60|$|Now for my part, as I did {{not think}} it wise to get too near to Sekukuni, I should have given them up and gone to hunt {{something}} else. Anscombe, however, was of a different opinion and pleaded hard that we should follow them. They were the only herd within a hundred miles, he said, if indeed there were any others this side of the Lebombo Mountains. As I still demurred, he suggested, in the nicest possible manner, that if I thought the business risky, I should camp somewhere with the wagon, while he went on with Footsack to look for the buffalo. I answered that I was well used to risks, which in a sense were my trade, and that as he was more or less in my charge I was thinking of him, not of myself, who was quite prepared to follow the buffalo, not only to Sekukuni's Mountains but over them. Then fearing that he had hurt my feelings, he apologized, and offered to go elsewhere if I liked. The upshot was that we decided to trek to the Oliphant's River, camp there and explore the bush on the other side on horseback, never going so far from the wagon that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> it again before nightfall.|$|E

For both samples, the c-axes of calcite grains are preferentially oriented {{perpendicular to the}} vein wall, which is indicative of competitive growth of calcite during the vein opening caused by vein normal extension. Additionally, mechanical e-twins are developed in both samples, which are inferred to have been developed under the same stress field as that responsible {{for the formation of}} calcite veins based on the paleostress analyses in grains with e-twins. For the calcite vein retrieved at the depth of 1, 885.5 mbsf, kink bands that developed by compression in the direction perpendicular to the vein wall are also present, which is indicative of stress reversal after the formation of mechanical e-twins. Although <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> definitely <b>reach</b> a conclusion about the cause of the stress reversal at the present time, it could have occurred during either the development of folds or seismic cycles in the Nankai accretionary prism, and this can be analyzed using the oriented core samples in the future.|$|R

40|$|The {{cage culture}} in India was {{introduced}} by CMFRI during 2007 {{with the support of}} Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries (DAHD&F), Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India. Though cage culture was in vogue in India since ancient times, it was in a primitive stage, lacking orientation. With the background of many advanced countries offering only the structures of the cages but not suitable technology to different locations in India, we initiated the open sea cage culture from Visakhapatnam in 2007. Starting from scratch, we were able to reach greater heights in terms of design, mooring, combating fouling, exchange of nets in sea and related aspects,mainly from the lessons that we learnt from the failure of the first cage. The technology thus developed was tested professionally at many locations along the Indian coast with all possible species, which helped to improve the design and economic viability of the cages. In this process, six generations of cages were developed, starting from high cost 15 m dia HDPE cages to 3 m dia low cost epoxy coated GI cages, suitable for establishing open sea cage farms in bays. In this historical achievement Team CMFRI contributed their mite, without which, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>reached</b> this R&D level in open sea cage culture...|$|R

The place did not look very promising, but as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> our destination, the Watelai river, owing to the contrary wind, I thought we might as well wait here a day or two.

5000|$|Writing {{about the}} rediscovery, Prof. Finlayson {{and his wife}} Dr. Geraldine Finlayson stated: [...] "Getting to the site was not easy even though we started with the {{advantage}} of being able to drive to a middle height on the Rock. This we did by obtaining permission to enter via the Waterworks. Mr Manolo Perez and his deputy, Mr Derek Cano, and their staff have always been most helpful to the Gibraltar Museum and this time was no exception. Having left the car {{on the west side of}} the Rock we walked the long and straight tunnel which leads to the huge reservoirs which hold Gibraltar's water supply. Some are the size of two football pitches and during the Second World War one of them housed the Blackwatch Regiment! The moment you enter this quarter-mile long tunnel you literally see the light at the other end. As you walk along it, on the tracks of a small railway system, the opening gets larger and the light brighter. Having got used to the darkness of the inner depths of the Rock you are suddenly confronted with the bright blue of the Mediterranean on the other side.The other side of the Rock is literally another world. Having got there the early morning sun, contrasting with the deep shade of the west side, is then quite warm and agreeable. You look around and you see Catalan Bay below you and the slopes around are covered in a curious mix of introduced caHottentot Figs from South Africa used to stabilise the loose sands, Canary Palms, Tamarisks and native matorral dominated by Lentisc and Olive. The old corrugated sheets of the watercatchments were still prevalent in those early days of 1992.From the exit to the tunnel we walked south along a passage on the side of which was the channel which used to carry the rainwater into the reservoirs. Throughout the walk we would hear the rattle of stones as they fell onto the sheets from the cliffs above, perhaps disturbed by a gull landing, perhaps accomplices in the millennial process of erosion which, one day, will reduce the Rock to a flat land. We reached a point where we had to abandon the luxury of the passage and start to climb towards the cliff face. The steps here were narrow and a railing to hold onto was not always there. In fact, when there was it was so precarious that it was best not to hold on to it at all! The situation was not for one who suffered from vertigo. The higher we went the smaller Catalan Bay became below us. On either side of us we had corrugated iron sheets so to stumble would have meant a long fall down. A large Tamarisk half-way up right across the steps did little to help as we had to struggle through its branches to get to the other side.Eventually we conquered the 700 or so steps and reached a sandy platform which had been created by the workers as they removed the sand. We peered over the top and the view was surreal. We can only describe it as a small forest of tobacco plants that had spread and grown here. In the centre of this, then was a bulldozer, apparently taken up there in parts and assembled on site! There were lots of boulders. In many ways getting from here to the cave was the most dangerous part. The boulders were left-overs of the sand removal. Among them were remnants of rusty sheets so there was no guarantee of stability. The cave was a small opening on the cliff side. When we got to it we soon found some prehistoric stone tools and more bones on the surface and we were convinced that this was just the tip of the iceberg. It was at that moment that we knew we had to excavate here.The cave needed a name. No matter how much we debated <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> agreement. Our son, Stewart, then nine years old, stated the obvious - we had found the complete skull of an Ibex (wild mountain goat) so it should be called Ibex Cave. As parents we were not sure. Months later Andy Currant, in his inimical style settled it for us - Stewart named it Ibex Cave, here is the Ibex skull, therefore you must call it Ibex Cave! Who would argue?

There are indeed one or two artifices by which, as stated in the text, an appearance of retirement or projection may be obtained, so that they partly supply the place of the stereoscopic effect, but they do not imitate that effect. The principle of the human sight is simply this:--by means of our two eyes we literally see everything from two places at once; and, by calculated combination, in the brain, of the facts of form so seen, we arrive at conclusions respecting the distance and shape of the object, which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> otherwise have <b>reached.</b> But it is just as vain to hope to paint at once the two views of the object as seen from these two places, though only {{an inch and a half}} distant from each other, as it would be if they were a mile and a half distant from each other. With the right eye you see one view of a given object, relieved against one part of the distance; with the left eye you see another view of it, relieved against another part of the distance. You may paint whichever of those views you please; you cannot paint both. Hold your finger upright, between you and this page of the book, about six inches from your eyes, and three from the book; shut the right eye, and hide the words [...] "inches from," [...] in the second line above this, with your finger; you will then see [...] "six" [...] on one side of it, and [...] "your," [...] on the other. Now shut the left eye and open the right without moving your finger, and you will see [...] "inches," [...] but not [...] "six." [...] You may paint the finger with [...] "inches" [...] beyond it, or with [...] "six" [...] beyond it, but not with both. And this principle holds for any object and any distance. You might just as well try to paint St. Paul's at once from both ends of London Bridge as to realize any stereoscopic effect in a picture.|$|R

He knows the true purport, intent, meaning, and sense of every promise, and piece of promise that is in the whole Bible, and can tell how to plead it for advantage against our accuser, and doth so. And I gather it not only from his contest with Satan for Joshua, (Zech 3), and from his conflict with him in the wilderness, (Matt 4), and in heaven, (Rev 14), but also from the practice of Satan's emissaries here; for what his angels do, that doth he. Now there is here nothing more apparent than that the instruments of Satan do plead against the church, from the pretended intricacy, ambiguity, and difficulty of the promise; whence I gather, so doth Satan before the tribunal of God; but there we have one to match him; [...] "we have an Advocate with the Father," [...] that knows law and judgment better than Satan, and statute and commandment better than all his angels; and by the verdict of our Advocate, all the words, and limits, and extensions of words, with all conditions of the promises, are expounded and applied!

Conclusion. The total effective rate of acupuncture for amblyopia was significantly superior to conventional treatment, indicating that acupuncture was a promising treatment for amblyopia. However, due to the limited number of CCTs and RCTs, especially those of large sample size and multicenter randomized controlled studies that were quantitatively insufficient, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> a completely affirmative conclusion until further studies of high quality are available...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue and {{exercise}} intolerance are symptoms {{in children with}} metabolic myopathy. Frequently this is combined with muscle pain in children with mitochondrial myopathy. Offering therapeutic advice remains challenging in this patient group. Here we describe five children above the age of four years, with normal intelligence, myopathy, exercise intolerance, motor developmental delay, and fatigue, who were diagnosed with a mitochondrial dysfunction. Based on the positive experience of condition training in adults with mitochondrial disease and inactivity, aerobic exercise training was advised for all the children. Because {{of the lack of}} clear protocols for individualized mitochondrial myopathies, regular training was initiated. The Movement Assessment Battery of Children, the Jamar dynamometer for grip force, and the Bruce protocol treadmill test were applied for evaluation. No patient showed significant disease progression on a weekly scheme of strength training or on aerobic training during periods varying between 6 and 18 months. Only one out of the five patients has shown an improvement after a period of structured, aerobic training, demonstrating good compliance and motivation over the course of 18 months. Some patients developed severe muscle pain after explosive exercise. Even in a relatively homogenous, intelligent group of patients and motivated parents, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> full compliance. With our case studies, we would like {{to draw attention to the}} importance and pitfalls of movement therapy in children with mitochondrial disease. status: publishe...|$|E
