40|$|Abstract. A high stable wire {{transport}} system of wire-cut electrical discharge machine (WEDM) that can exercise the micro-wire machining is developed in this paper. In the wire {{transport system}}, two novel designs are {{proposed to improve}} wire tension variation during machining. 1. Active wire feeding unit: a device is used to isolate the inertia of the <b>wire</b> <b>reel</b> from the wire transport system. Hence the inertial loading of the wire can be reduced and the stability is also increased. 2. Multilayer sandwich vibration absorber: the axis of the reel is connected to a damped sandwich beam. When the perturbation occurs, the flexible motion of the beam can absorb the fluctuation of the wire. Then the wire tension can be more stable and better working precision is also achieved. Finally, two mechanisms were implemented on a micro wire-EDM machine to suppress the fluctuation of wire tension. Experimental {{results show that the}} variation of wire tension can be significantly reduced from 12. 4 gf to 5. 5 gf...|$|E
2500|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} of 20 November, a small, [...] high ridge was discovered that would provide observation of the entire Empress Augusta Bay area and dominated the East–West Trail and the Piva Forks area. A platoon—under the command of First Lieutenant Steve J. Cibik—was ordered to occupy the ridge with detachments of signals and a section of heavy machine guns. The trek began with a struggle up the steep ridge late in {{the afternoon}}, with signal <b>wire</b> being <b>reeled</b> out as the platoon climbed the ridge. Reaching the summit just before sunset, they set about establishing defensive positions, with machine guns sited along likely avenues of attack.|$|R
50|$|The SCR-68 {{had a few}} {{distinct}} {{characteristics that}} separated the SCR-68 from other types of radio. The SCR-68 operated at 750 kHz (400 meter wavelength), using a long <b>wire</b> antenna <b>reeled</b> out behind the aircraft. It could receive and transmit messages over a maximum range of eighteen miles. The artillery observer (navigator) managed the SCR-68, receiving and relaying messages for the pilot. During World War I, most planes were two-person open-cockpit aircraft. Instead of communicating between themselves in the air, the pilot and the observer sent messages through the SCR-68 where the headphones would eliminate most outside noises. Like a private telephone line, the pilot and observer could communicate with each other; however, this action prevented the SCR-68 from receiving any transmissions.|$|R
50|$|The Webster Chicago Corporation was a {{maker of}} {{electronic}} equipment in Chicago, Illinois. Many products were sold under the brand name Webcor. The product line included record changers, <b>wire</b> recorders and <b>reel</b> to reel tape recorders. They also made phonograph amplifiers that are now used as guitar amplifiers in some cases. These amplifiers' sounds {{are similar to the}} sounds of the Fender Princeton. They are valued for their all-tube signal path and hand-wired circuit. Many Webster-Chicago record changers were installed in Magnavox home entertainment systems in the 1940s and early 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The E-6 {{aircraft}} {{is based}} on the Boeing 707. The wings were redesigned to meet new wing loading characteristics, the tail was redesigned after a catastrophic failure of the vertical stabilizer during flight tests. The cockpit was copied from the Boeing 737NG commercial airliner, and the landing gear was modified to handle the added weight. Larger fuel tanks were installed and the fuselage was extensively modified to accommodate the 31 antennas, including the trailing <b>wire</b> antenna and <b>reel</b> assembly. After the upgrade to the E-6B, the TACAMO aircraft - with the addition of an Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) - took over the EC-135 Looking Glass mission formerly conducted by the USAF 55th Wing at Offutt AFB, Nebraska.|$|R
5000|$|Field {{telephones}} operate over wire lines, sometimes commandeering civilian circuits when available, {{but often}} using wires strung in combat conditions. At least as of World War II, wire communications were the preferred method for the U.S. Army, with radio use only when needed, e.g. {{to communicate with}} mobile units, or until wires could be set up. Field phones could operate point to point or via a switchboard at a command post. A variety of wire types are used, ranging from light weight [...] "assault wire," [...] e.g. W-130 —— with a talking range about 5 mi, to heavier cable with multiple pairs. Equipment for laying the <b>wire</b> ranges from <b>reels</b> on backpacks to trucks equipped with plows to bury lines.|$|R
40|$|The {{electric}} {{solar wind}} sail (E-Sail) is a space propulsion invention exploiting the dynamic {{pressure of the}} solar wind. It uses centrifugally stretched positively charged conductive tethers to create thrust from the momentum flux of the solar wind. In space the tethers must be micrometeoroid resistant. We use ultrasonic bonding to create an aluminum multiwire Heytether structure to address this issue. For this work we produced a 1 km continuous piece of multifilament E-Sail tether of µm-diameter aluminum wires using a custom made automatic tether factory. The tether comprising 90704 bonds between 25 and 50 µm diameter <b>wires</b> is <b>reeled</b> onto a metal reel. The total mass of 1 km tether is 10 g. We reached a production rate of 70 m/ 24 h and a quality level of 1 ‰ loose bonds and 2 ‰ rebonded ones. Thus, we demonstrated that production of long electric solar wind sail tethers is both possible and practical. Based on images captured of each bond, a post production analysis was done to determine failure rate and types of the failures that occured during the production. Vain tiivistelmä.

500|$|When not on {{the front}} lines, Reckless packed other items for the platoon, and was {{particularly}} useful for stringing telephone <b>wire.</b> Carrying <b>reels</b> of <b>wire</b> on her pack that were played out as she walked, she could string as much wire as twelve men on foot. She became the first horse in the Marine Corps known to have participated in an amphibious landing when the 5th moved from Camp Casey to Inchon, planning to participate in amphibious landings hundreds of miles south of Inchon. The commanding officer of the transport halted loading operations {{when he saw the}} platoon on the dock with Reckless. He refused to take her on board his clean ship, which had won an award for being the cleanest ship in the previous two years. She was allowed on board after the Marines produced the loading plan, approved by him, which specifically listed Reckless and her equipment. Once the ship was underway, she became sick, making a mess on the ship's decks during {{the first part of the}} voyage. She could not be disembarked due to a storm, but soon became accustomed to the motion of the ship at sea and had no more problems. The 1st Marine Division was moved to a rest area soon after the move, and while there some platoon members posed with Reckless and a sign challenging the Thoroughbred Native Dancer to a race. They called their race the [...] "Paddy Derby", the field [...] "Upsan Downs", and the conditions differed from a typical horse race: 1.5 miles over paddies and hills, carrying 192 pounds of ammunition, and no riders. The Marines never received a reply; Native Dancer came in second in the Kentucky Derby, and went on to win the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes.|$|R
500|$|The cables were spun on-site using a reel {{because of}} the {{problems}} which had arisen using a bundle on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark. This also allowed for cost savings, as the reels could be used two times. The cables were spun using air spinning with controlled tension, which allowed spinning with little space and with a crew with limited spinning experience. This involved installing a carrier which shuttles forward and back over the catwalk; it spins the upper side of the cable in the one direction and the lower side in the other direction. The system has two reel racks, each with four <b>reels</b> of <b>wire.</b> Each rack only uses one reel at a time, allowing for minimum down-time when changing <b>reels.</b> <b>Wires</b> were connected using pressure casing. The balance in the system is kept in place using a counterbalance tower. Spinning of the main cable started on 2 March 2000 and was concluded on 14 April. In all [...] of steel wire were used to create the cables. The two bridges were {{the first time that}} on-site spinning was chosen in Norway, and it gave a cost saving of NOK10 to 11 million.|$|R

60|$|It {{may be as}} {{well here}} as {{elsewhere}} to state two things connected with all movements of the Army of the Potomac: first, in every change of position or halt for the night, whether confronting the enemy or not, the moment arms were stacked the men intrenched themselves. For this purpose they would build up piles of logs or rails {{if they could be}} found in their front, and dig a ditch, throwing the dirt forward on the timber. Thus the digging they did counted in making a depression to stand in, and increased the elevation in front of them. It was wonderful how quickly they could in this way construct defences of considerable strength. When a halt was made with the view of assaulting the enemy, or in his presence, these would be strengthened or their positions changed under the direction of engineer officers. The second was, the use made of the telegraph and signal corps. Nothing could be more complete than the organization and discipline of this body of brave and intelligent men. Insulated wires--insulated so that they would transmit messages in a storm, on the ground or under water--were wound upon reels, making about two hundred pounds weight of <b>wire</b> to each <b>reel.</b> Two men and one mule were detailed to each reel. The pack-saddle on which this was carried was provided with a rack like a sawbuck placed crosswise of the saddle, and raised above it so that the <b>reel,</b> with its <b>wire,</b> would revolve freely. There was a wagon, supplied with a telegraph operator, battery and telegraph instruments for each division, each corps, each army, and one for my headquarters. There were wagons also loaded with light poles, about the size and length of a wall tent pole, supplied with an iron spike in one end, used to hold the wires up when laid, so that wagons and artillery would not run over them. The mules thus loaded were assigned to brigades, and always kept with the command they were assigned to. The operators were also assigned to particular headquarters, and never changed except by special orders.|$|R
