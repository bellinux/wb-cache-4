It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E

Although Lopez did not write the song herself, [...] "Run the World" [...] is based on her relationship with husband Marc Anthony.

[...] The Birmingham Post's Gemma Quade named the wedding one of her five most memorable Neighbours storylines, calling it a [...] "tearjerker episode". Josephine Monroe, author of The Neighbours Programme Guide, wrote that the episode showed the [...] "soap wedding of the century!", adding [...] "Teenagers Scott and Charlene tied the knot in a traditional and emotional church service".

500|$|By this time, Thorpe's {{relationship}} with Frost {{was beginning to}} unravel. Thorpe had always insisted that his swimming was about enjoyment and improving himself in setting faster times, rather than victory or defeat. This contrasted with Frost, who had a more aggressive and combative mindset, often making bold public statements. Thorpe ignored Frost's advice and bulked up his upper body by a further 5kg to 105kg, making him the heaviest elite swimmer in history. His reasoning that the strength gains would outweigh any loss in flexibility raised concerns over his physiological strategy. On the first night in Manchester, Thorpe again lowered his 400m mark by 0.09s to 3min 40.08s, before anchoring the 4×100m freestyle relay team to another gold. Prior to the 200m final, Thorpe was seen arguing with Frost in the warm-up area. Thorpe won, but was unusually angry at having failed to lower his previous best, publicly stating that he [...] "wasn't with it" [...] {{and that he had}} [...] "one of the worst warm-ups ever". Thorpe did manage to lower his personal best in the 100m freestyle to 48.73s en route to his fourth gold, and anchored the 4×200m freestyle and 4×100m medley relays to comfortable victories. When he collected a silver in his first international race in the 100m backstroke with another personal best behind world champion Matt Welsh, he was forced to rebuff media comparisons to Spitz. He emphasised personal performance, stating [...] "I think it's a limiting attitude to be competing against other people <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be challenging yourself". Despite Thorpe's assertion that he could not match Spitz, Frost predicted that Thorpe could win nine golds at one Olympics. In spite of the media disappointment, Thorpe's six gold medals equalled the record set by Susie O'Neill, completing all in Games or World record time. As a result, he was awarded the honour of carrying the flag at the closing ceremony.|$|E
