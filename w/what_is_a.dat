He additionally manages to add realism by injecting real-life situations culled from his 15 years in management, that provoke much thought and encourage readers to assess their own performance, and take positive measures to become more effective in their workplace and interpersonal relationships.|$|E

He will assume control of your cities and nations. He is going to move on and take over your prisons, churches, schools, universities and corporations.|$|E
5|$|When debates {{polarise}} between techniques, {{the methods}} are {{often referred to}} by a colour code, based on the colours of the bindings of the two volumes from the first Oxford Conference, where the approaches were first distinguished. Green (Old World) archaeoastronomers rely heavily on statistics and are sometimes accused of missing the cultural context of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> social practice. Brown (New World) archaeoastronomers in contrast have abundant ethnographic and historical evidence and {{have been described as}} 'cavalier' on matters of measurement and statistical analysis. Finding a way to integrate various approaches has been a subject of much discussion since the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Curé Syndrome manifested. She {{suggests that}} while he had thought that he was traveling back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently, as part of a delusion, and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the knowledge that he is experiencing a delusion. She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the delusion, and the six days in his delusion will become reality. Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell down at the end of the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to what is real and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> delusion, and whether Makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his delusion.|$|E

25|$|Hutchinson in 1957 {{published}} a monograph that {{is regarded as}} a landmark discussion and classification of all major lake types, their origin, morphometric characteristics, and distribution. As summarized and discussed by these researchers, Hutchinson presented in it a comprehensive analysis of the origin of lakes and proposed <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> widely accepted classification of lakes according to their origin. This classification recognizes 11 major lake types that are divided into 76 subtypes. The 11 major lake types are tectonic lakes, volcanic lakes, landslide lakes, glacial lakes, solution lakes, fluvial lakes, aeolian lakes, shoreline lakes, organic lakes, anthropomorphic lakes, and meteorite (extraterrestrial impact) lakes.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, Ireland has the {{greatest}} number of known sheela na gigs.

Accurate numbers of figures are difficult to reach, as the interpretation of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sheela na gig will vary among scholars. For example, Freitag omits the Rochester figure from her list while Weir and Jerman include it. Concannon includes some worn figures that so far only she has identified as sheela na gigs. With renewed interest in the topic, scholars have recently identified previously unknown figures, so more could be discovered.|$|E
