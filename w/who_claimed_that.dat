5|$|The {{allegations}} were first sparked by University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> full versions of government documents proved Canada had willful knowledge that torture would occur before handing detainees to Afghan authorities.

One of these unveiled parliamentary testimony by diplomat Richard Colvin, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> many detainees were probably tortured, {{and it was a}} standard operating procedure for Afghan interrogators. The allegations have led to a showdown in the Canadian House of Commons, as opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) had called for the releasing of relevant documents in full and unredacted form, claiming parliamentary privilege to see them. The government maintained that they had a duty to protect Canadian soldiers and citizens as the documents contained sensitive information.|$|E

5|$|The legend {{surrounding}} Scotland's {{association with}} the Saint Andrew's Cross was related by Walter Bower and George Buchanan, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the flag originated in a 9th-century battle, where Óengus II led a combined force of Picts and Scots to victory over the Angles, led by Æthelstan. Supposedly, a miraculous white saltire appeared in the blue sky and Óengus' troops were roused to victory by the omen.

5|$|A similar {{theory to}} Syme's {{has been put}} forward by François Paschoud, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, {{in the same vein}} as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E
