5|$|<b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> factors {{leading to}} the first {{escapement}} clock in China? The chief tradition leading to Yi Xing (AD 725) was of course the succession of 'pre-clocks' which had started with Zhang Heng about 125. Reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow turning movement of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes {{by means of a}} water-wheel using clepsydra drip, which intermittently exerted the force of a lug to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar-axis shaft. Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere, and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which had become so widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century.|$|E

25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the lessons learned at Dieppe, the British developed a whole range of specialist armoured vehicles which allowed their engineers to perform many of their tasks protected by armour, most famously Hobart's Funnies. The operation showed major deficiencies in RAF ground support techniques, and this {{led to the creation of}} a fully integrated Tactical Air Force to support major ground offensives. Because the treads of most of the Churchill tanks were caught up in the shingle beaches of Dieppe, the Allies started a new policy of learning <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> exact elements of every beach they intended to land upon, and devising appropriate vehicles for said beaches.|$|E
25|$|During the 1954–55 Shield season, {{which was}} reduced to a single {{round-robin}} format, with only four matches per team, Hallebone scored only 44 runs from Victoria's first three games, and was dropped for the final match.

In December 1955, he left Australia for eight months to gain business experience in England and the United States. Hallebone, who was 26 {{at the time of his}} last state game, finished his career with a first-class batting average of 41.10, having scored 1,192 runs.

25|$|In 1948 Pauling {{discovered}} that many proteins included helical (see alpha helix) shapes.

(Pauling was also later to suggest an incorrect three chain helical DNA structure based on Astbury's data.) Even {{in the initial}} diffraction data from DNA by Maurice Wilkins, {{it was evident that}} the structure involved helices. But this insight was only a beginning. There remained the questions of how many strands came together, whether this number was the same for every helix, whether the bases pointed toward the helical axis or away, and ultimately <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> explicit angles and coordinates of all the bonds and atoms. Such questions motivated the modeling efforts of Watson and Crick.|$|E

25|$|The Parque Ecológico Loreto y Peña Pobre {{is located}} on <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> lands of a former paper factory and extends over 21,000m2. This factory, called Loreto y Peña Pobre, {{was built in the}} late 19th century (a time called the Porfiriato in Mexico) when many {{factories}} and other infrastructure was built in this area. The paper factory shut down in the 20th century, and its main building eventually became a mall, called the Plaza Inbursa (formerly Plaza Cuicuilco), which is known for its various entertainment options such as restaurants and movie theaters. In 1989, the rest of the lands were converted into this ecological park. It contains a model house showing alternative technologies designed to avoid environmental damage. Workshops are offered for children at the site, as well as restaurants serving organic food.|$|E
25|$|Mickey's eyes, {{as drawn}} in Plane Crazy and The Gallopin' Gaucho, were large and white with black {{outlines}}. In Steamboat Willie, the bottom {{portion of the}} black outlines was removed, although the upper edges still contrasted with his head. Mickey's eyes were later re-imagined as only consisting of the small black dots which were originally his pupils, while <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> upper edges of his eyes became a hairline. This is evident only when Mickey blinks. Fred Moore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave his face a Caucasian skin tone instead of plain white. This new Mickey first appeared in 1938 {{on the cover of}} a party program, and in animation the following year with the release of The Pointer. Mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in The Simple Things (1953) and in the comic strip, although he does not have eyebrows in his most recent appearances.|$|E
25|$|Just <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> {{functions}} of the hakham is not clear. Rapoport's suggestion {{that he was the}} arbiter in matters of ritual prohibition and permission is highly improbable. Zecharias Frankel looks upon the hakham as a presiding officer whose duty it was to examine a case in question from all points of view, and, having summed up the results, to present the matter for discussion. It is more probable, however, that the office of hakham was created in order to secure a majority in cases of difference of opinion between the nasi and the Av Beit Din in the affairs of the Sanhedrin; one of the most eminent scholars was always chosen for the post. A baraita leads to the inference that the hakham was always the director of a school ("bet ha-midrash"), for in addition to the Great Sanhedrin, which later came {{to take the place of}} an academy, there were also private academies under the direction of eminent scholars. The origin of the office of hakham is as doubtful as its duration.|$|E

25|$|Such of Boileau's early poems as {{have been}} {{preserved}} hardly contain {{the promise of}} what he ultimately became. The first piece in which his peculiar powers were displayed was the first satire (1660), in imitation of the third satire of Juvenal; it embodied the farewell of a poet {{to the city of}} Paris. This was quickly followed by eight others, and the number was at a later period increased to twelve. A twofold interest attaches to the satires. In the first place the author skilfully parodies and attacks writers who at the time were placed in the very first rank, such as Jean Chapelain, the abbé Charles Cotin, Philippe Quinault and Georges de Scudéry; he openly raised the standard of revolt against the older poets. But in the second place he showed both by precept and practice <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> poetical capabilities of the French language. Prose in the hands of such writers as René Descartes and Blaise Pascal had proved itself a flexible and powerful instrument of expression, with a distinct mechanism and form. But except with Francois de Malherbe, there had been no attempt to fashion French versification according to rule or method. In Boileau for the first time appeared terseness and vigour of expression, with perfect regularity of verse structure.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the period, men wore {{their hair}} long with curls {{well past the}} shoulders. The bangs (fringe) were usually combed forward and allowed to flow over the {{forehead}} a bit. Although men had worn wigs for years to cover up thinning hair or baldness, {{the popularity of the}} wig or periwig as standard wardrobe is usually credited to King Louis XIV of France. Louis started to go bald at a relatively young age and had to cover up his baldness with wigs. His early wigs very much imitated <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> hairstyles of the day, but they gave a thicker and fuller appearance than natural hair. Due {{to the success of the}} wigs, other men started to wear wigs as well. By 1680, a part in the middle of the wig became the norm. The hair on either side of the part continued to grow in the 1680s until by the 1690s two very high pronounced points developed on the forehead. As well, during the 1680s, the wig was divided into three parts: the front including the center part and the long curls which fell well past the shoulders, the back of the head which was combed rather close to the head, and a mass of curls which flowed down the shoulders and back. The curls of the wig throughout the 1660s until 1700 were rather loose. Tighter curls would not make their appearance until after 1700. Every natural color of wig was possible. Louis XIV tended to favor a brown wig. His son, Monseigneur was well known for wearing blond wigs.|$|E

500|$|When {{she retired}} from the Abbey board, Lady Gregory {{returned}} to live in Galway, although she continued to visit Dublin regularly. The house and demesne at Coole Park had been sold to the Irish Forestry Commission in 1927, with Lady Gregory retaining life tenancy.

On a tree in <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> grounds of the house, one can still see the carved initials of Synge, Æ, Yeats and his artist brother Jack, George Moore, Seán O'Casey, George Bernard Shaw, Katharine Tynan and Violet Martin.

I am confident that both countries can agree on many critical issues, especially on bringing peace to the region," [...] Pakistan's ambassador to the US Sherry Rehman said in a statement. In general the decision to reopen the supply routes was met in Pakistan with a general sense of befuddlement and muted criticism that the Pakistani government had given up a much-trumpeted increase in transit fees for NATO trucks. Opposition politicians criticised the move and demanded more of an explanation from the Pakistani government and military. [...] "Now government should let the people know about the terms and conditions for reopening the NATO supply lines. <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> demands?" [...] said former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. And Enver Baig, an opposition politician belonging to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz complained about Americans: [...] "They did not apologize. They said ‘sorry.’" [...] Some Pakistani vowed civil disobedience to stop the convoys. [...] "The decision to reopen NATO supplies is a big crime against the country, {{and we will not}} sit silently over this," [...] retired Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, a leader of the Defense Council of Pakistan (a coalition of Islamic parties that includes pro-Taliban clerics and other foes of the NATO routes) and a former chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, told the Pakistani cable channel Express News. [...] "We will come to roads and streets and protest against the decision and will also try to stop the supplies." [...] Pakistani Taliban announced that they will attack any NATO supply trucks travelling along the routes. Transporters who resume supplies will be [...] "considered a friend of the U.S." [...] and will face the consequences, a spokesman for the militant group said. Al Jazeera's Kamal Hyder said that both NATO and Pakistani forces had taken into account losses in the past. [...] "The losses, {{despite the fact that they}} have become a problem are nowhere near the levels that would cause alarm bells to ring" [...] the correspondent said. According to his analysis it would cause a problem if [...] "the Pakistani Taliban attack bridges or decide to take these people head on in the tribal areas" [...] connecting Pakistan to the southern Afghan province of Kandahar.|$|E
