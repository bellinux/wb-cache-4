5|$|In 1931, 18.7% of Stretford's {{population}} was {{middle class and}} 19.7% <b>working</b> <b>class</b> compared to 14% middle class and 36% <b>working</b> <b>class</b> nationally. The rest of the {{population was}} made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers. By 1971, the middle class in Stretford had declined steadily to 14.9% whilst the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> had grown to 31.3% compared to 24% middle class and 26% <b>working</b> <b>class</b> nationally.|$|E
5|$|The Reform Act did not enfranchise the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> since {{voters were}} {{required}} to possess property worth £10, a substantial sum at the time. This split the alliance between the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> and the middle class, giving rise to the Chartist Movement.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, 9.4% of Wigan's {{population}} was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 12.4% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this {{slight increase in}} the middle classes of Wigan was {{the decline of the}} <b>working</b> <b>class</b> population. In 1931, 38.7% were <b>working</b> <b>class</b> compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 33.5% in Wigan and 26% nationwide. The rest of the {{population was}} made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers or other miscellaneous. The slow decrease in the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> goes against the trend for a steeper national decline, reinforcing the perception of Wigan as a working-class town.|$|E

5|$|The other {{important}} contribution to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, The Condition of the <b>Working</b> <b>Class</b> in England in 1844, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict {{and to see the}} modern <b>working</b> <b>class</b> as the most progressive force for revolution.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or <b>working</b> <b>class.</b> The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the middle class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and <b>working</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
5|$|Northern England, as {{the first}} area {{in the world to}} industrialise, was the birthplace of much modern {{political}} thought. Reports into the lives of the Northern <b>working</b> <b>class,</b> from Friedrich Engels' The Condition of the <b>Working</b> <b>Class</b> in England to George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier, shaped Marxism and, more generally, socialism. Meanwhile, enterprise and trade at the North's ports influenced the birth of Manchester Liberalism, a laissez-faire free trade philosophy. Expounded by C. P. Scott and the Manchester Guardian, the movement's greatest success was the repeal of the Corn Laws, protests against which had led to the 1819 Peterloo Massacre in Manchester.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist Friedrich Engels at the Café de la Régence, {{beginning}} a lifelong friendship. Engels showed Marx his recently published The Condition of the <b>Working</b> <b>Class</b> in England in 1844, convincing Marx that the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> {{would be the}} agent and instrument of the final revolution in history. Soon, Marx and Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx's former friend, Bruno Bauer. This work was published in 1845 as The Holy Family. Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by {{the ideas of the}} Young Hegelians Max Stirner and Ludwig Feuerbach, but eventually Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.|$|E

5|$|Originally a <b>working</b> <b>class</b> town, {{there was}} an influx of middle class people in the mid-19th century when {{businessmen}} began using Sale as a commuter town. Since then, Sale has had {{a greater proportion of}} middle class residents than the national average. In 1931, 22.7% of Sale's population was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 36.3% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this increase in the middle classes of Sale was the decline of the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> population. In 1931, 20.3% were <b>working</b> <b>class</b> compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 15.4% in Sale and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers.
