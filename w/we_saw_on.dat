500|$|Reception of [...] "The Food Wife" [...] {{from food}} critics has been mixed. Before the episode aired, Robert Sietsema of The Village Voice disapproved {{of it for}} being outdated. He commented that [...] "this show should have been done, say, {{two or three years}} ago, when food {{blogging}} was hot. By now, many food bloggers of our acquaintance have out-migrated to paying gigs, and the concept of the food blog has been co-opted by every major media outlet, rendering real food blogs – the old-fashioned kind, where someone stood alone in their kitchen cooking things, or wandered the hinterlands seeking out unique deliciousness – nearly obsolete." [...] Sietsema also criticized the scenes showcasing molecular gastronomy because he thought they were out of date, since molecular gastronomy is, [...] "by now, long past its prime". Chris Shott, a food critic for Washington City Papers Young & Hungry column and blog, wrote negatively about the character that owns El Chemistri and is a parody of José Andrés. He commented that [...] "For one thing, the character seems far more subdued than the kooky, wild-eyed power drill-wielding cook <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> Conan recently. The satire here, involving a deconstructed Caesar salad of foams, gels and airs, is more a riff on molecular gastronomy in general than a send-up of Andrés' over-the-top personality." ...|$|E

"In July , for example, the Ministry of Health {{reported}} exactly zero violent {{deaths in}} Anbar Province, {{in spite of}} the contradictory evidence <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> our televisions. Is that a surveillance network on which our understanding {{of what is going on}} in Iraq can depend?" ...|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed that}} we were indeed fated to cross the path of Vaughn Steele. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> him working round his adobe house; then <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>on</b> horseback. Once we met him face to face in a store.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> {{a commotion}} <b>on</b> the castle walls. The Countess had fallen back, {{and men were}} {{pressing}} round her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gully," [...] said Cashel, {{his eyes}} sparkling, [...] "I {{should like to}} see one of those chaps <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> the common pitch into the doctor--get him on the ropes, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What, the model? Don't {{call her}} my rival, Cuthbert, {{it makes me}} ashamed of myself, even to think that I should have {{suspected}} you of caring for that woman <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> horseback the other day." ...|$|E
60|$|When we got fairly {{into the}} Clyde and near Glasgow {{the scene was}} wonderful. It was nearly night, and the great fires of the {{factories}} lit up the sky, and <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> the stocks a great ship being built.|$|E
60|$|Before Mr. Dawson could answer, {{before the}} Count could leave us, {{the door was}} opened from the sitting-room, and <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> Lady Glyde <b>on</b> the threshold.|$|R
5000|$|... "We picked {{our name}} because <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> it <b>on</b> a poster and liked the sound... {{and we are}} a sort of team. We write in English {{because no one else}} outside Holland speaks Dutch and we want our songs to be heard and listened to everywhere." [...] (Hans Vandenburg) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, lots o' them. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> deer <b>on</b> the hill-tops, {{and might}} ha' shot more o' them {{if we could}} have brought them into camp. An' <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> porcupines in all the pine bluffs. An' <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> fish in the lakes among the mountains. There are lots o' them lakes--small things some o' them--in all the gullies, and fish in most o' them; but we had neither lines nor hooks, so we catched none." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou art a good lad, Steve," [...] said Hal. [...] "I'm right glad thou leavest this {{father of}} mine behind thee. I {{would not see}} thee such as he--no, not for all the gold <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> the Frenchmen's backs." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} that I and Willersley became very sociological as we ran on to Spiez, and made {{all sorts of}} generalisations from the steeply sloping fields on the hillsides, and from the people <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> platforms and from little differences in {{the way things were}} done.|$|E
60|$|The finest thing <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> {{our whole}} Mississippi trip, we saw as we {{approached}} New Orleans in the steam-tug. This was the curving frontage of the crescent city lit up with the white glare of five miles of electric lights. It was a wonderful sight, and very beautiful.|$|E
60|$|Through {{the window}} of the {{warehouse}} <b>we</b> <b>saw,</b> lying <b>on</b> the counter or showboard, which was just before it, five pieces of silks, besides other stuffs, and though it was almost dark, yet the people, being busy in the fore-shop with customers, had not had time to shut up those windows, or else had forgot it.|$|R
60|$|A yell from Emett halted us. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> him above, <b>on</b> {{the extreme}} point of wall. Waving his arms, he yelled unintelligible {{commands}} to us. The fierce baying of Don and Moze added to our desperate energy.|$|R
6000|$|Master went a-hunting, [...] When {{the leaves}} were falling; [...] <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>on</b> the bridle path, [...] We heard him gaily calling. 'Oh master, master, come you back, For I have dreamed a dream so black!' [...] A glint of steel from bit and heel, [...] The {{chestnut}} cantered faster; [...] A red flash seen amid the green, [...] And so good-bye to master.|$|R
60|$|We had {{advanced}} boldly on this last {{stage of the}} journey, emboldened {{to do so by}} the evidences of panic, or something near akin to it, which <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> every hand, and trusting to the possibility that if seen it would be believed that we belonged to the encampment.|$|E
6000|$|... "O Macumazahn, we Zulus {{believe that}} what <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> that night was not Nombe or another dressed up, but {{the spirit of the}} witch Mameena itself. We believe it because we could see the light of Zikali's fire through her, not always, but sometimes; also because all that she said has come true, though {{everything}} is not yet finished." ...|$|E
6000|$|Along {{the base}} of the castle, on the {{opposite}} side to the entrance, flows a stream, sending up a pleasant murmur from among the trees. The housekeeper said it was not a stream, but only a [...] "wash," [...] whatever that may be; and I conjecture that it creates the motive-power of some factory-looking edifices, which <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> our first arrival at Skipton.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>saw</b> no fowl there, except gulls {{of various}} kinds; but the {{greatest}} store of them that ever <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> was <b>on</b> a flat but slightly covered with water {{on the east side}} of the harbor, and we observed a man who had landed there from a boat creeping along the shore in order to get a shot at them, but they all rose and flew away in a great scattering flock, too soon for him, having apparently got their dinners, though he did not get his.|$|R
500|$|For {{the first}} scene of the episode, when Jon Snow arises from the table, Weiss stated that [...] "Jon coming back to life was {{something}} in the first, first version we wrote originally had more talking. And as <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> it <b>on</b> the page written out, we realized it was just too much dialogue, we decided to just give the kind of awe of that moment its due." ...|$|R
500|$|When Geisel {{returned}} to Springfield in 1986 {{as part of}} a publicity tour he was greeted by dozens of children on Mulberry Street. Another group of children held up a banner that read, [...] "And to think that <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>on</b> Mulberry Street". John Fogerty, frontman for the Creedence Clearwater Revival, has stated that the band's song [...] "Lookin' Out My Back Door" [...] was partly inspired by the book.|$|R
60|$|It was the dreariest scenery imaginable. The only animals which <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> {{the sand}} {{at that time}} were spiders, which {{are to be found}} almost {{everywhere}} whether on snow or ice-water or sand,--and a venomous-looking, long, narrow worm, one of the myriapods, or thousand-legs. We were surprised to see spider-holes in that flowing sand with an edge as firm as that of a stoned well.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose it}} makes any {{difference}} what I think," [...] he said, in conclusion; [...] "but I am almost certain Mr. Hazelton {{did not have}} anything to do with the robbery, and even if I had suspected him, that which Dan and I heard while we were in the museum tent would have convinced me that the men whom <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> the creek are the thieves." ...|$|E
60|$|Our {{road toward}} the pass ran through the camping ground of the newly created Abati army, and what <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> our journey thither told us more vividly than any words or reports could do, how utter was the demoralization of that people. Where should have been sentries were no sentries; where should have been {{soldiers}} were groups of officers talking with women; where should have been officers were camp followers drinking.|$|E

5000|$|We {{were able}} to be urbane. Between us we read every book. Between us <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> every movie. Between us <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> every play <b>on</b> Broadway. You could make jokes about Kafka or Tennessee Williams. We also had dinner together. We went to movies together. We were all friends. And that was very important. We {{appreciated}} each other a lot.|$|R
60|$|Then the defile widened out, {{there was}} an open place before us, {{the very top of}} the pass. Also there were low barracks, and soldiers. We heard firing. Standing still, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> the slopes of snow, under the radiant blue heaven, tiny puffs of smoke, then some small black figures {{crossing}} the snow patch, then another rattle of rifle-fire, rattling dry and unnatural in the upper, skyey air, between the rocks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I presume {{you feel}} {{yourself}} drawn to any place where ancient prejudices are garnered up," [...] she answered, not without archness. [...] "I know by the stand you take about our cause that you share the superstitions {{of the old}} bookmen. You {{ought to have been}} at one of those really mediæval universities that <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> the other side, at Oxford, or Göttingen, or Padua. You would have been in perfect sympathy with their spirit." ...|$|E
60|$|Three or {{four years}} back, when Fieschi and Lacenaire were executed, I made {{attempts}} to see the execution of both; but was disappointed in both cases. In the first instance, the day for Fieschi's death was, purposely, kept secret; and he was, if I remember rightly, executed at some remote quarter of the town. But it would have done a philanthropist good, to witness the scene which <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> the morning when his execution did NOT take place.|$|E
6000|$|... [126] They'd soon be back again, I think, [...] If blacksmith's skill {{could break}} the link. [...] Ecclefechan held us next, [...] Where old Tom Carlyle was vexed [...] By the clamour and the strife [...] Of this strange and varied life. [...] <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> his pipe, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> his hat, [...] <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> the stone <b>on</b> which he sat. [...] The solid stone is resting there, [...] But where the sitter? Where, oh! where? ...|$|R
5000|$|Yueyaquan (...) is a {{crescent-shaped}} lake in an oasis, 6 km {{south of}} the city of Dunhuang in Gansu Province, China.It was named Yueyaquan in the Qing Dynasty. Mildred Cable & Francesca French visited the lake during their travels in the region and recorded their impressions in their book The Gobi Desert, [...] "All around us <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> tier <b>on</b> tier of lofty sand-hills, giving the lie to our quest, yet when, with a final desperate effort, we hoisted ourselves over the last ridge and looked down on what lay beyond, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> the lake below, and its beauty was entrancing." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>on</b> a bill at Winterland with Johnny Winter, and Fender had {{populated}} {{the stage}} with Fender Twins and a wall of amplifiers for Winter. It was beyond loud. Then, out comes Lonnie Mack with his one-foot square amp and band-mates all plugged-in tomidget amps. Everyone crowded up to the stage. The Mack sound was pure and better-integrated - it was fantastic. Johnny Winter just scratched his head in awe. Houghton, Becoming Elektra, 1st Ed., 2010, Jawbone Press, p. 245 ...|$|R
