5|$|During late 1999, No.75 Squadron {{was placed}} on alert to provide close air support and air defence for the {{international}} forces deployed to East Timor as part of INTERFET.

5|$|After his {{interview}} with the police, Farrar immediately filed for divorce from Green and for custody of Kate, who had been taken in by his parents while Green and Farrar dealt with the police. A court later awarded temporary custody of Kate to Farrar's parents, due to Green's instability and Kate's professed anger with her father. Green was allowed supervised access during this period, while Farrar's visits <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to be supervised.|$|E

5|$|Altgens {{and former}} Texas Governor John Connally met by chance in Houston {{a short time}} later. Connally told Altgens that he also had been called to testify and {{received}} airfare, but he decided to cash the check and spend the money. Connally pressed Altgens to spend his as well. Altgens later learned that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to attend.|$|E
5|$|As large {{consumers}} of fossil fuels, First World countries {{drew attention to}} environmental pollution. The Kyoto Protocol is a treaty {{that is based on}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries. Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E
5|$|Circulation figures <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to be {{published}} annually until the 1960s, so the actual circulation figures are not known. For comparison, the more successful Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which had been launched the previous year, {{is known to have}} had a circulation of just under 60,000 copies for its first issue, dated Fall 1949.|$|E

5|$|Differences between Chinese and Khitan society {{included}} {{gender roles}} and marital practices: the Khitans {{took a more}} egalitarian view towards gender, {{in sharp contrast to}} Chinese cultural practices that segregated men's and women's roles. Khitan women were taught to hunt, managed family property, and held military posts. Many marriages were not arranged, women <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to be virgins at their first marriage, and women had the right to divorce and remarry.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{women were}} also given a more {{official}} standing. The Texas Legislature in 1911 {{refused to give}} A permission to hold a summer semester unless women were also permitted to attend. For the next several decades during the summers cadets <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to be in uniform and women could attend class and participate in intramural activities.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 the {{guidelines}} were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as {{up to two}} categories for that year. These additional awards were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to be repeated by future conventions. This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only a few were ever awarded {{for more than one}} year.|$|E

5|$|In any event, the Lithuanians {{were not}} {{prepared}} to accept Christianity, and Mindaugas's baptism had little impact on further developments. The {{majority of the population}} and the nobility remained pagan; his subjects <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to convert. The cathedral he had built in Vilnius was superseded by a pagan temple, and all the diplomatic achievements made after his coronation were lost, although the practice of Christianity and intermarriage were well tolerated.|$|E
5|$|The signals {{used were}} of the ancient disc and {{crossbar}} type, installed when the line opened and never modified. They remained in use up to the line's closure in 1898. Only one locomotive {{was used in the}} Syndicate period so signals <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required.</b> By 1913 some had fallen down but others remained in working order.|$|E

Hyogo suffered the highest toll in terms of both lives lost and buildings destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Each {{team had}} progressed through five rounds {{to reach the}} final, having each entered in the third round. Both teams {{required}} a single replay in different rounds to progress, but otherwise won each of their games. In the fifth round, Cardiff knocked the reigning champions, Bolton Wanderers out of the cup. Both teams had a mixture of home and away games on their route to the final, but Arsenal <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to play outside London after the initial fourth round match. By the quarter-finals, the two teams were the only Football League Division One teams left in the competition.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Fermi {{continued}} {{teaching at the}} University of Chicago. His PhD students in the post-war period included Owen Chamberlain, Geoffrey Chew, Jerome Friedman, Marvin Goldberger, Tsung-Dao Lee, Arthur Rosenfeld and Sam Treiman. Jack Steinberger was a graduate student. Fermi conducted important research in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons. He made the first predictions of pion-nucleon resonance, relying on statistical methods, since he reasoned that exact answers <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> when the theory was wrong anyway. In a paper co-authored with Chen Ning Yang, he speculated that pions might actually be composite particles. The idea was elaborated by Shoichi Sakata. It has since been supplanted by the quark model, in which the pion {{is made up of}} quarks, which completed Fermi's model, and vindicated his approach.|$|E
5|$|Recognising their {{financial}} predicament, the LNC lobbied Parliament {{for a new}} Act of Parliament to allow the venture to survive. On 23 July 1855 the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Amendment Act 1855 received Royal Assent. This Act released the LNC from those compulsory purchases of land which had been mandated by the 1852 Act but {{had not yet been}} completed, easing the immediate financial burden. It also allowed a ten-year window for the LNC to sell certain parts of the land bought from Lord Onslow which <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> for the cemetery, to provide a source of income.|$|E

5|$|Serjeant's Inn was an Inn of Court {{restricted}} to Serjeants-at-Law. It operated from three locations, one in Holborn, known as Scroope's Inn, which was abandoned by 1498 {{for the one}} in Fleet Street, which was pulled down during the 18th century, and one on Chancery Lane, pulled down in 1877. The Inn was a voluntary association, and although most Serjeants joined upon being appointed they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to. There were rarely more than 40 Serjeants, even including members of the judiciary, and the Inns were noticeably smaller than the Inns of Court. Unlike the Inns of Court, Serjeant's Inn was a private establishment similar to a gentlemen's club.|$|E
5|$|The {{mysteries of}} Isis were {{religious}} initiation rites {{performed in the}} cult of the goddess Isis in the Greco-Roman world. They were modeled on other mystery rites, particularly the Eleusinian Mysteries in honor of the Greek goddess Demeter, and originated sometime between the third century BCE and the second century CE. Despite their mainly Hellenistic origins, the mysteries did allude to beliefs from ancient Egyptian religion, in which the worship of Isis arose. By undergoing the mystery rites, initiates signaled their dedication to Isis, although they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to worship her exclusively. The rites were seen as a symbolic death and rebirth, and they may have been thought to guarantee that the initiate's soul, with the goddess's help, would continue after death in a blissful afterlife.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} much {{speculation}} {{at the time}} in the Adelaide and Melbourne press on why the lifeboats had not been launched earlier. Survivor James Fitzgerald pointed out in his recollection that, had the lifeboats been filled to capacity, no one would have survived the severe weather conditions experienced. He also commented that passenger vessels <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> to carry enough lifeboats, concluding that there were insufficient places for all Gothenburgs passengers and crew. It was not until RMS Titanic sank some 37 years later in 1912, that it was made compulsory for all British registered ships to carry sufficient lifeboats for everyone on board.|$|E
