5|$|Hergé {{had long}} sought to regain contact <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> friend Zhang Chongren, {{with whom he}} had lost contact. He {{regularly}} asked any Chinese people that he met if they knew of Zhang, and in 1979 had some success when a staff member in a Brussels Chinese restaurant revealed that he was Zhang's godson. Hergé was thus able to re-establish contact <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> friend. The journalist Gérard Valet organised for Zhang to visit Brussels so that he and Hergé could be re-united. The event took place in March 1981, and was heavily publicised; Hergé however found the situation difficult, disliking the press attention and finding that he and Zhang had grown distant during the intervening years.|$|E
5|$|Shankly {{resigned}} on 15 November 1955 {{to take up}} {{the post}} of assistant manager at Huddersfield Town, working <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> friend Andy Beattie. His record in league football at Workington was 35 wins and 27 defeats from 85 matches.|$|E

5|$|Filmed in India, Mauritius, and Scotland, {{this was}} Karan Johar's directorial debut. One of his {{goals for the}} film was to set a new level for style in Hindi cinema. The plot {{combines}} two love triangles set years apart. The first half covers friends on a college campus, while the second {{tells the story of}} a widower's young daughter who tries to reunite her dad <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> friend.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Poulenc {{embarked}} on a collaboration <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> friend Cocteau, in an operatic version of the latter's 1930 monodrama La Voix humaine. The work was produced in February 1959 at the Opéra-Comique, under Cocteau's direction, with Duval as the tragic deserted woman speaking to her former lover by telephone. In May Poulenc's 60th birthday was marked, a few months late, by his last concert with Bernac before the latter's retirement from public performance.|$|E
5|$|Truman {{surrounded}} himself <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> friends, {{and appointed}} several to high positions that seemed well beyond their competence, including his two secretaries of the treasury, Fred Vinson and John Snyder.

5|$|In 1891 Smyth {{returned}} to Hamilton College {{to become the}} Stone Professor of Natural History. In addition to his teaching duties at Hamilton, Smyth spent each summer from 1892 to 1903 doing field work for the New York State Museum in the western Adirondack Mountains, which had been studied {{very little in the}} fifty years prior. He collaborated <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> advisor Kemp, who specialized in the eastern Adirondacks, and Henry Platt Cushing, who claimed the northern and northeastern sections. He {{returned to}} field work a final time in 1908; ill health prevented further expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Pope Innocent, who had proclaimed a new crusade in 1213, {{wanted to}} persuade Leo {{to assist the}} crusaders. In that year, Leo renounced all lands that he had seized from the Templars, but {{retained}} Bagras. John of Brienne married Leo's daughter, Stephanie, in 1214. During the same period, Bohemond's position weakened. His attempt to take vengeance on the Assassins {{for the murder of}} his eldest son, Raymond, brought him into conflict <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> ally, Az-Zahir Ghazi of Aleppo.|$|E
5|$|The Texans {{assumed the}} {{contracts}} {{of the players}} they selected, including all future portions of their signing bonuses and any guarantees or other terms. If the Texans cut a selection and he re-signed <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> team, the existing team re-assumed his signing bonus. Extra bonuses that did not count against the Texans' salary cap were given to veteran players who were selected. Those selected received $10,000 immediately, an additional $20,000 bonus for reporting to training camp, and another $30,000 for making the active roster during the regular season.|$|E

5|$|Theobald died on 18 April 1161, {{after a long}} illness, at his {{palace in}} Canterbury. He was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, in the Holy Trinity Chapel, near the tomb of Archbishop Lanfranc. His coffin was opened in 1190 during repairs to the cathedral and his body {{was found to be}} uncorrupted, but efforts to secure his canonisation as a saint on the basis of that {{evidence}} were unsuccessful. He was reburied in the nave near the altar to St Mary, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> marble tomb replaced above his new resting place. In 1787 his lead coffin was found in Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|With Pablo's assistance, Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Calculus {{escape from}} their guards and seek refuge with General Alcazar and his {{small band of}} anti-Tapioca guerrillas, the Picaros, who are hiding in the San Theodoran jungle. After {{realising}} that Pablo is a double agent working for Tapioca, they escape an attempt on their lives and then shelter for a time with the Arumbaya, an indigenous community who live within the forest. Here, Tintin is reunited <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> acquaintance, the explorer Ridgewell, who is living with the Arumbaya. Leaving the Arumbaya settlement, they eventually arrive at the Picaros' encampment, where they meet Alcazar's wife, Peggy.|$|E
5|$|A large, cranky sow {{escapes from}} its herd and attacks the Mistress after {{she tries to}} shoo {{it out of her}} garden. Lad charges between them and battles the sow, but <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> age and blunt fangs he struggles with the fight and is badly injured. Bruce and Wolf return from a forest romp in time to aid him, and the younger dogs are able to easily drive her off. While fleeing, the pig runs {{directly}} into the path of one of the Place's cars, driven by a car thief who is knocked unconscious. Lad's feelings are hurt by the battle being finished by the other dogs and the Mistress' holding him back from joining them at the end, but he quickly forgives her.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin {{became a}} monk in about 1170, and then abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Forde. He {{was well known}} as a canonist, and often acted as a judge-delegate for the papacy, hearing cases that had reached the Roman Curia and been remanded to local experts for decision. In 1166, Baldwin was the {{addressee}} of a work by John of Salisbury, Expectiatione longa, {{which was one of}} the tracts written during the Becket controversy. It was probably at this time that Baldwin wrote De sacramento altaris. In 1175 he served <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> bishop, Bartholomew, as joint papal judge in a dispute between Malmesbury Abbey and Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury. In 1178 he was recommended to Pope Alexander as a possible candidate for a cardinalship, but this never occurred.|$|E
5|$|Benbow {{continued}} {{aboard the}} Sovereign throughout 1691, {{and by the}} summer of 1692, was again master of the fleet, this time under Admiral Edward Russell, then aboard the Britannia. Benbow worked closely <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> colleague David Mitchell, then serving as Russell's first captain, and Josiah Burchett, Russell's clerk. Benbow may have advised Russell to take the Gull Passage inside the Goodwin Sands to the Downs, where they linked up with the Dutch forces. Benbow served as master of the fleet during the Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue. After the battles, Benbow returned to Deptford to resume his duties as master attendant, spending a brief period at Portsmouth Dockyard helping to oversee repairs to the fleet. He had already had his pay upgraded to that of a master attendant, he was now to be paid as a master, in addition to his master attendant's wage, presumably as an acknowledgement of his special services.|$|E
5|$|He {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} post-war career {{working for the}} U.S. government as a diplomat, civil servant, and administrator. His conversion to the Republican Party and his cooperation <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> friend, President Ulysses S. Grant, as well as critical comments {{he wrote in his}} memoirs about General Lee's wartime performance, made him anathema to many of his former Confederate colleagues. His reputation in the South further suffered when he led African-American militia against the anti-Reconstruction White League at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874. Authors of the Lost Cause movement focused on Longstreet's actions at Gettysburg as a primary reason for the Confederacy's loss of the war. Since the late 20th century, his reputation has undergone a slow reassessment. Many Civil War historians now consider him among the war's most gifted tactical commanders.|$|E

5|$|Kyo is {{a secret}} {{character}} in most versions of The King of Fighters '99, and has no team. In the story, Kyo is kidnapped by the NESTS syndicate to use his DNA to make various clones of himself. He tries to obtain answers personally from his captors entering their base but is forced to retreat when the place around him begins to collapse. Depending on how many points the player has when the game finishes, Kyo can be faced as a bonus fight. He continues his fight against the NESTS alone in The King of Fighters 2000 {{and in the next}} game, Kyo reunites <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> teammates, and his student Shingo Yabuki, to make a comeback on the Japan Team. In KOF 2002, Kyo is a playable character on the original Japan Team.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{return to}} the {{homicide}} unit after a rotation in robbery, {{only to find the}} highest murder clearance rate in five years. A delighted Gee (Yaphet Kotto) credits much of the success to the new detectives Stuart Gharty (Peter Gerety) and, particularly, Laura Ballard (Callie Thorne). Lewis (Clark Johnson) asks Gee for a different partner, but dodges questions about problems <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> partner Kellerman (Reed Diamond); Gee assigns him to Falsone (Jon Seda), one of the newer detectives, and Kellerman is partnered with Munch (Richard Belzer). That evening, Gee attends a black-tie dinner honoring his friend Felix Wilson (James Earl Jones), a wealthy businessman and respected Baltimore philanthropist. In that same hotel, a woman is found beaten to death in the men's bathroom, and Pembleton and Bayliss are called to investigate. Felix and his wife Regina (Lynne Thigpen) see the body and identify her as Melia Brierre, a Haitian expatriate working as one of their domestic workers. The Wilsons leave after only brief interviews, and Pembleton becomes agitated when Bayliss asks whether Pembleton went easy on them because of his respect for Wilson's contributions to the African American community.|$|E
5|$|Screen Gems backed Roddenberry's {{first attempt}} at {{creating}} a pilot. His series, The Wild Blue, went to pilot, but was not picked up. The three main characters had names that later appeared in the Star Trek franchise: Philip Pike, Edward Jellicoe, and James T. Irvine. While working at Screen Gems, an actress, new to Hollywood, wrote to him asking for a meeting. They quickly became friends and met every few months; the woman was Majel Leigh Hudec, later known as Majel Barrett. He created a second pilot called 333 Montgomery about a lawyer, played by DeForest Kelley. It was not {{picked up by the}} network, but was later rewritten as a new series called Defiance County. His career with Screen Gems ended in late 1961, and shortly afterward, he had issues <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> friend Erle Stanley Gardner. The Perry Mason creator claimed that Defiance County had infringed his character Doug Selby. The two writers fell out via correspondence and stopped contacting one another, though Defiance County never proceeded past the pilot stage.|$|E

50|$|Morse worked briefly <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>older</b> brother Dave in a {{band called}} The Plague until {{the family moved to}} Augusta, Georgia. In the late 1960s, he played {{in a band}} called Three <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>older</b> brother and a junior high schoolmate, William Gerald (Jerry) Wooten, who played keyboards. The three {{performed}} at a local psychedelic youth club, The Green Onion, and at Legion Halls and church functions.|$|R
