Locke knocks him {{unconscious}} with the handle of his knife, and Boone awakes to find himself tied up. Locke applies a strange paste on Boone's head wound and leaves a knife embedded in {{the ground in front}} of Boone so he'll be able to free himself. Locke explains that he will be able to reach it once he is properly motivated. After several unsuccessful attempts to do so, Boone hears Shannon's screams and the sounds of the 'monster' approaching. This is the impetus he needs, and after a short struggle, and in excruciating pain, he is finally able to reach the weapon. He then frees himself and searches for his sister.|$|E

500|$|As the storyline developed, it {{held the}} {{potential}} to ruin the positive changes that the character had achieved. Halfpenny said Amy had become really close to Val and Eric. They are in a [...] "good place" [...] and they think [...] "Amy's all happy." [...] The one person she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> is Val, with whom she shares the closest bond and shes [...] "gutted" [...] to remain silent. It prevents them from having a normal parent/child relationship, as the truth would ruin her one last chance. Halfpenny said her portrayal turns Amy to a [...] "dark place" [...] as she is [...] "too young to be coping with something like this." [...] As Amy becomes preoccupied with fear in case Cain finds out, Halfpenny said it makes Amy do [...] "something dangerous." [...] Though, Amy has Victoria {{to fall back on}} and is described as [...] "her rock". Emmerdale series producer Stuart Blackburn said the storyline would change the lives {{of a lot of people}} around Amy. At times he said the narrative is [...] "truly heart breaking" [...] and dangerous. [...] "I think it's going to change perceptions of Amy [...] we’re going to start to understand Amy an awful lot more." ...|$|E

500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} positive. The {{political}} {{journalist and author}} Andrew Rawnsley was critical of Blair's writing style in The Observer. [...] "It is Tony Blair's boast that he wrote every word in longhand 'on hundreds of notepads'. That I believe," [...] he wrote. [...] "He was the most brilliant communicator of his era as a platform speaker or television interviewee, but {{he can be a}} ghastly writer. Anyone thinking about taking this journey needs to be given a travel advisory: much of the prose is execrable ... I could say that it is a pity that Tony Blair did not employ a ghostwriter to prettify the prose and organise his recollections more elegantly." [...] Rawnsley does, though, praise the book as being [...] "a more honest political memoir than most and more open in many respects than I had anticipated." [...] Julian Glover, a columnist in The Guardian, said that [...] "no political memoir has ever been like this: a book written as if in a dream—or a nightmare; a literary out-of-body experience. By turns honest, confused, memorable, boastful, fitfully endearing, important, lazy, shallow, rambling and intellectually correct, it scampers through the last two decades like a trashy airport read." [...] The Sunday Telegraph was extremely critical of Blair's writing style. [...] "If Blair <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you a funny story, he makes the mistake of signalling in advance that you should be laughing—what happened was 'hilarious', his first weekend at Balmoral was 'utterly freaky'—thereby strangling the anecdote at birth. The book, like its author, is slightly embarrassing." [...] In the journal History Today, Archie Brown, Emeritus Professor of Politics at Oxford University was critical of what he believed to be Blair's flawed sense of leadership, but had praise for the chapter on the Northern Ireland peace process: [...] "Blair's role in the Northern Ireland settlement was perhaps his single most noteworthy achievement. His account of it is also the best chapter in a book which, even by the standards of memoirists who fancy themselves to be remarkable leaders, is strikingly egocentric." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sheriff Dumire has {{suspected}} the Wendells of shady activities since their arrival and questions {{them about the}} missing businessman.

2500|$|As an example, Buñuel {{has told}} {{about one of}} his {{experiences}} with cameraman Gabriel Figueroa, a veteran who had become famous in cinematography circles by making a specialty of illuminating {{the beauty of the}} Mexican landscape using photographic chiaroscuro (stark contrast between illuminated space and dark shadows). [...] Figueroa had set up a shot for Nazarín near the valley of the Popocatépetl: [...] "It was during this shoot that I scandalized Gabriel Figueroa, who had prepared for me an aesthetically irreproachable framing, with the Popocatépetl in the background and the inevitable white clouds. I simply turned the camera to frame a banal scene that seemed to me more real, more proximate. I have never liked refabricated cinematographic beauty, which very often makes one forget what the film <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> and which personally, does not move me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{scene in}} Beauty and the Beast {{during which the}} song is heard is the moment when Belle and the Beast's true {{feelings}} for each other are finally established. Set in the ballroom of the Beast's castle, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] is performed by the character Mrs. Potts, an enchanted teapot, midway through the film as she explains the feeling of love to her young teacup son Chip, referring to the emotion as [...] "a tale as old as time". According to Armen Karaoghlanian of Interiors, [...] "Belle familiarizes the Beast with the waltz and as soon he feels comfortable, he gracefully moves her across the floor". Afterwards, the song continues to play instrumentally as Belle and the Beast retire to the balcony for a romantic candlelit dinner. Believed to be the [...] "centerpiece that brings Beauty and her Beast together," [...] the sequence offers an insight into both characters' psyches. From the Beast's perspective, it is the moment he realizes {{that he wants to}} confess his true feelings for Belle to her and [...] "decides he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Belle he is in love with her." [...] Meanwhile, Belle begins {{to fall in love with}} her captor. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Jennie Punter reviewed it as the scene in which [...] "romance finally blossoms." [...] Film critic Ellison Estefan, writing for Estefan Films, believes that the sequence is responsible for [...] "add another dimension to the characters as they continue to fall deeply in love with each other." [...] Explaining the song's role in the film, director Kirk Wise described the scene as [...] "the culmination of their relationship," [...] while producer Don Hahn pegged it as [...] "the bonding moment of the film when the two main characters finally get together." [...] The scene had long been envisioned as having a more live-action feel to it than the rest of the film, an idea that originated from story artists Brenda Chapman and Roger Allers, who were the first to suggest that the ballroom be built using computers. As the film's executive producer, former Head of Disney's film division Jeffrey Katzenberg recalled that he began working on Beauty and the Beast deciding what its [...] "wowie" [...] moment would be, defining this as [...] "the moment in the movie where you see what's on the screen and go, 'Wow-IEE'"; this ultimately became the film's ballroom sequence. According to Hahn, the scene was conceived out of the filmmakers' desire to manipulate the camera in order to [...] "sweep" [...] the audience away. Allers and Chapman conceived the ballroom in order to provide the characters with an area in which they could linger, and were surprised by the amount of artistic freedom with which they were provided by the animators, who agreed to adjust to the changes in perspective that would result from the moving camera. While Allers decided to raise the camera in order to view the dancing couple from the overhead chandelier, Chapman decided to rotate the camera around Belle's skirt as the couple danced past it.|$|E
