5|$|The {{majority}} of sea terns have light grey or white body plumage as adults, {{with a black}} cap to the head. The legs and bill are various combinations of red, orange, yellow, or black depending on species. The pale plumage is conspicuous from a distance at sea, and may attract other birds to a good feeding area for these fish-eating species. When seen against the sky, the white underparts also help to hide the hunting bird from its intended prey. The Inca tern has mainly dark plumage, and three species that mainly eat insects, the black tern, <b>white-winged</b> <b>tern,</b> and black-bellied tern, have black underparts in the breeding season. The Anous noddies have dark plumage with a pale head cap. The reason for their dark plumage is unknown, {{but it has been}} suggested that in tropical areas, where food resources are scarce, the less conspicuous colouration makes it harder for other noddies to detect a feeding bird. Plumage type, especially the head pattern, is linked to the phylogeny of the terns, and the pale-capped, dark-bodied noddies are believed to have diverged earlier than the other genera from an ancestral white-headed gull, followed by the partially black-headed Onychoprion and Sternula groupings.|$|E
25|$|Yala {{is one of}} the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Of 215 {{bird species}} of the park, seven are endemic to Sri Lanka. They are Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, crimson-fronted barbet, black-capped bulbul, blue-tailed {{bee-eater}} and brown-capped babbler. The number of waterbirds inhabiting wetlands of Yala is 90 and half of them are migrants. Waterfowl (lesser whistling duck, garganey), cormorants (little cormorant, Indian cormorant), large waterbirds (grey heron, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, Asian openbill, painted stork), medium-sized waders Tringa spp., and small waders Charadrius spp. are among the most common waterbirds. Black-necked stork and lesser adjutant are many of the rare birds that {{can be seen in the}} park. The migrant great white pelican and resident spot-billed pelican are also have been recorded. Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include lesser flamingo, pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, <b>white-winged</b> <b>tern,</b> Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, godwits, and ruddy turnstone. The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew. Rock pigeon, barred buttonquail, Indian peafowl, black stork, black-winged stilt, and greater flamingo are among the other bird species. Crested serpent eagle and white-bellied sea eagle are the raptors of the park. The forest birds are orange-breasted green pigeon, hornbills, Old World flycatchers, Indian paradise flycatcher, Asian barbets, and orioles.|$|E

40|$|Many terns (Laridae) {{from the}} {{northern}} hemisphere overwinter in Australia, but they are rarely covered comprehensively in bird counts in Australian coastal waterways. We conducted censuses over 3 years on terns in an increasingly popular recreational waterway at {{the northern end of}} Moreton Bay, known as Caloundra sandbanks, to provide the first overview of the relative abundance of non-breeding tern species on estuary-type sandbanks in Australia. The maximum number of birds counted was > 43, 000, of which over 90 % belonged to six species of terns. The most abundant tern species was the common tern Sterna hirundo longipennis which reached > 38, 000 in one Austral summer. Other northern-breeding migrant <b>terns</b> were the <b>white-winged</b> black <b>tern</b> Chlidonias leucopterus (> 17, 000) and the little tern S. albifrons sinensis (> 11, 000), which also breeds in Australia. These migrant terns arrived at Caloundra sandbanks at around late-October and a vast majority had departed by mid-April. Numbers were generally highest from late-December through to early-April. An additional three Australian-breeding terns of smaller population sizes frequented the sandbanks. Density of terns using the habitats could reach a peak of 600 ha− 1 during the warmer months of the year, coinciding with peak human recreational activities. In light of the results, Caloundra sandbanks should be regarded as an Area of International Importance based on criteria contained in the Ramsar Convention. The situation at Caloundra sandbanks presents challenges to recreational and tourism issues, requiring review of traditional government priorities in the conservation of wetlands based primarily on waders...|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} {{paper on the}} ecology of fish-eating birds on Lake Kariba {{and their impact on}} fish populations within and beyond the lake. Most fish-eating species which were present in the middle Zambezi valley before inundation still occur on the lake (Donnelly and Donnelly 1983) and only those which occupied specialized habitats now lost through flooding have disappeared or become scarce and restricted (e g. Rufous-bellied Heron, African Skimmer, Little Bittern). White-breasted Cormorants disappeared from the lake after 1963 but have now returned (Hustler et al. 1986, Hustler 1986 a). Species that have colonized the lake include the Black Egret, Lesser Black- backed Gull, Grey-headed Gull and <b>White-winged</b> Black <b>Tern.</b> The last three species have probably responded to the large areas of open water formed by the lake and the increase in fishing activity (Begg 1973, Hustler 1986 b). There is no permanent population of Pelicans on Lake Kariba (Irwin 1981) but small numbers have been recorded periodically in recent years (Hustler 1987). These birds are abundant in shallow lakes such as Lake St. Lucia, South Africa (Whitfield and Cyrus 1978) and Lake Nakuru, Kenya (Vareschi and Jacobs 1984), and are absent from Lake Kariba because there are few suitable shallow areas. Fish-eating birds on the lake can be divided into residents, migrants and vagrants. It is likely that most resident species have increased in number because of the longer shoreline and greater availability of fish. Intra-African or palearctic migrants may be present for up to six months every year but their numbers vary considerably. The present investigations were sponsored for many years by the University of Zimbabwe Research Board and by the Swedish Agency for Research Cooperation with Developing Countries (SAREC) ...|$|R
