Climate changes exert significant influence on the functioning of mountain ski resorts, {{especially if they are}} located in areas with relatively high air temperatures in winter season. At the present time, a snowy cluster of mountain ski resorts is intensively progressing in vicinity of Krasnaya Polyana. This region in the West Caucasus (Russia) is characterized by relatively <b>warm</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> The snow cover thickness (of 1 % insurance) in area of the Aibga mountain range may reach 8. 1 m. But the snow cover thickness is not the only characteristic of the mountain skiing attractiveness. According to the Swiss standards a mountain ski resort can be considered reliable if during seven seasons of ten ones the snow cover with minimal thickness of 30 – 50 cm exists for a time not shorter than 100 days during a period from 1 st December till 15 th April. According to the forecast, during future decades the calculated amount of solid precipitation should reduce by 25 – 30 % in mountain regions on the south macro-slope of the Great Caucasus. As the calculations show, by 2041 – 2050 the maximal decade thickness of snow cover will decrease by 29 – 35 % while a number of days with snow – by 35 – 40 %. If this is the case, artificial snow will be needed in addition to the natural one. But, under <b>warm</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> using of plants for artificial snow production will require a certain perfecting of the nowadays technologies, and very likely, with use of chemicals.

40|$|As the {{worldwide}} energy consumption continues to grow, {{natural gas and}} especially LNG are expected to keep contributing significantly with this growth. More than 95 % of the installed LNG facilities use a precooling cycle as {{the first stage of}} the liquefaction process. In this work, a technical comparison between different precooling cycles for LNG processes is carried out through computational simulations using Aspen HYSYS&# 174;. The aim is to provide future project developments with a clear idea of the technical advantages/disadvantages involved in the selection of the process for the precooling cycle in LNG processes. The precooling circuit is treated as a stand-alone cycle first and then implemented in an entire liquefaction process; the propane precooled mixed refrigerant (C 3 MR) and the mixed fluid cascade (MFC&# 174;) processes are used for this purpose. The parameters studied are essentially coefficient of performance (&# 946;), heat exchanger UA value, compressor power, suction volumetric flow and pressure ratio. Two cases, cold (6 &# 176;C) and warm (25 &# 176;C) <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> are considered for each study. A three stage propane precooled process was found to be the most energetically efficient among the studied cases, even better than a two stage mixed refrigerant process (C 2 /C 3) for both climate conditions; however, the performance in terms of energy consumption is not the only parameter taken into account and therefore a selection chart is provided. Under <b>warm</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> a propane precooling circuit showed to be the most recommended process. For cold climates, however, a two stage mixed refrigerant cycle reaching ca. - 50 &# 176;C is the preferred alternative, since in this case the low ambient temperature gives the propane precooled process a low share in the entire process. Other cases, such as a single stage mixed refrigerant cycle and a mixed refrigerant including n-Butane are taken into account. Based on the obtained results, a new, highly efficient configuration for natural gas liquefaction has been suggested, it is to be implemented in relatively <b>warm</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> It consists of a MFC&# 174; process with modifications in the liquefaction cycle and a propane precooling instead of the mixed refrigerant circuit; no previous reference in the open literature was found for such arrangement. </p...|$|R

The question is addressed of whether the ice sheet could be regenerated if preindustrial climate conditions were reestablished after its melting. The HadCM 3 coupled atmosphere–ocean GCM is used to simulate the global and regional climate with preindustrial atmospheric greenhouse gas composition and with the Greenland ice sheet removed. Two separate cases are considered. In one, the surface topography of Greenland is given by that of the bedrock currently buried under the ice sheet. In the other, a readjustment to isostatic equilibrium of the unloaded orography is taken into account, giving higher elevations. In both cases, there is greater summer melting than in the current climate, leading to partially snow-free summers with much higher temperatures. On the long-term average, there is no accumulation of snow. The implication of this result is that the removal of the Greenland ice sheet due to a prolonged climatic warming would be irreversible. 1...|$|E

This fine-scale representation of CWD dynamics enables the identification of landscape features and habitats that may resist significant climatic changes in the future. We observe that north-facing slopes with relatively low energy loads are less sensitive in terms of drought stress to dramatically lower-than-average precipitation years. We also observe that the CA-BCM validates that deeper soils in valley bottoms are capable of sustaining more moisture longer into the dry season than environments with thin soils.

40|$|Climate {{changes in}} the North Atlantic region during the last glacial cycle were {{dominated}} by the slow waxing and waning of the North American ice sheet {{as well as by}} intermittent, millennial-scale Dansgaard–Oeschger climate oscillations. However, prior to the last deglaciation, the responses of North American vegetation and biomass burning to these climate variations are uncertain.

Here we use continuous, high-resolution measurements of ammonium concentrations between 110, 000 to 10, 000 years ago from the Greenland NGRIP and GRIP ice cores to reconstruct North American wildfire activity and soil ammonium emissions.

40|$|Abrupt {{changes in}} the {{strength}} of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (comprising northward flow of warm water and a cold southward return flow) are implicated in abrupt climate {{changes in the}} late Pleistocene. A sensitive place to assess this circulation is in the cold return flow of Deep Western Boundary Currents. Here, in records of flow speed and isotopic composition of surface and bottom waters from a Deep Western Boundary Current location near the northern source of North Atlantic Deep Water, we show both orbital and millennial-scale coupling between deep ocean flow and climate in the middle Pleistocene (0. 75 – 0. 87 Ma), when the boundary conditions in terms of the mean state and amplitude of climate change were different from more recent periods. The coupling appears as a phased series of events initiated by reduced vertical density gradients and initial ventilation of deep waters. The occurrence of these events in interglacials during the middle Pleistocene suggests that the millennial-scale climate variability in the North Atlantic was more pronounced at that time than previously thought. This demonstrates that, given the right boundary <b>conditions,</b> rapid <b>climate</b> shifts can also occur during relatively <b>warm</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
50|$|Different {{names have}} been given to the many {{varieties}} of the genus. Orange applies primarily to the sweet orange - Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck. The orange tree is an evergreen, flowering tree, with an average height of 9 to 10 m, although some very old specimens can reach 15 m. Its oval leaves, alternately arranged, are 4 to 10 cm long and have crenulate margins. Sweet oranges grow in a range of different sizes, and shapes varying from spherical to oblong. Inside and attached to the rind is a porous white tissue, the white, bitter mesocarp or albedo (pith). The orange contains a number of distinct carpels (segments) inside, typically about ten, each delimited by a membrane, and containing many juice-filled vesicles and usually a few seeds (pips). When unripe, the fruit is green. The grainy irregular rind of the ripe fruit can range from bright orange to yellow-orange, but frequently retains green patches or, under <b>warm</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions,</b> remains entirely green. Like all other citrus fruits, the sweet orange is non-climacteric. The Citrus sinensis group is subdivided into four classes with distinct characteristics: common oranges, blood or pigmented oranges, navel oranges, and acidless oranges.|$|R
40|$|During {{the early}} Pliocene, 5 to 3 million years ago, {{globally}} averaged temperatures were substantially {{higher than they}} are today, even though the external factors that determine climate were essentially the same. In the tropics, El Niño was continual (or ‘‘permanent’’) rather than intermittent. The appearance of northern continental glaciers, and of cold surface waters in oceanic upwelling zones in low latitudes (both coastal and equatorial), signaled the termination of those <b>warm</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> {{and the end of}} permanent El Niño. This led to the amplification of obliquity (but not precession) cycles in equatorial sea surface temperatures and in global ice volume, with the former leading the latter by several thousand years. A possible explanation is that the gradual shoaling of the oceanic thermocline reached a threshold around 3 million years ago, when the winds started bringing cold waters to the surface in low latitudes. This introduced feedbacks involving ocean-atmosphere interactions that, along with ice-albedo feedbacks, amplified obliquity cycles. A future melting of glaciers, changes in the hydrological cycle, and a deepening of the thermocline could restore the warm conditions of the early Pliocene. The early Pliocene was similar to and also very different from the world o...|$|R
