5|$|Alchemical {{magic was}} used to create or alter potions to achieve more {{powerful}} effects, repair or enchant items, identify unknown items or creatures, and combine different Order or Chaos spells to create spells with multiple elements (such as earth and fire spells creating a molten metal spell). Alchemical magic could also imbue a target with elemental attributes; for example, a warrior imbued <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Water</b> element would deal extra cold-type damage but receive additional heat-type damage.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Han dynasty, the Liu family associated its dynasty <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> phase as the previous Qin dynasty had done. By 104 BCE, to accompany the installment of the new Taichu Calendar (太初历), the Han court aligned itself with the earth phase to legitimately supplant the Qin's element. Yet by 26 CE (shortly after the downfall of Wang Mang) the new Eastern Han court made a retrospective argument that Han's element had always been fire.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally {{there had}} been a muffled thud or deadened {{explosion}} within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. This movement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> rushing up toward us was accompanied by a rumbling roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.|$|E
5|$|Surtsey, Iceland. The volcano built {{itself up}} from depth and emerged above the Atlantic Ocean {{off the coast}} of Iceland in 1963. Initial hydrovolcanics were highly explosive, but as the volcano grew out rising lava started to {{interact}} less <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and more with the air, until finally Surtseyan activity waned and became more Strombolian in character.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the raid was to destroy three objectives: the Normandie dock, the old gates into the Bassin de St Nazaire {{together}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> pumping machinery and other installations, and any U-boats or other shipping in the area. The initial Combined Operations plan required one specially lightened destroyer {{to carry out the}} raid. It would be packed with explosives and rammed into the dock gates.|$|E

5|$|Toxic {{blue-green algae}} blooms are a {{reasonably}} common occurrence in the lake. Warnings about coming into contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> are released when an algal bloom is detected. Attempts {{are being made}} to {{limit the amount of}} phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality. Blue-green algae (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce toxins, which can be harmful for humans and any other animals that come in contact with the contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.|$|E
5|$|While Stratton was at Johns Hopkins, the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 struck {{destroying}} large {{swaths of}} the city.

5|$|After {{learning}} that Hogeboom had murdered Fontaine and kidnapped Elsa, Phelps and Kelso pursue {{him into the}} Los Angeles River Tunnels as a heavy rain begins, fighting their way through corrupt policemen and thugs. The pair rescue Elsa, with Kelso killing Hogeboom to put {{him out of his}} mental anguish. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level rising, the group use an open manhole to escape, but Phelps is swept away in the current. Whilst the SRF scam is exposed, several members escape justice by making a deal with the Assistant D.A. to testify. They attend Phelps's funeral, each delivering eulogies to his memory, much to the disgust of Elsa. Biggs remarks to Kelso that Phelps was never his friend, to which Kelso agrees but responds that he was never Phelps' enemy.|$|E

5|$|Climate {{change may}} well affect populations of seabirds in the {{northern}} Atlantic. The most important demographic may {{be an increase in}} the sea surface temperature which may have benefits for some northerly Atlantic puffin colonies. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as the chick grows. In northern Norway the main food item fed to the chick is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae during the previous year was governed by the water temperature, which controlled plankton abundance and this in turn influenced the growth and survival of the first-year herring. The breeding success of Atlantic puffin colonies has been found to correlate in this way <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface temperatures of the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Link is rescued at Windfall Island by {{a talking}} boat, the King of Red Lions, who {{explains}} that the bird's master is a returned Ganon. To defeat him, Link must find the Hero of Time's power, which requires the three Pearls of the Goddesses. Link finds Din's Pearl on Dragon Roost Island, home of the avian Rito and the dragon Valoo; Farore's Pearl in Forest Haven, home of the Great Deku Tree and the plant-like Koroks; and Nayru's Pearl <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> spirit Jabun on Outset Island. The King of Red Lions then takes Link to the Tower of the Gods, where he faces trials before descending beneath the ocean to a castle suspended in time. Here Link finds the Hero of Time's weapon, the Master Sword.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding the {{southern}} part of Lake Okeechobee is the Fort Thompson Formation, made of dense, hard limestone, shells, and sand. Rain water is less likely to erode the limestone to form solution holes—smaller versions of sinkholes that do not intersect <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table. In this formation the beds are generally impermeable. Underneath the metropolitan areas of Palm Beach County is the Anastasia Formation, composed of shelly limestone, coquina, and sand representing a former mangrove or salt marsh. The Anastasia Formation is much more permeable and filled with pocks and solution holes. The Fort Thompson and Anastasia Formations, and Miami Limestone and (x), were formed during the Sangamon interglacial period.|$|E

5|$|The Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA) was validly {{established}} in October 1976 under The Punjab Development of Cities Act (1976) to regulate, supervise and implement development activities in its jurisdiction area. The FDA {{acts as a}} policy-making body {{for the development of}} the city and is in charge of arranging and supervising major developments within the city. It is responsible for the administration of building regulations, management of parks and gardens and subsoil water management. The FDA works <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Water</b> and Sanitation Agency (WASA) to control and maintain the water supply, sewerage and drainage. The FDA works to improve conditions in the slums.|$|E
5|$|The Terriers Association was {{established}} in 1890 to help retired artists in need of financial help. Leno was an active fundraiser in this and in the Music Hall Benevolent Fund, of which he became President. He was an early member of the entertainment charity Grand Order of Water Rats, which helps performers who are in financial need, and served as its leader, the King Rat, in 1891, 1892 and 1897. Near {{the end of his}} life, Leno co-founded The Music Hall Artistes Railway Association, which entered a partnership <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Water</b> Rats to form music hall's first trade union. Some of Leno's charity was discreet and unpublicised.|$|E
5|$|The bull {{appears to}} have had a sacred role in a number of Celtic cults. The animal was viewed {{positively}} by the Celts as an image of fertility and abundance; one tribe, the Taurini, even adopted the bull's name. It is unknown how it came to be associated with bodies of water {{in the form of the}} water bull, but historian and symbologist Charles Milton Smith has suggested that such mythological creatures might originate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> spouts that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, which can give the impression of a living form as they move across the water.|$|E

5|$|The lungs in {{amphibians}} are primitive {{compared to}} those of amniotes, possessing few internal septa and large alveoli, and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood. Ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping. Most amphibians, however, are able to exchange gases <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> or air via their skin. To enable sufficient cutaneous respiration, the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate. Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the Titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander. In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the plethodontid salamanders, which have neither lungs nor gills. Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the axolotl) retaining gills as aquatic adults.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovered}} beef {{material is}} extruded through long tubes that are thinner than a pencil, {{during which time}} at the Beef Products, Inc. (BPI) processing plant, the meat is exposed to gaseous ammonia. At Cargill Meat Solutions, citric acid is used to kill bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. Gaseous ammonia in contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> in the meat produces ammonium hydroxide. The ammonia sharply increases the pH and damages microscopic organisms, the freezing causes ice crystals to form and puncture the organisms' weakened cell walls, and the mechanical stress destroys the organisms altogether. The product is finely ground, compressed into pellets or blocks, flash frozen and then shipped for use as an additive.|$|E
5|$|They {{possess a}} unique feeding {{mechanism}} known as suction feeding. Instead of catching their prey with teeth, it is sucked into their oral cavity. Their tongue can move very freely, and when suddenly retracted {{at the same}} time as the gular floor is distended, the pressure immediately drops within their mouth and the prey is sucked in <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The family members are characterized by having a lower jaw that extends at least to the tip of the upper jaw, a shallow or non-existent notch between the tail flukes, a dorsal fin set well back on the body, three of four fused cervical vertebrae, extensive skull asymmetry and two conspicuous throat grooves forming a 'V' pattern.|$|E
