5|$|The {{election}} of Republican president William McKinley in 1896 deepened the Democrats' resolve {{to oppose the}} Republican governor and his allies. Moreover, when the legislature convened in 1898, the Democratic majority in both houses <b>was</b> <b>overwhelming.</b> Bradley's message to the General Assembly in 1898 called for numerous reforms including spending cuts to reduce government waste, putting the state's charitable institutions under control of a non-partisan board, and reforms to public education and legal system.|$|E
5|$|Urban saw Alexios's request as a dual {{opportunity}} to cement Western Europe and reunite the Eastern Orthodox Church with the Roman Catholic Church under his rule. On 27 November 1095, Pope Urban II called together the Council of Clermont, and urged all those present {{to take up}} arms under the sign of the Cross and launch an armed pilgrimage to recover Jerusalem and the East from the Muslims. The response in Western Europe <b>was</b> <b>overwhelming.</b>|$|E

5|$|A few {{physicists}} {{persisted in}} developing semiclassical models in which electromagnetic radiation is not quantized, but matter appears {{to obey the}} laws of quantum mechanics. Although the evidence from chemical and physical experiments {{for the existence of}} photons <b>was</b> <b>overwhelming</b> by the 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as absolutely definitive; since it relied on the interaction of light with matter, and a sufficiently complete theory of matter could in principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, all semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments. Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that quantization is a property of light itself is considered to be proven.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted {{six of the}} {{soldiers}} after two and one-half hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter because there <b>was</b> <b>overwhelming</b> evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers had felt threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E
5|$|Young {{proposed}} {{the plan in}} a letter to Franklin D. Richards, President of the European Mission, in September 1855. His letter was published in the Millennial Star, the Church's England-based periodical, on December 22, 1855, along with an editorial by Richards endorsing the project. The cost of the migration was expected to be reduced by one-third. The response <b>was</b> <b>overwhelming</b> – in 1856 the Perpetual Emigration Fund supported the travel of 2,012 European emigrants, compared with 1,161 the year before.|$|E

5|$|Another {{opponent}} to {{the project}} was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there <b>was</b> <b>overwhelming</b> support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to its {{misleading}} title, the Manifesto of the Sixteen {{had originally}} fifteen signatories—among them {{some of the}} most eminent anarchists in Europe—and was later countersigned by another hundred. The position of the Manifesto was in stark contrast to that of most anarchists of the day, many of whom denounced its signatories and their sympathizers, and accused them of betraying anarchist principles. In the fallout over the war, Kropotkin became increasingly isolated, with many former friends cutting their ties to him. The Russian anarchist movement was split into two, with a faction supporting Kropotkin's position to the strong criticism of the Bolsheviks. Elsewhere in Europe, including in the Spanish and Swiss anarchist movements, the dismissal of the Manifesto <b>was</b> <b>overwhelming,</b> with supporters being angrily denounced and marginalized.|$|E
5|$|Initially the 'congress' {{agreed to}} defend the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes's advance. However, once there, they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be {{bypassed}} through the pass by the modern village of Sarantaporo, and that the army of Xerxes <b>was</b> <b>overwhelming,</b> the Greeks retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont. A second strategy was therefore adopted by the allies. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnese) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual strategy {{was adopted by the}} congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans {{to defend the}} Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, whilst the women and children of Athens had been evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E

5|$|The Queen's grief <b>was</b> <b>overwhelming,</b> and the tepid {{feelings}} {{the public}} had felt previously for Albert were replaced by sympathy. Victoria wore black mourning {{for the rest of}} her long life, and Albert's rooms in all his houses were kept as they had been, even with hot water brought in the morning, and linen and towels changed daily. Such practices were not uncommon in the houses of the very rich. Victoria withdrew from public life and her seclusion eroded some of Albert's work in attempting to re-model the monarchy as a national institution setting a moral, if not political, example. Albert is credited with introducing the principle that the British royal family should remain above politics. Before his marriage to Victoria, she supported the Whigs; for example, early in her reign Victoria managed to thwart the formation of a Tory government by Sir Robert Peel by refusing to accept substitutions which Peel wanted to make among her ladies-in-waiting.|$|E
5|$|At {{the village}} of Kusić in Banat, a man named Ilija Bordan was {{regarded}} to be alovit; the villagers talked {{that he had a}} tail. Whenever a thunderstorm came, his appearance changed—he fought with an ala. If the ala <b>was</b> <b>overwhelming</b> him, Ilija would lie down and sleep, and if he was overpowering her, the clouds would start to dissipate. There was a tale in the same village about an alovit man who would warn the villagers of the approach of a thunderstorm, before he took a wagon pole on his back and flew into the clouds. At {{the village of}} Sokolovac in Banat, people told of an alovit man who had four nipples. At the sight of hail clouds, he would mount his mare and disappear for several days. The latter two men would come back tired, bruised, and with torn clothes. As held in the central Serbian region of Gruža, men could become dragonlike. As such, they would suddenly disappear during thunderstorms, and fly into the dark clouds to fight against ale. They were characterized as nimble, hot-tempered, rash and very strong. At a village near Radomir in western Bulgaria, there was a dragon man who was said to have been physically crippled by an ala.|$|E
