5|$|Having {{learned the}} truth about Dexter's identity, Arthur (John Lithgow) confronts Dexter (Michael C. Hall) at the police station, <b>where</b> <b>nobody</b> else knows Arthur is the Trinity Killer. He warns Dexter to leave him alone from now on. When he leaves, Dexter follows Arthur in his car, and accidentally strikes another car on his way. Dexter follows Arthur to a bank, where he sees Arthur bring a large {{envelope}} back to his van. Dexter attacks Arthur, knocking him out and dragging him into the van, and Dexter realizes the envelope is filled with cash. Dexter plans to take Arthur's van away and kill Arthur, but he spots {{the driver of the}} car he struck earlier talking to police officers next to Dexter's car. Dexter hides the envelope and confronts the driver, who acts very irritable. A frustrated Dexter attacks him and is detained by the police. By the time he is released, Arthur is gone, but Dexter recovers the envelope of money.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Strangers inject one of their men, Mr. Hand (Richard O'Brien), with memories intended for Murdoch in an attempt to predict his movements and track him down.|$|E
25|$|The IceHogs had {{a shorter}} {{off-season}} than usual {{due to their}} major league affiliate, the Chicago Blackhawks, having an extended 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs and winning the Stanley Cup. Head coach Ted Dent believed Rockford would have to develop new top scorers to replace those who left the team. Nevertheless, much of the focus in off-season practices went toward defense and discipline, particularly on avoiding taking penalties. The IceHogs played a pair of preseason exhibition away games, starting with a 2–1 victory over the Chicago Wolves on September 25. Jared Brown and Matt Lowry both scored for Rockford, but were nevertheless released from the team the next day. The IceHogs lost the preseason finale 2–1 to the Milwaukee Admirals on September 27, which Winchester scoring the team's only goal. The game went to a shootout, <b>where</b> <b>nobody</b> from either team scored until Milwaukee's Mathieu Tousignant in the tenth round.|$|E

25|$|Viennese cafés have an {{extremely}} long and distinguished history {{that dates back}} centuries, and the caffeine addictions of some famous historical patrons of the oldest are something of a local legend. These coffee houses are unique to Vienna and many cities have unsuccessfully sought to copy them. Some people consider cafés as their extended living room <b>where</b> <b>nobody</b> will be bothered if they spend hours reading a newspaper while enjoying their coffee. Traditionally, the coffee comes {{with a glass of}} water. Viennese cafés claim to have invented the process of filtering coffee from booty captured after the second Turkish siege in 1683. Viennese cafés claim that when the invading Turks left Vienna, they abandoned hundreds of sacks of coffee beans. The Polish King John III Sobieski, the commander of the anti-Turkish coalition of Poles, Germans, and Austrians, gave Franz George Kolschitzky (Polish – Franciszek Jerzy Kulczycki) some of this coffee as a reward for providing information that allowed him to defeat the Turks. Kolschitzky then opened Vienna's first coffee shop. Julius Meinl set up a modern roasting plant in the same premises where the coffee sacks were found, in 1891.|$|E

Even newspapers wondered where he was, speculating {{that he might have}} been kidnapped by Pittsburgh detectives, by Secret Service agents, or by [...] "agents of millionaires" [...] who opposed his message. Three days later, Berkman appeared in New York and contacted Goldman. He said the lecture tour had made him feel miserable.

[...] The narrator tells his lover to imagine incomplete things, like [...] "a world where no music is playing, a church <b>where</b> <b>nobody's</b> praying, a sky with no blue", and by seeing this, she can see his picture without her by his side. The song is similar to an older Webb Pierce song called [...] "That's Me Without You". It was originally recorded by George Jones, whose version peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1972. In his 1995 autobiography I Lived to Tell It All, Jones quoted lines from the song to describe his own sadness at the passing of his brother-in-law W.T. [...] "Dub" [...] Scroggins in 1993.|$|R
5000|$|Ron Silver {{was cast}} as main {{character}} Larry Goldman. Goldman {{was to be}} a likable personality whose professional conduct is questionable. [...] "What I wanted to set up was a situation <b>where</b> <b>nobody's</b> good and nobody's bad, and you ultimately don't know who to root for," [...] said Leonard. Silver said [...] "I was fascinated by the potential complexity of the character". In researching his role Silver met with Larry Flynt and Jenna Jameson as well as reading magazines and watching videos. Olivia Wilde played his daughter Jewel and Pamela Gidley played his wife Barbara. Kevin Anderson played the Los Angeles district attorney, Thomas Roam, who was out to get Goldman. Anderson elaborated on his character stating, [...] "He's not an out-and-out good guy, there's a dark side. He's different than the run-of-the-mill do-gooder crusader lawyer."

2500|$|In 1933 and 1934 MacDonald's {{mental and}} {{physical}} health declined further, and he became an increasingly ineffective leader as the international situation grew more threatening. His speeches in Commons became incoherent. One observer noted how [...] "Things ... got to the stage <b>where</b> <b>nobody</b> knew what the Prime Minister was going to say in the House of Commons, and, when he did say it, nobody understood it." [...] His pacifism, which had been widely admired in the 1920s, led Winston Churchill and others to accuse him of failure {{to stand up to the}} threat of Adolf Hitler. His government began the negotiations for the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. MacDonald was aware of his fading powers, and in 1935 he agreed to a timetable with Baldwin to stand down as Prime Minister after George V's Silver Jubilee celebrations in May 1935. He resigned on 7 June in favour of Baldwin, and remained in the cabinet, taking the largely honorary post of Lord President vacated by Baldwin.|$|E
2500|$|Assertions about {{discrepancies}} in the 2009 election were also {{examined by the}} FBI and California's Secretary of State.

As L.A. prosecutors investigated potential voter fraud, several citizens allegedly told the Times that city officials encouraged them to fill out absentee ballots in a manner that election experts said has significantly raised the possibility that state law has been violated. [...] "Under state law, this is not to be done unless someone is ill or disabled. If, in fact, the election itself has been tainted by improper electioneering or other violations of state law, then that involves civil — maybe even criminal — penalties, and in some circumstances, you can overturn the election itself", Attorney General Brown said. [...] "If (officials) met in a back room and said, 'How can we run an election <b>where</b> <b>nobody</b> shows up so we can then fatten our own salaries and pensions?"
