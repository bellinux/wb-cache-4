5|$|Another {{important}} factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard. Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. <b>Weaknesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pawn structure, such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and , once created, are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, by the possibility of developing an attack).|$|E

5|$|Sulla, who had {{observed}} the violent results of radical populare reforms (in particular those under Marius and Cinna), was naturally conservative, {{and so his}} conservatism was more reactionary than it was visionary. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and thus the senate. After being appointed Roman Dictator in 82 BC, he enacted a series of constitutional reforms. He resigned the Dictatorship in 80 BC, retired in 79 BC, and died a year later. While he {{thought that he had}} firmly established aristocratic rule, his own career had illustrated the fatal <b>weaknesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> constitution. Ultimately, it was the army, and not the senate, which dictated the fortunes of the state.|$|E

In a recent report, the application was found to be involved in nearly 40% of endpoint security incidents. While attackers have been finding <b>weaknesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Windows operating system for years, it’s clear that there’s something problematic with PowerShell scripting.|$|E

5|$|Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz {{beginning}} in 1873 described {{how to avoid}} weaknesses in one's own position and how to create and exploit such <b>weaknesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opponent's position. The scientific approach and positional understanding of Steinitz revolutionized the game. Steinitz {{was the first to}} break a position down into its components. Before Steinitz, players brought their queen out early, did not completely develop their other pieces, and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king, which either succeeded or failed. The level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan. In addition to his theoretical achievements, Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player, the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker, who maintained this title for 27years, the longest tenure of all World Champions.|$|E
5|$|Stephen became {{increasingly}} concerned with ensuring {{that his son}} Eustace would inherit his throne. The King tried to convince the Church to agree to crown Eustace to reinforce his claim; Pope Eugene III refused, and Stephen {{found himself in a}} sequence of increasingly bitter arguments with his senior clergy. In 1153 the Empress's son, Henry FitzEmpress, invaded England and built an alliance of powerful regional barons to support his claim for the throne. The two armies met at Wallingford, but neither side's barons were keen to fight another pitched battle. Stephen began to examine a negotiated peace, a process hastened by the sudden death of Eustace. Later in the year Stephen and Henry agreed to the Treaty of Winchester, in which Stephen recognised Henry as his heir in exchange for peace, passing over William, Stephen's second son. Stephen died the following year. Modern historians have extensively debated the extent to which Stephen's personality, external events, or the <b>weaknesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Norman state contributed to this prolonged period of civil war.|$|E
5|$|This {{explains}} {{the most natural}} plans for both sides. White will try a minority attack on the queenside, {{in order to increase}} its space advantage and to create some <b>weaknesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> black pawns (e.g. an isolated pawn or a backward pawn). So White will try to use the advances b2–b4 or c4–c5 in good conditions, supported by the queen and the rooks on the c-file and the d-file. On the other hand, Black will try to keep the position closed, most importantly by keeping the c4-pawn where it is {{in order to keep the}} Bf1 at bay. This can be achieved by moves like b7–b6 and d7–d6, and sometimes the manoeuvre Ne5–d7–f8–e6. The first move by Black has to be 10...d6! because otherwise White plays 11.c5! and gets a clear advantage immediately. For example 10...b6? loses a pawn to 11.Qd5 Nc6 12.Bxc7, and 10...0-0?! is bad because of 11.c5! Qxc5? 12.Rc1 Qe7 13.Rxc7 and White is winning already.|$|E

5|$|After the Russian {{victory against}} Sweden in 1743, the Swedes {{established}} {{a commission to}} identify <b>weaknesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern defenses. In 1747, the commission concluded that the fortifications in southeastern Finland needed to be improved and expanded, and that Sweden needed to build a strong coastal navy. Augustin Ehrensvärd (1710–72), an artillery officer, was {{the driving force behind}} these changes. The committee based many of its conclusions and decisions on his ideas. In 1756, Sweden established the archipelago fleet with the official name arméns flotta ("fleet of the army") under the command of the army department, Krigskollegium, with Ehrensvärd as supreme commander. For two decades, the struggle for power between the Hats and the Caps, the dominant political factions at the time, and rivalries between army and navy brought about changes to the archipelago fleet. The parliamentary victory of the Hats in the Riksdag in 1769–70 and the coup d'ètat by King Gustav III in 1772 secured the archipelago fleet's status as an independent branch of the army. Starting in 1770, the archipelago fleet merged with the Finnish Squadron (Finska eskadern) based at Sveaborg. In 1777, it incorporated the Swedish Squadron (Svenska eskadern), the galley fleet based at Stockholm. The Swedish armed forces invested considerable resources in the new army branch and made it a professional, independent organization. The archipelago fleet attracted members of the social and cultural elite who enjoyed the protection and patronage of King Gustav III, who had established himself as an absolute monarch in the 1772 coup.|$|E

Over two decades the archipelago fleet went through several changes caused by the competition between the Hats and the Caps, the dominant political fractions at the time, and because of rivalries between army and navy. With the parliamentary victory of the Hats in the riksdag of 1769–70 and the coup d'état by Gustav III in 1772, the archipelago fleet's status as an independent organization within the army was secured. From 1770, it was given the Finnish squadron (Finska eskadern) based in Sveaborg and in 1777 the galley fleet based in Stockholm was included in the archipelago fleet as the Swedish squadron (Svenska eskadern).
