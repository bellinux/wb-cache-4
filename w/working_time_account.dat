40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{institute}} of "working time account". <b>Working</b> <b>time</b> <b>account</b> is a flexible tool {{in the field of}} employment of labor. It is a kind of working time layout, which allows the employees to be assigned work in a certain period to the extent that will meet the needs of employers. Employees are simultaneously paid permanent or flat wage. In this kind of layout, the employee is not legally entitled to the assignment of work within the extent of the weekly working time. The first part of the thesis explains the basic concepts of working time and <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>account,</b> including their regulation in the Labour Code. Furthermore, this section {{deals with the}} use of flexible forms of work in the Czech and Slovak Republics. It was found that in both countries, in comparison with other European countries, flexible forms of work, including the working time accounts, are not as popular. In the Czech Republic, it is only used by 38 % of companies, mainly by the ones with over 50 employees. It is used most often in a situation where the employer wishes to retain qualified personnel, but doesn´t have work for them temporarily. The second part analyzes the use of working time accounts in terms of company XY. It was found that the employees are not particularly satisfied with the length of the balancing period and don´t like working in the <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>account.</b> This work confirmed that the main disadvantage of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>account</b> is associated with increased administration of working hours and wages records. An advantage for the employer is the ability to adapt working hours to the need of work. For employees, it is job security and constant wage...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} debate {{surrounding}} the move towards a more flexible working world and the employment-promoting reduction of overtime, <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> are often cited as an instrument that can link the two aims together. Although this instrument has become quite widespread in the meantime and will in all probability spread even further, <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> {{are by no means}} used in all firms. So far there is little empirical or theoretical knowledge about the determinants or consequences of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts.</b> In order to close this gap partially, this paper is to attempt to determine the company determinants of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts.</b> For this, after a short introduction, brief theoretical considerations are made about when <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> could be advantageous for a firm wishing to minimise costs. These theoretical considerations are then checked empirically with the aid of the IAB establishment panel. It is shown that the probability of using <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> is particularly high in large enterprises which have intensive human capital and are included in the system of industrial relations.

3000|$|... 13 This {{argument}} {{is in line}} with the finding that firms using <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> have in general more persistent levels of employment, but there has been no additional effect of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> on the extent of labor hoarding during the economic crisis (Bohachova et al., [2011]).|$|R
3000|$|Working <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> act as (quasi-)automatic stabilizers. If {{employees}} work fewer hours {{than their}} contractual obligation, <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> {{ensure that this}} debt will be balanced later. In these cases, firms give a credit to their employees (the full salary), and they receive compensation once demand improves (in the form of labor). Working <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> thus help companies to smooth employment levels and adjust working hours over the business cycle. Hence, {{they may have been}} an alternative to the use of short-time work in the adjustment process at the intensive margin. Indeed, about one third of the companies in Germany with more than 20 employees used <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> to maintain employment levels during the crisis (Zapf and Brehmer, [2010]). In 2009, the reduction in working hours that was due to <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> was about half {{of the size of the}} reduction that was due to short-time work (7.0 hours vs. 13.4 hours per employee; Zapf and Brehmer, [2010]). 9 Taking into account deadweight losses that might be associated with the use of both measures, the number of jobs that were saved is about 320, 000 for <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> and roughly 400, 000 for short-time work (Boeri and Brücker, [2011]). A majority of firms that used short-time work also used <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> (51.8 percent), whereas fewer than one in ten firms that used <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> also made use of short-time work (Boeri and Brücker, [2011]). Therefore, companies seem to have used <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> first to adjust at the intensive margin, and when individual accounts were close to zero, they switched their strategy and used the instrument of short-time work. This sequential approach is rational when considering the regulations governing the use of short-time work, and also when taking into account financial considerations. 10 Although firms face particular costs when they use short-time work as demonstrated above, these costs are lower than the costs that firms incur when they use <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts.</b> In the latter case, no compensation is paid by the Federal Employment Agency and firms have to pay the full salary. Therefore, only firms in a sufficiently good financial situation could sustain the use of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> during the crisis. 11 [...]...|$|R

40|$|Germany {{experienced}} an even deeper fall in GDP in the Great Recession than the United States with little employment loss. Employers' reticence to hire {{in the preceding}} expansion - associated in part {{with a lack of}} confidence it would last - contributed to an employment shortfall equivalent to 40 percent of the missing employment decline in the recession. Another 20 percent may be explained by wage moderation. A third important element was the widespread adoption of working time accounts, which permit employers to avoid overtime pay if hours per worker average to standard hours over a window. We find that this provided disincentives for employers to lay off workers in the downturn.

Based on the representative German Establishment Panel of the Institute for Employment Research during the period 2008 - 2013, effects on productivity, wages, sales, firm size, investments, further training, labor mobility, working hours, operating surplus and profits as performance indicators are estimated. Heterogeneity and robustness are investigated by a subgroup analysis where we distinguished between establishments with a high and a low share of qualified workers, between firms with strong and weak sales fluctuations. Additionally, different lengths of the agreed compensation period and reasons for longer time out periods of the employees are considered. Unobserved firm effects as well as interdependencies between important performance indicators and <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts</b> are analyzed.

40|$|This paper aims to {{describe}} and analyse the use of flexibility clauses instead of overtime to adapt work time to demand in the automotive industry in continental Europe. Flexibility to adapt to demand has become critical in the automobile manufacturing industry. Variability {{of the number of}} hours worked by existing staff is an indispensable component of manufacturing flexibility. Outside continental Europe, work time flexibility is obtains basically by using overtime. In continental Europe, the desire of governments and unions to maintain staff, and even to distribute the work more, strongly limits the possible accumulation of work time by the same workers. Due to the global nature of the automotive industry, this disadvantage has to be compensated. This has been achieved by the simultaneous used of several flexibility clauses, particularly average <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounted</b> and <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>accounts.</b> These clauses are designed to respect and even favour the interest of workers. National collective agreements of two outstanding cases, Volkswagen in Germany and Renault in France are analysed. Numerical internal variability generated by the combination of clauses is calculated. Equal or greater flexibility is seen than with the use of overtime, considering intervals of one or several years, depending on the case. It is concluded that the flexibility clauses are effective substitutes for overtime...|$|R

Measures of flexibility that assume a probability distribution of future demand are not really measuring flexibility, but rather risk.
