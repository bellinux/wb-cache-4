5|$|As {{the crowd}} began {{making their way}} home from Ninian Park, the news began to filter slowly out. Some Scottish fans had elected to remain in Cardiff and were celebrating the {{achievement}} of guaranteeing the play-off spot when they saw and heard <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Others had boarded trains or were in cars heading home – many fans didn't hear the news until they eventually got home the following day.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano's {{departure}} enraged the crowd, {{as he did}} {{not explain}} <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> and the people feared a betrayal.

The people finally settled down and dispersed when Saavedra intervened {{to say that the}} claims of the Infernal Legion were supported by the military.|$|E
5|$|Burnham's {{youngest}} son, Bruce B. Burnham (1897 – October 3, 1905), {{was staying}} with his parents in London when he accidentally drowned in the River Thames.

The next morning, a cable arrived with the news of Bruce's death.|$|E
5|$|Incorrect {{unloading}} sequences and ballasting {{which resulted}} in the buoyancy of the hull becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations. Total was held largely to blame for this. However, given that all the personnel involved in the unloading had died in the explosion, it was difficult to be certain as to <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E

He denies this and tells her that he is in love with her, but she insists that her actions were not personal.|$|E
5|$|The {{recruitment}} of Rookwood, Tresham and Digby {{coincided with a}} series of meetings in various taverns across London, during which the last remaining details were worked out. Fawkes would light the fuse, and escape by boat across the Thames. An uprising would start in the Midlands, during which Princess Elizabeth was to be captured. Fawkes would escape to the continent and explain to the Catholic powers <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> in England.|$|E
5|$|With {{the start}} of {{military}} operations in Croatia, Croats {{and a number of}} Serbian conscripts started to desert the JNA en masse, similar to <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> in Slovenia.

5|$|After {{the battle}} on the {{southern}} side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, could see nothing to tell them <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn.|$|E
5|$|After the incident, {{the event}} was halted for 15 minutes, until Vince McMahon and other WWF Corporate {{officials}} {{made the decision to}} continue the event. Hart's coworkers, professional wrestlers, and other miscellaneous workers, appeared somber after Hart's fall as they continued to do their jobs. An hour after the event restarted, Ross informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had {{died at the age of}} 34 at a nearby hospital. The fans in attendance were not told any information about <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to Hart, and they did not hear the announcement of his death.|$|E

5|$|In {{his final}} months, {{he sold his}} home in Poway, California, moving to Pasadena. Though he often stayed with friends, some of his {{longtime}} friends felt that he died in seclusion, embarrassed by <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> with his life. In November 1990, Wiggins was hospitalized with pneumonia and tuberculosis at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. After lapsing {{in and out of}} consciousness for a month, he died at the hospital on January 6, 1991.|$|E
5|$|Josh Grier, Wilco's lawyer, {{was able}} to {{negotiate}} a buy-out of the band from Reprise. The band would keep {{the rights to the}} album if they paid Reprise $50,000. Before Wilco could accept the deal, Reprise called the band and changed their offer to give the band the rights to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot for free. Despite Reprise's efforts to accommodate Wilco's departure, the process marred public relations after an article in the Chicago Tribune described <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 2012, the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, {{resulting in the}} deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> became politically controversial in the U.S. On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.|$|E

25|$|The {{medical history}} is a {{longitudinal}} record of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to the patient since birth. It chronicles diseases, major and minor illnesses, as well as growth landmarks. It gives the clinician a feel for <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> before to the patient.

50|$|At {{the same}} time, Servilia gleefully reveals to Atia and Octavian <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> at the Senate, and {{promises}} Atia {{that she will}} hurt her as slowly and painfully as Atia had done to Servilia, then allows them to depart. Atia is dumbfounded by <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened,</b> but Octavian coldly glares at Servilia, contemplating {{what is to be}} done next.|$|R
5|$|The next day, {{peaceful}} protests {{continued in}} front of the Consulate of Sri Lanka on the sidewalk of Spadina Avenue and at Queen's Park simultaneously. York Regional Police, Peel Regional Police, the OPP and the RCMP continued to help Toronto Police Service to prevent civil diobedience as <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> the previous night.

5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so {{did not know what}} they were talking about.|$|E
5|$|A second {{mandatory}} {{roll call}} {{took place in}} the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> during the day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.|$|E

Since Dulcitius is sleeping, the soldiers go to tell Diocletian <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened.</b> The enraged emperor orders Count Sisinnius to punish the sisters.|$|R
