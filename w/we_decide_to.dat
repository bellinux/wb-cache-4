One of the challenges that I posed to the production team was ... if we decided to play something different, if we decided to extend a part, whatever <b>we</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> do, I want the artwork to change with the performance. So it needs to be malleable ... It's as much a piece of art as the music is, so we want it to be compelling and fit with the overall kind of aesthetic of what the band is up to right at this moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dylan {{began to}} write a fresh string of songs {{during the winter of}} 1996 at his farm in Minnesota, which would later make up Time Out of Mind. Criteria Studio in Miami, Florida, was booked for recording. In a {{televised}} interview with Charlie Rose, Lanois recalled Dylan talking about spending a lot of late nights working on this chapter of work. Once the words were completed, according to Lanois, Dylan considered the record to be finished saying, [...] "You know, whatever <b>we</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> do with it, that's that." [...] Lanois replied: [...] "What's important is that it's written." ...|$|E
2500|$|Here’s an example: Suppose we {{see before}} us {{a parking lot}} full of {{hundreds}} of cars. <b>We</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> go around the entire lot looking for: “Cars with flat (bad) tires”. After {{an hour or so}} we have found two “cars with bad tires.” We can now say with certainty that “Some cars have bad tires”. Or we could say: “It’s not true that ‘All the cars have good tires’”. Or: “It is true that: ‘not all the cars have good tires”. Let us go to another lot. Here we discover that “All the cars have good tires.” We might say, “There’s not a single instance of a car having a bad tire.” [...] Thus we see that, if we can say something about each car separately then we can say something about ALL of them collectively.|$|E

"Pete" [...] {{also tells}} host Ponek that the Angels were hired by Cutler {{because of some}} rowdy, anxious on-stage {{incidents}} during the Stones' Oakland and Miami concerts weeks earlier. As security guards, Pete said [...] "we ain't into that security", but that they agreed after the beer offer. He also claimed that, other than being told to [...] "just keep people off the stage", Cutler gave the Hells Angels very little specific instructions for stage security: [...] "They didn't say nothing to us about any of that." [...] And although the Angels are not security guards, [...] "If we say we're going to do something, we do it. If <b>we</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> do it, it's done. No matter what, how far {{we have to go}} to do it." [...] The similar lack of detailed security instructions by the concert's management was also mentioned by Barger during his telephone call-in.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{his attack}} is {{directed}} against the common conception of rationality, which he believes is badly flawed. First, he argues that reasons don't cause you to do anything, because having sufficient reason wills (but doesn't force) {{you to do that}} thing. So in any decision situation we experience a gap between our reasons and our actions. For example, when <b>we</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> vote, we do not simply determine that we care most about economic policy and that we prefer candidate Jones's economic policy. We also have to make an effort to cast our vote. Similarly, every time a guilty smoker lights a cigarette they are aware of succumbing to their craving, not merely of acting automatically as they do when they exhale. It is this gap that makes us think we have freedom of the will. Searle thinks whether we really have free will or not is an open question, but considers its absence highly unappealing because it makes the feeling of freedom of will an epiphenomenon, which is highly unlikely from the evolutionary point of view given its biological cost. He also says: [...] " [...] All rational activity presupposes free will [...] ".|$|E
