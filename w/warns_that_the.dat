5|$|Maester Aemon summons Jon and {{explains}} {{to him the}} reason why members of the Night's Watch do not marry: it would force them to choose between their duty to the order or loyalty to their loved ones. Aemon knows this very well because he is actually Aemon Targaryen, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen's uncle and Daenerys's great-uncle, who dutifully and reluctantly stayed at the Wall while his family members were killed or exiled when the Targaryens were overthrown.

500|$|While conceding the impressionistic feel of The Oceanides, Nils-Eric Ringbom <b>warns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{comparison}} with Debussy {{should not be}} taken too far. Whereas in Debussy's works [...] "there is seldom anything that grows thematically or undergoes development" [...] (instead, Debussy marvels the listener with [...] "his mastery in rendering dreamy, passive moods and fleeting, restrained emotions"), Sibelius places [...] "too much weight on the logical development of his musical ideas to let... them flicker out in the empty nothingness of thematic instability"; in other words, he insists that [...] "atmospheric background swallow neither action nor structure".

[...] Among left-leaning academics, criticism focuses on Satin's theoretical underpinnings. [...] Political scientist Michael Cummings takes issue {{with the idea that}} consciousness is ultimately determining. [...] Science-and-society professor David Hess rejects the idea that economic class analysis should give way to psychocultural class analysis. [...] A lengthy, systemic critique of New Age Politics, by communication studies professor Dana L. Cloud, accuses it of employing a [...] "therapeutic rhetoric generated to console activists after the failure of post-1968 revolutionary movements and to legitimate participation in liberal politics".|$|E

500|$|This {{story is}} about a king who wants to keep all magic to himself. To do this he needs to solve two problems: he must capture and imprison all of the sorcerers in the kingdom {{and he has to}} learn magic. He creates a [...] "Brigade of Witch Hunters" [...] and calls for an {{instructor}} in magic. Only a [...] "cunning charlatan" [...] with no magical ability responds. The charlatan proves himself with a few simple tricks and begins to ask for jewellery and money to continue teaching. However, Babbitty, the king's washerwoman, laughs at the king one day as he attempts to do magic with an ordinary twig. This causes the king to demand the charlatan join him in a public demonstration of magic and <b>warns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> charlatan will be beheaded if anyone laughs. The charlatan later witnesses Babbitty performing magic in her house. He threatens to expose her if she does not assist him. She agrees to hide and help the demonstration.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Blonsky is {{revealed}} {{to have survived}} the earlier battle at Culver University and has completely healed. He joins Ross' forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed and Banner, along with Betty, are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. Sterns <b>warns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> combination of the super-soldier formula and Banner's blood may cause him to become an [...] "abomination", but Blonsky insists. The experiment mutates Blonsky into a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk, but drives him mad. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well. Blonsky then rampages through Harlem. Realizing that the Hulk {{is the only one}} who can stop Blonsky, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky. After having a small, peaceful moment with Betty, the Hulk flees from New York.|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network's reviewers found much {{to enjoy}} {{about the first}} series, {{although}} Theron Martin <b>warns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first DVD should be [...] "watched in small doses, as trying to tackle {{too much of it}} in one sitting will elevate the suicide rate of your brain cells". Carl Kimlinger comments that [...] "from the moment the words 'School Rumble' come spinning onto the screen, you know you're in for ... undiluted good times", and that the title is [...] "two of the greatest animation non-sequiturs you're likely to see anytime soon". Carlo Santos praises volume six's bizarre comedy, but laments its romantic elements as being too generic. Overall, his rating is mediocre, saying that [...] "although this disc technically marks the end of [...] School Rumble, it's really more of a pause, seeing as how the last few episodes simply ride along with the plot rather than try to reach a dramatic finish". Reviewers from Mania.com followed this pattern; Dani Moure was skeptical of the series' long-term entertainment value, but like fellow reviewer Danielle Van Gorder, found his early indifference fading as the story develops. IGN's Jeff Harris, N.S. Davidson, and David F. Smith gave mostly positive reviews, although Davidson believes the audio and extras had begun to wane by volume five. Jakub Lhota of Reanimated rated the first season an 8/10, stating that he enjoyed it more than some other anime series he had previously watched, and the style—if not always the color—of Funimation's metallic locker artbox for School Rumbles English translation of the first season was welcomed.|$|E

500|$|Season 4 {{begins in}} an {{alternate}} timeline, {{one in which}} September had failed to save the alternate version of Peter in 1985, according to the Observers. This creates a butterfly effect influencing the main characters' pasts but otherwise stabilizing both universes due {{to the creation of}} the bridge. Peter is pulled into this new timeline due to the actions of the alternate timeline's Fringe team, which includes Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel). Peter initially works to return to his own timeline, fueled by fears that his memories are altering Cortexiphan-dosed Olivia's of this timeline, but after encountering a wounded September, Peter comes to learn that this timeline is truly his home, and both he and Olivia come to accept the change, rekindling their affair. September also reveals to Peter that the Observers needed to erase Peter's son, Henry, to assure their future will be created, though noting that Peter's future child with Olivia will be important. Meanwhile, in the present, William Bell has instructed David Robert Jones, alive in this timeline, to work with the parallel universe's version of Nina Sharp to synchronize the two universes, aiming to collapse them both and pave the way for a third universe under Bell's control, using Olivia's Cortexiphan powers to enable the collapse. The Fringe division is forced to close the dimensional bridge, but this fails to stop Bell's plan. Walter is left with one choice, to shoot and kill Olivia, her death disrupting the process and saving the world. Olivia's [...] "death" [...] is only temporary, as the Cortexiphan in her body is consumed to repair the bullet wound, leaving her alive and healthy but lacking her psionic abilities. As Olivia and Peter begin their lives together, September appears to Walter and <b>warns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Observers [...] "are coming".|$|E
500|$|The {{two pairs}} come from {{different}} planets {{within the same}} system. [...] It is explained that the barrel contains Felicium, a medicine for a plague which is ravaging the planet Ornara. Felicium is produced on the planet Brekka, but the Ornarans are the only race in the system with the means of space travel; however, the two remaining Ornaran ships were all built long ago and are beginning to fail due to overuse and lack of maintenance – and the Ornarans no longer know how to repair them. [...] Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) offers to return them each to Ornara and provide replacement parts for the remaining freighters. The Brekkans, Sobi and Langor, argue that they retain ownership of the Felicium, as the items the Ornarans offered in payment were lost on board the freighter. T'Jon and Romas, of Ornara, are suffering {{from the effects of}} the plague, and are sent to sickbay where Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) can find no reason for their symptoms. [...] In a gesture of goodwill following the demand of compassion from Crusher, the Brekkans offer two doses of Felicium for T'Jon and Romas' immediate needs. Langor explains that the entire Brekkan economy and industry is devoted to producing the medicine for Ornara, whose inhabitants provide Brekka with the necessities of daily life in return. After T'Jon and Romas take their doses, Dr. Crusher realizes that Felicium is actually a highly addictive narcotic, and the plague itself was cured long ago, so the symptoms believed to be attributed to the plague were actually withdrawal symptoms. [...] Crusher wants to offer assistance to aid the Ornarans in breaking free of their addiction, but Picard <b>warns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Federation cannot intervene due to the Prime Directive. He and Dr. Crusher later question the Brekkans alone and confirm that the Brekkans know the truth regarding the plague being eradicated, and the addictive nature of the medicine, and are knowingly exploiting the Ornarans because of the clear implication that Brekka's economy would collapse if the Ornarans no longer needed Felicium.|$|E
