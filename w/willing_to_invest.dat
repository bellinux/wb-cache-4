5|$|In April 2006, Ofotbanen {{declared}} {{that they were}} in severe financial difficulties. Accounts payable were giving liquidity problems, and Ofotbanen announced that they needed more capital, estimated at NOK 8 million. GB Group said they were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> more money in the railway company. Ofotbanen had then been losing money continually since the start-up in 2001; in 2004, it had a deficit of NOK 4 million of a NOK 20 million revenue. At the extraordinary general meeting on 4 September 2006, the company was sold for NOK 1 million to Rail Management, a holding company for the London-based shipping owner Mons Bolin. In November, the Norwegian Rail Inspectorate threatened to withdraw the company's safety license, since they had failed to show proper maintenance of the rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{suggestion}} {{by his friend}} and mentor Pedro de Córdoba, Las Casas petitioned a land grant {{to be allowed to}} establish a settlement in northern Venezuela at Cumaná. Founded in 1515, there was already a small Franciscan monastery in Spain, Cumana Mexico, and a Dominican one at Chiribichi, but the monks there were being harassed by Spaniards operating slave raids from the nearby Island of Cubagua. In order to make the proposal palatable to the King, Las Casas had to incorporate the prospect of profits for the royal treasury. He suggested fortifying the northern coast of Venezuela, establishing ten royal forts to protect the Indians and starting up a system of trade in gold and pearls. All the Indian slaves of the New World should be brought to live in these towns and become tribute paying subjects to the King. In order to secure the grant Las Casas had to go through a long fight in court against Bishop Fonseca and his supporters Gonzalo de Oviedo and Bishop Quevedo of Tierra Firme. Las Casas's supporters were Diego Columbus and the new chancellor Gattinara. Las Casas's enemies slandered him to the King, accusing him of planning to escape with the money to Genoa or Rome. In 1520 Las Casas's concession was finally granted, but it was a much smaller grant than he had initially proposed; he was also denied the possibilities of extracting gold and pearls, which made it difficult for him to find investors for the venture. Las Casas committed himself to producing 15,000 ducats of annual revenue, increasing to 60,000 after ten years, and to erecting three Christian towns of at least 40 settlers each. Some privileges were also granted to the initial 50 shareholders in Las Casas's scheme. The King also promised not to give any encomienda grants in Las Casas's area. That said, finding fifty men <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> 200 ducats each and three years of unpaid work proved impossible for Las Casas. In the end, he ended up leaving in November 1520 with just a small group of peasants, paying for the venture with money borrowed from his brother in-law.|$|E

40|$|The goal of Education for All (EFA) is in jeopardy, and {{the cause}} is widely {{perceived}} to be a lack of political will. But we lack an accurate definition of political will. In this article, I offer a definition that determines beforehand whether a government will have political <b>will.</b> In contrast <b>to</b> current academic work and popular discourse, which looks for political will in democratic institutions or the commitment of leaders, I argue that a government has the political <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in primary education if doing so helps it to stay in power. The article demonstrates that providing primary education helps a government stay in power in two specific circumstances. The first is when the government needs {{the support of the}} poor, which only occurs when the poor have help organising from a 'political entrepreneur'. The second is when employers need large numbers of skilled workers. In these two circumstances, the government will have the political <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in primary education. This formula is successful in predicting government commitments to primary education over a half-century or more in three very different developing countries: Taiwan, Ghana, and Brazil. In each, the article presents evidence that periods of commitment to primary education are the result either of successful political entrepreneurship of the poor or of employer conditions. The results suggest a new direction for EFA that is more challenging but potentially more successful: directing resources toward those countries whose governments currently have political will, and encouraging it in those that do not...|$|R

Following the completion of his previous film, River of No Return, Preminger had paid 20th Century Fox $150,000 to cancel the remainder of his contract, so he was surprised when Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck contacted him and offered to finance the film while allowing him to operate as a fully independent filmmaker. In December 1953, he accepted $750,000 and began what became a prolonged preproduction period. He hired cinematographer Sam Leavitt as director of photography, Herschel Burke Gilbert as musical director, and Herbert Ross as choreographer and began to scout locations.|$|E
25|$|From a more {{academic}} {{point of}} view, Barak Libai, Eitan Muller and Renana Peres constructed a {{research in the}} subject which is {{among the first to}} shed light on the actual value created by word of mouth programs and explore issues such as how targeting opinion leaders creates more value than targeting random customers. In seeding programs, word-of-mouth can gain customers who would not otherwise have bought the product, this is called expansion. However, word-of-mouth can also accelerate the purchase process of customers who would have purchased anyway, the faster the adoption, the greater the profits. These processes of expansion and acceleration integrate to create social value in a word-of-mouth seeding program for a new product. Furthermore, when deciding upon an optimal seeding program, the researchers conclude that “Influencer Seeding Programs” yield higher customer equity than “random Seeding Programs”. Of course, the decision about which program type to adopt depends on how much the company is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in discovering their influencers.|$|E
