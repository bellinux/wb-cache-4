In all cases the CAA/EASA retains {{responsibility}} for safety regulation, but representative bodies, particularly of sectors {{that are not}} included in the scope of EASA, are granted greater oversight of their activities. The majority of microlight aircraft are regulated by the British Microlight Aircraft Association (BMAA), although a significant number are regulated by the Light Aircraft Association (LAA), formerly known as the Popular Flying Association. The LAA is the primary regulator for amateur built aircraft, as well as vintage and classic aircraft. Parachuting is governed by the British Parachute Association, although the aircraft used in this activity are generally CAA-regulated. Balloon and airship flying is overseen by the British Balloon and Airship Club. The UK-specific National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) is administered by the National Pilots Licensing Group Ltd., supported by the LAA, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association UK, the British Gliding Association, and the British Microlight Aircraft Association. Separate from these devolved groups, gliding in the UK is self-regulated. The British Gliding Association was until recently responsible for glider airworthiness, now formally regulated as a result of EASA legislation, and still retains control of pilot certification. Hang gliding and paragliding activities (i.e. foot-launched gliders) are governed by the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association.|$|E

25|$|<b>Within</b> <b>this</b> <b>framework,</b> {{the goal}} of {{linguistics}} is to identify all of the principles and parameters that are universal to human language (called Universal Grammar). As such, any attempt to explain the syntax of a particular language using a principle or parameter is cross-examined with the evidence available in other languages. This leads to continual refinement of the theoretical machinery of generative linguistics {{in an attempt to}} account for as much syntactic variation in human language as possible.|$|E
25|$|A {{major force}} behind {{intuitionism}} was L.E.J. Brouwer, who rejected {{the usefulness of}} formalized logic of any sort for mathematics. His student Arend Heyting postulated an intuitionistic logic, different from the classical Aristotelian logic; this logic does not contain {{the law of the}} excluded middle and therefore frowns upon proofs by contradiction. The axiom of choice is also rejected in most intuitionistic set theories, though in some versions it is accepted. Important work was later done by Errett Bishop, who managed to prove versions of the most important theorems in real analysis <b>within</b> <b>this</b> <b>framework.</b>|$|E
25|$|Principles and {{parameters}} is {{a framework}} within generative linguistics {{in which the}} syntax of a natural language is described in accordance with general principles (i.e. abstract rules or grammars) and specific parameters (i.e. markers, switches) that for particular languages are either turned on or off. For example, the position of heads in phrases is determined by a parameter. Whether a language is head-initial or head-final {{is regarded as a}} parameter which is either on or off for particular languages (i.e. English is head-initial, whereas Japanese is head-final). Principles and parameters was largely formulated by the linguists Noam Chomsky and Howard Lasnik. Many linguists have worked <b>within</b> <b>this</b> <b>framework,</b> and {{for a period of time}} it was considered the dominant form of mainstream generative linguistics.|$|E

25|$|Psychophysical {{experiments}} {{suggest that}} information is encoded in VSTM across multiple parallel channels, each channel associated with a particular perceptual attribute (Magnussen, 2000). <b>Within</b> <b>this</b> <b>framework,</b> a decrease in an observer's ability to detect a change with increasing set-size {{can be attributed to}} two different processes: (1) if decisions are made across different channels, decreases in performance are typically small, and consistent with decreases expected when making multiple independent decisions (Greenlee & Thomas, 1993; Vincent & Regan, 1995); (2) if multiple decisions are made within the same channel, the decrease in performance is much greater than expected on the basis of increased decision-noise alone, and is attributed to interference caused by multiple decisions within the same perceptual channel (Magnussen & Greenlee, 1997).|$|E
25|$|However, {{what really}} put Latin American {{literature}} on the global map was no doubt the literary boom of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as Julio Cortázar's Rayuela (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was Gabriel García Márquez's Cien años de soledad (1967), {{which led to the}} association of Latin American literature with magic realism, though other important writers of the period such as the Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes do not fit so easily <b>within</b> <b>this</b> <b>framework.</b> Arguably, the Boom's culmination was Augusto Roa Bastos's monumental Yo, el supremo (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as Juan Rulfo, Alejo Carpentier, and above all Jorge Luis Borges were also rediscovered.|$|E
25|$|As a {{contract}} B director at Nikkatsu, Suzuki's films were made following a rigid structure. He {{was assigned a}} film and script, and could only refuse it {{at the risk of}} losing his job. He claims to have turned down only 2 or 3 scripts in his time with Nikkatsu but always modified the scripts both in preproduction and during shooting. Nikkatsu also assigned an actor for the lead, or leads, either a (usually 2nd-tier) star or one being groomed for stardom. The rest of the cast was not assigned but typically drawn from the studio's pool of contract actors. Most studio A films had a set budget of ¥45 million where Suzuki's black-and-white Bs ran 20 million and his colour films were provided an additional 3 million. His films were scheduled 10 days for pre-production, such as location scouting, set design and costumes, 25 days for shooting and 3 days for post-production, such as editing and dubbing. <b>Within</b> <b>this</b> <b>framework</b> he had a greater degree of control than the A directors as the cheaper B productions drew a less watchful eye from the head office.|$|E

500|$|In 1961 the Beatles {{recorded}} [...] "Cry for a Shadow", a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who {{is credited}} with composing the song's lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English {{groups such as the}} Shadows. The musicologist Walter Everett noted that while early Beatles compositions typically held close to the conventional patterns in rock music at the time, he also identified significant variations in their rhythm and tonal direction. Harrison's liberal use of the diatonic scale in his guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly, and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly feel in the style of Perkins. <b>Within</b> <b>this</b> <b>framework</b> he often used syncopation, as during his guitar solos for the Beatles' covers of Berry's [...] "Roll Over Beethoven" [...] and [...] "Too Much Monkey Business". Another of Harrison's musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves, as on [...] "I'll Be on My Way". He {{was the first person to}} own a Rickenbacker 360/12, a guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart; the higher four being pairs tuned in unison. The Rickenbacker is unique among twelve-string guitars in having the lower octave string of each of the first four pairs placed above the higher tuned string. This, and the naturally rich harmonics produced by a twelve-string guitar provided the distinctive overtones found on many of the Beatles' recordings. His use of this guitar during the recording of A Hard Day's Night helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that Melody Maker termed it the Beatles' [...] "secret weapon".|$|E
