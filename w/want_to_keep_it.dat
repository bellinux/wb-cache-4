25|$|In 1984, Edwards was {{assigned}} to a medical malpractice lawsuit that had been perceived to be unwinnable; the firm had accepted it only {{as a favor to}} an attorney and state senator who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it.</b> Nevertheless, Edwards won a $3.7 million verdict on behalf of his client, who had suffered permanent brain and nerve damage after a doctor prescribed an overdose of the anti-alcoholism drug Antabuse during alcohol aversion therapy. In other cases, Edwards sued the American Red Cross three times, alleging transmission of AIDS through tainted blood products, resulting in a confidential settlement each time, and defended a North Carolina newspaper against a libel charge.|$|E
500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and I have a good relationship, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E
500|$|When Alan McGee, Creation's {{publicist}} Johnny Hopkins, {{and marketing}} executive Emma Greengrass first heard Be Here Now at Noel Gallagher's house, each had their doubts about its artistic value, but kept their doubts to themselves. One Creation employee recalled [...] "{{a lot of}} nodding of heads, a lot of slapping of backs." [...] McGee later admitted to having strong misgivings at first: [...] "I heard it {{in the studio and}} I remember saying 'We'll only sell seven million copies'... I thought it was too confrontational." [...] However, {{in an interview with the}} music press a few days later he predicted the album would sell twenty million copies. McGee's hyperbole alarmed both Oasis and their management company Ignition, and both immediately excluded him from involvement in the release campaign. Ignition's strategy from that point on centred on an effort to suppress all publicity, and withheld access to both music and information from anybody not directly involved with the album's release. Fearful of the dangers of over-hype and bootlegging, their aim was to present the record as a [...] "regular, everyday collection of tunes." [...] To this end they planned a modest marketing budget, to be spent on subdued promotional activities such as street posters and music press adverts, while avoiding mainstream instruments such as billboard and TV advertising. According to Greengrass [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> low key. We want to keep control of the whole mad thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 2007, Bachmann {{joined a}} Congressional {{delegation}} visiting Ireland, Germany, Pakistan, Kuwait, and Iraq. Bachmann met briefly (due to security concerns) with U.S. {{personnel in the}} Green Zone and upon her return she said she [...] "was encouraged by reports of progress from Crocker, Gen. David Petraeus and other personnel in Iraq linked to the surge". She said the surge [...] "hasn't {{had a chance to}} be in place long enough to offer a critique of how it's working. (Gen.

2500|$|Psychoanalysts {{today do}} not regard {{cross-dressing}} by {{itself as a}} psychological problem, unless it interferes with a person's life.

2500|$|On July 10, 2013 it was {{announced}} that there would be another remake of Day of the Dead. Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman, two of the producers behind Texas Chainsaw 3D have obtained the rights. Campbell, who had a small role in the first remake said [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> as close to the Romero version as possible. To make sure that his fans are happy.

[...] Campbell and Grobman are currently holding meetings with possible writers to figure out the best way to adapt the story. It began filming in June 2016.|$|E

2500|$|I think [...] {{has stated}} that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, and that's as simple as they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it.</b> They don't {{want to get into}} the nitty-gritty things such as if you bury a Scud missile to hide it from detection, there is a little thing called corrosion. Where do you hide the fuel, how do you make this stuff up, how do you align it. Because when you {{disassemble}} it, there is a process called re-alignment. There is a factory involved in that. And then you have to test launch it to make sure that the alignment works, and that's detectable, and they haven't done that. There is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of whether or not Iraq has a operational weapons of mass destruction capability.|$|E

It had only refused to do so once previously, in 1984. Towards the end of 1998 the Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control initially refused to discharge the community's budget for 1996 over what it saw as the arrogance of the Commission in its refusal to answer questions relating to financial mismanagement. Paul van Buitenen, a whistle-blower working in the Commission, had sent the Parliament a report alleging that widespread fraud and cover ups, stating: [...] "I found strong indications that [...] [...] [...] auditors have been hindered in their investigations and that officials received instructions to obstruct the audit examinations [...] [...] [...] The commission is a closed culture and they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> that way, and my objective is to open it up, to create more transparency and to put power where it belongs – and that's in the democratically-elected European Parliament."
