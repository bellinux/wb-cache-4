500|$|When Missy and I do a record, {{the energy}} is {{on a whole}} other level. I can't explain exactly what it is. It's just the energy, I think. She knows how to really make a party a party. That's what I want – to make this record to be the {{ultimate}} party record. That's pretty much how that all came about. ... I guess each time <b>we</b> <b>work</b> <b>together,</b> we give 100% of our energy to each other. It's crazy. Sometimes you can't explain what the chemistry is. It's just how you feel.|$|E
500|$|Whenever <b>we</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> {{she always}} sits {{with me and}} listens to the song, and says [...] "tell me what this song is about to you." [...] She's very methodical in her thinking. We talk about it, she writes down words that I say {{describing}} what the song's about and the sentiment that I'd like her to get out there, and then she goes away and she works on it. She writes it, she comes back. She does a version of it, we talk about it. It's a back and forth until she gets it right. It's a total collaboration.|$|E

40|$|Jake and I were {{professional}} {{colleagues and}} friends {{for more than}} twenty years, but it was in the last fifteen years that <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> closely <b>together,</b> bridging the supposed divide between political science and international law. Sometimes <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> in the American Society of International Law, other times in the Social Science Research Council (SSRC), or in the Human Dimensions of Global Change program. Most often, <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> as scholars in interdisciplinary research...|$|R

[...] "'Alison Moyet And The Man From,' ...because I wanted Guy in there somewhere. Because like I say this {{felt like a}} band album to me {{as opposed to a}} solo singer album. Because <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> as a band, <b>we</b> didn't <b>work</b> <b>together</b> as a producer-client." ...|$|R
50|$|Even {{though we}} came from two totally {{different}} backgrounds, when <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> it just gelled. When it came to our differences I guess we both kind of compromised {{and came to a}} decision in the middle.|$|R
2500|$|Springer {{was first}} seen with her second calf on June 6, 2017. It was {{estimated}} {{to have been born}} about six months earlier. Said Dr. Lance Barrett-Lennard: [...] "Her rescue, relocation, reunification with relatives and transition to motherhood is an incredible story. I see it as testimony to both the resiliency of killer whales as a species and to the wonderful things we humans can do when <b>we</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> on behalf of — rather than against — nature." ...|$|E
2500|$|We {{value the}} close {{relationship}} with our counterparts in JMSDF as <b>we</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> to address regional issues of vital importance to both countries. [...] The United States Navy and the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force have a unique relationship in that {{we have one of}} the most robust bilateral exercise programs between any two countries. This PASSEX is a chance for our two navies to enhance military-to-military relationships and is designed to improve both naval forces’ capability for coordinated and bilateral operations.|$|E

60|$|The {{stiffness}} {{had gone}} from my brain and fingers. My pen flew over the paper.

Then, with a little sigh of satisfaction, I leaned back in my chair.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone following the first reunion show Only {{was asked about the}} future of the Misfits, and if there were plans to continue and possibly record new music. [...] "I want it to continue. I know Doyle wants it to continue. I know Glenn wants it to continue. We just have to be big-enough people to make it continue. And that's where we're at. Whatever it takes. We're going into our 40th anniversary so the timing couldn't be more perfect. Eventually Doyle's got to write a new album; I've got to write a new album; Glenn's got to write a new album. Why don't <b>we</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> and make the greatest album ever? Now we've got different elements. We've got Doyle playing more of a metal kind of thing. We've got Dave, who we're trying to figure out what the fuck he's doing. And Glenn's got his own thing. And Acey [...] fills in good, too. And I've got the band where it is today. So it's a matter of re-molding and using all the different elements that I've got." [...] When asked if Danzig would want to record new music Only said, [...] "I think it's got to evolve naturally. The thing is we've tried to plan things, and then we stand there and wait, and as it comes we'll just do it. When we go back — I don't know about Glenn — but I canceled our touring and everything for this, so I'm going to go home and write and lift." ...|$|E

60|$|And {{there is}} another thing of the most solemn importance: We English-speaking nations are by chance as it were the ballast of the future.
