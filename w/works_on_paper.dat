Because he {{encouraged}} the edition of his sculpted work, Rodin's sculptures are represented in many public and private collections. The Musée Rodin was founded in 1916 and opened in 1919 at the Hôtel Biron, where Rodin had lived, and it holds the largest Rodin collection, with more than 6,000 sculptures and 7,000 <b>works</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper.</b> The French order Légion d'honneur made him a Commander, and he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.|$|E
5|$|The {{prints and}} {{drawings}} department encompasses <b>works</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper.</b> The {{origins of the}} collection were the 8,600works in the Royal Collection (Cabinet du Roi), which were increased via state appropriation, purchases such as the 1,200works from Fillipo Baldinucci's collection in 1806, and donations. The department opened on 5 August 1797, with 415pieces displayed in the Galerie d'Apollon. The collection is organized into three sections: the core Cabinet du Roi, 14,000royal copper printing-plates, and the donations of Edmond de Rothschild, which include 40,000prints, 3,000drawings, and 5,000illustrated books. The holdings are displayed in the Pavillon de Flore; due to {{the fragility of the}} paper medium, only a portion are displayed at one time.|$|E

5|$|Currently, the {{conservation}} department serves {{the needs of}} the museum through the expertise of specialists in paintings, textiles, <b>works</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper,</b> frames, and objects conservation. The department has grown in both size and staff throughout the years, with the most recent expansion occurring in 2007. As of 2007, the IMA owned one of the few computer-based X-ray units in the United States, continuing a trend in X-ray technology that the department began in the 1970s. In 1980, the department helped organize and establish the Midwest Regional Conservation Guild, which includes conservators and conservation scientists from Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan. In the mid-1980s, the department received attention when head conservator Martin Radecki assisted local authorities in uncovering over two dozen forged T.C. Steele and William Forsythe paintings worth more than $200,000. The high-profile forgery case led Radecki to organize an exhibit in 1989, Is it Genuine? Steele, Forsythe and Forgery in Indiana. The exhibit highlighted conservation techniques and examined how forgeries can be discovered. Another public presentation of conservation took place in 2007 with Sebastiano Mainardi: The Science of Art, a Star Studio exhibit that allowed visitors to watch conservators as they worked on the 16th-century altarpiece. The IMA's Star Studio is an interactive gallery that enables visitors to learn, through the process of art-making and observation, about the museum's collections.|$|E
