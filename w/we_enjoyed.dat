He called for stakeholders in the health sector to collaborate enable the ministry achieve Buhari's health agenda. According to The Nation, Adewole said for the apex policy on health to be achieved, {{we need to work}} together and working together means we can make a huge difference. We have been described as a generation that enjoyed better health when we were young than now and our aim is to bring back the health care system <b>we</b> <b>enjoyed</b> when we were young.|$|E

[...] Culligan admitted that [...] "Confidentially though, <b>we</b> <b>enjoyed</b> Dr. No, and if this be sick, sick, sick, gentlemen, {{make the most of}} it." [...] James Sandoe in his book review for The New York Herald Tribune was very positive about Dr. No and thought that it was [...] "the most artfully bold, dizzyingly poised thriller of the decade.

500|$|Recognizing McKinley's potential, the Democrats, {{whenever}} they controlled the Ohio legislature, sought to gerrymander or redistrict {{him out of}} office. In 1878, McKinley faced election in a redrawn 17th district; he won anyway, causing Hayes to exult, [...] "Oh, the good luck of McKinley! He was gerrymandered out and then beat the gerrymander! <b>We</b> <b>enjoyed</b> {{it as much as}} he did." [...] After the 1882 election, McKinley was unseated on an election contest by a near party-line House vote. Out of office, he was briefly depressed by the setback, but soon vowed to run again. The Democrats again redistricted Stark County for the 1884 election; McKinley was returned to Congress anyway.|$|E

They said [...] "honestly, {{how many times have}} we been through this with these two?" [...] They later branded him [...] "one angry man" [...] during the police corruption storyline. They said he slept with Jade because [...] "too much stewing over work and not enough play makes Brennan a dull boy". TV Week described Mark's departure episode as [...] "edge-of-your-seat." [...] While a reporter for the Daily Record said [...] "Goodbye Brennan - <b>we</b> <b>enjoyed</b> having you and your hunky good looks around, but all good things must come to an end." [...] Nicky Branagh from Studentbeans.com included Mark in her list of the [...] "Top ten hottest Aussie soap guys" [...] and she stated [...] "As Ramsay Street's resident hottie back in 2010, Scott McGregor graced Neighbours as the coolest kind of police investigator (he rode a motorbike).

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Spice Up Your Life" [...] was {{directed}} on 6 September 1997, by Marcus Nispel in a two-day shoot located in New York City. The video features {{the group in}} a futuristic setting, inspired by the 1982 film Blade Runner, and the music video for Janet Jackson's 1989 single Rhythm Nation controlling every aspect of society in a dark futuristic post apocalyptic cityscape. Nispel {{came up with the}} concept based on a sketch that was faxed to him signed [...] "Ginger Spice". He recalls: [...] "I looked at what Disney did to Times Square in NYC and tried to imagine how the Spice Girls would transform it, as their career seemed to have no limits—at the time." [...] The group was not consulted about the concept. According to Brown's autobiography, they wanted a carnival party theme, but were too tired to fight about it with the label, and ended up with a concept linked to the theme of world domination. Brown commented: [...] "It wasn't right. I don't think any of us liked it much, even though <b>we</b> <b>enjoyed</b> making it. I still can't understand what's going on in it half the time." [...] The video exclusively premiered on MTV in September 1997.|$|E
500|$|A {{reporter}} for PopSugar Australia said [...] "We {{love it when}} our favourite, long-running TV soapies surprise us with something new and a little different." [...] Cameron Adams from the Herald Sun included the episode in his feature on the best television programs being broadcast on 22 June, saying [...] "Brooding cop Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) has 30 minutes to leave Erinsborough before the poop goes down with the dodgy police investigation that's been dragging on for months. Girlfriend Kate plans to leave with him, but her sister Sophie's not so keen on a life change." [...] Channel 5 included the episode in their [...] "Top 20 Aussie Soap Moments of 2011" [...] program, where it came second overall. A writer for the channel's website {{believed that it was}} clear from the start that Mark would be worthy of a memorable send-off, during a feature on the character's [...] "best bits".

500|$|Reviews for {{the film}} were {{positive}} {{and focused on the}} novel methods used to attract the audience to the theater. The Moving Picture World stated, [...] "A burlesque picture which becomes more thrilling as it proceeds. The convict is supposed to have escaped and the way he is chased and surrounded bodes no good for him. But somehow he manages to elude the steadily increasing army of pursuers until they are gathered around him, when he calmly shows a motion picture announcement, and the reason for all this melee, in which the whole countryside took part, becomes apparent." [...] The requirement that the fleeing [...] "convict" [...] be continually assisted {{as a part of the}} plot may have been lost on The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer. The reviewer writes, [...] "Perhaps, in real life, things might not happen so luckily for the convict unless the carriage, the boat and the automobile were previously arranged for him. Even then, Fate might conceivably have some disagreeable card up her sleeve. In the film, at any rate, everybody bit nicely. They pursued the escaped convict in increasing crowds until he led them to the theatre he was advertising. There they all obligingly bought tickets to the show and, no doubt, enjoyed it hugely. They did if it was as good as the film is. The least interesting sections of the film are the telephone messages exchanged by agitated police officials; but they set off the livelier adventures of the convict with agreeable contrast." [...] Walton of The Moving Picture News identified the set up and assistance to [...] "the convict" [...] and states,"In spite of the Thanhouser folk joining in the racket and the peculiar readiness of carriage and automobile and boat to help the gentleman in a costume, not used in this state for some two years, the audience did not 'catch on.' When the revelation came, at the door of the New Rochelle picture show, the theatre rang with laughter. We were all 'stung' and <b>we</b> <b>enjoyed</b> it." ...|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "Don’t keep dwelling on this thing, you know?" [...] Mercieca could not be prosecuted for his activities with Foley because the relevant statutes of limitations had expired, and the Palm Beach County state attorney's office [...] "cannot conduct an investigation because Foley has declined to press charges." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1906, {{because of}} Frank's {{literary}} successes and the profitable royalties from the 1902 Wizard of Oz musical, Maud and Frank were wealthy enough to travel around Egypt, Greece, Italy, North Africa, Switzerland, and France on a six-month expedition. During their traveling, Maud saw an Egyptian harem and enthusiastically climbed the Great Pyramid of Giza. A year later, her husband published In Other Lands Than Ours, which he compiled from Maud's letters {{to people at}} home. Published in modest quantity, the book was for friends and family. She asked Frank to edit her work, and he also included a foreword and sixteen photographs {{that he had taken}} of the trip.

When they first moved to Portland, Meloy and Ellis were living in a warehouse where they [...] "had this idea of working on a novel together ... because <b>we</b> <b>enjoyed</b> making up stories and playing off one another's creative impulses." [...] Meloy was influenced by books that he read growing up, including Tolkien, and Lloyd Alexander's The Chronicles of Prydain. Meloy cites Piers Anthony's Xanth novels as a [...] "direct influence", noting the [...] "world within the real world and the implausibility of the whole enterprise". Ellis was influenced by The Chronicles of Narnia series as a child; the illustrations in the seven books of the Narnia series were a direct inspiration on her work. [...] Unlike her previous work, where the text is completed before the illustrations are created, for Wildwood, Ellis collaborated with Meloy throughout the writing process.|$|E
2500|$|A {{summer camp}} was {{established}} in the mountains at Pine Grove Furnace State Park, near a place called Tagg's Run. Students lived in tents and picked berries, hunted and fished.

It wasn't up to our quality standard, and we decided to cancel it. It’s no longer in development. That wasn't an easy decision, but it’s one that won’t surprise many folks given that we hadn't been talking about it. Human Head Studios is no longer working on it. It's a franchise we still believe we can do something with — we just need to see what that something is." [...] Tim Gerritsen, business development director at Human Head Studios, said, [...] "While we are disappointed that we won’t be able to deliver our vision of the game, we remain proud of our work on the franchise, which we feel speaks for itself, including the award-winning presentation of the game at E3 2011. <b>We</b> <b>enjoyed</b> working with the many talented people at Bethesda, and we wish them all the best of luck with any future plans they may have for the franchise." ...|$|E
