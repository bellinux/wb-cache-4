Eight number architectures of three-dimensional orthogonal woven compos-ites have been analyzed.

For the same fiber volume fraction, three-dimensional orthogonal interlock woven composites show a significant increase in through-the-thickness properties without a comparable reduction in the in-plane properties.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that failure of a {{material}} is a locally driven event. In the case of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), significant variations in the microstructure of the composite exist and their significance on both deformation and life response need to be assessed. Examples of these variations include changes in the fiber tow shape, tow shifting/nesting and voids within and between tows. In the present work, the influence of scale specific architectural features of woven ceramic composite are examined stochastically at both the macroscale (<b>woven</b> <b>repeating</b> unit cell (RUC)) and structural scale (idealized using multiple RUCs). The recently developed MultiScale Generalized Method of Cells methodology is used to determine the overall deformation response, proportional elastic limit (first matrix cracking), and failure under tensile loading conditions and associated probability distribution functions. Prior results showed that the most critical architectural parameter to account for is weave void shape and content with other parameters being less in severity. Current results show that statistically only the post-elastic limit region (secondary hardening modulus and ultimate tensile strength) is impacted by local uncertainties both at the macro and structural level...|$|R

40|$|Honeycomb {{woven fabric}} {{is a single}} layer of fabric exhibiting {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) cellular shape on both fabric sides due to the combination of periodic straight yarn floats and partial plain weave. In a fabric <b>weave</b> <b>repeat,</b> the triangle shape of increased yarn floats and crossed diagonal woven lines form two inverted pyramidal spaces on the fabric surfaces and a closed internal space. This particular 3 D architecture is bound to influence the fabric transfer and mechanical properties. This study investigated these properties for honeycomb weaves experimentally, including air resistance, thermal conductivity, water absorption and vapor transmission rate, bending rigidity, compressional energy and tensile behavior. The typical two-dimensional plain woven fabrics with the same yarns and density were set as references and elastic yarns were considered as a factor of effect on the fabric properties. The measurements by the Kawabata Evaluation System and Instron machine show that the honeycomb woven fabric has enhanced air permeability and water absorption, as well as lower thermal conductivity {{compared to that of}} the plain woven fabric. Higher bending rigidity, compressional energy and Young’s modulus are also observed for honeycomb fabrics.

40|$|The tensile, {{ballistic}} and puncture {{impact behavior}} of woven fabric {{have been subject}} of interests for many researchers. The tensile behavior of woven fabric can be analyzed from the experimental and analytical methodologies. While experiment provides accurate information about woven fabric’s mechanical properties than the analytical approach, it also generates sample wastage. Finite element analysis (FEA) method is used to model uniaxial tensile, impact and puncture response of woven fabrics in two and three dimensional geometrical model shapes. Woven fabrics models sizes are based on either unit cell or meso-scale (large scale) approach. Nevertheless, limited publications address woven fabric models in terms of <b>weave</b> <b>repeat</b> sizes. Finite element analysis {{has the ability to}} represent fabric geometrical properties and their symmetries, with weave mesh structures able to be made as close as possible, with minimal assumptions. Other than ballistic impact performance, limited work is done to model tensile performance of aramid based woven fabrics. In addition to that, many publications neglect the weaves structures influences such as float and yam crimp to tensile and puncture impact behavior. Hence, in the study, an alternative simulation procedure was proposed to develop the understanding and prediction of float and yam crimp relationship in uniaxial tensile and puncture impact behavior of isotropic <b>weave</b> <b>repeat</b> unit. Woven fabric geometrical models were developed with TexGen and Abaqus CAD pre-processor module. The study was divided into three critical stages. Initially, FEA models were established on plain 1 / 1, 2 / 2 twill and 8 ends satin. Woven fabrics were configured as a balanced weave thereby allowing systematic investigation o f the effect of uniaxial tensile stress on the weave. Woven fabrics were designed to have equivalent densities 8 yams cm' 1 for all three weaves. Equivalent woven fabric specifications were manufactured and tested. Stress-strain validation between experimental and simulation results were made. Next, puncture impact models were developed based on the validated uniaxial tensile simulation models framework and its selected assumptions. Woven fabric for puncture simulation was expanded to consider larger model size than the previous uniaxial tensile model. Here, puncture model analysis was developed with 7 ends and picks cm with a total of 112 yams in both directions. Similar in uniaxial tensile approach, validation analysis was made between puncture model and experimental stress-strain result. Parameters studies were executed on the validated puncture models. The effects of yam frictions and impactor shapes to puncture models stress-strain, post-impact kinetic energy and damage evolution were analyzed. The stress-strain behavior of woven fabrics was found to be related to woven fabric structures. In uniaxial tensile validation, the presence of float in woven fabrics had contributed to stronger square woven fabrics in both warp and weft directions. The apparent gap was more pronounced in puncture model validation than uniaxial tensile model validation. The parameters studies results had shown that flat impactor shape and tightest yam to yam frictions contributed to highest stress-strain, post-impact kinetic energy and damage evolution results. Both uniaxial tensile strength and puncture impact present analogous non-linearity behavior in stress-strain result, which indicated the crimp interchange and yam extension presence in the analysis...|$|E

Figured silks are often described in terms of their association with the Byzantine Empire, based on representational and textual evidence. 1 The implement necessary to <b>weave</b> sophisticated <b>repeating</b> patterns was the drawloom. 2 These devices were equipped with a figure harness for repetitive production of woven patterns. Although the origin and development of these looms is obscure, they were important labor-saving devices. Patterns tied-up in a figure harness provided a means of recording and storing work for later mechanical reproduction. Without a means to replicate memorized patterns, weaving designs in silk was slow and tedious. From a modern point of view, the capability to store sequences of mechanically recorded work steps means that pattern tie-ups were, in effect, an early form of software (Fig. 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Determination of {{features}} of weave patterns {{is a crucial}} task in practice, including determination of equivalent weave patterns, determination of <b>weave</b> type, <b>repeat</b> period detection, pattern correction, representation of fabric structures and pattern searching from a collection of weave patterns.

By compiling the 32 components with different shapes of yarn cross-sections, it is possible to quickly produce the required weave geometries and weave textures at different levels of detail. A set of frequency matrices of a weave pattern can be considered as the fingerprint where each weave pattern is uniquely endowed with a set of frequency spectra.

40|$|Fabrics {{are unique}} {{materials}} which consist of various properties affecting their performance and end-uses. A computerized fabric property evaluation and analysis method plays {{a crucial role}} not only in textile industry but also in scientific research. An accurate analysis and measurement of fabric property provides a powerful tool for gauging product quality, assuring regulatory compliance and assessing the performance of textile materials. This thesis investigated the solutions for applying computerized methods to evaluate and intelligently interpret the texture and material properties of fabric in an inexpensive and efficient way. Firstly, a method which allows automatic recognition of basic weave pattern and precisely measuring the yarn count is proposed. The yarn crossed-areas are segmented by a spatial domain integral projection approach. Combining fuzzy c-means (FCM) and principal component analysis (PCA) on grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) feature vectors extracted from the segments enables to classify detected segments into two clusters. Based on the analysis on texture orientation features, the yarn crossed-area states are automatically determined. An autocorrelation method is used to find <b>weave</b> <b>repeats</b> and correct detection errors. The method was validated by using computer simulated woven samples and real woven fabric images. The test samples have various yarn counts, appearance, and weave types. All weave patterns of tested fabric samples are successfully recognized and computed yarn counts are consistent to the manual counts. Secondly, we present a methodology for using the high resolution 3 D surface data of fabric samples to measure surface roughness in a nondestructive and accurate way. A parameter FDFFT, which is the fractal dimension estimation from 2 DFFT of 3 D surface scan, is proposed as the indicator of surface roughness. The robustness of FDFFT, which consists of the rotation-invariance and scale-invariance, is validated on a number of computer simulated fractal Brownian images. Secondly, in order to evaluate the usefulness of FDFFT, a novel method of calculating standard roughness parameters from 3 D surface scan is introduced. According to the test results, FDFFT has been demonstrated as a fast and reliable parameter for measuring the fabric roughness from 3 D surface data. We attempt a neural network model using back propagation algorithm and FDFFT for predicting the standard roughness parameters. The proposed neural network model shows good performance experimentally. Finally, an intelligent approach for the interpretation of fabric objective measurements is proposed using supported vector machine (SVM) techniques. The human expert assessments of fabric samples are used during the training phase in order to adjust the general system into an applicable model. Since the target output of the system is clear, the uncertainty which lies in current subjective fabric evaluation does not affect the performance of proposed model. The support vector machine {{is one of the best}} solutions for handling high dimensional data classification. The complexity problem of the fabric property has been optimally dealt with. The generalization ability shown in SVM allows the user to separately implement and design the components. Sufficient cross-validations are performed and demonstrate the performance test of the system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The use of {{composite}} materials is increasing although their behavior under impact fatigue loading remains rather unknown. This {{study is to}} assess the evolution of damage, especially delamination and crater, in a composite Glass/Epoxy <b>woven</b> fabric, using <b>repeated</b> impact tests at low energy levels (< 10 J). Both types of damage that arise and grow within the material cannot be independent from each other. Our objective in this work is to establish the interaction between two damages (delamination and crater) on laminate damage, and understand the contribution of each {{of them in the}} different phases through which passes the composite before perforation. To do this, impact fatigue tests are carried out on composite plates and measures of the crater size (diameter and depth) {{and the size of the}} delaminated area (diagonals from a diamond shape) are collected for different numbers of impacts and impact energies. A question worth asking; can we foster one of these damages over the other? especially when we are interesting to the “structure applications”, where one "prefers " perforation to delamination (while completing correctly the function's intended to the structure), or “shielding applications”, where one "prefers " the delamination to perforation.

40|$|Abstract — Fourier {{spectrum}} {{has been}} a widely accepted approach by many researchers working {{in the area of}} analysis of fabric patterns and faults in the fabric. Due to more energy content in the Fourier power spectrum (FPS) as compared to Fourier spectrum (FS), the authors were motivated to use FPS to determine the periodicity of the woven fabric which has regular repeating units. The DC suppressed FPS sum was studied on simulated as well as real fabric patterns. The simulated fabric patterns studied have horizontal and vertical stripes, diagonal pattern, checks, plain and twill <b>weave</b> patterns which <b>repeat</b> regularly. These patterns are obtained either by using a program developed by us or by a commercially available Texcard software or from NET. The comparative study of FS, DC suppressed FPS without and with zero padding was carried out on simulated as well as real fabric patterns. The marginals obtained from DC suppressed FPS have shown the superiority in identifying the periodicity over the method using only FPS. Further observation on the first and second significant peaks of DC suppressed FPS sum plot in frequency domain along u and v direction have been found to act as very good measure of the periodicity or repeat unit (RU) and thread count in warp and weft direction of the pattern image. The accuracy of thread count is more than 99 % respectively in both warp direction weft direction. It was also observed that the nature of power spectral view pattern identifies the fabric pattern. The details of the experimentation and the results thereof are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of robust image processing tools in the textile industry, fabric designers are beginning to use feature extraction methods for both analysis and pattern design of fabric materials. In the design evaluation process, {{one of the basic}} problems is the efficient segmentation for textile fabric images. This is equivalent to partitioning the images into several meaningful regions that often correspond to units of design patterns, <b>repeats,</b> <b>woven</b> yarn or fibres. The main challenge in this problem is identifying robustly the boundaries of various components of fabric materials. In this paper, we propose a novel model to solve the problem. The model is established on the analysis of the characteristic of textile/fabric images. The main contributions of the model are: (1) a cartoon-and-texture decomposition process is incorporated into the model, which can reduce the influence of the random texture noise on the segmentation process; (2) to overcome the drawback of the lightness inconsistency for the segmentation process, a bias field function is introduced to measure the deviation degree between the cartoon image and the piecewise constant approximation of the cartoon image. Then, the regions of textile images can be more accurately estimated; (3) following the advantages of the fuzzy region competition based image segmentation models, we also use the fuzzy membership functions (FMFs) to indicate the regions of images. However, to restrain the FMFs from degeneration, a new penalty term on the FMFs is introduced in our model. In addition, by using the augmented Lagrange multiplier method and the Chambolle[U+ 05 F 3]s dual projection method, we derive an efficient algorithm to solve the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can generate better segmentation results for textile images than classical FMF based models. Department of Computin...|$|R
