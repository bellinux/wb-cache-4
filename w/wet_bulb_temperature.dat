5|$|Increasingly, {{ski resorts}} are relying on snowmaking, the {{production}} of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. <b>Wet</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> {{is used as a}} metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.|$|E
25|$|Global warming of that {{magnitude}} {{would make}} {{most of the}} planet uninhabitable by humans. The human body generates about 100 W of metabolic heat that must be carried away to maintain a core body temperature near 37°C, which implies that sustained wet bulb temperatures above 35°C can result in lethal hyperthermia. Today, the summer temperature varies widely over the Earth's surface, but <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> is more narrowly confined by the effect of humidity, with the most common value of approximately 26–27°C and the highest approximately of 31°C. A warming of 10–12°C would put most of today's world population in regions with a wetbulb temperature above 35°C. Given the 20°C warming that occurs with 4.8 times current CO2 levels, such a climate forcing would produce intolerable climatic conditions even if the true climate sensitivity is significantly less than the Russell sensitivity, or, if the Russell sensitivity is accurate, the CO2 forcing required to produce intolerable conditions for humans is less than this amount.|$|E

40|$|In {{locations}} where workforce {{is exposed to}} high relative humidity and light winds, heat stress is a significant concern. Such is the case at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Heat stress is depicted by the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe <b>temperature,</b> which is the official measurement used by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. The <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe <b>temperature</b> is measured by an instrument {{which was designed to}} be portable and needing routine maintenance. As an alternative form for measuring the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe <b>temperature,</b> algorithms have been created to calculate the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe <b>temperature</b> from basic meteorological observations. The algorithms are location dependent; therefore a specific algorithm is usually not suitable for multiple locations. Due to climatology similarities, the algorithm developed for use at the Dryden Flight Research Center was applied to data from the White Sands Missile Range. A study was performed that compared a <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe instrument to data from two Surface Atmospheric Measurement Systems that was applied to the Dryden <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe <b>temperature</b> algorithm. The period of study was from June to September of 2009, with focus being applied from 0900 to 1800, local time. Analysis showed that the algorithm worked well, with a few exceptions. The algorithm becomes less accurate to the measurement when the dew point temperature is over 10 Celsius. Cloud cover also has a significant effect on the measured <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe <b>temperature.</b> The algorithm does not show red and black heat stress flags well due to shorter time scales of such events. The results of this study show that it is plausible that the Dryden Flight Research <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe <b>temperature</b> algorithm is compatible with the White Sands Missile Range, except for when there are increased dew point temperatures and cloud cover or precipitation.

A multivariate regression model was developed to simulate the operating variables of an air-cooled chiller with mist precooling.

50|$|Assuming {{constant}} pressure, sigma heat {{is solely}} {{a function of}} the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> of the air. For this reason, humidity need not be taken into account unless dry-bulb temperature measurements are used. Like sigma heat, the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> is not directly affected by the temperature of any condensed water vapor (liquid water), and it varies only when there is a net energy change to the system. In contrast, the dry bulb temperature can vary even for processes where there is no such net energy change. This difference may be understood by examining evaporative cooling. During evaporative cooling, all energy lost from air molecules as sensible heat is gained as latent heat by water molecules evaporating into that air. With no net energy gained or lost from the now more humid air, sigma heat remains unchanged. In keeping with this, the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> also remains unchanged, as its reading already represented the maximum possible amount of evaporative cooling. The dry bulb temperature however is in conflict with the sigma heat since it decreases during such evaporative cooling. This is why measurements of sigma heat which use dry bulb temperatures must also take into account the humidity of the air.|$|E
