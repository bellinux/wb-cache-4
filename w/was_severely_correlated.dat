Various methods of bandwidth selection have been proposed, but their successful implementation critically depends on a tuning procedure which requires accurate information about error correlation. Unfortunately, such information is usually hard to obtain since errors are not observable. In this article a new bandwidth selector based on the use of a bimodal kernel is proposed and investigated. It is shown that the new bandwidth selector is quite useful for the tuning procedures of various other methods.

40|$|The {{transportation}} sector <b>is</b> <b>severely</b> <b>correlated</b> {{with major}} problems in environment, citizens’ health, climate and economy. Issues such as traffic, fuel cost and parking space have make life more difficult, {{especially in the}} dense urban environment. Thus, {{there is a great}} need {{for the development of the}} electric vehicle (EV) sector. The number of cars in cities has increased so much that the current transportation system (roads, parking places, traffic lights, etc.) cannot accommodate them properly. The increasing number of vehicles does not affect only humans but also the environment, through air and noise pollution. According to EPA, the 39. 2 % of total gas emissions in 2007 was caused by transportation activities. Studies have shown that the pollutants are not only gathered in the major roads and/or highways but can travel depending on the meteorological conditions leading to generic pollution. The promotion of EVs and the charging stations are both equally required to be further developed in order EVs to move out of the cities and finally confront the range problem. In this work, a wind resource and a GIS analysis optimizes in a wider area the sitting of wind based charging stations and proposes an optimizing methodology...|$|R
40|$|Rod and cone {{photoreceptor}} neurons in the mammalian retina possess specialized cellular {{architecture and}} functional features for converting light to a neuronal signal. Establishing and maintaining these characteristics requires appropriate {{expression of a}} specific set of genes, which is tightly regulated by a network of photoreceptor transcription factors centered on the cone-rod homeobox protein CRX. CRX recruits transcription coactivators p 300 and CBP to acetylate promoter-bound histones and activate transcription of target genes. To further elucidate the role of these two coactivators, we conditionally knocked out Ep 300 and/or CrebBP in differentiating rods or cones, using opsin-driven Cre recombinase. Knockout of either factor alone exerted minimal effects, but loss of both factors severely disrupted target cell morphology and function: the unique nuclear chromatin organization seen in mouse rods was reversed, accompanied by redistribution of nuclear territories associated with repressive and active histone marks. Transcription of many genes including CRX targets <b>was</b> <b>severely</b> impaired, <b>correlating</b> with reduced histone H 3 /H 4 acetylation (the products of p 300 /CBP) on target gene promoters. Interestingly, the presence of a single wild-type allele of either coactivator prevented many of these defects, with Ep 300 more effective than Cbp. These results suggest that p 300 and CBP play essential roles in maintaining photoreceptor-specific structure, function and gene expression...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Severe {{alcohol use}} is {{recognized}} as a major public health concern, even though light to moderate alcohol use might have beneficial effects on health. Alcohol use has been studied to some extent in solid organ transplant populations, yet evidence is lacking on alcohol use and its correlates in the renal transplant population. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to determine the prevalence, severity and correlates of alcohol use in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study is a secondary analysis of the Supporting Medication Adherence in Renal Transplantation (SMART) study. Alcohol use was assessed by patient's self-report. At risk and binge drinkers were classified using World Health Organization criteria. The following correlates of alcohol use were explored: adherence with immunosuppression (Siegal questionnaire; electronic monitoring), smoking, coping style (UCL), depressive symptomatology (BDI) and busyness/routine in life style (ACQ Busyness Scale). RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-four patients were included in this analysis, 58. 1 % male, {{with a mean age of}} 54 yr (range 20 - 84) and a median of seven (interquartile ranges [IQR] 8) yr post-transplantation. A total of 52. 8 % of study participants reported to drink alcohol at least once a week. Two hundred and eighty of 284 subjects (98. 5 %) were drinking at low risk, four at moderate risk (1. 5 %). None of the participants <b>were</b> drinking <b>severely.</b> <b>Correlates</b> of alcohol use were male gender and being professionally active. CONCLUSION: Alcohol use is less prevalent in renal transplant recipients than in the general population. Severe alcohol use does not seem to represent a serious problem in renal transplant patients. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwo {{host range}} switch mutants of the {{immunosuppressive}} strain of parvovirus Minute Virus of Mice (MVMi) were isolated from plaques on A 9 fibroblasts. Both carried a single coding mutation at residue D 399 in VP 2, to alanine and glycine in hr 105 and hr 107, respectively, and a second, non-coding, guanine-to-adenine change at nucleotide 1970 in hr 105 and 1967 in hr 107. These mutations were recreated {{in a wild}} type MVMi infectious plasmid clone, both alone and as pairs, in either the original or switched combinations. All single mutants failed to replicate productively in fibroblasts, but the two pairs of changes were functionally equivalent. Single D 399 mutations allowed the viruses to initiate infection in fibroblasts, but NS 2 expression <b>was</b> <b>severely</b> restricted and <b>correlated</b> with poor accumulation and release of progeny virus. Mutations at 1967 or 1970 enhanced NS 2 accumulation, and allowed efficient progeny production and release. Conversely, the D 399 mutations destroyed the viruses' ability to infect EL 4 lymphocytes. In all productive EL 4 infections, NS 2 was expressed at high ratios {{even in the absence}} of upstream mutations, and progeny accumulation was efficient. However, EL 4 cells lack a mechanism for early progeny release, potentially explaining why virus amplification in these cells is slow...|$|R
40|$|Although {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) play {{an important}} role in mediating protection against influenza virus, the precise role of lung DC subsets, such as CD 11 b− and CD 11 b+ conventional DCs or plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), in different lung compartments is currently unknown. Early after intranasal infection, tracheal CD 11 b−CD 11 chi DCs migrated to the mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs), acquiring co-stimulatory molecules in the process. This emigration from the lung was followed by an accumulation of CD 11 b+CD 11 chi DCs in the trachea and lung interstitium. In the MLNs, the CD 11 b+ DCs contained abundant viral nucleoprotein (NP), but these cells failed to present antigen to CD 4 or CD 8 T cells, whereas resident CD 11 b−CD 8 α+ DCs presented to CD 8 cells, and migratory CD 11 b−CD 8 α− DCs presented to CD 4 and CD 8 T cells. When lung CD 11 chi DCs and macrophages or langerin+CD 11 b−CD 11 chi DCs were depleted using either CD 11 c–diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) or langerin-DTR mice, the development of virus-specific CD 8 + T cells <b>was</b> <b>severely</b> delayed, which <b>correlated</b> with increased clinical severity and a delayed viral clearance. 120 G 8 + CD 11 cint pDCs also accumulated in the lung and LNs carrying viral NP, but in their absence, there was no effect on viral clearance or clinical severity. Rather, in pDC-depleted mice, there was a reduction in antiviral antibody production after lung clearance of the virus. This suggests that multiple DCs are endowed with different tasks in mediating protection against influenza virus...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} mice lacking the high mobility group A 1 gene (Hmga 1 -knockout mice) developed a type 2 -like diabetic phenotype, in which cell-surface insulin receptors were dramatically reduced (below 10 % {{of those in}} the controls) in the major targets of insulin action, and glucose intolerance was associated with increased peripheral insulin sensitivity. This particular phenotype supports the existence of compensatory mechanisms of insulin resistance that promote glucose uptake and disposal in peripheral tissues by either insulin-dependent or insulin-independent mechanisms. We explored the role of these mechanisms in the regulation of glucose homeostasis by studying the Hmga 1 -knockout mouse model. Also, the hypothesis that increased insulin sensitivity in Hmga 1 -deficient mice could be related to the deficit of an insulin resistance factor is discussed. RESULTS: We first show that HMGA 1 is needed for basal and cAMP-induced retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP 4) gene and protein expression in living cells of both human and mouse origin. Then, by employing the Hmga 1 -knockout mouse model, we provide evidence for the identification of a novel biochemical pathway involving HMGA 1 and the RBP 4, whose activation by the cAMP-signaling pathway may play an essential role for maintaining glucose metabolism homeostasis in vivo, in certain adverse metabolic conditions in which insulin action is precluded. In comparative studies of normal and mutant mice, glucagon administration caused a considerable upregulation of HMGA 1 and RBP 4 expression both at the mRNA and protein level in wild-type animals. Conversely, in Hmga 1 -knockout mice, basal and glucagon-mediated expression of RBP 4 <b>was</b> <b>severely</b> attenuated and <b>correlated</b> inversely with increased Glut 4 mRNA and protein abundance in skeletal muscle and fat, in which the activation state of the protein kinase Akt, an important downstream mediator of the metabolic effects of insulin on Glut 4 translocation and carbohydrate metabolism, was simultaneously increased. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that HMGA 1 is an important modulator of RBP 4 gene expression in vivo. Further, they provide evidence for the identification of a novel biochemical pathway involving the cAMP-HMGA 1 -RBP 4 system, whose activation {{may play a role in}} glucose homeostasis in both rodents and humans. Elucidating these mechanisms has importance for both fundamental biology and therapeutic implications.
