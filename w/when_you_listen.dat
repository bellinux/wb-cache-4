5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me.

The fact {{is that it was}} just another session for them." [...] Payne states of his observations of Van Morrison's performance style: [...] "When (Van) was on stage, he would look like a space cadet, but then he'd open his mouth and you would realize that he had channeled everything into the sound of his voice. The rest of it was just a shell that was there for the purpose of producing this noise." ...|$|E

Deborah Evans-Price of CCM Magazine gave it four out of five stars, commenting that [...] "With this new set, [...] Hall and his companions again deliver songs that are musically engaging and lyrically insightful... Few acts more eloquently capture the complexities of being a Christian in today’s tumultuous world, but these fine folks continue to help light the path for the rest of us". Jennifer E. Jones of cbnmusic.com gave it four out of five spins, opining that [...] "There’s a reason why Casting Crowns {{is one of the best}} Christian bands out today, and that reason is evident <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> to The Altar and The Door. After three albums, lead singer/songwriter Mark Hall still knows how to speak for those who cannot... The Altar and The Door leaves plenty of room for the sinners and the saints to come closer to Jesus". Mark Lawrence of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares, saying [...] "Traditionally album number three is a defining point in a band's legacy: some bands self implode and produce an album high on production sheen but low on song quality... other bands though go on to produce their masterpiece... The Altar and the Door leans closer to the masterpiece than the flop but leaves you with a sense that they have even greater things to come... The Altar And The Door' is clearly a Casting Crowns album in sound, content and style but this is far from being a negative thing and will appeal to both existing fans as well as draw in new ones". Brian Mansfield gave it two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that [...] " [...] concern themselves with the space between the title’s two fixtures– that is, between intention and action, between doing good and getting in the way, or, as one song puts it, between “the God we want and the God who is.” That’s a space worth exploring, and the band’s motives may be the best, but their anthems are as predictable as a televangelist’s tears: start soft, build big, then cue the strings".|$|E

2500|$|One of Wilson's {{earliest}} memories {{was hearing}} Glenn Miller's 1943 recording of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue (1924), later citing it as a pivotal influence in his {{development as a}} composer. He recalled: [...] "Around our house, when I was a child, I heard things from my parents' record collection like Les Paul and Mary Ford, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Rosemary Clooney, and the Four Freshmen. Those were my first inspirations. To try to describe exactly what each influence was is hard to explain because it's very subtle, {{but it can be}} felt <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> to my music. I don't think people realize just how much Rosemary Clooney affected my singing. She taught me to sing with love in my heart ... I would sing along with it , studying her phrasing, and that's how I learned to sing with feeling." [...] John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful noted, [...] "Brian had control of this vocal palette of which we had no idea. We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like the Crew Cuts. Look what gold he mined out of that." [...] Carl speculated that it was Mike Love who got Brian into doo-wop music.|$|E
2500|$|The soundtrack also {{received}} positive critical responses.

Chennai online stated that [...] "The entire album gives an upbeat electro sense and wings to our imaginations. The music is convinced to grow on you, if not an instant hit." [...] A review by Music Aloud said, [...] "While the soundtrack of Enthiran has enough fodder to delight a connoisseur, {{it remains to be}} seen how much its sophistication will appeal to the masses, who are after all Rajinikanth's primary target." [...] Behindwoods reviewed the music saying, [...] "Yes, it exasperates you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> for the first time. But as you listen again, you realize that though Rahman gives this album a crisp metallic touch in keeping with the theme of the story, he still remains faithful to his Carnatic roots in a touching way. Watch how cleverly he varies the feel of the normal duets and robo-based duets. The lyrics are interesting too. If the listener shakes off his conditioned thinking while listening to this album, he is in for a treat." [...] Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff commented that, [...] "Enthiran is, in fact, a perfect superstar album. Where the collection does manage to veer from the usual, Rahman has managed to add his own quirky, creative notes to the songs." ...|$|E
