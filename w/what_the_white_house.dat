5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Hotel {{began as}} a rooming house in the large home of Mississippi {{attorney}} and circuit court judge Walter White. Between 1900 and 1930, it was White’s wife who transformed neighborhood mansions, connected by pillared porches and renovations, into <b>what</b> would become <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Hotel. James Love, Jr., owner of Biloxi’s Buena Vista Hotel, acquired <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> property in 1940, modernized the buildings, and added a swimming pool. Business thrived until 1971, when the Love family sold the hotel, and it began a slow decline. The hotel passed through a succession of owners, and in 1988, bankruptcy was declared. The hotel was boarded up and abandoned. In 1989, the son of James Love bought the hotel with plans to return it to its former glory, but did not begin restoration until 10 years after he acquired the property. Renovation efforts stopped when financing fell through after the 2001 {{terrorist attacks on the}} U.S. and subsequently by devastation to the Mississippi Gulf Coast from Hurricane Katrina, and harsh economic times from the Great Recession. In May 2012, the hotel was added to Biloxi’s list of blighted properties, and the owner was given the choice of demolishing the structure, renovating it to meet city codes, or selling it to a developer. [...] In April 2013, the City of Biloxi announced that <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Hotel had been sold to a Mississippi developer.

He took refuge at an American post on the western shore, whence he returned in the night to his quarters. New arrangements were made for an interview, but it was postponed until after Washington should depart for Hartford to hold the proposed conference with Count Rochambeau and the other French officers. In the meantime the British sloop-of-war, Vulture, anchored a few miles below Teller's Point, to be at hand in aid of the negotiation. On board was Colonel Robinson, who, pretending to believe that General Putnam still commanded in the Highlands, addressed a note to him requesting an interview on the subject of his confiscated property. This letter he sent by a flag, enclosed in one addressed to Arnold; soliciting of him the same boon should General Putnam be absent.|$|R

40|$|Literature on genre {{analysis}} mainly {{focuses on}} the description of language use in the different professional and institutional domains (Bhatia 2004). Despite the different directions of the studies on genre (Bhatia 1993; Martin and Christie 1997; Swales 1990), a common orientation {{may be seen in}} their tendency to describe homogeneous concepts, such as communicative situation, register and function. Nevertheless, genre-specific features are subject to changes due to the ongoing processes of internationalisation and globalisation (Candlin and Gotti 2004; Cortese and Duszak 2005; Crystal 1997). In particular, political and institutional communication genres have been experiencing in-depth transformation in the last few decades, mainly due to evolutions in the media market, fuelled by technological developments and by the economic globalisation (Blumler and Kavanagh 1999). Within the framework of a wider research project “Tension and change in English domain-specific genres” funded by the Italian Ministry of Research, the present paper aims to outline, through a corpus-based analysis of lexico-grammatical and linguistic features (Baker 2006), in <b>what</b> ways <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> press briefings, as a genre, have evolved in the last 16 years under the pressure of technological developments and of media market transformation. <b>White</b> <b>House</b> press briefings are meetings between <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> press secretary and the press, held on an almost daily basis. They may be regarded as the main official channel of communication for <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> and therefore {{play a crucial role in}} the communication strategies on the world's most powerful institution (Kumar 2007). Embracing a diachronic perspective, our analysis aims at identifying the main features of the evolution of the briefings as a genre, during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. A corpus (DiaWHoB) including all the briefings from January 1993 to January 2009, available on the American Presidency Project website ([URL] has been collected in order to carry out the analysis. The corpus consists of 4, 000 briefings and is made up of more than 18 million words. The scope and size of a specialised corpus of this kind make it a powerful tool to investigate the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> press briefing. In order to manage the data more efficiently, the corpus has been annotated. The XML mark-up includes information about individual speakers and their roles, date, briefing details and text structure. Our intent is to compare different discourse strategies adopted by speakers in the briefings at different points in time, and also to identify differences between discourse features employed by the press secretary and those more typical of the press. The present research paper draws up the corpus structure and in <b>what</b> ways <b>the</b> corpus architecture helps in investigating the evolution of the genre, and also presents some preliminary results. In particular, focus is on some examples of evolution in phraseology within the genre of briefings in order to support the hypothesis that a diachronic corpus-based investigation facilitates comparisons among different speakers thanks to the XML mark-up while providing interesting insight into the evolution of a genre...|$|R

5000|$|Kinzer's {{reporting}} on Central America was criticized by Edward S.

In {{the last two weeks}} I've seen eight articles by Kinzer that say exactly <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> wants. Kinzer always raises questions about Sandinista intentions, whether they're truly democratic, and so on. When you analyse his articles you see he's just responding <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> is saying." [...] Chomsky later expanded on this in an interview published in the 2002 collection Understanding Power: [...] Look, {{one of the things that}} Edward Herman and I did in Manufacturing Consent was to just look at the sources that reporters go to. In a part that I wrote, I happened to be discussing Central America, so I went through fifty articles by Stephen Kinzer of the New York Times beginning in October 1987, and just asked: whose opinions did he try to get? Well, it turns out that in fifty articles he did not talk to one person in Nicaragua who was pro-Sandinista. Now, there's got to be somebody -- you know, Ortega's mother, somebody's got to be pro-Sandinista. Nope, in fact, everybody he quotes is anti-Sandinista. Ortega was the Sandinista President. Well, there are polls, which the Times won't report, and they show that all of the opposition parties in Nicaragua combined had the support of only 9 percent of the population. But they have 100 percent of Stephen Kinzer - everyone he's found supports the opposition parties, 9 percent of the population. That's in fifty articles.|$|E

Indeed, {{the identification of the}} Taliban in late 2001 as a central threat to US security has been looked upon by specialists with a sense of irony. After all, it was Saudi Arabia that was the primary source of both financial and ideological support for the Taliban movement. This paper studies another case of aggressive Saudi indoctrination. The war-torn region of Kosova has, since the end of war in mid- 1999, been flooded by organizations linked to the same educational and humanitarian agencies that helped turn a portion of the Afghan refugee community in the 1980 s into a factionalized and highly antagonistic population. There is a tragic irony in Western governments neglecting the rural poor in Kosova, ostensibly leaving this population at the mercy of Islamic organizations bent on homogenizing a traditionally tolerant and diverse community. In the past, other attempts to impose theological rigidities on society failed, cases that this paper highlights to emphasize that it is not inevitable that a segment of the Kosovar Albanian population become linked to Saudi Wahhabi doctrine. That said, as Western aid agencies and governments have neglected the communities most destroyed by war and thus most in need of assistance, the monopolization of that aid by Saudi organizations may result in exactly what post September 11 th policy-makers want to avoid...|$|E
