Draft chapters circulated and received strenuous objections from General Sir Hubert Gough to being blamed for failures, noting that GHQ had planned much of the offensive and should receive {{a share of the}} blame. Wynne rewrote certain passages, adding some comments from Gough; Edmonds, Wynne and Gough corresponded during the writing which Wynne finished in 1946.

25|$|Green related an estrangement between Wynne and Edmonds, over Edmonds' {{willingness}} to accept Gough's objections. Edmonds sent Wynne to meet Gough, {{which led to a}} substantial change in Wynne's point of view. Wynne revised the draft to remove much of the blame from Gough, writing that Haig bore principal responsibility for the Fifth Army plan in the third (1945) draft. Edmonds then found this draft objectionable and quarrelled with Wynne, <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> named as an author. Green wrote that Edmonds and Wynne had changed their views about Gough and made the narrative of his role in the events of 1917 much more accurate, it being noticeably less defensive of Haig. Wynne's conclusion had been that the strategy of retaining the initiative to protect the French Army had worked and that the tactical intention to clear the Belgian coast had failed, due to an underestimation of German resilience and the mistaken attempt at a breakthrough.|$|E

Norquist was quoted as saying [...] "I think some people had given him up for dead, but he was good old Karl, upbeat and enthusiastic." [...] At the meeting Rove previewed Bush's final two years in office, saying Social Security reform was likely off the table and that Iraq and the economy would be the biggest issues for 2008.

2500|$|In January 2010, {{a senior}} Obama {{administration}} official, <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> named, {{referred to the}} shooting as [...] "an act of terrorism", however other administration officials have not referred to the shootings as a terrorist event. Several people, including Senator Joe Lieberman and General Barry McCaffrey, have called the event a terrorist attack. The United States Department of Defense and federal law enforcement agencies had classified the shootings {{as an act of}} workplace violence. This was changed by the Fiscal Year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act which broadened the criteria for awarding the Purple Heart to include [...] "an attack by a foreign terrorist organization….if the attack was inspired or motivated by the foreign terrorist organization." [...] This allowed the Army to award the Purple Heart, and its civilian equivalent, The Defense of Freedom Medal, to victims of the attack.The U.S. government declined requests from survivors and family members of the slain to categorize the Fort Hood shooting as an act of terrorism, or motivated by militant Islamic religious convictions. In November 2011, a group of survivors and family members filed a lawsuit against the government for negligence in preventing the attack, and to force the government to classify the shootings as terrorism. The Pentagon argued that charging Hasan with terrorism was not possible within the military justice system and that such action could harm the military prosecutors' ability to sustain a guilty verdict against Hasan.|$|E

In the second and third sections, I look at deconstructions of the nationalist romance paradigm in the 1990 s written by a critically-minded Chinese writer and by aboriginal writers. I describe the earlier period as colonial and the latter as democratic. But Taiwan may be both democratizing and still in some sense colonial.

60|$|The {{letter is}} {{accompanied}} by two photographs of the young lady. I should have cried myself had I seen her as she was at first. She was a stumpy, flat-headed, squat-nosed, cross-eyed thing. She did not even look good. One virtue she appears to have had, however. It was faith. She believed what the label said, she did what the label told her. She is now a tall, ravishing young person, her only trouble being, I should say, {{to know what to}} do with her hair--it reaches to her knees and must <b>be</b> a nuisance <b>to</b> her. She would do better to give some of it away. Taking this young lady as a text, it means that the girl <b>who</b> <b>declines</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a dream of loveliness does so out of obstinacy.
