50|$|The plasmasphere, or inner {{magnetosphere}}, is {{a region}} of the Earth's magnetosphere consisting of low energy (cool) plasma. It is located above the ionosphere. The outer boundary of the plasmasphere {{is known as the}} plasmapause, which is defined by an order of magnitude drop in plasma density. The plasmasphere was discovered in 1963 by Don Carpenter from the analysis of VLF <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> data. Traditionally, the plasmasphere has been regarded as a well behaved cold plasma with particle motion dominated entirely by the geomagnetic field and hence corotating with the Earth.|$|E

A portion of <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> return to the ionosphere with a smaller perpendicular wave vector resulting in diminished linear damping and enhanced ability to pitch-angle scatter trapped electrons. In addition, a portion of the scattered wave packets can be reflected near the ionosphere back into the magnetosphere.

Through resonance and related nonlinear interaction with the large-amplitude whistler waves, the water ions become trapped by the packet. An energy balance calculation demonstrates that the trapped ions lose their kinetic energy during the trapped motion in the packet.

40|$|International audience[1] We {{calculated}} the electron pitch-angle diffusion coefficients {{in the outer}} radiation belt for L-shell $ 4. 5 {{taking into account the}} effects of oblique <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> propagation. The dependence of the distribution of the angle q between the <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> vector and the background magnetic field on magnetic latitude is modeled after statistical results of Cluster wave angle observations. According to in-situ observations, the mean value and the variance of the q distribution rapidly increase with magnetic latitude. We found that inclusion of oblique <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> propagation led to a significant increase in pitch-angle diffusion rates over those calculated under the assumption of parallel <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> propagation. The effect was pronounced for electrons with small equatorial pitch-angles close to the loss cone and could result in as much as an order of magnitude decrease of the electron lifetimes. We show that the intensification of pitch-angle diffusion {{can be explained by the}} contribution of higher order cyclotron resonances. By comparing the results of calculations obtained from two models of electron density distribution along field lines, we show that the effect of the intensification of pitch-angle diffusion is stronger when electron density does not vary along field lines. The intensification of pitch-angle diffusion and corresponding decrease of energetic electron lifetime result in significant modification of the rate of electron losses and should have an impact on formation and dynamics of the outer radiation belt.

40|$|New {{behavior}} of strictly perpendicular shocks in supercritical regime is analyzed {{with the help}} of both two-dimensional (2 -D) hybrid and full particle electromagnetic simulations. Surprisingly, in both simulation cases, the shock front region appears to be dominated by emission of coherent large amplitude <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> for some plasma conditions and shock regimes. These <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> are oblique with respect to the shock normal {{as well as to the}} upstream magnetic field and are phase-standing in the shock rest frame.

In contrast, both corresponding one-dimensional (1 -D) hybrid and full particle simulations performed in similar plasma and Mach regime conditions show that the self-reformation takes place for 1 -D perpendicular shock.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{nonlinear}} dynamics of <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> in magnetized plasmas.

We have applied the renormalization group method to obtain dynamical equations for the slowly varying amplitudes of <b>whistler</b> <b>waves.</b> Further, {{it has been shown that}} the amplitudes of eigenmodes satisfy an infinite system of coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations. In this sense, the whistler eigenmodes form a sort of a gas of interacting quasiparticles, while the slowly varying amplitudes can be considered as dynamical variables heralding the relevant information about the system. An important feature of our description is that <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> do not perturb the initial uniform density of plasma electrons. The plasma response to the induced <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> consists in velocity redistribution which follows exactly the behaviour of the whistlers.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> magnetic and electric field amplitude ratios from which we compute wave propagation angles and energies of electrons in resonance with the waves. To do this analysis, we compute the theoretical dependence of ratios of wave components on the <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> propagation angle Theta for various combinations of orthogonal wave components. Ratios of wave components that would be observed by a spinning spacecraft are determined, {{and the effects of}} arbitrary inclinations of the spacecraft to the ambient magnetic field and to the <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> vector are studied. This analysis clearly demonstrates that B/E, the ratio of magnetic to electric field amplitudes, cannot be assumed to be the wave index of refraction, contrary to assumptions of some earlier studies. Therefore previous interpretations of <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> observations based on this assumption must be reinvestigated. B/E ratios derived using three orthogonal wave components can be used to unambiguously determine Theta. Using spin plane observations alone, a significant uncertainty occurs in the determination of Theta. Nevertheless, for whistler waves observed downstream of several interplanetary shocks by the Ulysses plasma wave experiment we find that Theta is highly oblique. We suggest that the analysis of wave amplitude ratios used in conjunction with traditional stability analyses provide a promising tool for determining which particle distributions and resonances are likely to be dominant contributors to wave growth...|$|E

Some of them are associated with whistler waves. Such TDS often emerge on the forward edges of the <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> packets and form chains. The parametric decay of a <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> into a <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> propagating {{in the opposite direction}} and an electron acoustic wave is studied experimentally as well as analytically, using Van Allen Probes data. The resulting electron acoustic wave is considered to be the source of electron scale TDS.

The bicoherence analysis shows the nonlinear nature of the observed electron-acoustic waves as well as the <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> and electron acoustic wave phase relation. The estimated decay instability growth rate shows that the process of three-wave interaction can develop in a characteristic time smaller than 1 s, thus, the process is rapid enough to explain the observations.

From Lunar Prospector, the <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> were observed on the dayside, outside the lunar wake, and suggested a possible link of solar wind interaction with lunar magnetic anomalies as the source (Halekas et al. 2006). The analysis of the narrow-band <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> observed as magnetic fluctuation close to 1 Hz from Kaguya (Tsugawa et al. 2011) suggested the ion beams reflected by the lunar magnetic anomalies as a possible source of the waves.

40|$|International audienceTwo-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) {{simulations}} {{are used}} for analyzing in detail different nonstationary behaviors of a perpendicular supercritical shock. A recent study by Hellinger et al.

First, for a fixed βi value, the <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> emission (WWE) persists for high MA above a critical Mach number (i. e., MA ≥ MAWWE). The quasi-stationarity is only apparent and disappears when considering the full 3 -D field profiles. Second, for lower MA, the self-reformation is retrieved and becomes dominant as the amplitude of the <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> becomes negligible. Third, there exists a transition regime in MA within which both processes compete each other. Fourth, these results are observed for a strictly perpendicular shock only as B 0 is within the simulation plane. When B 0 is out of the simulation plane, no <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> emission is evidenced and only self-reformation is recovered. Fifth, the occurrence and disappearance of the nonlinear <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> are well recovered in both 2 -D PIC and 2 -D hybrid simulations.
