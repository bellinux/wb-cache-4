5|$|Animal-sourced foods (meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, dairy) provide zinc. The {{concentration}} of zinc in plants varies <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> in the soil. With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, mustard). Zinc {{is also found}} in beans, nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and blackcurrant. Plant phytates interfere with zinc absorption, so people consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet may need to increase zinc intake.|$|E
5|$|By 1914 the Territorial Force {{had some}} 30,000 men {{involved}} in divisional level training camps; two years previously, the manpower and logistical {{constraints of the}} force was such that only battalion level camps could be achieved. When General Ian Hamilton, the Inspector General of Overseas Forces, visited New Zealand in 1914, he was impressed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of preparedness of the country's military. This reflected positively on Godley's work, and he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George the same year.|$|E
5|$|Most {{living things}} have predators and {{therefore}} {{are in a}} constant evolutionary arms race to develop antipredator adaptations, while the predator adapts to become more efficient at defeating the prey's adaptations. Some organisms have evolved to make detection less likely, for example by nocturnality and camouflage. Others have developed chemical defences such as the deadly toxins of certain snakes and wasps, or the noxious scent of the skunk. Such prey often send clear and honest warning signals to their attackers with conspicuous aposematic (warning) patterns. The brightness of such warning signs is correlated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of toxicity of the organism.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after winning}} an {{increased}} {{majority in the}} 2008 election, Stelmach's cabinet approved substantial raises for themselves, increasing the salary paid to cabinet ministers from $142,000 to $184,000 and that paid to the Premier from $159,450 to $213,450. The increases also affect the severance paid to ministers who resign or are defeated in elections—under the program implemented by Ralph Klein's government to replace the previously existing pension program, departing MLAs receive three months' pay for every year they served, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of the pay based on their three highest-earning years. The increases were attacked by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and the opposition parties, but Stelmach defended the raises as the first received by cabinet ministers in fifteen years and as being necessary to attract qualified people to politics.|$|E
5|$|The final whistle blew {{with the}} score {{remaining}} at 1–1.

It was Alex Ferguson, who went onto the pitch after the final whistle, who began informing some of the players of Stein's collapse, news of which began to filter through to all of them {{as they made their way}} back to the dressing room.|$|E
5|$|As most meat ant colonies {{rarely have}} a second queen, polydomy is not always {{associated}} with polygyny, although the two are frequently associated with each other because polygynous colonies reproduce by budding. This means that the ecological factors that promote polydomy and polygny both differ. Studies show that most meat ants are produced by a single, inseminated queen due to {{the high level of}} relatedness in all but one tested colonies. Colonies that are not closely related are the result of colony fusion (meaning that two unrelated and separate colonies form a single entity). Meat ants also show nest fidelity: in polydomous colonies, workers from different nests will always mingle with others from different nests but never return to a nest they do not originate from. Instead, they return to the nest they enclosed in. This means that colonies may only homogenise through brood transfer. As discussed before, nestmates from different nests will always be aggressive towards each other, but this is due to a number of factors: genetic and spatial distance in nests can correlate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of aggression exhibited by the ants. However, they exhibit more aggression to ants of different species from adjoining territories. They are also aggressive to conspecific ants from distant colonies, suggesting that environmental cues {{play a vital role in}} nestmate recognition. An example is that background odours in a particular environment may impair ants from identifying their own nestmates, and may need to make more attempts to determine an ant's identity.|$|E

5|$|Fez is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) puzzle platform game {{set in a}} three-dimensional (3D) world. The player-character Gomez lives peacefully on a 2D plane until he receives a red fez and witnesses the breakup of a giant, golden hexahedron that tears the fabric of spacetime and reveals a third dimension. After the game appears to glitch, reset, and reboot, the player can rotate between four 2D views of the 3D world, as four sides around a cube-like space. This rotation mechanic reveals new paths through the levels by connecting otherwise inaccessible platforms, and {{is the basis of}} Fez puzzles. For example, floating platforms become a solid road, discontinuous ladders become whole, and platforms that move along a track stay on course. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments, which accrete to restore order to the universe. In search of these cubes, Gomez traverses the game environment by jumping between ledges. Other platforming elements change <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> themes, including crates that activate switches, bombs that reveal passages, and pistons that launch Gomez airborne.|$|E
5|$|Iginla {{continued}} {{his pursuit of}} Fleury's franchise record of 830points in 2008–09. He recorded his 800th point with a first period assist against the Chicago Blackhawks on December 19, 2008. He ended 2008 with a career high five points in a New Year's Eve game against the Edmonton Oilers. He had 14 previous four point games. In January, he {{was named to the}} 2009 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal, his fifth such selection. Representing the Western Conference, Iginla scored his first career NHL All-Star Game goal in a 12–11 shootout loss. He passed Fleury as the Flames' all-time scoring leader on March 1, 2009, by recording five points, including his 400th career goal, in an 8–6 loss to the Lightning. He finished the season with 35goals and 89points, but a disappointing playoff performance led to questions of whether he had been playing with an injury. Iginla quickly denied the rumour, admitted that he had not played <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of consistency he expected and stated that he would spend the summer focused on improving his play in 2009–10.|$|E
5|$|Nordberg {{was part}} of Holmenkolbanen's {{operating}} network until 1975, when the municipality of Oslo bought all the company's stock. In the early 1990s, the stations on the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, which involves a heightening and lengthening of the platforms, installation of third rail power supply and a new signaling system. The third rail {{made it impossible to}} cross the line in-grade, and under- or overpasses had to be built at all stations. The transport authorities decided to close Nordberg, arguing that the access roads to the station were steep and dangerous, and icy during the winter. The residents of Nordberg opposed the closure of the station, arguing that it had served the area well with its central position in the area. Nevertheless, the station was closed, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> crossing that formerly had allowed for car traffic to cross the tracks. An underpass for pedestrians was constructed.|$|E
