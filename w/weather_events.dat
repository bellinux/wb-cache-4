40|$|Weather {{insurance}} {{within the}} agricultural sector has been limited by the difficulty in defining the appropriate <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> and in pricing the product. We develop a new pricing method for weather insurance under situations where returns depend {{not only on the}} occurrence of the <b>weather</b> <b>event,</b> but also its timing. The method is used to price weather insurance for ice wine. Because the harvest quantity of grapes for ice wine degrades over time, the strike value on the <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> measured as harvestable hours is random. We develop a Monte Carlo method to estimate the premium. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

5|$|Argentina is {{vulnerable}} {{and will likely}} be significantly impacted by climate change. Temperatures have increased {{in the last century}} while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more and other areas less. These changes have impacted river flow, increased the frequency of extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events,</b> and led to the retreat of glaciers. Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E
5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience increasingly more rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to provide for their colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with dry weather. These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E
5|$|Climate can {{influence}} bat distribution, movements and biogeography, access to food resources, timing of reproduction and emergence {{and rate of}} energy expenditure. In combination with other factors, including ongoing loss and degradation of habitat, global climate change or global warming presents a serious and increasing threat to bats and other fauna. The affinity of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat for riparian zones in arid and semi-arid environments renders it potentially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} water stress and extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events.</b> Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being at increased risk of the potential impacts of global climate change include habitat (species that rely on riparian habitats in water stress prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking insectivore), roost type (tree hollow specialist), biogeography (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) and extreme weather (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E

5|$|The tornado {{outbreak}} {{sequence of}} June 3–11, 2008 {{was a series}} of tornado outbreaks affecting most of central and eastern North America from June 311, 2008. 192tornadoes were confirmed, along with widespread straightline wind wind damage. Seven people were killed from a direct result of tornadoes; four in Iowa, two in Kansas, and one in Indiana. Eleven additional people were killed across five states by other <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> including lightning, flash flooding, and straight-line winds. Severe flooding was also reported in much of Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa {{as a result of the}} same thunderstorms, while high heat and humidity affected much of eastern North America; particularly along the eastern seaboard of the United States from New York City to the Carolinas.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{atmospheric}} convection—the ordinary {{process of}} lower, warm air rising—inversions leave cooler air suspended below warm air, preventing the lower air from rising and trapping airborne pollutants that would ordinarily disperse in the atmosphere. Such <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> are common, {{but they are}} usually followed by a strong cold front that brings an influx of clean air and disperses pollutants before they {{have enough time to}} become highly concentrated; in this case, a cold front approaching west through southern Canada was delayed. When explained in less formal terms, the process of an inversion causing a smog event has been compared to a lid that holds in pollutants or a balloon that fills with pollutants. In general, smog events occur not because of a sudden increase in a region's output of pollution, but rather because weather conditions like stagnant air prevent the dispersal of pollutants that were already present.|$|E
5|$|The Chaco Low is a semi–permanent low {{pressure}} system situated {{east of the}} Andes that is approximately located between 20oS and 30oS during summer (displaced to the north in winter). It is stronger in the summer than in winter due {{to a combination of}} high insolation, dry surface conditions, and southward displacement of the South Atlantic and South Pacific High (this makes it difficult for cold fronts to enter at lower latitudes). The Chaco Low interacts with the South Atlantic High, generating a pressure gradient that draws moist air from the northeast to coastal and central regions of Argentina. It also forces easterly winds from the Amazon basin to move southward, which is reinforced by the funneling effect from both the Andes and the Brazilian Plateau. The Chaco Low brings large amounts of moisture that favour the development of convective thunderstorms during summer, reaching as far south as 35oS. This movement of air from the north owing to the interaction between the Chaco Low and the South Atlantic high is the strongest in summer when the Chaco Low is at its strongest. These winds bring hot, humid tropical air from the north. Sustained and intense winds from the north are responsible for severe <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> such as heat waves and severe convection. During winter, the Chaco Low weakens as a result of lower insolation. This is partly responsible for the decrease in winter precipitation over much of Argentina (in addition to northward displacement of westerlies) due to a weaker transport of air masses from the tropics. This excludes areas south of 40oS where it is dominated by westerlies.|$|E

50|$|The 2006 Central Pacific cyclone, {{also known}} as 91C.INVEST or Storm 91C, was an unusual <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> of 2006. Forming on October 30, from a {{mid-latitude}} cyclone in the north Pacific mid-latitudes, it moved over waters warmer than normal. The system acquired some features more typical of subtropical or even tropical cyclones. However, as it neared western North America it fell apart. Moisture from its remains then caused substantial rainfall in British Columbia. The exact status and nature of this <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> is unknown, with meteorologists and weather agencies having differing opinions.|$|R
25|$|The NWS uses several {{scales in}} {{describing}} <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> or conditions. Several common scales are described below.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{subjects}} discussed in the literature {{is whether or not}} extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> can be attributed to human activities. Seneviratne et al. (2012) stated that attributing individual extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> to human activities was challenging. They were, however, more confident over attributing changes in long-term trends of extreme weather. For example, Seneviratne et al. (2012) concluded that human activities had likely led to a warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Health {{facilities}} {{play a crucial}} role in maintaining healthcare services to the community during an extreme <b>weather</b> <b>event.</b> Health facilities managers operate within a wider network of organisations which include emergency services, health resource suppliers, local authorities, external health agencies and governmental organisations. Their response to an extreme <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> depends significantly on their ability to manage the network risks which may arise between actors in this complex system. Yet existing research has tended to look at facilities managers in isolation. Through an in-depth case study of how health services in the State of New South Wales, Australia would respond to an extreme <b>weather</b> <b>event,</b> the interface risks between these various agencies are explored from a facilities management perspective. An analysis of 139 documentary sources which would dictate the inter-agency response shows that health facilities managers face numerous hidden risks arising from overlapping, complex and unresolved governance conflicts between the agencies on which they depend. It is concluded that these interface risks can be reduced if facilities managers employ a number of strategies. These include: mapping hospital dependency on other agencies; resolve overlapping operational boundaries with other agencies; undertaking proactive risk reduction for critical external support infrastructure; and better understanding potential conflicts with external agencies in responding to an extreme <b>weather</b> <b>event...</b>|$|R
25|$|The DR {{is exposed}} {{to a number of}} natural hazards, such as hurricanes, storms, floods, drought, earthquakes, and fires. The {{destructive}} force of these phenomena can be enormous - in 1998 Hurricane Georges caused economic losses estimated at US$2,193 (14 percent of GNI), and 235 deaths. In particular, climate shocks have included a dramatic increase in the frequency of major <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> over the past forty years, with 491 recorded major <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> during the previous decade, as compared to 126 from 1960 to 1969. Flooding has emerged as the most common recorded disaster during the 1990s, replacing fires {{for the first time in}} nearly fifty years. Alarmingly, flooding is mostly due to non-extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events.</b> Out of the recorded 464 major flooding events between 1966 and 2000, only 33 were caused by hurricanes or tropical storms, while the overwhelming majority of flooding was caused by precipitation during the rainy season.|$|E

25|$|How might {{climate change}} affect energy {{production}} and {{supply in the}} United States? The research evidence about effects is {{not as strong as}} for energy consumption, but climate change could affect energy production and supply (a) if extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> become more intense, (b) where regions dependent on water supplies for hydropower and/or thermal power plant cooling face reductions in water supplies, (c) where temperature increases decrease overall thermoelectric power generation efficiencies, and (d) where changed conditions affect facility siting decisions. Most effects are likely to be modest except for possible regional effects of extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> and water shortages.|$|E
50|$|A rare December tornado outbreak, {{part of a}} {{much more}} {{significant}} severe <b>weather</b> <b>event,</b> affected parts of northeastern Pennsylvania when several small lines or cells of thunderstorms affected the area during the afternoon. 5 tornadoes have been confirmed including an F2 in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. This F2 tornado originated in Nescopeck Township, lifting up tractor trailers and campers, tossing them like toys. Several houses were also badly damaged. The tornado traveled 15 miles into Mountain Top. One person was killed by a falling tree in Dauphin County. They were part of a larger winter <b>weather</b> <b>event.</b>|$|R
