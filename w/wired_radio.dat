[...] However, despite the power company's optimism that the system would eventually be installed nationally, the effort proved unable to compete with the free offerings provided by standard radio stations.

40|$|International audienceDespite the {{exceptional}} progress of MPSoC architectures, on chip communication networks remain a lock for {{the evolution of}} their performances due to the power consumption and the delay in data carrying. In this context, the <b>wired</b> <b>radio</b> frequency (RF) network on chip (RFNoC) has emerged. In this paper, we developed a library of RF component models in VHDL-AMS for time domain simulation. This library includes mainly the transmission line (TL) and the RF transceiver components such as the low noise amplifier (LNA), the mixer and the local oscillator (LO). The models consider the conventional parameters describing their performances including the non-linearities, the noise and the bandwidth of the LNA and the mixer. Leakages between ports are also considered for the mixer. The LO model considers the traditional parameters, more importantly its phase noise. The originality of the TL model is the modeling of the skin effect on a wide frequency range for time domain simulations. All the models are validated. Global simulations are performed to demonstrate the interest to accurately model the components of the RFNoC. The developed library is used here for wired RFNoC, however it can be used for all other wired and wireless RF communication system...|$|E
