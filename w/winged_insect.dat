60|$|While we were resting under a spruce I espied a white-breasted, blue-headed, gray-backed {{little bird}} {{at work on}} a pine tree. He walked head first down the bark, pecking here and there. I saw a moth or a <b>winged</b> <b>insect</b> fly off the tree, and then another. Then I saw several more fly away. The bird was feeding on winged insects that lived in the bark. Some of them saw or heard him coming and escaped, but many of them he caught. He went about this death-dealing {{business}} with a brisk and cheerful manner. No doubt nature had developed him to help protect the trees from bugs and worms and beetles.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Flanders wrote letters; Mrs. Jarvis wrote them; Mrs. Durrant too; Mother Stuart {{actually}} scented her pages, thereby {{adding a}} flavour which the English language fails to provide; Jacob {{had written in}} his day long letters about art, morality, and politics to young men at college. Clara Durrant's letters were those of a child. Florinda--the impediment between Florinda and her pen was something impassable. Fancy a butterfly, gnat, or other <b>winged</b> <b>insect,</b> attached to a twig which, clogged with mud, it rolls across a page. Her spelling was abominable. Her sentiments infantile. And for some reason when she wrote she declared her belief in God. Then there were crosses--tear stains; and the hand itself rambling and redeemed only by the fact--which always did redeem Florinda--by {{the fact that she}} cared. Yes, whether it was for chocolate creams, hot baths, the shape of her face in the looking-glass, Florinda could no more pretend a feeling than swallow whisky. Incontinent was her rejection. Great men are truthful, and these little prostitutes, staring in the fire, taking out a powder-puff, decorating lips at an inch of looking-glass, have (so Jacob thought) an inviolable fidelity.|$|E

40|$|Among the <b>winged</b> <b>insects</b> (Pterygota) the Dragonflies and Damselflies (Odonata) {{are unique}} for several reasons. Behaviourally they are aerial predators that hunt and catch their prey in flight, only. Morphologically the flight {{apparatus}} of Odonata is {{significantly different from}} what {{is found in the}} remaining Pterygota. However, to understand the phylogenetic relationships of <b>winged</b> <b>insects</b> and the origin and evolution of insect flight in general, it is essential to know how the elements of the odonatan flight apparatus relate to those of the other Pterygota. Here we present a comprehensive, comparative morphological investigation of the thoracic flight musculature of damselflies (Zygoptera). Based on our new data we propose a homologization scheme for the thoracic musculature throughout Pterygota. The new homology hypotheses will allow for future comparative work and especially for phylogenetic analyses using characters of the thoracic musculature throughout all <b>winged</b> <b>insects.</b> This will contribute to understand the early evolution of pterygote insects and their basal phylogenetic relationship...|$|R

60|$|Her horse, Majesty, {{tossed his}} head and flung his mane and {{switched}} his tail at the flies. He would rather have been cutting the wind down the valley slope. Madeline sat with her back against a tree, and took off her sombrero. The soft breeze, fanning her hot face, blowing strands of her hair, was refreshingly cool. She heard the slow tramp of cattle going in to drink. That sound ceased, and the grove of mesquites appeared to be lifeless, except {{for her and her}} horse. It was, however, only after moments of attention that she found the place was far from being dead. Keen eyes and ears brought reward. Desert quail, as gray as the bare earth, were dusting themselves in a shady spot. A bee, swift as light, hummed by. She saw a horned toad, the color of stone, squatting low, hiding fearfully in the sand within reach of her whip. She extended the point of the whip, and the toad quivered and swelled and hissed. It was instinct with fight. The wind faintly stirred the thin foliage of the mesquites, making a mournful sigh. From far up in the foothills, barely distinguishable, came the scream of an eagle. The bray of a burro brought a brief, discordant break. Then a brown bird darted down from an unseen perch and made a swift, irregular flight after a fluttering <b>winged</b> <b>insect.</b> Madeline heard the sharp snapping of a merciless beak. Indeed, there was more than life {{in the shade of the}} mesquites.|$|E

50|$|Bahiaxenos relictus is {{the sole}} {{member of the family}} Bahiaxenidae, a type of <b>winged</b> <b>insect.</b> It was only {{discovered}} and described in 2009 from relictual sand dunes associated with the Rio São Francisco in Bahia, Brazil.

It is known from only a single male specimen, and its biology is unknown.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{characteristic}} of the apterygotes is they are primitively wingless. While some other insects, such as fleas, also lack wings, they nonetheless descended from <b>winged</b> <b>insects</b> but have lost them {{during the course of}} evolution. By contrast, the apterygotes are a primitive group of insects that diverged from other ancient orders before wings evolved. Apterygotes, however, have the demonstrated capacity for directed, aerial gliding descent from heights. It has been suggested by researchers that this evolved gliding mechanism in apterygotes might have provided an evolutionary basis from which <b>winged</b> <b>insects</b> would later evolve the capability for powered flight.|$|R
50|$|Sisyridae, {{commonly}} known as spongeflies or spongillaflies, are a family of <b>winged</b> <b>insects</b> in the order Neuroptera. There are approximately 60 living species described, and several extinct species identified from the fossil record.|$|R
25|$|The {{subclass}} Apterygota (wingless insects) is {{now considered}} artificial as the silverfish (order Thysanura) are {{more closely related to}} Pterygota (<b>winged</b> <b>insects)</b> than to bristletails (order Archaeognatha). For instance, just like flying insects, Thysanura have so-called dicondylic mandibles, while Archaeognatha have monocondylic mandibles. The reason for their resemblance is not due to a particularly close relationship, but rather because they both have kept a primitive and original anatomy in a much higher degree than the <b>winged</b> <b>insects.</b> The most primitive order of flying insects, the mayflies (Ephemeroptera), are also those who are most morphologically and physiologically similar to these wingless insects. Some mayfly nymphs resemble aquatic thysanurans.|$|R
50|$|The larva of E. nostras has large {{jaws and}} a broad abdomen.
