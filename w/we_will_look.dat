500|$|Arsenal then {{travelled}} to the Reebok Stadium to play Bolton on 20 December 2003, {{the setting}} where their title challenge faltered eight months ago. Although they again picked {{up just a}} point, Wenger believed it was a useful one: [...] "Provided Bolton keep playing like that, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> back at this result and feel very happy. They {{are as good as}} a team as we have played." [...] On Boxing Day, Henry scored twice for Arsenal in a 3–0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three days later, the team played Southampton. The only goal of the match came in the first half: Henry's through pass found Pirès [...] "who slid the ball beneath the exposed Antti Niemi". The win meant Arsenal had gone half the season without losing and the team according to The Times had begun to [...] "establish an aura of invincibility". Arsenal ended the calendar year in second place, with 45 points from 19 matches. They were one point behind leaders Manchester United and three ahead of Chelsea.|$|E

She {{supported}} Stonewall {{during their}} [...] "It gets better..... today" [...] campaign to prevent homophobic bullying, and dedicated the music video to her song [...] "Firework" [...] to the It Gets Better Project. Perry told Do Something in November 2008 {{she was proud}} to be a gay activist, saying [...] "I've always been a very open-minded person, but I definitely believe in equality." [...] She confirmed that she voted against Proposition 8, an amendment (ultimately ruled unconstitutional) that legally defined marriage as a union solely {{between a man and a}} woman in California. In June 2012, Perry expressed her hopes for LGBT equality, commenting [...] "hopefully, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> back at this moment and think like we do now concerning [...] civil rights issues. We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That would be my prayer for the future." [...] In December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism on behalf of LGBT youth. On March 18, 2017, she received a Nation Equality Award from Human Rights Campaign for [...] "using her powerful voice and international platform to speak out for LGBTQ equality", with the organization further stating that [...] "Katy's message of inclusion and equality continues to inspire us and the world".|$|E

500|$|American {{officials}} said {{according to the}} New York Times that Hillary Clinton's increasingly cordial relationship with the young Pakistani foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar paid dividends in resolving the dispute between both countries over the Salala incident. A final agreement on the wording of Clinton's statement of her conversation with Khar came {{after a week of}} marathon talks that included two trips to Islamabad by General John R. Allen, the US commander in Afghanistan, and a quickly arranged weekend trip by Thomas R. Nides, the deputy secretary of state for management and resources. In recent weeks Nides and Pakistani Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh had spearheaded the negotiations to reopen the supply lines. After weeks of behind-the-scenes phone calls, e-mails and meetings between Nides and Abdul Hafeez Shaikh reached an agreement on the terms for the reopening of the NATO supply lines. Besides the US apology both sides agreed to the following: After initially demanding as much as $5,000 for each truck Pakistan dropped its insistence on a higher transit fee for each truck carrying NATO’s nonlethal supplies from Pakistan into Afghanistan and agreed to keep the fee at the current rate of $250. The Obama Administration will ask Congress to reimburse Pakistan about $1.2 billion for costs incurred by 150,000 Pakistani troops carrying out counterinsurgency operations along the border with Afghanistan. [...] "With the GLOCs open, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> to pay past coalition support fund claims," [...] Pentagon spokesman Captain John Kirby said, using a Pentagon acronym for the supply routes. The United States military reimburses by [...] "coalition support funds" [...] Pakistan for logistical, military and other support provided to American military operations against militants, but these payments have been suspended since Pakistan shut off the routes. More precisely the US halted paying the bills from Pakistan as tension rose between the two countries.|$|E

2500|$|Geological {{investigation}} of a feature begins with determining its structure, composition, age, and relationship with other features. The OWL does not cooperate. [...] It is expressed as an orientation in many elements of diverse structure and compositions, and even as a boundary between areas of differing structure and composition; there is yet no [...] understanding {{of what kind of}} feature or process [...] the [...] "ur-OWL" [...] could control this. [...] Nor are there particular [...] "OWL" [...] rocks which can be examined and radiometrically dated. [...] We are left with determining its age by looking at its relationship with other features, such as which features overlap or cross-cut other (presumably older) features. In the following sections <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> at several features which might be expected {{to have some kind of}} structural relationship with the OWL, and consider what they might tell us about the OWL.|$|E
2500|$|Gaussian {{beams of}} any beam waist w0 satisfy this wave equation; {{this is most}} easily {{verified}} by expressing the wave at z {{in terms of the}} complex beam parameter q(z) as defined above. There are many other solutions. As solutions to a linear system, any combination of solutions (using addition or multiplication by a constant) is also a solution. The fundamental Gaussian happens to be the one [...] that minimizes the product of minimum spot size and far-field divergence, as noted above. In seeking paraxial solutions, and in particular ones that would describe laser radiation that is not in the fundamental Gaussian mode, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> for families of solutions with gradually increasing products of their divergences and minimum spot sizes. Two important orthogonal decompositions of this sort are the Hermite–Gaussian or Laguerre-Gaussian modes, corresponding to rectangular and circular symmetry respectively, as detailed in the next section. With both of these, the fundamental Gaussian beam we have been considering is the lowest order mode.|$|E

On September 26, 2008, against a backdrop of growing economic turmoil caused by the Credit Crunch, David Leonhardt of The New York Times singled out a quotation made by Dorgan in 1999 during the US Senate's repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act.

2500|$|In 2001, the IMF {{conducted}} considerable {{research that}} opposes a transaction tax. On 11 December 2009, the Financial Times reported [...] "Since the Nov 7 [...] {{summit of the}} G20 Finance Ministers, {{the head of the}} International Monetary Fund, Mr Strauss-Kahn, seems to have softened his doubts, telling the CBI employers' conference: 'We have been asked by the G20 to look into financial sector taxes. ... This is an interesting issue. ... <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> at it from various angles and consider all proposals.'" [...] When the IMF presented its interim report for the G20 on 16 April 2010, it laid out three options: a bank tax, a Financial Activities Tax (FAT), and a third option (which was not promoted but not ruled out), a financial transaction tax. On 16 April 2011, the IMF stated, it does not endorse a financial transaction tax, believing it [...] "does not appear well suited to the specific purposes set out in the mandate from the G-20 leaders". However, it concedes that [...] "The FTT should not be dismissed on grounds of administrative practicality".|$|E
