5|$|Hurricane Rita is {{the fourth}} strongest Atlantic {{hurricane}} in terms of barometric pressure and one of three tropical cyclones from 2005 on the list, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> being Wilma and Katrina at first and sixth, respectively. However, with a barometric pressure of 895mbar (hPa; 26.43inHg), Rita is the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes Camille, Mitch, and Dean share intensities for the seventh strongest Atlantic hurricane at 905mbar (hPa; 26.73inHg). The tenth place for most intense Atlantic tropical cyclone is Hurricane Maria listed to have deepened to a pressure as low as 908mbar (hPa; 26.81inHg).|$|E
5|$|Khmer dialects, {{although}} mutually intelligible, {{are sometimes}} quite marked. Notable variations {{are found in}} speakers from Phnom Penh (Cambodia's capital city), the rural Battambang area, the areas of Northeast Thailand adjacent to Cambodia such as Surin province, the Cardamom Mountains, and southern Vietnam. The dialects form a continuum running roughly north to south. Standard Cambodian Khmer is mutually intelligible <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> but a Khmer Krom speaker from Vietnam, for instance, may have great difficulty communicating with a Khmer native of Sisaket Province in Thailand.|$|E

5|$|On 18 January 1919 the Paris Peace Conference began. The conference {{aimed to}} {{establish}} peace between the war's belligerents {{and to establish}} the post-war world. The Treaty of Versailles resulting from the conference dealt solely with Germany. This treaty, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> that were signed during the conference, each took their name from the suburb of Paris where the signings took place. While 70 delegates from 26 nations participated in the Paris negotiations, representatives from Germany were barred from attending, nominally over fears that a German delegation would attempt to play one country off against the other and unfairly influence the proceedings.|$|E

5|$|Alice {{remembers that}} an {{anti-virus}} {{is in the}} lab, but they find it missing. Spence remembers he stole and released the virus. He hid the T-virus and anti-virus on the train. Spence is bitten by a zombie, which he kills before trapping the survivors in the lab. He retrieves the anti-virus, but is ambushed and killed by a Licker. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, whose health is fading and who has been infected too long for the anti-virus to work reliably. As the Licker attempts to reach them, a power outage occurs. The lab door opens to reveal Kaplan forced the Red Queen to open the door. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the T-virus and kills a reanimated Spence before escaping <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the hull of Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} that Russian industry {{would not be able to}} complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{competitor}} on paper in 1988, Coates {{was supposed to}} only be a coach and was forbidden to compete. The Australian Skating Union had refused to select him as they wanted to allow younger athletes an opportunity to race. However, the AOF officially listed Coates as {{a competitor}} {{so that he could}} train <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> on the ice, and because the artificially inflated athlete count would entitle the Australian team to take more support staff. However, Coates was informed that the registration was only for show and that he was not to race. However, {{when it was time for}} his event, he put on a uniform, defied team orders and skated his best time ever. Henke publicly excoriated Coates in front of the cameras, but stopped when he found out that Prime Minister Bob Hawke had sent Coates a congratulatory message. However, Coates' new Australian record was only good enough for 26th place and ended his sixth and final Olympic campaign. His speed skating teammates Michael Richmond and Danny Kah managed two top 15 finishes each, and Medhurst was the only other Australian to place in the top 20.|$|E
5|$|Ann soon arrives, {{discovering}} Gil cowering in {{the cellar}} {{in a state of}} shock. Believing that he is beyond help, Gil at first refuses to see Dr. Hoffman, but after Ann's tearful pleading, Gil reluctantly agrees. During the examination, Dr. Hoffman orders Gil to remain in the house at all times as a precaution until he can return with help. Feeling guilty for leaving Trudy, Gil returns to the bar but is brutally beaten by George and his gang. Gil regains consciousness the next morning and discovers that Trudy, having felt sorry for him, brought him home to her apartment. George soon arrives and, upon seeing Gil, forces him at gunpoint out into the daylight. Transforming into the creature, Gil murders George in front of the horrified Trudy before fleeing into the hills. Returning to the house, Gil finds Ann, Dr. Hoffman and Buckell waiting there and returns to his normal human state. A disturbed Gil later admits to the murder, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> assuring him that he acted in self-defense, but when the police arrive with an arrest warrant, the hysterical Gil flees from the grounds in his car and accidentally hits a police officer.|$|E
5|$|Arsène Lupin III, the {{grandson}} of the fictional gentleman thief, Arsène Lupin, is considered the world's greatest thief, known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of his desired items. His right-hand man and closest ally is Daisuke Jigen, an expert marksman who can accurately shoot a target in 0.3 seconds. Although Lupin and Jigen frequently work as a two-man team, they are often joined by Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything, or Fujiko Mine, a femme fatale and Lupin's love interest. Although Fujiko usually works together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> she occasionally exploits Lupin's interest in her to steal the treasure for herself. Lupin and his gang are constantly chased by Inspector Koichi Zenigata of the ICPO, who has made it his life's work to arrest them, pursuing Lupin across the globe.|$|E

5|$|Edward II's {{refusal to}} pay homage to the French king was based on concern for his royal sovereignty, but also on fear of a {{potential}} resurgence of domestic resistance. For this reason, he sent his wife Isabella to negotiate with King Charles, who was her brother. The Queen departed for France on 9 March 1325, and in September she was joined by her son, the heir to the throne, Prince Edward. Isabella's negotiations were successful, and it was agreed that the young Prince Edward would perform homage in the king's place, which he did on 24 September. Not long after this, Edmund joined the queen and prince in Paris. A circle of opposition was emerging around the queen, including the exiled Roger Mortimer. Edmund, who had previously been steadfast in his support for his half-brother, now joined the plot against the king. Though he still distrusted Mortimer, his hatred for the Despensers seems to have been even greater at this point. When Edmund, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> ignored the king's order to return to England, his lands were confiscated in March 1326.|$|E
5|$|Faced with a numerically superior, {{but less}} {{experienced}} enemy, the Company assumed a defensive position, {{taking care to}} select a battleground that favoured them. They chose a naturally strong position, protected by a swamp which, according to Gregoras, they further enhanced by digging trenches and inundating them with water diverted from the nearby river. The Catalans themselves took up positions on dry ground behind the swamp, arranging themselves in a solid line, but the sources give no further details as to their exact disposition. The Athenian army {{on the other hand}} assembled at Lamia. On 10 March 1311, Walter of Brienne composed his testament there and led his army forth. On the eve of battle, the 500 Catalans in the Duke's service, stricken by conscience, went to him and asked for leave to rejoin their old comrades-in-arms, saying that they would rather die than fight against them. Walter reportedly gave them permission to leave, replying that they were welcome to die <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> At the same time, however, the Catalans' Turkish auxiliaries took up a separate position nearby, thinking the quarrel was a pretext arranged by the Company and the Duke of Athens to exterminate them.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{short-lived}} relationship with physiotherapist Justin Fuller (Ben Richards), Donna {{moves on to}} date hospital manager Bradley Hume (Scott Adkins). Their relationship is terminated by the discovery that Bradley has been running a pharmaceutical scam, resulting {{in the death of}} one of Donna's patients due to a morphine overdose. After entering into a scratchcard syndicate at work, Donna wins £20,000. She refuses to share her winnings <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> and resigns from her job, making plans to travel to Australia. On her last day, a patient with bi-polar disorder steals and re-distributes her money. Donna misses her flight, and is forced to remain in Holby. She goes on to begin an affair with consultant general surgeon Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon), despite the fact he is married. When Michael's wife Annalese (Anna-Louise Plowman) begins working at the hospital as a locum anaesthetist, she suspects that Michael has been unfaithful to her and confronts Donna, who confesses the affair and apologises profusely.|$|E
