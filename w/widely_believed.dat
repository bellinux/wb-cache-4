5|$|Although {{the movie}} {{is set in the}} fashion world, most {{designers}} and other fashion notables avoided appearing as themselves for fear of displeasing U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who is <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> to have been the inspiration for Priestly. Still, many allowed their clothes and accessories {{to be used in the}} film, making it one of the most expensively costumed films in history. Wintour later overcame her initial skepticism, saying she liked the film and Streep in particular.|$|E

Dean was <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> to have been killed until October 1950, when US forces captured a North Korean soldier named Lee Kyu Hyun near P'yongyang. Lee {{had been assigned to}} live with Dean for a month as an interpreter. Lee was interviewed throughout late 1950 but US military leaders still generally thought Dean was dead.|$|E

5|$|Franz Ferdinand was an {{advocate}} of increased federalism and <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> to favor trialism, under which Austria-Hungary would be reorganized by combining the Slavic lands within the Austro-Hungarian empire into a third crown. A Slavic kingdom {{could have been a}} bulwark against Serb irredentism, and Franz Ferdinand was therefore perceived as a threat by those same irredentists. Princip later stated to the court that preventing Franz Ferdinand's planned reforms was one of his motivations.|$|E
5|$|In several passages, {{he gives}} proof of {{independent}} observation (XXXIV:38, 46, 63, XXXV:17, 20, 116 seq.). He prefers the marble Laocoön and his Sons {{in the palace}} of Titus (<b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> to be the statue that {{is now in the}} Vatican) to all the pictures and bronzes in the world (XXXVI:37). The statue is attributed by Pliny to three sculptors from the island of Rhodes: Agesander, Athenodoros (possibly son of Agesander) and Polydorus.|$|E
5|$|It is also <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> that {{birth rates}} fell {{during the period}} too, meaning that {{the growth rate of}} the {{population}} fell relative to the natural death rate. Vansina, however, notes that precolonial societies had high birth and death rates, leading to a great deal of natural population fluctuation over time. Among the Kuba, the period 1880 to 1900 was actually one of population expansion.|$|E

50|$|Contemporary historians <b>widely</b> <b>believe</b> {{that the}} bombing {{was carried out}} by four KKK members, {{including}} Gary Rowe and known bomber Bill Holt.

5|$|It was <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> {{the film}} would win {{most of its}} Oscar nominations, but it {{received}} only the award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay), shared by Welles and Mankiewicz. Variety reported that block voting by screen extras deprived Citizen Kane of Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor (Welles), and similar prejudices were {{likely to have been}} responsible for the film receiving no technical awards.|$|E
5|$|On {{the next}} racing day, the other riders were {{reluctant}} to continue racing and asked the organisers for a postponement. French rider Jean Stablinski suggested that the race continue, with a British rider, whose team would wear black armbands, allowed to win the stage.

5|$|Radiocarbon dating {{determined}} that the papyrus is medieval, and further analysis of the language led most scholars to conclude it was copied from the Gospel of Thomas. The fragment's provenance and similarity to another fragment from the same anonymous owner <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> to be fake further supported a consensus among scholars that the text is a modern forgery written on a scrap of medieval papyrus.|$|E

I argue that this "received view " is wrong: methodological criticisms popular among philosophers are seriously misconceived, and the discussion in philos-ophy of science about these matters is largely disconnected from the real, empirically complex issues debated in science.

5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently {{been used as}} a model system for studying neurophysiology.

5|$|The U.S. {{military}} and government conducted many interrogations, asking if women {{had ever had}} sexual relations with another woman and essentially equating even a one-time experience to a criminal identity, thereby severely delineating heterosexuals from homosexuals. In 1952 homosexuality was listed as a pathological emotional disturbance in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. The view that homosexuality was a curable sickness was <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> in the medical community, general population, and among many lesbians themselves.|$|E
5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name.

40|$|An {{important}} part of solid modeling systems based on curved primitives is the representation and manipulation of algebraic plane curves with rational coefficients and points with algebraic coordinates. These objects are often approximated by floating-point numbers and spline curves, which are easy to manipulate, but are subject to accuracy and robustness problems. Exact computation can eliminate these numerical robustness problems, but efficient exact methods have not been available. Moreover, it is <b>widely</b> <b>believe</b> that exact arithmetic is impractical for manipulating curved primitives...|$|R

Seale {{writes that the}} bomb had been manufactured by Abu Nidal's technical committee, who had delivered it to Syrian air force intelligence. It was sent to London in a diplomatic bag and given to Hindawi. According to Seale, it was <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> that the attack {{was in response to}} Israel having forced down a jet, two months earlier, carrying Syrian officials to Damascus, which Israel had supposed was carrying senior Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|As a {{particularly}} conspicuous forest flower, T. grandiflorum was designated the provincial emblem of Ontario in 1937 (Flora Emblem Act), {{and as the}} state wild flower of Ohio in 1987. As a symbol of Ontario, a stylized trillium flower features prominently on the official flag of the province's French-speaking community. It is also frequently used by the Canadian Heraldic Authority to represent Ontario in grants of arms. Although a network of laws make picking wildflowers illegal in the province on any Crown or provincially owned land, it is not, unlike <b>widely</b> <b>believed,</b> specifically illegal (or necessarily harmful) to pick the species in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, a {{predominant}} {{feature of}} the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near Midtown Manhattan, dips down lower between 29th Street and Canal Street, then rises toward the surface again in Lower Manhattan. It has been <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and Financial District areas, and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas.

5|$|In England, ain't is {{generally}} considered a non-standard or illiterate usage, as it is used by speakers of a lower socio-economic class, or by educated people in an informal manner. In the nineteenth century, ain't was often used by writers to denote regional dialects such as Cockney English. Ain't is a non-standard feature commonly found in mainstream Australian English, and in New Zealand, ain't is a feature of Maori-influenced English. In American English, usage of ain't corresponds to a middle level of education, although it is <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> that its use establishes of lack of education or social standing in the speaker.|$|E

5|$|In later {{editions of}} the book, Darwin traced {{evolutionary}} ideas {{as far back as}} Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church Fathers and Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. Nature was <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life.|$|E

Physicians win roughly half of the cases that expert reviewers believe physicians should lose and nearly all of the cases that experts feel physicians should win.
