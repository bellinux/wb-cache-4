50|$|The Cumberland YMCA {{building}} is a three story <b>wedge-shaped</b> <b>brick</b> structure with a partially raised basement, built in 1925 in the Classical Revival style, located in Cumberland, Maryland, United States. It {{is an excellent example}} of institutional architecture of its time. At the time of its construction, it offered the only indoor swimming pool in the area.|$|E
50|$|East of Yonge Street, {{the street}} is for a few blocks a two-lane one-way east street angling further to the north. The corner here {{is the site of}} the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts theater. The north side is the Altius Group office {{building}}, with ground-floor retail. One block east is the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts theatre building on the south side, with a park along the north side. Along the south side to the east of the theatre are 19th Century commercial low-rise heritage buildings. At Church Street, the street intersects at an angle with Wellington Street (formerly Market Street). The intersection is notable for the Gooderham Building a <b>wedge-shaped</b> <b>brick</b> building between Wellington and Front. From Church Street, the road continues as a four-lane street of two-way traffic, with a central divider. The north side are recent low-rise condominiums, the south side a collection of 19th-century commercial buildings.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Elevated bite {{forces and}} reduced bone densities and {{dimensions}} associated with posterior {{regions of the}} maxilla cause relatively high failure rates when short dental implants are placed to substitute missing teeth. This study uses the finite element method to evaluate four distinctly different short implant designs (Bicon, Neodent, Nobel Biocare, and Straumann) for their influences on the von Mises stress characteristics within the posterior maxilla. Materials and Methods: Finite element models of the supporting bone and tooth crowns are developed based on computed tomography data, and implant geometries are obtained from manufacturers' catalogs. The finite element models are meshed using three-dimensional hexahedral and <b>wedge-shaped</b> <b>brick</b> elements. Assumptions made in the analyses are: linear elastic material properties for bone, 50 % osseointegration between bone and implant, and crown height-implant length ratio of 2 : 1. Results: Bicon's neck indentation produced reduced stress in the cortical bone {{when compared with the}} Nobel Biocare and Straumann systems. The increased taper of the Neodent design decreased the stress level in cancellous bone. Nobel Biocare's rounded thread crest and reduced thread pitch produced a smoother stress profile. Straumann's increased thread pitch produced elevated stress in the cancellous bone. Generally, stresses were concentrated in the crestal bone region around the implant neck, attributable to the inclined nature of the masticatory force. Conclusion: Nobel Biocare and Bicon systems are recommended for use in type 4 cancellous and cortical bone, respectively.

50|$|It {{was built}} {{sometime}} between June 23, 1813 and 1817 at a prominent intersection known as Robinson's Point, {{and is a}} three-story, load bearing <b>brick</b> <b>wedge-shaped</b> building with the bricks on the exterior laid in a Flemish bond pattern. It sits on an uncoarsed rubble foundation and has a full basement. The building housed a grain and feed storage and sales company until 1941. In 1983 the building underwent major rehabilitations, and is currently occupied by the Preservation League of New York State.|$|R
