5000|$|As {{the name}} implies, <b>wire</b> <b>nails</b> are formed from wire. Usually coils of wire are drawn {{through a series}} of dies to reach a {{specific}} diameter, then cut into short rods that are then formed into nails. The nail tip is usually cut by a blade; the head is formed by reshaping {{the other end of the}} rod under high pressure. Other dies are used to cut grooves and ridges. <b>Wire</b> <b>nails</b> were also known as [...] "French nails" [...] for their country of origin. Belgian <b>wire</b> <b>nails</b> began to compete in England in 1863. Joseph Henry Nettlefold was making <b>wire</b> <b>nails</b> at Smethwick by 1875. Over the following decades, the nail-making process was almost completely automated. Eventually the industry had machines capable of quickly producing huge numbers of inexpensive nails with little or no human intervention.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of cheap <b>wire</b> <b>nails,</b> the use of wrought iron for nail making quickly declined, as more slowly did the production of cut nails. In the United States, in 1892 more steel-wire nails were produced than cut nails. In 1913, 90% of manufactured <b>nails</b> were <b>wire</b> <b>nails.</b> Nails went from being rare and precious to being a cheap mass-produced commodity. Today almost all nails are manufactured from wire, but the term [...] "wire nail" [...] has come to refer to smaller nails, often available in a wider, more precise range of gauges than is typical for larger common and finish nails.|$|R

50|$|In April 2009 Herefordshire Archaeology {{excavated}} New Weir Iron Works at Symonds Yat (West) {{to establish}} how the iron works functioned between {{the start of}} smelting in {{and the decline of}} the works in the 1800s.

50|$|The {{three men}} founded the Empire <b>Wire</b> <b>Nail</b> Company to {{manufacture}} nails, {{operating out of}} John Gray's barn on Trumbull. Meanwhile, Needham invented another machine to make radiator chaplets (casting devices used to hold cores in place during a pour). Chaplets {{proved to be a}} more lucrative business than nails, and the company gradually shifted its production in that direction.|$|E
5000|$|In {{woodworking}} and construction, a nail is a pin-shaped {{object of}} metal (or wood, called a treenail or [...] "trunnel") {{which is used}} as a fastener, as a peg to hang something, or sometimes as a decoration. Generally, nails have a sharp point on one end and a flattened head on the other, but headless nails are available. Nails are made in a great variety of forms for specialized purposes. The most common is a <b>wire</b> <b>nail.</b> Other types of nails include pins, tacks, s, and cleats.|$|E
50|$|A {{memorandum}} {{appeared in}} Kusel in 1863, supporting a railway that would branch from the Palatine Ludwig Railway in Landstuhl and {{run through the}} Mohrbach, Glan and Kuselbach valleys to Kusel. It noted among other things that a <b>wire</b> <b>nail</b> factory and a textile factory were located in Altenglan and claimed that the nail factory could double its annual production of 10,000 Zentner if the railway was built. It was argued that, among other things, the railway construction would improve the rather poor economic and social conditions of the region.|$|E

50|$|The Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South King of the Deathmatch is {{an annual}} {{professional}} wrestling tournament running since 1997 {{in which a}} number of wrestlers compete in various deathmatches, in (for the most part) a single-elimination tournament {{which is similar to}} World Wrestling Entertainment's King of the Ring tournament. These tournaments include the typical weapons used in hardcore wrestling such as barbed <b>wire,</b> <b>nails,</b> thumbtacks, fire, and light tubes, and are known for their large amount of blood loss.|$|R
5000|$|Another inventor, William Edenborn, a German {{immigrant}} who later settled in Winn Parish, Louisiana, patented a machine which simplified {{the making of}} barbed wire and cut the unit price of production from seventeen to three cents per pound. His particular wire is the [...] "humane" [...] version that did not harm cattle. The original wire was sharp-teethed and contributed to western range wars. Edenborn's company in time supplied 75 percent of the barbed wire in the United States. A <b>wire</b> <b>nail</b> machine that he also patented reduced the price of wire nails from eight to two cents per pound.|$|E

50|$|Initial {{settlement}} {{concentrated in}} the Main Strasse neighborhood of Covington, but by the 1860 s and 1870s, the Germans began {{to move into the}} southwestern part of the city, a separate entity known as the City of Central Covington. St. Augustine was the fifth Catholic parish established in Covington and the original St. Augustine church was built in 1870. The Reverend Father Joseph Goebbels led the church in the 1870s and organized a <b>wire</b> <b>nail</b> factory to pay back the debt incurred in constructing the church. The enterprise was not successful and a number of parishioners lost their life savings in the venture. The parish was returned to a sound financial footing by Father Paul Abeln who was pastor from 1883 until his death in 1911.|$|E

50|$|The cut-nail {{process was}} {{patented}} in America by Jacob Perkins in 1795 and in England by Joseph Dyer, {{who set up}} machinery in Birmingham. The process was designed to cut nails from sheets of iron, while {{making sure that the}} fibres of the iron ran down the nails. The Birmingham industry expanded in the following decades, and reached its greatest extent in the 1860s, after which it declined due to competition from <b>wire</b> <b>nails,</b> but continued until the outbreak of World War I.|$|R

30|$|Akyildiz and Malkocoglu [8, 9] {{evaluated}} the screw and nail withdrawal strengths for five different tree species (beech, alder, chestnut, spruce, and pine). Tests {{were conducted in}} compliance with the Turkish Standard (TS) 6094 [10] and ASTM-D 143 [11] and ASTM-D 1761 [12] standards at two different moisture contents (MC) (12 and 30  %). The dimensions of screw were 4.5  mm in diameter and 40  mm in length. For common <b>wire</b> <b>nail,</b> the dimensions were 2.5  mm in diameter and 50  mm in length. The 12  % MC had significantly higher withdrawal strength (WR) than the 30  % for screws. In the case of nail withdrawal, the 12  % had significantly lower WR than the 30  %. The WR values of radial surfaces were found to be higher than the others. The least withdrawal strength values were found in the cutting ends. On the other hand, the highest screw and nail withdrawal strengths were obtained in the oriental beech, among the five tree species. The least withdrawal strength was found in pine and spruce for nail and screw, separately [8, 9, 13].|$|E

The result was pollution which began to affect Mayfield which lost its fashionable status. The housing erected during and after World War I was overwhelmingly for those with employment in the heavy industries.

The timber pigsty collar is intact but skewed toward the river. It measures about 1200 x 2400 mm suggesting it was a two- compartment shaft. Timbers were all about 400mm diameter.
