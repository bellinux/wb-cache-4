500|$|Ahsan Haque of IGN {{gave the}} episode {{a score of}} 8.2 out of 10, commending Chris's storyline and praising Stewie's {{temporary}} build, but criticizing the staleness of Meg's continued poor treatment. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave a much more critical review giving the episode a grade of a C. Heisler stated that neither of the storylines [...] "held any water", because they were [...] "ridiculously short". He also commented: [...] "I'm starting to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> show is even watchable anymore – 18 minutes of filler, 45 seconds of inspired silliness." ...|$|E

In 2005, TV Guide designated the Heidi Game at #6 on its list of the [...] "100 Most Unexpected TV Moments" [...] in history. Interviewed by the magazine, Jennifer Edwards, title star of Heidi, commented: [...] "My gravestone is gonna say, 'She was a great moment in sports.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Timmons' playing, with Lewis Powers on {{bass and}} Ron McCurdy on drums, was {{described}} by a Washington Post reviewer as [...] "flexible and adventuresome [...] Glossing over everything is an undeniable sheen of church music and spirituals." [...] In 1965 the same reviewer commented that Timmons was employing musicians who were of much lower ability: [...] "Timmons lacks a certain passion but I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> is not the fault of his sidemen." [...] Timmons started playing vibes in the mid-1960s. He occasionally played organ, but recorded only one track on that instrument – a 1964 version of [...] "Moanin'" [...] on From the Bottom. Recordings as a leader continued, usually {{as part of a}} trio or quartet, but, after joining Milestone Records around 1967, Timmons' album Got to Get It! featured him as part of a nonet, playing arrangements by Tom McIntosh.|$|E

500|$|... "Venus" [...] is a synthpop and dance-pop song {{consisting}} of four hooks. The structure and Gaga's vocal delivery {{are similar to}} that of singer David Bowie in his persona Ziggy Stardust, as well as Bananarama's 1986 single of the same name. Along with the Bowie-esque verses, there's one hook where the beat drops, then another hook where it starts building up, and finally the chorus is reached. When Bradley Stern from MuuMuse reviewed the single, he described the chorus as [...] "total pop euphoria" [...] with Gaga belting the lyrics, [...] "When you touch me I die just a little inside / I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> could be love!" [...] The song is written in the key of F minor and composed in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 122 beats per minute. Gaga's vocals range from F3 to E5, and the track follows a basic sequence of Em–D–Em–D in the first verse, G–D–Em–D in the second hook, Em–A–Em–A in the third verse, and finally Em–G–D–C in the chorus.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, scholar Philip Jenkins drew {{attention}} to a popular novel by James H. Hunter entitled The Mystery of Mar Saba, that first appeared in 1940. This novel presents some unusual parallels to the events associated with Mar Saba MS, that have unfolded in real life after 1958. Later, Robert M. Price also {{drew attention}} to this novel. In 2007, musicologist Peter Jeffery also published a book accusing Morton Smith of forgery, arguing that Smith wrote the Mar Saba document {{with the purpose of}} [...] "creat(ing) the impression that Jesus practised homosexuality". Some <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> accusation was made on the grounds that Smith himself was a homosexual, and had a well-established reputation as a sharp-witted cynic.|$|E
2500|$|The Broncos then {{defeated}} the Cleveland Browns 37–21 in the AFC Championship Game. This {{was the third}} time {{in the last four years}} that both teams faced each other for the AFC Championship, and the previous two resulted in two of the most famous games in NFL Lore: The Drive and The Fumble. In this game, the Broncos seemed to be in complete control at first, building up a 24–7 lead. But Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar rallied his team back with two third-quarter touchdowns, cutting the lead to 24–21 going into the 4th quarter. [...] Some observers began to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> game would become known as [...] "The Comeback". [...] However, Elway destroyed any chance of a Browns comeback by leading the Broncos 80 yards and scoring with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Sammy Winder on the first drive of the 4th quarter. Denver then scored field goals on each of their next two drives to put the game away. [...] Elway finished the game with 385 passing yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions, while also leading Denver in rushing with 5 carries for 39 yards.|$|E

2500|$|Women in Arab {{societies}} experience discrimination {{from the}} western world based upon many misconceptions {{and a lack of}} knowledge about the realities of their lives. As described previously, the themes of invisibility, lacking accurate representation in media that {{other parts of the world}} absorb, and conflation of identities, be it Arab/Muslim, anti-Zionist/anti-Semite, etc. The conflict occurring Israel and Palestine is a prime example of how these misconceptions create an incorrect understanding of the circumstances and experiences that women in this area encounter in their daily lives. In the article “Arabiya Made Invisible” [...] by Noura Erakat, Ms. Erakat illustrates how the concepts of anti-zionism and antisemitism are conflated to vilify and silence Arab women who support Palestine or denounce the occupation. She says,“The equation of anti-Semitism to anti-Zionism is systematically used as a silencing tactic. Anti-Semitism refers to the historic oppression and vilification of Jews that led to such tragedies as the Nazi-engineered Holocaust. Zionism is the theoretical notion that global Jewry should have a homeland, and in its practical application, Zionism has meant the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine.”Erakat goes on to discuss one protest that was hosted by a group of women of color at the Boalt Law School at UC Berkeley, a silent vigil protesting the occupation of Palestine, Iraq, and Haiti. A Jewish student wrote an op-ed for the school paper complaining that people should not be protesting Israel because Israel is accepting of homosexuals and gives women equal rights. She pointed out that it was ironic that women and gay men were at this vigil, while the places they were showing support of do not respect their rights as much as Israel does. At this point, Erkat gets to the meat of her argument. She says, “This student asserts that misogyny and gender inequality are inherent to Arabs in general and Palestinians in particular. According to her, “the Israeli occupation has nothing to do with Arab oppression of women and gays.” She fails to consider that structural violence waged on women in the context of war and occupation is the most extreme of its form. Moreover, she swiftly disregards the nexus of colonial occupation and patriarchy....when a nationalist movement becomes militarized [...] [...] [...] male privilege in the community usually becomes more entrenched...”The denial of the reality that the occupation and the threat it poses to women and gender equality in this opinion shows a prime example of how the incorrect characterization of Arab women can lead to further misconceptions and false justifications for situations of oppression. In a critique of Erakat's Students for Justice in Palestine group, a fellow student claims to be concerned as to whether his Palestinian peers at Berkeley would be comfortable exercising the freedoms they enjoy in Berkeley on the streets of Ramallah or Jerico. Erakat illustrates how this critique uses false concern to invalidate the real concerns that Palestinians living outside the occupied territories hold for their homeland, despite their differences in living situations and freedoms. She writes in response, “whereas the author wonders whether I would be able to comfortably walk around in tight jeans in Palestine, I <b>wonder,</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> man is truly concerned with my personal freedom, then why isn’t he protesting the twenty-five-foot Apartheid Wall built between my village of Abu-Dis and Jerusalem? If he really cares whether I can read Lolita comfortably, then shouldn’t he be more concerned that Palestinian children are denied a roof over their heads because of consistent home demolitions? His concern with my personal liberation seems disingenuous in light of the fact that he fails to mention Israeli military occupation as a significant, if not the most significant, factor contributing to the subjugation of Palestinian women’s rights. Instead, he uses the lack of gender equality in Palestine as a justification for its continued colonization.” ...|$|E
