5|$|Although {{the city}} of Mahabalipuram was {{constructed}} by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century AD, {{there is evidence that}} a small port might have functioned at the site even earlier.

The Sangam age poem Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai describes a port called Nirppeyyaru <b>which</b> <b>some</b> scholars identify with the present-day Mahabalipuram.

5|$|Before the Treaty of Lisbon {{came into}} force, the {{executive}} {{power of the}} EU was held by the Council: it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise.

This aspect has been changed by the Treaty of Lisbon, after which the Commission exercises its powers just {{by virtue of the}} treaties. Powers are more restricted than most national executives, in part due to the Commission's lack of power over areas like foreign policy– that power is held by the European Council, <b>which</b> <b>some</b> analysts have described as another executive.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months.

The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the expensive new battlecruisers, <b>which</b> <b>some</b> thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|Continuing a {{theme of}} his presidency, in 2006 Mosley called for Formula One {{manufacturers}} to develop technology relevant to road cars.

Mosley has announced a 10-year freeze on the development of engines, which would allow manufacturers to spend more of their budgets on environmentally friendly technology such as the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) introduced in 2009. In July 2008, he sent a letter to the Formula One teams, in which he called for the teams to propose future sporting regulations to address specific issues including reduced fuel consumption.|$|E
