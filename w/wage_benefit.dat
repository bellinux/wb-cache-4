25|$|International Harvester never {{recovered}} from the strike. In November 1981, IH asked the UAW for $100 million in wage and benefit concessions. Rising interest rates, demand weakened by the early 1980s recession, and high manufacturing costs pushed the company's total debt to a whopping $4.5 billion. On December 23, 1981, the company reached an agreement with 200 of its lenders to refinance $4.15 billion of its debt {{in a bid to}} avoid bankruptcy. On January 20, 1982, the UAW rejected Harvester's request for concessions because McCardell had just given $6 million in bonuses to salaried employees. But with the firm's financial condition rapidly worsening, the UAW opened negotiations in March 1982.

2500|$|The Pension Reform Law (1972) {{guaranteed}} all retirees {{a minimum}} pension {{regardless of their}} contributions and institutionalized the norm that the standard pension (of average earners with forty years of contributions) should not fall below 50% of current gross earnings. The 1972 pension reforms improved eligibility conditions and benefits for nearly every subgroup of the West German population. The income replacement rate for employees who made full contributions was raised to 70% of average earnings. The reform also replaced 65 as the mandatory retirement age with a [...] "retirement window" [...] ranging between 63 and 65 for employees {{who had worked for}} at least thirty-five years. Employees who qualified as disabled and had worked for at least thirty-five years were extended a more generous retirement window, which ranged between the ages of 60 and 62. Women who had worked for at least fifteen years (ten of which had to be after the age of age 40) and the long-term unemployed were also granted the same retirement window as the disabled. In addition, there were no benefit reductions for employees who had decided to retire earlier than the age of 65. The legislation also changed the way in which pensions were calculated for low-income earners who had been covered for twenty-five or more years. If the pension benefit fell below a specified level, then such workers were allowed to substitute a wage figure of 75% of the average wage during this period, thus creating something like a minimum <b>wage</b> <b>benefit.</b> According to one study, the 1972 pension reform “enhanced” the reduction of poverty in old age.|$|E

50|$|The strike {{severely}} impacted the company's financial status. International Harvester lost $257.2 {{million in}} the second quarter, {{for a total of}} $479.4 {{million in the}} first half of the year, while sales slid 47.3 percent. The company put its utility vehicle division up for sale to help cover the losses, and by the end of April 1980 was forced to take out loans which increased its short-term debt from $442 million to a staggering $1 billion.

5000|$|On November 9, 2012, the BCTGM went {{on strike}} at {{bakeries}} operated by Hostess Brands, to protest contract changes forced upon its members by a bankruptcy court. On November 16, 2012, after warning the union {{that it would be}} unable to continue operations unless employees returned to work, Hostess Brands, Inc., filed a motion to change its bankruptcy filing from one of reorganization to one of liquidation, shutting down the company. The liquidation resulted in the loss of 18,500 jobs., including approximately 6,500 BCTGM members. After announcing the company's liquidation, Hostess Brands published a notice announcing that the business is unprofitable under its current cost structure, much of which is determined by union wages and pension costs, describing their offer to the BCTGM as having included <b>wage,</b> <b>benefit</b> and work rule concessions and giving Hostess Brands’ 12 unions a 25 percent ownership stake in the company, representation on its Board of Directors and $100 million in reorganized Hostess Brands’ debt. The Teamsters Union had reached a deal with the Hostess, but BCTGM, representing bakery workers, refused to agree to concessions. Teamster officials were quoted as saying that the BCTGM had chosen [...] "to not substantively look for a solution or engage in the process". BCTGM President Frank Hurt issued a statement claiming that Hostess failed because its six management teams {{over the last eight years}} were unable to make it a profitable, successful business enterprise, and that despite a commitment from the company after an earlier bankruptcy that the resources derived from the workers’ concessions would be plowed back into the company, this never materialized. BCTGM President Hurt resigned from his position 6 weeks later effective 1 January 2013.|$|E
40|$|Throughout the 1990 s, {{government}} reports {{such as the}} Competitive Tendering and Contracting Report (Industry Commission 1996) and the Report of the Independent Commission to Review Public Sector Finances (McCarrey 1993), {{suggested that}} the contracting-out of government services would improve the delivery of public goods in Australia. This article reports {{on the findings of}} a case study of contracting-out of building maintenance services in the state of Western Australia in Australia. The study focuses on evaluating the impact of the contracting-out of these services on the wages and conditions of employees affected by moving from public sector to private sector employment. The study found differences in the employment conditions of white collar and blue collar workers. In general, the conditions of white collar workers improved but there was a marginal decline in the conditions of blue collar workers. The article concludes that while contracting-out created budgetary savings for government, these resulted partly from a reduction in <b>wages</b> and <b>benefits</b> of former blue collar staff, despite the best efforts of the Western Australian government to protect staff <b>wages</b> and <b>benefits.</b> The research makes an important theoretical contribution by arguing that the impact of contracting-out on staff <b>wages,</b> <b>benefits</b> and conditions is conditional upon the level of competition in the labor market for worker’s expertise. In "thick markets", <b>wages,</b> <b>benefits</b> and conditions are likely to reduce, due to strong competition for expertise.

40|$|In this paper, a joint {{model of}} wages, hazard {{of a job}} ending, and {{probability}} of holding employer-provided health insurance is estimated, taking account of unobservable person and job characteristics.

The explicit modeling of this correlation produces consistent estimates {{of the effect of}} tenure on wages and the effect of health insurance on mobility. Substantial levels of job-lock and significant annual returns to seniority are found. Increasing the job-specific probability of obtaining employerprovided health insurance from 60 % to 63 %, or increasing the job-specific hourly wage rate by $. 80, are both associated with an equivalent decrease in the hazard of the job ending.
