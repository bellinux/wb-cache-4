In Akoli, 46. 5 % of all buildings are classified highly vulnerable (BV).

5|$|Probably {{the easiest}} to recycle would be bismuth-containing fusible alloys {{in the form of}} larger objects, then larger {{soldered}} objects.

Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content, perhaps as bismuth phosphomolybdate, and then bismuth used in galvanizing and as a free-machining metallurgical additive.|$|E
