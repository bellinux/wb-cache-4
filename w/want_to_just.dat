It's my favorite kind of country music; it's like 1980s, 1990s country music, that throwback, two-steppin' style.

Drummer Phil Selway said: [...] "There was {{an awful lot of}} soul-searching [...] To do that again on another album would be excruciatingly boring." [...] Yorke, Radiohead's primary lyricist, said at the time, [...] "we could really fall back on just doing another miserable, morbid and negative record lyrically, but I don't really want to, at all.

500|$|The {{group also}} held an improvisational {{approach}} to live performances, which connected the band with jam band culture. [...] "Jazz and blues musicians {{have been doing}} this for decades, but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music," [...] said Haynes. [...] "We sure didn’t set out to be a [...] "jam band" [...] but those long jams just emanated from within the band, because we didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> play three minutes and be over," [...] said Allman.

He didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> bring everybody back, so that the audience go, 'Oh, look, it's Bill Fichtner again!' – he honestly thought, 'I'm not sure where to do that in the plot.' So if someday there's another chapter of this, maybe then Bill will be back. But I think the characters that are there, each of our moments that we have, are key to the storytelling, which is how it should be." ...|$|E

500|$|On the {{original}} LP's third disc, entitled Apple Jam, {{four of the}} five tracks – [...] "Out of the Blue", [...] "Plug Me In", [...] "I Remember Jeep" [...] and [...] "Thanks for the Pepperoni" [...] – are improvised instrumentals built around minimal chord changes, {{or in the case of}} [...] "Out of the Blue", a single-chord riff. The title for [...] "I Remember Jeep" [...] originated from the name of Clapton's dog, Jeep, and [...] "Thanks for the Pepperoni" [...] came from a line on a Lenny Bruce comedy album. In a December 2000 interview with Billboard magazine, Harrison explained: [...] "For the jams, I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> throw [...] in the cupboard, and yet at the same time it wasn't part of the record; that's why I put it on a separate label to go in the package as a kind of bonus." ...|$|E

Though Perry has occasionally voiced regret over not having changed the Daddies' name earlier in their career, he has nevertheless acquiescently embraced the name as his [...] "Holden Caulfield red hunting hat", while outright dismissing critics who choose to demonize the name based on literal interpretation than the jazz-era jive slang it drew from. [...] "It gives outrage addicts another soapbox they can jump up on", Perry said, [...] "If people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> look at it , then that's their problem, but I don't write it that way"..."I assure you we don't cruise high schools for dates".|$|E

He then said that he feels [...] "like situations are really going to be relatable to people." [...] He then stated that he [...] "didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> do another club song", and he didn't even wanted to follow these popular music standards. [...] "This is just what the fuck I want to do. Some people are going to like it. Some people are going to hate it; regardless, I'm just doing me." [...] Sean then said that Hall of Fame will be a far more inspirational and a more conceptually-driven project than his debut album. He even went on by saying the fact that he wants to teach, while making his lasting impact on peoples' lives with this second album. During an interview with Power 105, Sean stated that he would include some skits on the album to give it a [...] "classic feel".

Slater played in 259 games from 1976 to 1995, a then-record for {{offensive}} lineman (broken by Bruce Matthews in the 1999 season). He was {{the first player to}} play 20 seasons for one team, later matched by Washington Redskins cornerback Darrell Green and Detroit Lions kicker Jason Hanson and third all-time. He played for 24 quarterbacks and 37 running backs in his lengthy career, during which seven running backs reached for over 1,000 yards in a season and played in seven Pro Bowls. Former teammate Jim Everett stated [...] "Jackie Slater is proof they were playing football in the prehistoric days". [...] He was Dickerson's Hall of Fame presenter in 1999. In 2001, Slater was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Upon hearing his induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, fellow inductee and teammate Jack Youngblood said [...] "Jackie Slater didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> beat you, he wanted to dominate you.

500|$|However, Mercury and {{his inner}} circle of colleagues and friends, whom he felt he could trust, {{continually}} denied the stories, even after one front-page article published on 29 April 1991, showed Mercury appearing very haggard in what was by then a rare public appearance. It {{has been suggested that}} he could have made a contribution to AIDS awareness by speaking earlier about his situation and his fight against the disease. Mercury kept his condition private to protect those closest to him, with Brian May confirming in a 1993 interview he had informed the band of his illness much earlier. Filmed in May 1991, the music video for [...] "These Are the Days of Our Lives" [...] features a very thin Mercury, in what are his final scenes in front of the camera. The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, {{for an hour or two}} at a time. May says of Mercury: [...] "He just kept saying. 'Write me more.

500|$|With the {{introduction}} of Jason Wilkes and Frost, both considered [...] "outsiders" [...] as Carter {{was in the first}} season, co-showrunner Chris Dingess noted how their arcs in the season would be similar, yet different to Carter's, saying [...] "I think everyone, to get to that place of getting respect, has a different road to get there. Everyone makes different choices along the way that define that road and I think with these three characters, everyone has a distinct, separate path." [...] Atwell spoke specifically about the season's approach to diversity and prejudice, and noted that the series' crew had expanded to include African American and Asian writers as well as a female director. [...] "Since the first season heavily focused on a woman in a man's world," [...] Atwell said, [...] "we're now going into more diversity and we're investigating different prejudices within this time and one of them absolutely would have been race, as we all know....if you have a staunchly white male cast then it might be more accurate of the time, but it becomes less relatable to our audiences, especially when the Marvel world's so diverse." [...] On the racism issue, Butters stated, [...] "We didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> have an African-American character and not talk about that. That would have been very inauthentic." [...] As for the sexism Frost faces, Gina McIntrye and Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly saw similarities with Marvel's Jessica Jones when Frost is asked to smile by two different men in her flashbacks in [...] "Smoke & Mirrors". Towers said, [...] "The talent agent [...] may not be the Purple Man, but Whitney is certainly being ushered into a brainwashed mindset that will set her on a path she can't deviate from easily." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song.

Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E
