25|$|Hamilton won {{the pole}} {{position}} by posting the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his startline advantage {{heading into the}} first corner. His main championship rival Nico Rosberg suffered a <b>wiring</b> <b>loom</b> steering problem and started from the pit lane. Hamilton remained in the lead {{after the first round}} of pit stops before ceding it to Ricciardo for one lap when the second pit stop phase occurred. In the closing stages of the Grand Prix, Hamilton made his third (and final) pit stop for the change to tyres and rejoined narrowly ahead of Ricciardo in second. Vettel led the event for one lap until Hamilton passed him on lap 54 and maintained it to secure the race victory. There were four lead changes among three different drivers {{during the course of the}} race.|$|E
25|$|As {{night fell}} on the circuit, Toyota's lead {{extended}} to over a minute from the two remaining Audi entrants, while the OAK Ligier took over the LMP2 lead and ran away to nearly three minutes over the duelling Race Performance Oreca and Signatech Alpine. LMGTE Pro {{continued to be a}} close battle between Giancarlo Fisichella in the No. 51 Ferrari, Darren Turner's No. 97 Aston Martin, and No. 74 Corvette driven by Richard Westbrook, with the trio following one another nose to tail for a multitude of laps. The second Corvette dropped off the leading pace after problems with the car's air jack system required a lengthy pit stop. The No. 98 and No. 95 Aston Martin vehicles continued to hold sway over the LMGTE Am class, but around midnight Pedro Lamy relinquished the lead the No. 98 car had held for 86 consecutive laps {{when he came to the}} pit lane with smoke from the bonnet as the power steering system on the car failed. The No. 1 Audi of Kristensen was forced to the garage to replace failed fuel injectors after the race passed half distance, while Lieb Porsche's No. 14 car was forced to return to the pit lane on solely electrical power after suffering a second fuel pressure problem. As Nakajima drove the No. 7 Toyota into its ninth hour in the race lead, the car lost drive shortly after the Arnage corner and came to a stop alongside the barriers. An FIA-mandated piece of monitoring equipment had failed within the car and melted a <b>wiring</b> <b>loom</b> and was not able to be repaired by Nakajima, forcing Toyota to abandon the former race-leading car. The No. 2 Audi became the new leader ahead of the No. 20 Porsche and the recovering No. 1 Audi by three laps.|$|E

Rosberg's car had trouble as his steering wheel controls did not work, and although he made the starting grid after a steering wheel change and computer reset, the problem was not rectified. Rosberg was unable to leave his starting position because of a <b>wiring</b> <b>loom</b> and was forced to start from the pit lane. Kobayashi's car developed an oil pressure issue on the formation lap and pulled off the circuit, rendering him unable to start the race. When the race started, Hamilton maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first corner. Ricciardo's engine briefly lost power, preventing him from passing teammate Vettel. Alonso attempted to overtake both Red Bull cars around the outside but entered turn one too quickly, locked his front-left tyre, and drove onto the turn's run-off area. He emerged in second behind Hamilton and ceded third place to Vettel driving towards the seventh turn.|$|E
2500|$|Mercedes {{won their}} first World Constructors' Championship {{after taking a}} 1–2 finish in Russia. Lewis Hamilton won his second World Drivers' Championship after a season-long battle with {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg. Rosberg won the Australian and Monaco Grands Prix, and Hamilton the races in Malaysia, Bahrain, China and Spain after retiring in Australia. The Mercedes team's run of victories ended in Canada where Rosberg and Hamilton were simultaneously hit with a power unit failure that put additional strain on their brakes. Hamilton was {{forced out of the}} race and while Rosberg was able to continue, his performance deteriorated and he ultimately finished second. Mercedes returned {{to the top of the}} podium in Austria, with Rosberg leading Hamilton across the finish line for his third victory of the season. Hamilton reclaimed ground in the championship standings in Britain winning after Rosberg was forced out with gearbox issues. Rosberg claimed the win in Germany, while Hamilton recovered to third after an accident in qualifying saw him start from twentieth place. Hamilton finished third in Hungary after starting from pit lane, ahead of Rosberg. Rosberg had to settle for second place in Belgium after contact with Hamilton early in the race, which ultimately prompted Mercedes to retire Hamilton's car. Hamilton went on to claim his sixth win of the season in Italy, ahead of Rosberg. Hamilton reclaimed the championship lead with a win in Singapore, while Rosberg was retired with a broken <b>wiring</b> <b>loom.</b> Hamilton claimed the win in rain- and accident-shortened Japan, ahead of Rosberg. Hamilton won the inaugural race in Russia, once again ahead of Rosberg. The result was enough for Mercedes to secure their first World Constructors' Championship. Hamilton took his fifth consecutive win – for the first time in his career – in the United States, again ahead of Rosberg. Rosberg took his fifth win of the season in Brazil, with Hamilton finishing in second. Hamilton carried a seventeen-point advantage into the title-deciding [...] and went on to win the race while Rosberg struggled with electrical problems and finished outside the points.

50|$|Before {{the start}} of the Second World War, the Government decided to {{disperse}} certain production to locations away from obvious bombing targets. This led to a shadow factory at Cowbridge House, Malmesbury, Wiltshire, being established by Ekco. This was followed by other shadow factories at Aylesbury, Woking, Preston, and Rutherglen. The wartime headquarters of Ekco was based at Aston Clinton House in Buckinghamshire. Following the outbreak of war, the Southend-on-Sea factory was evacuated apart from the bakelite moulding shop whose large moulding presses could not be moved easily. Less than a year later, the empty factory was re-equipped to make <b>wiring</b> <b>looms</b> for aircraft such as the Avro Lancaster.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an additive manufacturing technology {{that has the}} potential to print plastic components with integral conductive polymer electronic circuits. This could have a major impact in the fields of robotics and mechatronics as {{it has the potential to}} allow large <b>wiring</b> <b>looms,</b> often an issue with complex robotic systems, to be printed as an integral part of the products plastic shell. This paper describes the development of a novel Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process in which the layers of material that make up the part are deposited as curved layers instead of the conventional flat layers. This opens up possibilities of building curved plastic parts that have conductive electronic tracks and components printed as an integral part of the plastic component, thereby eliminating printed circuit boards and wiring. It is not possible to do this with existing flat layer additive manufacturing technologies as the continuity of a circuit could be interrupted between the layers. With curved-layer fused deposition modeling (CLFDM) this problem is removed as continuous filaments in 3 dimensions can be produced, allowing for continuous conductive circuits...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2017, {{a further}} two year delay was announced, pushing the {{expected}} first delivery to mid 2020.

40|$|Combining {{advanced}} sensor technologies, with optimised {{data acquisition}} and diagnostic and prognostic capability, structural health monitoring (SHM) systems provide real-time {{assessment of the}} integrity of bridges, buildings, aircraft, wind turbines, oil pipelines and ships, leading to improved safety and reliability and reduced inspection and maintenance costs. The implementation of power harvesting, using energy scavenged from ambient sources such as thermal gradients and sources of vibration in conjunction with wireless transmission enables truly autonomous systems, reducing the need for batteries and associated maintenance in often inaccessible locations, alongside bulky and expensive <b>wiring</b> <b>looms.</b> The design and implementation of such a system however presents numerous challenges. A suitable energy source or multiple sources capable of meeting the power requirements of the system, over the entire monitoring period, in a location close to the sensor must be identified. Efficient power management techniques must be used to condition the power and deliver it, as required, to enable appropriate measurements to be taken. Energy storage may be necessary, to match a continuously changing supply and demand {{for a range of}} different monitoring states including sleep, record and transmit. An appropriate monitoring technique, capable of detecting, locating and characterising damage and delivering reliable information, whilst minimising power consumption, must be selected. Finally a wireless protocol capable of transmitting the levels of information generated at the rate needed in the required operating environment must be chosen. This paper considers solutions to some of these challenges, and in particular examines SHM {{in the context of the}} aircraft environment...|$|R
