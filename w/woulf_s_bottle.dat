40|$|The {{bottled water}} {{market in the}} U. S. is a recent development. Most water {{bottlers}} had traditionally positioned their products {{as an alternative to}} tap water. A few imported waters were sold for health reasons. The real growth in the bottled water market took place {{in the second half of}} 1970 s when Perrier was introduced as anon alcoholic, chic alternative to soft drinks and alcoholic beverages. Bottled water accounted for $ 3. 2 billion sales in 1992 out of a total beverage sales of $ 159 billion. Although bottled water is the smallest in terms of revenue, its gallonage market share stood at 8. 7 percent, and it is by far the fastest growing category of all beverages. The future prospects of the bottled water industry in the U. S. appear bright due to the deterioration of municipal water supplies, interest in healthy living, and the movement of bottled water into main stream as a refreshment beverage. Currently, there are over 700 bottled water manufacturers in the U. S. The leader among these is the Perrier Group with almost one-fourth of the market. Although the Perrier Group is a foreign firm, most of its sales are generated from U. S. brands that this company has acquired over the years. For example, its only imported brand Perrier, accounted for only 1. 7 percent of the market in 1993. Overall, imports have less than 4 percent of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>bottled</b> water market. This situation is no different than in the beer or soft drink industry. But there is one exception. While lead players in the beer and soft drink industries are U. S. companies, in the case of bottled water the three among the first five industry members are foreign firms, (i. e., Perrier Group, Suntory International and Evian), accounted for about one-third of industry sales.

Six laboratories participated in this inter-laboratory exercise and tested four chemicals, according to methods published earlier by the RIVM (1987) and ECETOC (1988). The most satisfactory and simple procedure to evaluate the degree of anaerobic mineralization is to combine two parameters that can easily be measured, i. e. the net gas production and the increase of dissolved inorganic carbon. This approach is more succesful than monitoring the evolved methane. Both procedures to wash the anaerobic sludge are effective in reducing the blank gas production due to the sludge. The blank values are all in the surprisingly small range of 20 and 100 ml per g sludge. Polyethyleneglycol- 400 is a suitable positive reference compound.

An {{outgrowth}} of the Ohio Bottle Co., {{it was the first}} of the large conglomerates, setting a tone that would be followed two decades later by giants like the Knox Glass Bottle Co. and the Owens-Illinois Glass Co. American Bottle set the standard for small-mouth bottle production in the beer and soda bottle field and forced competitors to invent or adopt semiautomatic machines (and eventually gob feeders to make them fully automatic) to try to keep up. The company pioneered the use of date codes to establish the year a bottle was produced, but their markings were so cryptic that many of them have been misidentified, misunderstood, or ignored by researchers for decades. Ironically, most of the marked bottles associated with American Bottle are the result of hand – not machine – production, and the company refrained from using date codes on machine-made bottles until 1916. The American Bottle Co. initiated the placement of date codes on the heels of bottles, a device for tracking the number of round trips that a soda or beer bottle makes. Because these bottles were intended to be returnable, the number of trips between the bottling plant and the consumer affects the profit margin. As financial planning became more important to the beverage industry, attention to the number of round trips became more important.

40|$|The {{capability}} of maintaining protozoa populations {{and reduce the}} accumulation of undigested material was investigated in two experiments using a stratified continuous-culture rumen fermenter (CCF) at various setting. The CCF consists of 8 x 2 L glass bottles, warmed at 39 °C and placed on a water proof magnetic stirrer. Bottles are closed with a rubber stopper, with an insert for the inflow of artificial saliva and have the outflow at the base. In Experiment 1 the effect of two stirring frequencies (continuous vs intermittent, S 1 and S 2) and two dilution rates (D, 1. 29 vs 1. 04) on the pH values and on the counts of the protozoa in the fermentation fluid was evaluated. The pH reached a steady state after 4 d of fermentation and <b>S</b> 1 <b>bottles</b> had lower pH than those S 2 (6. 50 vs 6. 57, P< 0. 001). The protozoa in the fermentation fluid (2. 92 * 105 /ml at the beginning) declined sharply in the first 2 d of fermentation and stabilized at about 13 * 103 /ml in the S 2 flasks, while the S 1 flasks had lower protozoa concentrations (about 0. 8 * 103 /ml, P< 0. 001). The D had no effects on pH and protozoa. Experiment 2 aimed to test effects of varying the daily diet (F) amount (15, 20, 25, 30 g DM/d of a diet with 50 : 50 forage: concentrate ratio) on the organic matter (OM) digestibility (OMD) and on the fermentative patterns. In 2 fermentation runs of 8 d each, bottles were inoculated with 450 ml of rumen fluid and 1050 ml of artificial saliva, which was then pumped {{at a rate of}} 78 ml/h. Lowering F reduced the OM accumulated inside the vessels (from 5. 06 to 0. 68 g/d; P< 0. 001) but did not affected the OMD for any of the dietary treatments (range between 0. 460 and 0. 510). The reduction of F led to a linear decrease (P< 0. 001) in volatile fatty acids concentration (from 65. 8 to 45. 3 mM), to an increase of acetate:propionate ratio (from 2. 91 to 3. 42) and to a reduction of pH (from 6. 4 - 6. 5 to 6. 0 - 6. 1).

40|$|Hazardous {{consumption}} of alcohol by teenagers is a significant public health problem in New Zealand. Concern about supply of alcohol to minors motivated 'Think before you buy under- 18 s drink', a campaign to reduce alcohol-related harm by discouraging inappropriate supply of alcohol by adults. Two intervention districts and a comparison district, in the South Island of New Zealand, were selected {{for the purpose of}} evaluating the campaign. Primary outcome measures were changes in the prevalence of parent supply to their teenager (13 - 17 years) for unsupervised drinking (SUD), and changes in the prevalence of binge drinking among teenagers. At baseline, 49 % of teenagers reported a recent episode of binge drinking. SUD in the past month was reported by 36 % of teenagers. Recent purchases of alcohol by under- 18 <b>s</b> were common (<b>bottle</b> shops: 16 %; pubs/bars: 11 %). In contrast to teenagers, only 2 % of parents reported SUD in the past month. Levels of binge drinking decreased in all three districts.

Discrepancies between teenager and parent reports of SUD {{may be due to the}} latter providing a socially desirable survey response and to differences in the interpretation of what constitutes adult supervision.

40|$|Deforestation {{and forest}} {{degradation}} {{is a global}} issue, especially in poor and developing regions of the world. In order to combat deforestation {{it is critical to}} enhance the productivity of forest restoration operations, which often involve planting of nursery-grown forest tree seedlings. Production of low quality stock types with deformed and spiraled root systems is a significant issue hindering successful restoration programs. Polybags (i. e., small plastic bags) are a common container type for seedling propagation in developing countries. However, polybags produce seedlings with spiraled and deformed root systems that reduce outplanting survival and performance. Use of discarded plastic water bottles could be a feasible alternative as a container type for seedling propagation in restoration programs. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} develop technology for repurposing discarded plastic beverage bottles to grow quality native plants, trees and shrubs to benefit agroforestry, reforestation, restoration, and conservation programs. Specific objectives for this study were accomplished in two separate experiments (CHAPTER 2) : 1) Container Comparison Experiment - to compare root and shoot development of seedlings grown in plastic bottles, modern nursery containers, and polybags; and 2) Bottle Modification Experiment - to examine the effects of root spiraling control techniques and container opacity on seedling morphological attributes. ^ In the Container Comparison experiment, seedlings of two species, Afghan pine (Pinus eldarica Medw.) and Arizona walnut (Juglans major [Toor. ] Heller), were grown in four container types; Coca-Cola® beverage bottle (Coke), modern container Deepot™ D 27 (D 27), Polyethylene polybag (polybag), and Sam 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Club® water <b>bottle</b> (Sams). At the first sampling period in August, Arizona walnut seedling shoot height, shoot dry biomass, and root dry biomass were all significantly greater in D 27 containers compared to Coke bottles and polybags, while Sams bottles did not differ among treatments. Afghan pine seedling shoot height was significantly greater for seedlings grown in the Sams bottles compared to polybags, while Coke bottles and D 27 did not differ among treatments. Root fibrosity was greater for seedlings grown in both Coke and Sams bottles compared to D 27 and polybags. Similarly, the number of lateral roots was greater in Coke bottles compared to D 27 and polybag containers. At the final measurement period (November), significant differences among treatments were found for all root morphological responses; for both species, seedlings grown in plastic bottles and modern containers had significantly less spiraled roots compared to the polybag. Seedling shoot and root development in plastic bottles at the end of the growing season was equal to or greater than that of the modern container. First year field height and diameter of Arizona walnut and Afghan pine were similar among containers. Similarly, first year field survival of both species was not affected by container type and was 100...|$|R
