500|$|During {{his ninth}} season in 1966, Taylor did not sign a new one-year {{contract}} and instead played out his option; {{he made no}} secret that it was likely his last season with the Packers. He caught a career-high 41 passes that year but recorded the fewest rushing yards since his second season. The Packers finished atop the Western Division with a 12–2 record and defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the 1966 NFL Championship Game for their fourth NFL title in six years. In January 1967, Taylor and the Packers played in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game, known retroactively as Super Bowl I, in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. They easily defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 35–10. Taylor was the top rusher of the game with 56 rushing {{yards and a touchdown}} on a Packer Sweep play, with his score being the first rushing touchdown in Super Bowl history.

Rehearsing in Broadhurst Gardens in London, there was the looming prospect of a new album, although their priority {{at that time was}} the creation of new material. In a band meeting at drummer Nick Mason's home in Camden, bassist Roger Waters proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters' idea was for an album that dealt with things that [...] "make people mad", focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett. The band had explored a similar idea with 1969's The Man and The Journey. In an interview for Rolling Stone, guitarist David Gilmour said: [...] "I think we all thought – and Roger definitely thought – {{that a lot of the}} lyrics that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> using were a little too indirect.
