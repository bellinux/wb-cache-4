25|$|As the {{orientation}} of Earth's orbit changes, each season will gradually start earlier in the year. Precession means the Earth's nonuniform motion (see above) will affect different seasons.

However it seems Japan is pressing forward now with the GCOM earth observation satellites as successors to the ADEOS missions. First launch is planned for 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Consider {{the case}} {{where there is no}} sentient observer, i.e. no mind around to observe the experiment.

25|$|When {{two people}} look at two {{different}} detectors that scan entangled particles, both observers will enter an indefinite state, as with one observer. These results need not agree – the second observer's mind {{does not have to}} have results that correlate with the first's. When one observer tells the results to the second observer, their two minds cannot communicate and thus will only interact with the other's body, which is still indefinite. When the second observer responds, its body will respond with whatever result agrees with the first observer's mind. This means that both observer's minds <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of the wavefunction that always get the expected results, but individually their results could be different.|$|E
25|$|Female queen snakes will {{be fully}} sexually mature at three years of age, males at two years. Breeding {{takes place in the}} spring and autumn months. If mating was in the autumn, the female can delay giving birth till spring, storing the energy she will need through the months that she <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> period of brumation. This snake is ovoviviparous, the female giving birth to live young after {{carrying}} the eggs within her body. This differs from oviparous and viviparous snakes. Litter size can vary from 5 to 20, and the time for an individual birth is from 1.5 to 2.5 minutes. Time between individual births is 4 minutes to 1 hour, with the average time being 11 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} life threat due to GHB overdose (with {{or without}} other substances) is respiratory arrest. Other relatively common {{causes of death}} due to GHB ingestion include aspiration of vomitus, positional asphyxia, and trauma sustained while intoxicated (e.g., motor vehicle accidents while {{driving under the influence}} of GHB). The risk of aspiration pneumonia and positional asphyxia risk can be reduced by laying the patient down in the recovery position. People are most likely to vomit as they become unconscious, and as they wake up. It is important to keep the victim awake and moving, who must not be left alone due to the risk of death through vomiting. Frequently they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good mood but this does not mean they are not in danger.

25|$|After one saros, the Moon {{will have}} {{completed}} roughly an integer number of lunar orbit cycles and synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods (241, 223, 242, and 239) and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical: the Moon {{will have the}} same phase and be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth. In addition, because the saros is close to 18 years in length (about 11 days longer), the earth will be nearly the same distance from the sun, and tilted to it in nearly the same orientation (same season). Given the date of an eclipse, one saros later a nearly identical eclipse can be predicted. During this 18-year period, about 40 other solar and lunar eclipses take place, but with a somewhat different geometry. One saros equaling 18.03 years is not equal to a perfect integer number of lunar orbits (earth revolutions with respect to the fixed stars of 27.32166 days sidereal month), therefore, even though the relative geometry of the Earth–Sun–Moon system will be nearly identical after a saros, the Moon <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slightly different position with respect to the stars for each eclipse in a Saros series.

Parts of the nobility also held Dudley responsible for Elizabeth's failure to marry, and plots to assassinate him abounded. In March 1560 de Quadra informed PhilipII: [...] "Lord Robert told somebody … that if he live another year he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very different position from now. … They say that he thinks of divorcing his wife."
