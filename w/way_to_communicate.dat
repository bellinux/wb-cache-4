5|$|On 7 September 1909 two {{visitors}} were left stranded {{at the top}} of the tower as the final lift car of the night descended without them. The woman and twelve-year-old child were not noticed during the final round of inspection and so, without a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> with anyone on the ground, they spent the night on the tower until 10am the following morning. They did not appear too concerned by the ordeal and left without giving their names to officials.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate.</b> You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.|$|E

However, the road was never built; first because Guatemalan and Belizeans could not reach an agreement of the exact location for the road, and later because the conservatives lost power in Guatemala in 1871, and the liberal government declared the treaty void.|$|E

25|$|The Devanāgarī script in Bollywood film titles is used {{mostly by}} Hindi {{speakers}} while the Perso-Arabic script is used primarily by Urdu speakers. The language used in Bollywood films is Hindi, {{but can be}} understood by Urdu speakers alike. Since {{a significant number of}} Indians cannot read the Devanāgarī script as India has a diverse linguistic landscape and some people do not speak Hindi, English, which is written in the Latin alphabet, often becomes the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> among Indians who speak different languages. For these reasons, the Roman script is used for most Bollywood film titles, alongside usual Hindi script and occasionally Urdu script, although instances of Urdu script used in Hindi films is becoming increasingly rare.|$|E
25|$|Olivia is a 29-year-old FBI Special Agent {{assigned}} to a multi-agency task force of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security called the Fringe Division, after her partner and lover, John Scott, is exposed to a flesh-dissolving agent. Both Agent Broyles and Nina Sharp consider her to have much potential and talent, the latter even hoping to bring her on as an employee of Massive Dynamic. An experiment by Dr. Bishop to link her to the dying John Scott's mind {{in order to learn}} what he knew about his condition results in Olivia gaining part of his consciousness, causing her mind to begin integrating and purging the foreign consciousness. This results in Olivia mistaking John Scott's memories for her own.

25|$|Chavacano or Chabacano is a Spanish-based creole {{language}} and known in linguistics as Philippine Creole Spanish. Chabacano is originally spoken by {{majority of the}} Caviteños that lived in Cavite City and Ternate after {{the arrival of the}} Spaniards three centuries ago. The various dialects of Chabacano were formed out of necessity like all languages, though scholars and laypersons disagree about exactly when and where it all began. The various language groups working at the Cavite naval base needed a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> with each other, and to the soldiers who were barking the orders in less-than-genteel Spanish. It was from this situation that Cavite Chabacano began as a simplified form of Spanish – a pidgin language that later developed into a mixed, or creole language. The fact that the first Chabacanos learned their Spanish from the coarse language of soldiers is probably why they were called Chabacanos in the first place.|$|E

25|$|The {{human need}} for art, on this view, {{stems from the}} need for {{cognitive}} economy. A concept is already a sort of mental shorthand standing for {{a large number of}} concretes, allowing a human being to think indirectly or implicitly of many more such concretes than can be held explicitly in mind. But a human being cannot hold indefinitely many concepts explicitly in mind either—and yet, on the Objectivist view, needs a comprehensive conceptual framework to provide guidance in life. Art offers {{a way out of this}} dilemma by providing a perceptual, easily grasped means of communicating and thinking about a wide range of abstractions, including one's metaphysical value-judgments. Objectivism regards art as an effective <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> a moral or ethical ideal. Objectivism does not, however, regard art as propagandistic: even though art involves moral values and ideals, its purpose is not to educate, only to show or project. Moreover, art need not be, and usually is not, the outcome of a full-blown, explicit philosophy. Usually it stems from an artist's sense of life (which is preconceptual and largely emotional).|$|E

25|$|Instead of worshipping every animal of a {{particular}} species, a few animal cults would select one specific animal, chosen because of its special markings, to be the totem of the particular god. Each sacred animal was pampered and cared for until its death, when elaborate burial proceedings took place. The animal was then mummified {{as a sign of}} respect to the god. Next, a new symbolic animal was chosen. Only one animal at a time would be chosen as the sacred one. These animal cults reached the pinnacle of popularity during the Late and Graeco-Roman Periods. The cycle of selecting a new totem animal continued for hundreds of years. Though the animals were undoubtedly considered sacred, Egyptians did not worship the individual animals themselves, but rather the invisible deity believed to be present within the animal symbolizing the deity. In certain cases, such as the Apis bull, the animal could even be a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> the desires of the god. The Apis bull cult was the main source of this type of religious animal mummy in ancient Egypt, as most other animals were mummified in large quantities for religious offerings.|$|E
