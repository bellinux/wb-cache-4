As Aristotle claims in his Metaphysics: [...] "To say that that <b>which</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> and that <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>is,</b> is a falsehood; therefore, to say that <b>which</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is,</b> and that <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>is</b> true".|$|R
