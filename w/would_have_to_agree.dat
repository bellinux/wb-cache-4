25|$|After the 1985 season, the White Sox {{came close}} to trading Fisk to the New York Yankees for {{designated}} hitter Don Baylor. Baylor was unhappy with the Yankees since he did not play every day as he wanted (despite being the team's regular DH) and asked to be traded. The potential deal was complicated in that the White Sox would have to re-sign Fisk, a free agent, and that both players <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to the trade. Negotiations between the two teams ended when {{they were unable to}} reach an agreement. The White Sox re-signed Fisk, who remained with the club until the end of his career. During spring training in 1986, the Yankees traded Baylor to the Boston Red Sox for designated hitter Mike Easler.|$|E
25|$|The Munich Agreement of 1938 did {{not last}} for long. In March 1939 the German {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia began with the invasion of Bohemia and Moravia, leaving Slovakia as a German puppet state. Lithuania was forced {{to give up its}} Klaipėda Region (Memelland). Formal demands were made for the return of the Free City of Danzig to Germany, even though its status was guaranteed by the League of Nations. In early 1939 Hitler proposed Poland an alliance on German terms, with an expectation of compliance. The Polish government <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to Danzig's incorporation by the Reich and to an extraterritorial highway passage connecting East Prussia with the rest of Germany through the so-called Polish Corridor (an area linking the Polish mainland with the Baltic Sea). Poland would join an anti-Soviet alliance and coordinate its foreign policy with Germany, thus becoming a client state. The independence-minded Polish government was alarmed and a British guarantee of Poland's independence was issued on 31 March 1939. Reacting to this act and to Poland's effective rejection of the German demands, Hitler renounced the existing German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact on April 28.|$|E
500|$|As the {{negotiations}} continued into 1996, a panel appointed by Houston mayor Bob Lanier reported that {{building a new}} arena was [...] "essential to keep pro sports in Houston". After Watson rejected a contract buyout proposal of $30 million, the Rockets filed a legal challenge against their lease, stating the [...] "need {{to be able to}} buy out" [...] of the lease. However, the city of Houston filed a counterclaim to force the Rockets to stay at the Summit, saying that if the Rockets did not honor their contract, then they might [...] "have no incentive to honor any new agreement with the city of Houston to play in a new downtown sports arena". The validity of the lease was eventually upheld, and in April 1997, Lanier announced that the Rockets and Watson <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to share control of the new arena equally, or lose access to it altogether. After both parties agreed to the terms, a bill that authorized increased taxes to pay for a new arena was signed into law in July, by then-Governor George W. Bush.|$|E

50|$|Subsequent {{attempts}} (Meech Lake Accord, Charlottetown Accord) to try {{to appease}} the government of Quebec failed {{in part due to}} First Nations opposition. It has never been in dispute that First Nations <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> voluntarily <b>agree</b> with their formal treaty partner, the Canadian Crown, to modify the treaties.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, Bliss {{was given}} a 10-year show-cause order for what the NCAA called [...] "a blatant and {{sweeping}} disregard" [...] of NCAA rules. If he had been hired by an NCAA member school in an athletic capacity before the penalty had expired in 2015 (he hadn't been hired), Bliss <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> abide by any restrictions the NCAA infractions committee imposed on him, and then report back to the NCAA in writing every six months {{for the duration of}} the order or until the end of his employment. Bliss's prospective employer <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> show cause for why Bliss <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> restrictions imposed on his duties. The penalty is the most severe punishment the NCAA can hand a coach. Ash was hit with a five-year show-cause order. Another assistant, Rodney Belcher, was hit with a seven-year show-cause order for lying about recruiting violations committed in the course of bringing Dennehy to Baylor.|$|R
500|$|After Jackson's {{acquisition}} of ATV Music Publishing, his record label's owner, CBS, was negotiating {{the sale of}} its record division in an unrelated deal. The record company was renamed Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. Following hurriedly arranged meetings and disagreements over the selling price, a deal was sealed by Jackson during a concert in Tokyo. Upon seeing {{the success of this}} sale, Japanese corporation Sony sought to break away from its core business of hardware manufacturing and diversify into music, films and games. Looking for further opportunities, the company aimed to expand its music publishing interests. The Japanese corporation, since it wanted to diversify in the media, offered Jackson $90million for a 50% stake in the ATV catalogue via a merger with Sony Music. Through the agreement, Jackson would {{become one of the most}} important shareholders in Sony. Jackson gladly accepted; he had essentially acquired half ownership of the Beatles' songs for a large profit. Jackson's own songs were not included in the deal. Sony and ATV having merged, the new company was named Sony/ATV Music Publishing and became the second largest music publisher in the world. Michael P. Schulhof, President and CEO of Sony Corporation of America, welcomed the merger and praised Jackson for his efforts in the venture. [...] "Michael Jackson is not only the most successful entertainer in history; he is also an astute businessman. Michael understands the importance of copyrights and the role they play in the introduction to new technologies." [...] He added that Jackson recognises Sony's [...] "leadership in developing and realizing new technologies that serve to expand the creative horizon of artists such as himself". Administrative expertise was provided by Sony, who installed Paul Russell as chairman. Jackson was a company director and attended board meetings regularly. As each party in the arrangement held the power of veto, both sides <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> on a decision before it could be made. If neither party agreed on a decisions, they would not be implemented.|$|E
2500|$|A ketannah (literally meaning [...] "little [...] ") was any girl {{between the}} age of 3 years and that of 12 years plus one day; he could arrange a {{marriage}} for her in her best interests. However, after reaching {{the age of}} maturity, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to the marriage to be considered as married. If the father was dead or missing, the brothers of the ketannah, collectively, had the ability , as had her mother. In these situations, a ketannah would always {{have the right to}} annul her marriage, even if it was the first.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order that}} the Daimler {{licences}} could be transferred from Simms to the new company, all the former partners <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to the transfer. By this time, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach had withdrawn from Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft's business to concentrate on cars and engines for them. [...] Simms offered to pay DMG £17,500 for the transfer and for a licence for Daimler and Maybach's Phénix engine, which DMG did not own. [...] Simms therefore insisted that the transfer be {{on the condition that}} Daimler and Maybach rejoined DMG. This was agreed in November 1895 and the Daimler-Maybach car business re-merged with DMG's. Daimler was appointed DMG's General Inspector and Maybach chief Technical Director. At the same time Simms became a director of DMG but did not become a director of the London company. According to Gustav Vischer, DMG's business manager at the time, Simms getting Daimler to return to DMG was [...] "no mean feat".|$|E

2500|$|Watford Leisure's Annual General Meeting {{was held}} on 15 December 2009. That meeting began with {{chairman}} Jimmy Russo, and fellow directors Vince Russo and Robin Williams resigning from the board. Former Watford manager Graham Taylor was appointed interim chairman. VGS requested immediate repayment of the outstanding loan balance. The club received an offer from Fordwat to underwrite a rights issue worth £7.5m, but revealed that for this plan to work VGS <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to suspend the loan repayment, indicating {{that they would be}} placed into administration unless agreement were reached. VGS refused to do so, and Jimmy Russo stated that unless something changed, VGS were left with no option but {{to begin the process of}} placing the club in administration. However, administration was avoided when Fordwat paid VGS the money on 21 December 2009, and the club announced two days later that it would borrow money from Elton John's [...] "Playing for Players" [...] concert to fund its running costs until it received the money from the rights issue.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, {{professor}} and New York Times writer Jay Dolan critiqued Generations for not talking more about class, race and sex, to which Neil Howe replied that they [...] "are probably generalizations not even {{as effective as}} a generation {{to say something about}} how people think and behave. One of the things to understand is that most historians never look at history in terms of generations. They prefer to tell history as a seamless row of 55-year-old leaders who always tend to think and behave the same way -- but they don't and they never have. If you look at the way America's 55-year-old leaders were acting in the 1960s -- you know, the ebullient and confidence of the JFKs and LBJs and Hubert Humphreys -- and compare them with today's leaders in Congress -- the indecision, the lack of sure-footedness -- I think you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> that 55-year-olds do not always act the same way and you're dealing with powerful generational forces at work that explain why one generation of war veterans, war heroes, and another generation which came of age in very different circumstances tend to have very different instincts about acting in the world.” ...|$|E
60|$|The news of {{the altered}} {{condition}} of things followed Clyde with leisurely persistence from one place of call to another, and at last ran him to a standstill somewhere in the Orenburg Steppe. He would have found it exceedingly difficult to analyse his feelings on receipt of the tidings. The Fates had unexpectedly (and perhaps just a little officiously) removed an obstacle from his path. He supposed he was overjoyed, but he missed the feeling of elation which he had experienced some four months ago when he had bagged a snow-leopard with a lucky shot after a day’s fruitless stalking. Of course he would go back and ask Vanessa to marry him, but he was determined on enforcing a condition; on no account would he desert his newer love. Vanessa <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to come out into the Wilderness with him.|$|E
50|$|Looking back on {{the entire}} incident, I now find it {{fascinating}} and somehow uplifting that the public broadcasting network in Israel <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> finance and broadcast a film that investigated the horrors inflicted by Israeli forces on the Palestinians.

60|$|It struck Farnie, as it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> struck most people, that if {{this was}} Monk's idea of strict business, there were the makings of no {{ordinary}} financier in him. But to get his two pounds he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> anything. And the end of term seemed a long way off.|$|R
50|$|Pace was a {{free agent}} in 2005 and {{explored}} the possibility of signing with another team. The Rams placed the franchise tag on Pace again. In March, he visited the Houston Texans. The problem for Pace and the Texans was that if they work out an agreement, the Texans <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with the Rams on a compensation package, which would be two first-round draft choices which the Rams would be entitled to under the franchise-player rules. However, the day before a deadline, the Pace accepted a seven-year, $52.9 million deal. The deal included $18 million in first-year salary and bonus.|$|R
60|$|General Sherman had met Mr. Lincoln at City Point {{while visiting}} there {{to confer with}} me about our final movement, and knew what Mr. Lincoln had said to the peace commissioners when he met them at Hampton Roads, viz.: that before he could enter into {{negotiations}} with them they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to two points: one being that the Union should be preserved, and the other that slavery should be abolished; {{and if they were}} ready to concede these two points he was almost ready to sign his name to a blank piece of paper and permit them to fill out the balance of the terms upon which we would live together. He had also seen notices in the newspapers of Mr. Lincoln's visit to Richmond, and had read in the same papers that while there he had authorized the convening of the Legislature of Virginia.|$|E
60|$|Two {{human beings}} can not live {{together}} in peace without laws--laws innumerable. Everything that either, in consideration of the other's wish or welfare, abstains from is inhibited by law, tacit or expressed. If there were {{in all the world}} none but they--if neither had come with any sense of obligation toward the other, both clean from creation, with nothing but brains to direct their conduct--every hour would evolve an understanding, that is to say, a law; every act would suggest one. They <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> not to kill nor harm each other. They must arrange their work and all their activities to secure the best advantage. These arrangements, agreements, understandings--what are they but laws? To live without law is to live alone. Every family is a miniature State with a complicate system of laws, a supreme authority and subordinate authorities down to the latest babe. And as he who is loudest in demanding liberty for himself is sternest in denying it to others, you may confidently go to the Maison Vaillant, or the Mosthaus, for a flawless example of the iron hand.|$|E
50|$|Wednesday 28 February 1996: After {{a summit}} in London, the British and Irish prime ministers {{set a date}} (10 June 1996) {{for the start of}} all-party talks, and stated that {{participants}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to abide by the six Mitchell Principles and that there would be preparatory 'proximity talks'.|$|E

5000|$|But {{the strip}} doesn't assert that. That's the {{assumption}} that adults make because nobody else sees him, sees Hobbes, {{in the way that}} Calvin does. Some reporter was writing a story on imaginary friends and they asked me for a comment, and I didn’t do it because I really have absolutely no knowledge about imaginary friends. It would seem to me, though, that when you make up a friend for yourself, you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> somebody <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with you, not to argue with you. So Hobbes is more real than I suspect any kid would dream up.|$|R

50|$|Buyer {{agency can}} exist {{exclusively}} (where a brokerage firm chooses to only represent buyers and never sellers, as an exclusive buyer agent) or, in a full-service company, by offering buyer agency to buyers who become clients.
