25|$|In 1971, Ehart and Hope {{left the}} group, and Livgren {{reworked}} {{the band and}} continued it under the name Kansas. (This group later became known by fans as Kansas II and is the lineup that reformed decades later as Proto-Kaw). Kansas II continued to perform Livgren's original works that fused experimental rock with psychedelia and jazz. During this time, Kansas II recorded a demo cassette that was released commercially 30 years later. Kansas II generated a loyal fan following, and the built-in audience helped the band secure concert bookings. However, financial problems plagued the band, and after a record deal with Jefferson Airplane's label failed to materialize and an old school bus broke down while the band <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> touring, the band dissolved in 1973.|$|E

25|$|In 1951, Jones won a {{scholarship}} to Seattle University, where a young Clint Eastwood also a music major there watched him play in the college band. After only one semester, Jones transferred {{to what is now}} the Berklee College of Music, in Boston, on another scholarship. (As of 2016, Jones's application for admission continued to be preserved on display at Berklee.) While studying at Berklee, he played at Izzy Ort's Bar & Grille with Bunny Campbell and Preston Sandiford, whom he later cited as important musical influences. He left his studies after he received an offer to tour as a trumpeter with the bandleader Lionel Hampton and embarked on his professional career. While Jones <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> with Hampton, he displayed a gift for arranging songs. Jones relocated to New York City, where he received a number of freelance commissions arranging songs for artists including Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Gene Krupa, and Ray Charles, by then a close friend.|$|E
25|$|United's next match <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> against Montreal Impact, and {{the game}} {{could not have been}} more {{different}} than the nearly record-setting 6-4 shootout in United's prior game at home against RSL. The surprising, quick return from injury by goalie Bill Hamid and the sprained knee injury suffered by Fabian Espindola during training the day before the match virtually guaranteed that United would play a cautious, defensive-minded game. Statistics from the game bore that out, as United was outshot 25–1 by the home team, and possession was more than 2–1 in the Impact's favor. Amazingly though, United emerged with a 1–0 victory, thanks to strong goalkeeping and a first-half goal by Rolfe that finished off a play assisted by Arrieta's high pressure. Arrieta forced a turnover by the Montreal defense and directed the ball to Rolfe who scored what proved to be the game-winner on United's only shot of the game. United became the first team ever to win an MLS match having recorded only one shot all game.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Dirty Dozen's uniqueness, {{however, the}} band's success {{inspired}} {{a resurgence of}} New Orleans' brass band music, both {{in the city and}} nationwide. The band was most influential in the 1980s, when they demonstrated by example that brass band music could be successful by moving beyond a type of music that risked stagnation as nothing more than a tourist attraction. Before the Dirty Dozen band was formed the Olympia Brass Band was already mixing R and jazz influences in with traditional tunes; the Dirty Dozen took this farther, and gave the trend worldwide visibility. Bands which followed in their wake did not all follow their more jazz oriented stage band approach—only the Soul Rebels have gone in that direction—but a wide variety of bands, from the Rebirth Brass Band to Wisconsin's Youngblood Brass Band have been influenced by them in other ways. Rebirth has the most direct connection with the Dirty Dozen: they got their start playing at Daryl's when the Dirty Dozen <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
