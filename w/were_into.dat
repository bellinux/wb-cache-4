25|$|Income Tax Authorities in India in 2006 {{unearthed}} the 1.6million dollar {{penny stock}} scam in Bangalore. The scam is the fallout of nationwide income tax raids {{on the premises}} of businessmen in April 2006, suspecting large scale money laundering and tax evasion through ramping up shares of small firms. Around 25 premises were raided in Mumbai and 10 in Bangalore. After the raids, the Additional Commissioner set up a team and investigated this scam. They pursued the investigations and issued orders on December 31, 2008 that {{are said to have}} national ramifications. The team found that the traders had ramped up penny stocks to launder money an organised crime and a serious economic offence that has misused provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India and Registrar of Co-operatives. This route is chosen to use capital gains tax and legalise the unaccounted money. On April 28, the Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Ministry of Finance billed the case as the best investigation and assessment order of the year.

Two British artillery colonels were surprised and killed while driving on the road in this lightning attack. Upon reaching the road bridge at 8.30 a.m. Watanabe found it defended by a battery of Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft guns from the Singapore and Hong Kong Artillery Regiment. Although two of the guns managed to lower their barrels quickly enough to fire on the tanks, the rounds did not damage the tanks' armor and the gunners fled. Watanabe himself cut the wires to the demolition charges on the bridge with his sword. It was still only early morning and the Japanese attack had managed to scatter the entire 11th Indian Division, leaving most of its survivors attempting to escape across the Slim River.|$|E

He {{wanted to have a}} [...] "naive and sweet" [...] feel with the portrayal of a boy waiting outside for Madonna. They built the set from scratch, including the frontal part with the ticket booth.

It's kind of badly done, which I like, compared to today. We didn't have the same equipment, people are more skillful today, but there's something sweet about it." [...] Madonna was initially asked by him to wear a black wig, and the initial reaction to the whole wardrobe was positive. But Madonna wanted Mondino's opinion on the whole ensemble, who replied that she would look better as a blonde. So the wig was kept for the initial scenes of the video only.|$|E

Having analyzed the data, the writer finds that the forms of compliment utterances and its translation are word <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> word; noun phrase <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> word; noun phrase <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> noun phrase; noun phrase <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> declarative sentence; simple declarative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> word; simple declarative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> adjective phrase; simple declarative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> simple declarative sentence; negative declarative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> negative declarative sentence; compound sentence us translated into compound sentence; compound sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> simple declarative sentence; interrogative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> interrogative sentence; negative interrogative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> declarative sentence; negative interrogative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> negative interrogative sentence; and exclamatory sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> adjective phrase.
