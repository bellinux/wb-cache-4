500|$|From May 1892 to January 1893, the {{legislature}} of the Kingdom convened for an unprecedented 171 days, which later historians such as Albertine Loomis and Helena G. Allen dubbed the [...] "Longest Legislature". This session {{was dominated by}} political infighting between and within the four parties: National Reform, Reform, National Liberal and Independent; none were able to gain a majority. Debates heard {{on the floor of}} the houses concerned the popular demand for a new constitution, the passage of a lottery bill and an opium licensing bill, aimed at alleviating the economic crisis caused by the McKinley Tariff. The main issues of contention between the new monarch and the legislators were the retention of her cabinet ministers since political division prevented Liliʻuokalani from appointing a balanced council and the 1887 constitution gave {{the legislature}} the power to vote for the dismissal of her cabinet. Seven resolutions of <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> were introduced during this session, and four of her self-appointed cabinets (the Widemann, Macfarlane, Cornwell, and Wilcox cabinets) were ousted by votes of the legislature. On January 13, 1893, after the legislature dismissed the George Norton Wilcox cabinet (which had political sympathies to the Reform Party), Liliʻuokalani appointed the new Parker cabinet consisting of Samuel Parker, as minister of foreign affairs; John F. Colburn, as minister of the interior; William H. Cornwell, as minister of finance; and Arthur P. Peterson, as attorney general. She had chosen these men specifically to support her plan of promulgating a new constitution while the legislature was not in session.|$|E
2500|$|McLaws {{accompanied}} Longstreet's corps to Tennessee {{to come to}} the aid of General Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee. He arrived {{too late}} to lead his division at Chickamauga, where it was led by Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw, but he did participate in the Chattanooga Campaign. In the Knoxville Campaign later in 1863, Longstreet relieved McLaws for the failure of the attack on Fort Sanders, citing [...] "a <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the efforts and plans which the Cmdg Genl has thought proper to adopt." [...] In a letter to Confederate Adjutant and Inspector General Samuel Cooper, on December 30, Longstreet submitted three charges of [...] "neglect of duty" [...] but did not request a court-martial because McLaws's [...] "services might be important to the Government in some other position." [...] (In that same letter, he requested a court-martial for Brig. Gen. Jerome B. Robertson, who had been charged with [...] "incompetency" [...] by his division commander.) McLaws also wrote to Cooper on December 30, disputing Longstreet's charges and requesting a court-martial to clear his name. Cooper forwarded Longstreet's letter to Secretary of War James Seddon and to Confederate President Jefferson Davis with the annotation that Longstreet was not authorized to relieve and reassign officers under his command without a formal court-martial. Davis ordered the court-martial of both generals, although he opposed relieving McLaws until a successor could be appointed.|$|E

60|$|One {{reason why}} this truth is so reluctantly admitted, is men's irrational <b>want</b> <b>of</b> faith in the self-protective quality of a highly {{developed}} and healthy community. The timid compromiser on the one hand, and the advocate of coercive restriction on the other, are equally the victims of a superfluous apprehension. The one fears to use his liberty {{for the same reason}} that makes the other fearful of permitting liberty. This common reason is the <b>want</b> <b>of</b> a sensible <b>confidence</b> that, in a free western community, which has reached our stage of development, religious, moral, and social novelties--provided they are tainted by no element of compulsion or interference with the just rights of others, may be trusted to find their own level. Moral and intellectual conditions are not the only motive forces in a community, nor are they even the most decisive. Political and material conditions fix the limits at which speculation can do either good or harm. Let us take an illustration of the impotence of moral ideas to override material circumstances; and we shall venture to place this illustration somewhat fully before the reader.|$|R
60|$|This is {{the truth}} which the deniers of general {{over-production}} have seized and enforced; nor is it pretended that anything {{has been added to}} it, or subtracted from it, in the present disquisition. But it is thought that those who receive the doctrine accompanied with the explanations which we have given, will understand, more clearly than before, what is, and what is not, implied in it; and will see that, when properly understood, it in no way contradicts those obvious facts which are universally known and admitted to be not only of possible, but of actual and even frequent occurrence. The doctrine in question only appears a paradox, because it has usually been so expressed as apparently to contradict these well-known facts; which, however, were equally well known to the authors of the doctrine, who, therefore, can only have adopted from inadvertence any form of expression which could to a candid person appear inconsistent with it. The essentials of the doctrine are preserved when it is allowed that there cannot be permanent excess of production, or of accumulation; though it be at the same time admitted, that as there may be a temporary excess of any one article considered separately, so may there of commodities generally, not in consequence of over-production, but <b>of</b> a <b>want</b> <b>of</b> commercial <b>confidence.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the {{remainder}} of the year there were several altercations among the officers of the regiment, a state of affairs which recurred throughout the regiment's existence. In March, 1778, Lt. Col. Bayard was charged with murdering one of his own officers, Lt. William Bird. Bayard was tried and found guilty of manslaughter in October, and sentenced to be suspended for three months and then removed from his command. This sentence was overturned on a technicality by the Judge Advocate General, but probably played a role in Bayard's subsequent difficulties in retaining his command. In August, Col. Innes received a letter from Edward Winslow in which he wrote: I have in free conversation suggested my opinion to you that the Corps of King's Orange Rangers is at present in a position peculiarly alarming -- Feuds and dissensions among the Officers -- Mutinies and Desertions among the men...Whether the present Commandant is not sufficiently experienc'd in military matters?

40|$|Models of {{continuous}} opinion dynamics under bounded confidence show a sharp transition between a consensus and a polarization phase {{at a critical}} global bound <b>of</b> <b>confidence.</b> In this paper, heterogeneous bounds <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> for agents are studied.

40|$|Background: The Swedish life-insurance {{business}} has been extensively criticised lately due to broken promises to customers as well as due to scandals that some companies within the business have been involved in. The companies within the Swedish life-insurance business {{find themselves in a}} so- called crisis <b>of</b> <b>confidence,</b> something that is created in and by media. A company that finds itself in a crisis <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> somehow have to manage the situation and crises <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> can also result in different kinds of changes. Purpose: The aim of this thesis is to explore and analyse how individual life- insurance companies manage crises <b>of</b> <b>confidence.</b> As a consequence, the aim is also to investigate in what way crises <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> are initiators to change. Procedure: The study has been conducted through seven qualitative interviews with individuals holding a managerial position within a Swedish life-insurance company. Findings: Essential for managing crises <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> is communication and information mainly to media, but also to customers and employees. Further, a higher level of clarity and transparency in products and activities, together with increased control of ethical policies, are aspects that {{have been shown to be}} of importance in managing the crisis <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> within the Swedish life- insurance business. The crisis <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> has generated changes, but it can not be decided with certainty if these changes have been initiated only by the crisis <b>of</b> <b>confidence,</b> or if the changes would have been carried through anyway. What can be established, is that the crisis <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> has speeded up already planned changes...|$|R
