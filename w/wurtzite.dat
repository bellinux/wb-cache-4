5|$|Other source {{minerals}} for zinc include smithsonite (zinc carbonate), hemimorphite (zinc silicate), <b>wurtzite</b> (another zinc sulfide), {{and sometimes}} hydrozincite (basic zinc carbonate). With {{the exception of}} <b>wurtzite,</b> all these other minerals were formed by weathering of the primordial zinc sulfides.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium oxide, BeO, {{is a white}} {{refractory}} solid, {{which has}} the <b>wurtzite</b> crystal structure and a thermal conductivity as high as in some metals. BeO is amphoteric. Salts of beryllium can be produced by treating Be(OH)2 with acid. Beryllium sulfide, selenide and telluride are known, all having the zincblende structure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wurtzite</b> BN can be {{obtained}} via static high-pressure or dynamic shock methods. The limits of its stability are not well defined. Both c-BN and w-BN are formed by compressing h-BN, but formation of w-BN occurs at much lower temperatures close to 1700°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{hexagonal}} structure {{has a point}} group 6mm (Hermann-Mauguin notation) or C6v (Schoenflies notation), and the space group is P63mc or C6v4. The lattice constants are a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.2 Å; their ratio c/a ~ 1.60 {{is close to the}} ideal value for hexagonal cell c/a = 1.633. As in most group II-VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic (Zn2+–O2−) with the corresponding radii of 0.074nm for Zn2+ and 0.140nm for O2−. This property accounts for the preferential formation of <b>wurtzite</b> rather than zinc blende structure, as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn-O bonds, zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials, but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained. However, studies using wurtzoid structures explained the origin of surface flatness and the absence of reconstruction at ZnO <b>wurtzite</b> surfaces in addition to the origin of charges on ZnO planes.|$|E
5|$|Alpha {{silicon carbide}} (α-SiC) {{is the most}} {{commonly}} encountered polymorph; it is formed at temperatures greater than 1700°C and has a hexagonal crystal structure (similar to <b>Wurtzite).</b> The beta modification (β-SiC), with a zinc blende crystal structure (similar to diamond), is formed at temperatures below 1700°C. Until recently, the beta form has had relatively few commercial uses, although there is now increasing interest in its use as a support for heterogeneous catalysts, owing to its higher surface area compared to the alpha form.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride is a heat- and {{chemically}} resistant refractory compound of boron and nitrogen with the chemical formula BN. It exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice. The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite {{is the most}} stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare <b>wurtzite</b> BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even be harder than the cubic form.|$|E
5|$|The <b>wurtzite</b> form {{of boron}} nitride (w-BN; point group = C6v; space group = P63mc) {{has the same}} {{structure}} as lonsdaleite, a rare hexagonal polymorph of carbon. As in the cubic form, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into tetrahedra, but in w-BN the angles between neighboring tetrahedra are different. As in the cubic form, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into 6-membered rings; in the cubic form all rings are in the chair configuration, in w-BN the rings between 'layers' are in boat configuration.|$|E
5|$|Polonium has {{no common}} {{compounds}}, {{and almost all}} of its compounds are synthetically created; more than 50 of those are known. The most stable class of polonium compounds are polonides, which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements. Na2Po has the antifluorite structure, the polonides of Ca, Ba, Hg, Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice, BePo and CdPo have the <b>wurtzite</b> and MgPo the nickel arsenide structure. Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600°C, except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300°C and the lanthanide polonides, which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000°C. For example, PrPo melts at 1250°C and TmPo at 2200°C. PbPo is {{one of the very few}} naturally occurring polonium compounds, as polonium alpha decays to form lead.|$|E
25|$|ZnSe {{can be made}} in both {{hexagonal}} (<b>wurtzite)</b> and cubic (zincblende) crystal structure.|$|E
25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} potential can {{be created}} in any bulk or nanostructured semiconductor crystal having non central symmetry, such as the Group III–V and II–VI materials, due to polarization of ions under applied stress and strain. This property is common to both the zincblende and <b>wurtzite</b> crystal structures. To first order, {{there is only one}} independent piezoelectric coefficient in zincblende, called e14, coupled to shear components of the strain. In <b>wurtzite,</b> there are instead three independent piezoelectric coefficients: e31, e33 and e15.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium nitride (AlN) is a nitride of aluminium. Its <b>wurtzite</b> phase (w-AlN) is a {{wide band}} gap (6.01-6.05 eV at room temperature) {{semiconductor}} material, giving it potential application for deep ultraviolet optoelectronics.|$|E
25|$|The {{semiconductors}} {{where the}} strongest piezoelectricity is observed are those {{commonly found in}} the <b>wurtzite</b> structure, i.e. GaN, InN, AlN and ZnO. ZnO is the most used material in the recent field of piezotronics.|$|E
500|$|Zinc oxide {{crystallizes}} in {{two main}} forms, hexagonal <b>wurtzite</b> and cubic zincblende. [...] The <b>wurtzite</b> structure is most stable at ambient conditions and thus most common. The zincblende form can be stabilized by growing ZnO on substrates with cubic lattice structure. In both cases, the zinc and oxide centers are tetrahedral, the most characteristic geometry for Zn(II). [...] ZnO converts to the rocksalt motif at relatively high pressures about 10 GPa.|$|E
500|$|The {{potential}} of X-ray crystallography {{for determining the}} structure of molecules and minerals—then only known vaguely from chemical and hydrodynamic experiments—was realized immediately. The earliest structures were simple inorganic crystals and minerals, but even these revealed fundamental laws of physics and chemistry. The first atomic-resolution structure to be [...] "solved" [...] (i.e., determined) in 1914 was that of table salt. The distribution of electrons in the table-salt structure showed that crystals are not necessarily composed of covalently bonded molecules, and proved the existence of ionic compounds. The structure of diamond was solved in the same year, proving the tetrahedral arrangement of its chemical bonds and showing that the length of C–C single bond was 1.52 angstroms. Other early structures included copper, calcium fluoride (CaF2, also known as fluorite), calcite (CaCO3) and pyrite (FeS2) in 1914; spinel (MgAl2O4) in 1915; the rutile and anatase forms of titanium dioxide (TiO2) in 1916; pyrochroite Mn(OH)2 and, by extension, brucite Mg(OH)2 in 1919;. Also in 1919 sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and caesium dichloroiodide (CsICl2) were determined by Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff, and the <b>wurtzite</b> (hexagonal ZnS) structure became known in 1920.|$|E
2500|$|Copper(I) iodide, {{like most}} [...] "binary" [...] (containing only two elements) metal halides, is an {{inorganic}} polymer. [...] It has a rich phase diagram, {{meaning that it}} exists in several crystalline forms. It adopts a zinc blende structure below 390°C (γ-CuI), a <b>wurtzite</b> structure between 390 and 440°C (β-CuI), and a rock salt structure above 440°C (α-CuI). [...] The ions are tetrahedrally coordinated when in the zinc blende or the <b>wurtzite</b> structure, with a Cu-I distance of 2.338 Å. [...] Copper(I) bromide and copper(I) chloride also transform from the zinc blende structure to the <b>wurtzite</b> structure at 405 and 435°C, respectively. Therefore, the longer the copper – halide bond length, the lower the temperature needs to be to change the structure from the zinc blende structure to the <b>wurtzite</b> structure. The interatomic distances in copper(I) bromide and copper(I) chloride are 2.173 and 2.051 Å, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Cadmium sulfide has, like zinc sulfide, two crystal forms. [...] The {{more stable}} {{hexagonal}} <b>wurtzite</b> structure (found in the mineral Greenockite) and the cubic zinc blende structure (found in the mineral Hawleyite). In {{both of these}} forms the cadmium and sulfur atoms are four coordinate. There is also a high pressure form with the NaCl rock salt structure.|$|E
2500|$|Cadmium sulfide is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula CdS. [...] Cadmium sulfide is a yellow solid. It occurs in nature with two different crystal structures as the rare minerals greenockite and hawleyite, but is more prevalent as an impurity substituent in the similarly structured zinc ores sphalerite and <b>wurtzite,</b> {{which are the}} major economic sources of cadmium. As a compound that is easy to isolate and purify, it is the principal source of cadmium for all commercial applications. [...] Its vivid yellow color led to its adoption as a pigment for the yellow paint [...] "cadmium yellow" [...] in the 18th century.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wurtzite</b> group includes: Cadmoselite CdSe, Greenockite CdS, Mátraite ZnS and Rambergite MnS, in {{addition}} to <b>wurtzite.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>wurtzite</b> crystal {{structure}}, {{named after}} the mineral <b>wurtzite,</b> is a crystal structure for various binary compounds. It {{is an example of}} a hexagonal crystal system. The chemical prototype is conventionally given as ZnS, although mineral <b>wurtzite</b> is a multi-component alloy compound.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{compounds}} {{that can take}} the <b>wurtzite</b> structure are <b>wurtzite</b> itself, AgI, ZnO, CdS, CdSe, α-SiC, GaN, AlN, w-BN and other semiconductors. In most of these compounds, <b>wurtzite</b> is not the favored form of the bulk crystal, but the structure can be favored in some nanocrystal forms of the material.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wurtzite</b> {{structure}} is non-centrosymmetric (i.e., lacks inversion symmetry). Due to this, <b>wurtzite</b> crystals can (and generally do) have properties such as piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity, which centrosymmetric crystals lack.|$|E

50|$|Three {{crystalline}} {{forms of}} CdSe are known: <b>wurtzite</b> (hexagonal), sphalerite (cubic) and rock-salt (cubic). The sphalerite CdSe structure is unstable and converts to the <b>wurtzite</b> form upon moderate heating. The transition starts at about 130 °C, and at 700 °C it completes within a day. The rock-salt structure is only observed under high pressure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wurtzite</b> and zincblende {{structures}} characterize most wide bandgap semiconductors. <b>Wurtzite</b> phases allow spontaneous polarization in the (0001) direction. A {{result of}} the spontaneous polarization and piezoelectricity is that the polar surfaces of the materials are associated with higher sheet carrier density than the bulk. The polar face produces a strong electric field, which creates high interface charge densities.|$|E
