25|$|Similar {{to other}} {{environmental}} issues, {{there can be}} conflict between the fishermen <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> on fishing for their livelihoods and fishery scientists who realise that if future fish populations are to be sustainable then some fisheries must limit fishing or cease operations.|$|E
25|$|According to the World Food Programme, between 35-60 {{percent of}} the {{agriculture}} industry has been damaged by the Israeli military operation.

25|$|Overfishing {{occurs when}} more fish are caught than the {{population}} can replace through natural reproduction. Gathering as many fish as possible {{may seem like}} a profitable practice, but overfishing has serious consequences. The results not only affect the balance of life in the oceans, but also the social and economic well-being of the coastal communities <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> on fish for their way of life.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{implication}} {{that many of}} these impacts will be detrimental—especially for the three-quarters of the world's poor <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> on agriculture systems. The report does, however, note that owing to the great diversity of coastal environments; regional and local differences in projected relative sea level and climate changes; and differences in the resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems, sectors, and countries, the impacts will be highly variable in time and space.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 11th day of battle, Surya offered his invincible chariot and his charioteer Aruṇa to Karna, just like Lord Indra who gave his chariot to Arjuna. The chariot of Surya was {{brilliant}} as the sun, yoked with 7 horses of different colors [...] and only a person with divine vision could look into it. Confident in his own skills, Karna rejects this offer, saying he didn't {{want to be remembered}} as a person <b>who</b> <b>depended</b> upon others strength to gain victory, indirectly referring to Arjuna <b>who</b> <b>depended</b> upon Lord Krishna. Drona took the commander-in-chief position.|$|R
25|$|Throughout Antigua and Barbuda, {{losses from}} the {{hurricane}} amounted to EC$34million ($12.6million USD). In {{the wake of}} Earl, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies allocated roughly $50,000 (USD) in relief funds for the country. A three-month recovery operation was implemented {{within days of the}} storm's passage and focused on providing shelter and sustinance for the 1,000 families displaced by Earl. Additionally, economic assistance due to substantial crop losses was required, especially for families <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> on agriculture.|$|E
25|$|By August 1918 the US State Department had {{tightened}} wartime {{control at}} the border by limiting passport-carrying Mexican laborers to two entries per day and restricting nonworkers to one crossing per week. A Nogales newspaper reported that the new rules had “greatly curtailed traffic from the Mexican side of the international border, and there is universal weeping among retail merchants of Nogales, Arizona, who see ‘panicky’ times ahead, for those <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> on citizens {{of the other side}} of the international line, to swell their daily receipts.” Although businesses in Nogales, Arizona, protested, the persons most affected were working-class nogalenses who depended on wages from their jobs in the US.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate as}} to what degree mustangs and cattle compete for forage is multifaceted. One group of opponents, {{primarily}} cattle and sheep ranchers and those <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> on the livestock industry, argue essentially that feral horses degrade rangeland and compete with private livestock for public land forage. The environmentalist community is split over {{the position of the}} mustang within the North American ecosystem. This debate centers on the potential classification of mustangs as either an introduced species such as cattle, or as a reintroduced native species due to the prehistoric presence of horses in North America, albeit with a gap of thousands of years between their extinction and reintroduction from European stock.|$|E

25|$|Holtz {{published}} a study {{concluding that the}} ancient ecology of tyrannosaur habitats and morphology of tyrannosaur bodies were inconsistent {{with the idea that}} they were scavengers. He also suggested that the tyrannosaur skull was subjected to greater torsional forces hunting and/or feeding than the skulls of other large carnivorous dinosaurs like allosaurs and ceratosaurs. He interpretd the breadth of the tyrannosaur skull and high development of its secondary palate as adaptations for enduring these forces. He theorized that tyrannosaurids exploited a similar hunting tactic to modern wolves and hyenas by running after prey and attacking it with their jaws. This tactic would distinguish tyrannosaurid hunting behavior from that of modern big cats, <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> more heavily on their forelimbs to take down prey.|$|E
25|$|On January 9, 1994, the Green Line {{closed for}} the largest transit {{rehabilitation}} project in the city's history. The Green Line reopened on May 12, 1996, {{with much of the}} renewal work completed and {{with the exception of a}} few stations. Six stations were closed indefinitely following the rehabilitation project, which angered many commuters <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> on the Green Line. In September 1997, after political pressure brought on by community leaders, the Jackson Park branch was shortened again from University to Cottage Grove after previous attempts by the City, CTA and other agencies to extend the route eastward to Dorchester, immediately west of the Illinois Central Railroad. This had seemed logical to the Dorchester Terminal, due to the fact that the Metra Electric District and South Shore Line both share a station along the IC ROW, at 63rd Street.|$|E
25|$|Edible insects {{have long}} been used by ethnic groups in Asia, Africa, Mexico and South America as cheap and {{sustainable}} sources of protein, and the major role of entomophagy in human food security is well-documented. Up to 2,086 species are eaten by 3,071 ethnic groups in 130 countries. While more attention is needed to fully assess the potential of edible insects, they provide a natural source of essential carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals and vitamins and offer an opportunity {{to bridge the gap}} in protein consumption between poor and wealthy nations but also to lessen the Ecological footprint. Many insects contain abundant stores of lysine, an amino acid deficient in the diets of many people <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> heavily on grain. Some argue that the combination of increasing land use pressure, climate change, and food grain shortages due to the use of corn as a biofuel feedstock will cause serious challenges for attempts to meet future protein demand.|$|E

500|$|Burger King Corporation quickly {{pulled the}} {{franchise}} license for that location {{and had the}} store shuttered explaining that Rikamor, Ltd. had violated its contract by opening the location in the West Bank.

500|$|The {{main problem}} with {{implementing}} such a radical tax would be finding acceptance. [...] Although {{such a system}} might find acceptance within some nations, particularly those (1) {{with a history of}} neutrality, (2) without an active military (such as Costa Rica), or (3) with lower levels of military spending (such as Japan, which currently spends 1% of its GDP on defense), it would be unpopular among many consumers of arms. Nations in this latter category range from the United States, which spends 4% of its GDP on defense, to dictatorships <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> on arms to keep themselves in power. Other likely opponents would be nations engaged in ongoing military conflicts, or others in a state of heightened military alert, such as Israel. Arms producers would also oppose it, because it would increase their costs and possibly reduce their consumer base.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of his term as leader of the Moderate Youth League, Reinfeldt supported the government of Prime Minister Bildt, but he gradually changed his views and became more critical of the party leadership. In 1993 he wrote the book [...] "Det sovande folket" [...] (The Sleeping Nation), in which he criticized the Swedish welfare state and argued for the introduction of a neoliberalist society. The book argues that the welfare state is a stillborn construction, as it systematically puts people in benefit dependency. It states that the people of Sweden can be divided into [...] "fools" [...] and [...] "sleepy-brains", out of which the former stands for those who work, and the latter for the slackened people <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> on funds from the welfare state. A recurrent message in the book is that [...] "Swedes are mentally handicapped and indoctrinated to believe that politicians can create and ensure welfare".|$|E
