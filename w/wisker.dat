5|$|By 1864, Gossip was {{appearing}} in London chess circles, drawing {{a game against}} Joseph Henry Blackburne at a simultaneous exhibition in April. He played {{in a number of}} chess tournaments between 1870 and 1895, usually with unimpressive results. At London 1870, the Third British Chess Association Congress (won by John <b>Wisker</b> after a playoff against Amos Burn), Gossip scored two of six possible points, finishing in a tie for fifth–sixth out of seven players. He had the consolation of handing Burn his only loss. At London 1872 (won by Steinitz ahead of Johannes Zukertort and Blackburne), he scored just one out of seven, finishing seventh out of eight players.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Electroless plating {{technology}} was applied {{in order to}} improve the poor wettability between copper and SiC. β-SiC(w+p) /Cu composites were fabricated by hot-press sintering. The influences of SiC volume fraction on microstructure, relative density and wear propertity were researched in detail. It turned out that SiC particles and <b>wiskers</b> distributed in Cu matrix homogeneously. And with the increase of SiC volume fraction, the relative density and friction coefficient were reduced respectively, the wear-resistant improved greatly. Some of metal matrix composites, such as SiC/Cu composite, have attracted much attention because of their good mechanical, thermal and wear properties. These composites are considered preferably for applications where good wear resistance without loss of thermal and electrical conductivity of the matrix is the prime consideration[1].

SiAlON {{ceramics}} {{were successfully}} {{produced in the}} form of powders from high purity kaolin, a hydrated aluminium silicate, Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 type of clay mineral (comprises 83. 85 % kaolinite, 13. 59 % quartz, 0. 88 % feldspar, 1. 37 % others) of Canakkale-Can origin. Factors affecting SiAlON powder production were temperature, holding time, gas-flow rate and preparation methods. System optimisation was achieved following the results succeeded from numerous testing and characterisation (with XRD, SEM, EDS, BET, etc.) of each test. Changing in gas flow rate, temperature and holding time at plateau temperature had influences on the final powder yield, their morphologies and phase formation. The best conversion of kaolin clay mineral to SiAlON ceramic powder was the test run at 1475 o C for 4 hour under 1 lt/min N 2 -flow. Product after the process was mainly of β'- Si 3 Al 3 O 3 N 5 (z= 3) powder along with small amounts of Al 2 O 3, mullite and AlN phases.

Technology as a neutral tool can help to fix the balance necessary to the interests of our without compromising those of later generations. Lead-free technologies are of such a dimension and today enough time passed by to risk a first approximation to comprehensive evaluation. Starting as an environmental topic since 15 years there are intensifying activities in the transition from the well known Tin/Lead to various alternate lead-free interconnection systems. Many projects were done to find best solutions. Tin/Silver/Copper will be the most favorite future alternative. The environmental aspects as toxicity, energy use, behavior in recycling and landfill of soldered PCB´s but also the economical impacts i. e. availability of rough materials and conversion costs will be discussed.

40|$|Research {{skills and}} methods are an {{integral}} part of the undergraduate nursing curriculum, underpinning the use of research evidence in practice. Understanding the research process and research methods are thresholds which students need to pass through to support their development into evidence-based practitioners. However research evidence suggests that undergraduate nursing students find research skills and methods troublesome and this is a significant barrier to learning. Troublesome research knowledge can be readily aligned with existing understanding of troublesome knowledge, as identified by Perkins (1999). For example Ax and Kincade (2001) identified counter-intuitive knowledge in the term “research ” because of the everyday usage of research as being simply to find out about something. In the threshold concepts literature, aspects of research learning have been found to be troublesome in other disciplines, e. g. Taylor and Meyer’s (2010) work on hypothesis development in biology and Kiley and <b>Wisker’s</b> (2009) study of research learning in doctoral students. A narrative research study was undertaken to investigate research learning in undergraduate nursing education using threshold concepts as a framework. Seventeen nursing students were interviewed in depth about their experiences of learning about research. Learning narratives were gathered an...|$|R
40|$|Study of the {{interfaces}} in the inorganic-matrix composites. Different {{kinds of}} composites have been synthetized and characterized, focusing the {{attention on the}} role of the interfaces between the matrix and the dispersed phase. One aim of the research activity was the optimization of the sintering process of particle-reinforced glass matrix composites to obtain densities as close as possible to the theoretical value and improved mechanical properties in comparison with the parent glass matrix. A pressureless sintering process has been studied by means of heating-microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and dilatometry on glass powders and mixtures of glass and reinforcement powders. Particular attention was focused on the oxidation and reduction reactions, as well as on the dissolution phenomena develpoed at the inerface between the oxidized surface layer of metal paticles and the softened glass marix during the sinering process. The chosen glass matrix composites have the following compositions: (1) 5, 10 and 20 wt% Ti particle-reinforced ZnO-B 2 O 3 -PbO based glasses; and (2) 5, 10 and 20 wt% Ti particle-reinforced TiO 2 -ZnO-B 2 O 3 -PbO based glasses. These glasses were suitable as 'model' glasses, and the method was then extended to other glass matrixces, in particular to several bioactive glass-matrices, aiming to prepare bioactive composites reinforced by titanum particles, to be used as bulk or coatings on metallic substrates for load bearing applications. A second aim of the research was the study of the interfaces between 2024 Aluminium alloys and SiC <b>wiskers</b> in metal matrix composites.

40|$|In {{his book}} The Celluloid Closet Vito Russo argues: “It {{is an old}} {{stereotype}} that homosexuality has to do only with sex while heterosexuality is multi-faceted and embraces love and romance. ” (1987 :p. 132). In an attempt to redress this I embarked, many years ago, on a project to queer iconic heterosexual love stories. My intention was to demonstrate that love affairs between men can be as rich, as complex and as romantic as those between men and women, {{even if they are}} intrinsically different. In this essay I will examine the process of creating the most recent of these – a contemporary screen version of the story immortalised by Puccini in his opera Madama Butterfly. This was the artefact for my PhD by practice, completed in 2016, entitled Emancipating ‘Madame Butterfly’: Intention and Process in Adapting and Queering a Text. The adaptation required me to remediate what had been a novella, a play, an opera and a musical into a screenplay, with all the attendant issues, as well as to relocate it from the 19 th century to the 21 st. But the most profound change came from the queering process. With two men now loving each other the heteronormative mould which constrains the original story was broken, and the consequences of this were far more pervasive than simply changing the gender and sexual identity of the protagonists. Making the love affair homosexual also presented problems, not least the requirement for there to be an offspring from the relationship. But in those very problems lay opportunities which, in the end, led to a complete change of theme as well as context. For example, in the original the 15 -year-old Butterfly asks her older lover Pinkerton to ‘love her like a father’ (1904 :Act 1), but this theme is not explored further. In my version I was able to move this to the centre and explore the frustrated paternal instincts which sometimes lie behind relationships between older and younger men. So, whilst the story remains a child of its parents, it has its own life in its new context With reference to Queer Theory, as well as to Pearce and <b>Wisker’s</b> (1998) concept of ‘romantic subversion’ and D. H. Hwang’s utterly subversive version of the story, M. Butterfly (1989), I will argue that queering is a profoundly liberating kind of adaptation with a real power to enlarge and to enrich a text...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the chapter}} on Darwin's finches, Wells argues that Darwin's finches were merely a [...] "speculative afterthought". Wells claims that ornithologist David Lack is more to be {{credited}} with the popular finches, {{and that it was}} Lack who paraded the finches and claimed that they were instrumental in Darwin's theories. This claim is contradicted by Alan D. Gishlick and Dave <b>Wisker,</b> who state that Darwin was in fact heavily influenced by the finches as early as 1837, with <b>Wisker</b> stating that [...] "Wells seems to be the one doing the speculating". Wells argues that, rather than evolving, the finch species may be [...] "merging", combining from multiple species into a single species rather than diverging from a single species into multiple species. Wells argues that, due to interbreeding between many of the finch [...] "species", the thirteen species may actually be less than previously thought. Contradicting this, Gishlick states that the separation [...] "according to which species are separated by behaviors that lead animals to recognize potential mates" [...] is [...] "widely accepted". <b>Wisker</b> states that hybridization among finch species on the Galápagos Islands is in fact rare. Both agree that even if hybridization did occur, it would be irrelevant because evolution does not specifically require divergence.Wisker concludes: The general reader is done a great disservice by this chapter in Icons of Evolution. Jonathan Wells does not sufficiently address the biographical or scientific literature on Darwin's Finches to enable the reader to make an informed decision regarding his argument. He writes, with exquisite irony, 'It makes one wonder how much evidence there really is for Darwin's theory'. Since, as we have seen, Wells avoids most of it regarding Darwin's Finches, one wonders how much evidence there is to support his book.|$|E
