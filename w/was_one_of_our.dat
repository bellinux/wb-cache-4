5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

In her later years, Rita became known for her struggle with Alzheimer's disease. Her courage and candor, and that of her family, were a great public service in bringing worldwide attention to a disease which we all hope will soon be cured. Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend who we will miss. We extend our deep sympathy to her family.|$|E

Watching the two teams come together and fight alongside each other, it's one of the most fun parts, ... we just don’t believe in waiting. We really believe in accelerated storytelling." [...] Kreisberg explained that since they are all comic book fans themselves, they have all debated the age-old question of which superhero would win in a fight; [...] "So, the idea that [...] would fight each other in one of these episodes <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> earliest ideas, and that the cast members would have that Comic-Con argument on camera <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> earliest ideas." [...] Greg Berlanti, creator {{and executive producer}} on both series, explained that [...] "crossovers are part of [...] DNA, ... and if we waited ..., then we would be depriving the audience of something we all wanted to see".|$|E

[...] This offended some; columnist Russell Baker complained of [...] "a group conspiracy to grant him absolution". Cartoonist Jeff Koterba of the Omaha World-Herald depicted History before a blank canvas, his subject Nixon, as America looks on eagerly.

500|$|The {{music of}} Mass Effect 2 was {{primarily}} composed by Jack Wall. His previous work with BioWare was {{as the main}} composer for Jade Empire and the original Mass Effect. The score also features some pieces by Sam Hulick, David Kates, and Jimmy Hinson, with additional editing and in-game implementation by Brian DiDomenico. Unlike the original Mass Effect, the composers aimed for a darker and more mature sound to match {{the mood of the}} game. The music incorporates both orchestral and classic sci-fi arrangements which were inspired by the soundtrack of the cult classic film Blade Runner and music by German electronic group Tangerine Dream. The harmonic structure of Wendy Carlos's Tron soundtrack also represented significant influences. To complement each character, the composers gave them their own theme song to convey their personalities and backgrounds. According to Kates, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> mandates to create a dynamic score that expressed a wide range of emotions." ...|$|E
500|$|Mackin {{signed for}} York {{permanently}} on 22 May 2009 on a one-year contract. After signing, manager Martin Foyle said [...] "Levi was fantastic {{for us and}} came on in leaps and bounds. He <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> most consistent players, but I know there's more to come from him." [...] Mackin played in the opening match of 2009–10, a 2–1 defeat away to Oxford on 8 August 2009, and according to The Press was a [...] "strong presence in the City midfield in a very committed performance". A foot infection led to him missing a match against Gateshead on 25 August 2009 and he made his return in a 2–0 home win over Crawley Town on 5 September as an 84th-minute substitute. His first start since 22 August 2009 came in a 2–2 home draw with Cambridge United on 22 September to fill in for Alex Lawless. This {{was the first of}} five consecutive matches to be started by Mackin before he had a six-match spell on the substitutes' bench. This came to an end when he started in the 1–0 victory away to AFC Wimbledon on 21 November 2009 and his performance drew praise from Foyle.|$|E
500|$|Oppong debuted {{and made}} his first start for the Eastern Kentucky Colonels in their season opener on November 14, 2008, against Florida International. He led his team in both rebounds and blocks. In the {{following}} week, he was named Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) Newcomer of the Week. In a win over Ball State on December 13, he recorded 11 points and a season-high 9 rebounds. However, on December 20, he separated his left shoulder after grabbing a team-high 8 rebounds vs Cincinnati. It was estimated by head coach Jeff Neubauer that he would miss a few weeks due to a torn labrum. Oppong was absent for the Colonels' five next games. He recalled the moment saying, [...] "Cincinnati <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> best games, but for me, I really don't like that game. It was when I actually dislocated my shoulder. And it hurt—it really hurt. The process of coming back was so hard because it took so long. When I got back, {{it took me a}} minute {{to get back into the}} flow and get adjusted." [...] Oppong return on January 15, 2009, against Eastern Illinois, and did not make another start that season until a loss to Morehead State at the 2009 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. Through the whole season, Oppong averaged 9.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 1.2 assists. He was one of Eastern Kentucky's rebounding leaders.|$|E

Gray was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in both 1980 and 1981 in the category of [...] "Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama" [...] respectively. The character of Sue Ellen was well received by television critics. The Biography Channel said, [...] "Who could ever forget Dallas with the gin-swilling Sue Ellen Ewing, replete with shoulder pads long before Dynasty, staggering around Southfork Ranch with a permanently tearful expression as she suffered the brunt of J.R. Ewing's evil ways?" [...] The Boulevard Magazine said, It may be 2009 and seventeen years since the primetime drama Dallas went off the air, but memories of the Ewing family still linger. Corruption and betrayal, lies, greed, affairs and scandal – all were just part of another day at the Southfork Ranch. At the center of it all <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> favorite Ewings, the person we couldn't help but root for each week as she drank and slept her way through one ordeal after another. This, of course, was the tortured and (sometimes) villainous Sue Ellen Shepard Ewing, former Texas beauty queen and trophy wife of the womanizing rogue J.R. Ewing, played to perfection by actress Linda Gray.|$|E

Further, the band took no advance payments, paid for their own recordings, and signed no contracts. Durango later remarked that [...] "We came from a punk perspective — {{we did not want to}} get sucked into a corporate culture where basically you're signing a contract because you don't trust the other person to live up to their word.

In 1890, some time after Wounded Knee, Luther moved from Rosebud and followed his father and brother Ellis Standing Bear to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. [...] Pine Ridge provided a series of varying employment and family ventures. In 1891, Luther became principal of a reservation day school. Standing Bear also worked in his uncle’s little general store. [...] One day {{they were talking about}} the delay in mail delivery. [...] “I told my uncle that John Wanamaker, the man for whom I had worked in Philadelphia, was Postmaster-General, and that I would write and see if we could not have a post office established at his camp. [...] I suggested that we call it Kyle. [...] It was a short name and easy to spell. [...] When Mr. Wanamaker received my letter, he replied immediately. [...] He was pleased with my suggestion, but said that he could not appoint me postmaster, as I was an Indian. [...] It would have to be some white man. [...] There was a Joseph Taylor who <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> missionaries, and we sent his name. [...] He received the appointment, but I took care of the office.” [...] Later, Luther opened a dry goods store with his brother Ellis at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle.
