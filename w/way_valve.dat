50|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} problems with these valves. One {{is that the}} chest tube can clog. When chest tube clogging occurs, the pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema can recur.

To address this, some have turned to small chest drainage alternatives, such as the Atrium Express Mini 500 or the Teleflex Mini Sahara. An alternative solution is to attach a sputum trap to the valve, thus providing a reservoir to capture the draining fluid. The Atrium Pneumostat chest drain valve combines a one <b>way</b> <b>valve</b> and a 30cc collection chamber to address this issue.|$|E

5000|$|A chest {{drainage}} system is typically {{used to collect}} chest drainage (air, blood, effusions). Most commonly, {{drainage system}}s use three chambers {{which are based on}} the three-bottle system. The first chamber allows fluid that is drained from the chest to be collected. The second chamber functions as a [...] "water seal", which acts as a one <b>way</b> <b>valve</b> allowing gas to escape, but not reenter the chest. Air bubbling through the water seal chamber is usual when the patient coughs or exhales but may indicate, if continual, a pleural or system leak that should be evaluated critically. It can also indicate a leak of air from the lung. The third chamber is the suction control chamber. The height of the water in this chamber regulates the negative pressure applied to the system. A gentle bubbling through the water column minimizes evaporation of the fluid and indicates that the suction is being regulated to the height of the water column. In this way, increased wall suction does not increase the negative pressure of the system. Newer drainage systems eliminate the water seal using a mechanical check-valve, and some also use a mechanical regulator to regulate the suction pressure. Systems which employ both these are dubbed [...] "dry" [...] systems, whereas systems that retain the water seal but use a mechanical regulator are called [...] "wet-dry" [...] systems. Systems which use a water seal and water column regulator are called [...] "wet" [...] systems. Dry systems are advantageous as tip-overs of wet systems can spill and mix with blood, mandating the replacement of the system. Even newer systems are smaller and more ambulatory so the patient can be sent home for drainage if indicated.|$|E
