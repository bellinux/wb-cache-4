5|$|Matthew West {{was born}} on April 25, 1977 in Downers Grove, Illinois. As a child he was a fan of his {{hometown}} baseball team, the Chicago Cubs, and wanted to eventually have a career in baseball. He played baseball throughout high school at Downers Grove North High School, becoming team captain as a senior. He <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> a college baseball scholarship but instead ended up receiving a four-year music scholarship at Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois {{where he was a}} part of the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship chapter. He graduated from Millikin in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Within the Triple Alliance, Prussia <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> some {{territorial}} {{gains in}} the Baltic region, through war (with Russia) or diplomacy (from the Commonwealth), {{or a combination of}} the above. With regard to the Balkans, the Triple Alliance aimed at restraining the Russian Empire, as well as the its ally, the Austrian Empire, and there were expectations of a war between the Alliance and Russia (and possibly Austria) around 1791.|$|E
5|$|Both Spykers {{and both}} Super Aguris were {{knocked out of}} the first phase of qualifying, along with Alexander Wurz's Williams and Vitantonio Liuzzi's Toro Rosso. For Super Aguri's Takuma Sato, it did not matter where he qualified, as he was docked ten places, due to {{overtaking}} Jenson Button under yellow flags at the last Grand Prix. Spykers Adrian Sutil <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> a wet race after an unspectacular qualifying. At {{the front end of the}} grid, the McLarens were first and fourth, with Hamilton on top, and the Ferraris splitting them in third and fourth. Heikki Kovalainen rounded out the top five.|$|E

5|$|By then, Reitz had {{developed}} {{a keen interest in}} law, and he continued his studies at South African College, reading law with professor F.S. Watermeyer. The latter's death only months after Reitz started working with him, made Reitz decide to continue his studies in London, at the Inner Temple. It was a decision that needed deliberation, as his father <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> his son to return to the farm in due time, and the financial situation of the family was not strong. However, Reitz did go to London, and finished his studies successfully. He was called to the bar at Westminster on 11 June 1867. During his time in England Reitz became interested in politics, and regularly attended sessions of the House of Commons. Before returning to South Africa he made a tour of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Pick had {{not been}} well for some years. The {{stresses}} of his war work took a further toll on his health and he lost two stone during his travels {{around the country to}} research his report on the canal industry. Although exhausted {{at the end of the}} tour, he wrote to friends that he was struggling with the idleness and <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> something new to do. He died at his home, 15 Wildwood Road, Golders Green, on 7 November 1941 from a cerebral haemorrhage. His funeral was held at Golders Green Crematorium on 11 November 1941 and a memorial service was held at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square on 13 November 1941.|$|E
5|$|Walker finally meets Konrad at his penthouse. Konrad {{appears to}} be the charismatic, villainous force behind the atrocities that Walker <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for,</b> until Walker finds his {{decaying}} corpse on the penthouse deck. Walker finds that Konrad committed suicide after his failed evacuation effort, and he has been communicating with a traumatic hallucinatory Konrad, created in his mind as a dissociative disorder upon the aftermath of the white phosphorus strike. Rationalizing the actions he had witnessed and carried out, Walker distorted many subsequent events of the game to make Konrad look responsible. With this revelation, 'Konrad' forces Walker, at gunpoint, to decide once and for all if he is to blame for his actions in Dubai.|$|E

5|$|After the {{southern}} campaign, the Commonwealth {{had to deal}} with a threat from the north, as the armistice, ending the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1629) was expiring. The majority of Polish nobles preferred to solve the problem through negotiations, unwilling to pay taxes for a new war, provided that Sweden was open to negotiations and concessions (in particular, to retreat from the occupied Polish coastal territories). Władysław himself <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> a war, which could yield some more significant territorial gains, and even managed to gather a sizeable army, with navy elements, near the disputed territories. Sweden, weakened by involvement in the Thirty Years' War, was however open to a peaceful solution. Władysław could not go against the decision of the Sejm and Senate, and agreed to support the treaty. Thus both sides agreed to sign the Armistice of Stuhmsdorf (Sztumska Wieś) on 12 September 1635, favourable to the Commonwealth, which regained the Prussian territories, and called for a reduction of the Swedish tolls on the maritime trade.|$|E

25|$|On August 14, 1979, Hinton set the piston-driven {{aircraft}} 3-kilometer world speed {{record at}} 499.018mph at Tonopah, Nevada, making Hinton, age 27, the youngest person ever {{to capture the}} speed record. The team <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> 100+ degree temperatures in the Nevada desert, conditions under which they believed they could achieve 530mph. The weather did not cooperate, however, and the cool 68-degree air held their speed just under 500mph. Even so, the record held for a decade.|$|E
25|$|Whereas the Reds were at or {{near the}} top of their {{division}} Foster's entire time in Cincinnati, the Mets were consistent cellar dwellers in the National League East when Foster joined his new club. The franchise <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> a turn around with Foster in tow, but it was not to be, as all of Foster's power numbers declined. He hit just 13 home runs while driving in 70 his first season in New York City, both the lowest numbers he'd put up since 1974.|$|E

25|$|The Byzantine Emperor <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> the Pope to {{stop his}} Latin adversaries. In fact after the death in 1276 of Pope Gregory X, the main {{supporter}} of the union of the churches, his successors maintained the same course and this restricted Charles' movements. However, in February 1281 Charles of Anjou achieved a diplomatic victory by imposing a French Pope, {{as the head of}} the Catholic Church. The Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII was excommunicated by the new Pope and Charles' expedition against him blessed as a new crusade.|$|E

Meanwhile, around 40km south, the XI Corps led by Galip was renewing attacks on Russian lines in an attempt to relieve the pressure on the IX and X Corps positioned in front of Sarikamish. The Russians were advancing and the circle was getting narrower.|$|E

The Spanish garrison was given the honours of war and marched out with their arms.|$|E
