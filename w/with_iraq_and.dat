5|$|Jordan's total {{foreign debt}} in 2012 was $22 billion, {{representing}} 72% of its GDP. In 2016, the debt reached $35.1 billion representing 90.6% of its GDP. This substantial increase {{is attributed to}} effects of regional instability causing: decrease in tourist activity; decreased foreign investments; increased military expenditure; attacks on Egyptian pipeline; the collapse of trade <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>and</b> Syria; expenses from hosting Syrian refugees and accumulated interests from loans. According to the World Bank, Syrian refugees have cost Jordan more than $2.5 billion a year, amounting to 6% of the GDP and 25% of the government's annual revenue. Foreign aid covers {{only a small part}} of these costs, 63% of the total costs are covered by Jordan. An economic programme was adopted by the government which aims to reduce Jordan's debt-to-GDP ratio to 77 percent by 2021.|$|E

25|$|A {{report by}} Strategic Foresight Group has {{estimated}} the opportunity cost of conflict for the Middle East from 1991–2010 at $12 trillion. The report's opportunity cost calculates the peace GDP of {{countries in the}} Middle East by comparing the current GDP to the potential GDP in times of peace. Israel's share is almost $1 trillion, <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>and</b> Saudi Arabia having approximately $2.2 and $4.5 trillion, respectively. In other words, had there been peace and cooperation between Israel and Arab League nations since 1991, the average Israeli citizen would be earning over $44,000 instead of $23,000 in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Assad {{was now in}} control, but {{he hesitated}} to push his advantage. Jadid {{continued}} to rule Syria, and the Regional Command was unchanged. However, Assad influenced Jadid to moderate his policies. Class struggle was muted, criticism of reactionary tendencies of other Arab states ceased, some political prisoners were freed, a coalition government was formed (with the Ba'ath Party in control) and the Eastern Front—espoused by Assad—was formed <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>and</b> Jordan. Jadid's isolationist policies were curtailed, and Syria reestablished diplomatic relations with many of its foes. Around this time, Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt, Houari Boumediene's Algeria and Ba'athist Iraq began sending emissaries to reconcile Assad and Jadid.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Zuhab, {{concluded}} on 17 May 1639, {{finally settled}} the Ottoman–Persian frontier, with Iraq permanently ceded to the Ottomans. Mesopotamia, which had formed {{an important part}} of various Persian empires {{from the time of the}} Achaemenids, was thereby irrevocably lost. The rest of the borders were restored roughly according to the way they were in 1555, with Eastern Armenia, Dagestan, eastern Georgia, and the contemporary Azerbaijan Republic remaining Persian, while Ottoman gains in Western Georgia and Western Armenia were made decisive. In broad terms, the Treaty of Zuhab reconfirmed the provisions of the 1555 Peace of Amasya. Eastern Samtskhe (Meskheti) was irrevocably lost to the Ottomans as well, making Samtskhe in its entirety an Ottoman possession. The peace established a permanent equilibrium of power in the region, and despite future conflicts and minor adjustments, the frontier postulated by the treaty remains to this day the western border of Iran <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>and</b> Turkey.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the ending}} of the British Raj in India, British {{interest}} in the Middle East remained strong: Britain had treaty relations with Jordan and Iraq and was the protecting power for Kuwait and the Trucial States, the colonial power in Aden, and the occupying power in the Suez Canal. Many right-wing Conservative MPs, organised in the so-called Suez Group, sought to retain this imperial role, though economic pressures made maintenance of it increasingly difficult. Britain did seek to maintain its huge military base in the Suez Canal zone and, in the face of Egyptian resentment, further develop its alliance <b>with</b> <b>Iraq,</b> <b>and</b> the hope was that the Americans would assist Britain, possibly through finance. While the Americans did co-operate with the British in overthrowing the Mosaddegh government in Iran, after it had nationalised British oil interests, the Americans developed their own relations in the region, taking a positive view of the Egyptian Free Officers and developing friendly relations with Saudi Arabia. Britain was eventually forced to withdraw from the canal zone and the Baghdad Pact security treaty was not supported by the United States, leaving Eden vulnerable to the charge of having failed to maintain British prestige.|$|E

500|$|Following the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, American intelligence agencies reported that aides of Saddam Hussein managed to acquire Belarusian passports while in Syria, {{but that it}} was unlikely that Belarus would offer a safe haven for Saddam and his two sons. This action, along with arms deals <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>and</b> Iran, prompted Western governments to take a tougher stance against Lukashenko. The US was particularly angered by the arms sales, and American political leaders increasingly began to refer to Belarus as [...] "Europe's last dictatorship". The EU was concerned for the security of its gas supplies from Russia, which are piped through Belarus, and took an active interest in Belarusian affairs. With the accession of Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, the EU's border with Belarus has grown to more than 1000kilometers.|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the events}} Clarke recounted during the {{hearings}} were also published in his memoir. Clarke charged that {{before and during the}} 9/11 crisis, many in the Administration were distracted from efforts against Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda organization by a pre-occupation <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>and</b> Saddam Hussein. Clarke had written that on September 12, 2001, President Bush pulled him and a couple of aides aside and [...] "testily" [...] asked him to try to find evidence that Saddam was connected to the terrorist attacks. In response he wrote a report stating {{there was no evidence of}} Iraqi involvement and got it signed by all relevant agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the CIA.

2500|$|On 6August American troops {{arrived at}} the Kuwait-Saudi Arabian border, Saddam's {{conditions}} were ignored, and Hussein's role as mediator was undermined. Saddam then announced that his invasion had become [...] "irreversible", and on 8August he annexed Kuwait. Jordan, along with the international community, refused to recognize the Iraqi-installed regime in Kuwait. The United States, seeing Jordan's neutrality as siding with Saddam, cut its aid to Jordanaid on which Jordan depended; Gulf countries soon followed. Hussein's position {{in the international community}} was severely affected, so severe that he privately discussed his intention to abdicate. Jordan's public opinion was overwhelmingly against international intervention, and against Gulf rulers who were perceived to be greedy and corrupt. Hussein's popularity among Jordanians reached its zenith, and anti-Western demonstrations filled the streets. But Western pundits viewed Hussein's actions as impulsive and emotional, claiming that he could have dampened Jordanian public support for Iraq through better leadership. Hussein's brother, Crown Prince Hassan, also disagreed with Hussein, but the King refused to recognize Saddam's wrongdoings. In late August and early September Hussein visited twelve Western and Arab capitals in an effort to promote a peaceful resolution. He finished his tour by flying directly to Baghdad to meet Saddam, where he warned: [...] "Make a brave decision and withdraw your forces; if you don't, you will be forced out." [...] Saddam was adamant but agreed to Hussein's request to release Western nationals who were being held as hostages. Threats of a war between Israel and Iraq were rising, and in December 1990 Hussein relayed a message to Saddam saying that Jordan would not tolerate any violations of its territory. Jordan dispatched an armored division to its borders <b>with</b> <b>Iraq,</b> <b>and</b> Hussein's eldest son Abdullah was in charge of a Cobra helicopter squadron. Jordan also concentrated its forces near its border with Israel. Adding to Jordan's deteriorating situation was the arrival of 400,000 Palestinian refugees from Kuwait, who had all been working there. By 28February 1991 the international coalition had successfully cleared Iraqi forces from Kuwait.|$|E
