500|$|The comic {{efficacy}} of Homer's personality lies in his frequent bouts of bumbling stupidity and laziness, and his explosive anger. He {{has a low}} intelligence level and is described by director David Silverman as [...] "creatively brilliant in his stupidity". Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and [...] "is devoted to his stomach". His short attention span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to [...] "change ... his mind when things go badly". Homer often spends his evenings drinking Duff Beer at Moe's Tavern, and was shown in the episode [...] "Duffless" [...] (season four, 1993) as a full-blown alcoholic. He is very envious of his neighbors, Ned Flanders and his family, and is easily enraged by Bart. Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse in a cartoonish manner. The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short [...] "Family Portrait". According to Matt Groening, the rule was that Homer could only strangle Bart impulsively, never with pre-meditation, because doing so [...] "seems sadistic. If <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> that he's ruled by his impulses, then he can easily switch impulses. So, even though he impulsively wants to strangle Bart, he also gives up fairly easily." [...] Another of the original ideas entertained by Groening was that Homer would [...] "always get his comeuppance or Bart had to strangle him back", but this was dropped. Homer shows no compunction about expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people outside the family.|$|E

60|$|But more: these sad {{thoughts}} make us {{see ourselves}} as God sees us.

So let us face those sad night thoughts, however painful, however humiliating they may be; for by them God is calling us to repentance, and forcing us to keep Lent in spirit and in truth, whether <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> outwardly or not.|$|E

Fathers and brothers think it discreditable to themselves not to give their daughters and sisters the means of living in idleness; and any adventurous fair one, who seeks to end the ennui of utter aimlessness by applying herself to some occupation whereby she may earn her own living, infallibly draws down on her the comments of her whole circle: 'Keeping school, is she?

"I don't {{suppose the}} {{authorities}} {{will want to}} keep the prisoners, but of course you will report them on your arrival; and can give them one of the boats, to land across the bay, if they are not wanted.

It is just as well to be on good terms with the authorities. We might have to put in to refit, and want spars, etc., from the naval yard. If the governor doesn't want the cargo, don't sell it to anyone else till we return. There is no fear of prices going down.
