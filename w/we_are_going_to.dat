If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be serious about living in a Circular Economy we need to recognise the value of our waste and ensure resources are kept in the economy for longer, slow down the use of valuable raw materials and ensure that products are reused and materials are recycled rather than landfilled.|$|E
25|$|The {{target of}} the right-wing vested {{interests}} was a famous annual May Day celebration at the Portella della Ginestra. A {{few days before the}} festivities, Giuliano received a letter that was evidently the culmination of negotiations. After reading it, the bandit chieftain burned it and announced, “The hour of our liberation has come. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> attack the Communists, to go to fire on them on May 1 at Portella della Ginestra.” One of his bandits protested that women and children would be present. The chieftain replied that only leaders would be targeted. Giuliano's behavior before and after the armed action indicate that he believed that he and his men would be offered pardons for their crimes if all went well on May Day, an outcome ostensibly guaranteed by some prominent Sicilian. According to Giuliano's later statements, his main aim of the day was the capture of Girolamo Li Causi, head of the Communist party of Sicily—any other action was a diversionary tactic to facilitate Li Causi's capture. Although scheduled to speak, Li Causi did not attend.|$|E

[...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E
