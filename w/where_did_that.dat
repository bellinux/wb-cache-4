2500|$|Steven Moffat {{has said}} that {{reference}} {{will be made to}} Peter Capaldi's previous appearances in the Whoniverse during his tenure as the Twelfth Doctor: [...] "The face is not set from birth. It’s not like he was always going to be one day Peter Capaldi. We know that’s the case because in The War Games he has a choice of faces. So we know it’s not set, so where does he get those faces from? They can’t just be randomly generated because they've got lines. They've aged. When he turns into Peter he’ll actually have lines on his face. So <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> face come from?” In [...] "Deep Breath" [...] (2014), the Doctor and several other characters speculate about where his new face came from, given that it has lines from frowning. The Doctor considers aloud that it is a face he recognises from somewhere, but due to post-regenerative trauma, he cannot place it. In [...] "The Girl Who Died" [...] (2015), he concludes that he subconsciously chose the face as a reminder of his decision {{to save the life of}} Caecilius (also played by Capaldi) in [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] (2008) and to remind him to save people even with possible historical consequences by doing so.|$|E

60|$|A knotty {{point for}} Venters {{was the fact}} that the cattle tracks all pointed west. The broad trail came from the {{direction}} of the canyon into which the rustlers had ridden, and undoubtedly the cattle had been driven out of it across the oval. There were no tracks pointing the other way. It had been in his mind that Oldring had driven the red herd toward the rendezvous, and not from it. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> broad trail come down into the pass, and where did it lead? Venters knew he wasted time in pondering the question, but it held a fascination not easily dispelled.

50|$|The German {{productions}} {{used the}} same costumes with some new additions - the most notable change being that Milady's costume for <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> summer go? was changed from a black leather coat and dishevelled hair to a long black velvet gown and her hair down and curly.
