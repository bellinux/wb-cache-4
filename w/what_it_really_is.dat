5|$|The novel, {{described}} as a political, social and ethical commentary {{on the nature of}} good and evil, takes place in the Land of Oz, in the years leading to Dorothy's arrival. The story centers on Elphaba, the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious Wicked Witch of the West and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become Glinda the Good Witch of the South. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters and situations from L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 film adaptation in new ways. It is designed to set the reader thinking about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> to be 'Wicked', and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script. To this end, he collaborated with Emmy Award–winning writer Winnie Holzman to develop the outline of the plot {{over the course of a}} year while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.|$|E
25|$|Allegorically, the Inferno {{represents}} the Christian soul seeing sin for <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is,</b> {{and the three}} beasts represent three types of sin: the self-indulgent, the violent, and the malicious. These three types of sin also provide the three main divisions of Dante's Hell: Upper Hell, outside the city of Dis, for the four sins of indulgence (lust, gluttony, avarice, anger); Circle 7 {{for the sins of}} violence; and Circles 8 and 9 for the sins of malice (fraud and treachery). Added to these are two unlike categories that are specifically spiritual: Limbo, in Circle 1, contains the virtuous pagans who were not sinful but were ignorant of Christ, and Circle 6 contains the heretics who contradicted the doctrine and confused the spirit of Christ. The circles number 9, with the addition of Satan completing the structure of 9 + 1 = 10.|$|E
500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I have no idea <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it. I have to look like I’ve been doing it a long time".|$|E

2500|$|Even in [...] "naked commerce", the {{possible}} methods of [...] "masking" [...] what one is, what one represents or what one does, are extremely diverse. Human languages and numerical systems, for example, offer very subtle distinctions of meaning that can [...] "cover up" [...] something, or present it {{as different from}} <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b> Anthropologists, sociologists and linguists have sometimes studied [...] "linguistic masking".|$|E

2500|$|In {{several of}} his later publications, {{especially}} Beyond Theology and The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are, Watts put forward a worldview, drawing on Hinduism, Chinese philosophy, pantheism or panentheism, and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic Self playing hide-and-seek (Lila); hiding from itself (Maya) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe and forgetting <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> – the upshot being {{that we are all}} IT in disguise. In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception of ourselves as an [...] "ego in a bag of skin," [...] or [...] "skin-encapsulated ego" [...] is a myth; the entities we call the separate [...] "things" [...] are merely aspects or features of the whole.|$|E
2500|$|Virgil {{proceeds}} to guide Dante through the nine circles of Hell. The circles are concentric, representing a gradual increase in wickedness, and culminating at {{the centre of}} the earth, where Satan is held in bondage. The sinners of each circle are punished for eternity in a fashion fitting their crimes: each punishment is a contrapasso, a symbolic instance of poetic justice. For example, later in the poem, Dante and Virgil encounter fortune-tellers who must walk forward with their heads on backward, unable to see what is ahead, because they tried to see the future through forbidden means. Such a contrapasso [...] "functions not merely as a form of divine revenge, but rather as the fulfilment of a destiny freely chosen by each soul during his or her life". People who sinned, but prayed for forgiveness before their deaths are found not in Hell but in Purgatory, where they labour to become free of their sins. Those in Hell are people who tried to justify their sins and are unrepentant. Allegorically, the Inferno represents the Christian soul seeing sin for <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Although she is {{credited}} on the sleeve, the album does not feature Velvet Underground stalwart drummer Maureen Tucker, {{as she was}} pregnant at the time. Drumming duties were performed mainly by bassist Doug Yule, recording engineer Adrian Barber, session musician Tommy Castanero and Doug Yule's brother Billy. Lou Reed commented that [...] "Loaded didn't have Maureen on it, and that's a lot of people's favorite Velvet Underground record, so we can't get too lost in the mystique of the Velvet Underground... It's still called a Velvet Underground record. But <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> is something else." [...] Sterling Morrison had strong feelings about Yule's increased presence on Loaded, saying: [...] "The album came out okay, as far as production it's the best, {{but it would have}} been better if it had real good Lou vocals on all the tracks." [...] While Morrison contributed guitar tracks to the album, he was also attending City College of New York and juggling his time between the sessions and classes, leaving most of the creative input to Reed and Yule. Doug Yule claimed that [...] "Lou leaned on me a lot in terms of musical support and vocal arrangements. I did a lot on Loaded. It sort of devolved down to the Lou and Yule recreational recording". Of the ten songs that make up Loaded, Yule's lead vocals were featured on four songs: [...] "Who Loves the Sun", which opens the album, [...] "New Age", [...] "Lonesome Cowboy Bill", and [...] "Oh! Sweet Nuthin'". In addition to his lead vocal parts, Yule handled all of the bass, piano and organ duties, and also recorded several lead guitar tracks. The guitar solos on [...] "Rock and Roll", [...] "Cool it Down", [...] "Head Held High" [...] and [...] "Oh! Sweet Nuthin'" [...] were all played by Yule.|$|E

50|$|In Ritter's opinion, Germany can {{be criticized}} for its mistaken {{evaluation}} {{of the state of}} European power politics in July 1914. According to Ritter, the German government had underrated the state of military readiness in Russia and France, falsely assumed that British foreign policy was more peaceful than <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was,</b> overrated the sense of moral outrage caused by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on European opinion, and above all, overestimated the military power and political common sense of Austria-Hungary.|$|R
