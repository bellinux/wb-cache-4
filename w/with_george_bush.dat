500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E

5000|$|In {{what would}} be the start of a {{tradition}} in open primary campaigns, The first (of six) Republican presidential debate in over 30 years was held in Iowa on January 6, 1980. Former California Governor Ronald Reagan, who was the prohibitive front-runner, chose to bypass the debate, as it was beneath his dignity. Five of the ten candidates participated: George Bush, John Anderson, Phil Crane, Bob Dole, and John Connally. The participants openly criticized Reagan for taking the state caucus for granted, which {{set the stage for a}} victory by Ambassador Bush. Reagan would participate in all further debates, including the decisive one, the February 23 “‘Ambush at Nashua’ debate <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Dukakis {{had trouble}} with the {{personality}} that he projected to the voting public. His reserved and stoic nature was easily interpreted to be a lack of passion; Dukakis was {{often referred to as}} [...] "Zorba the Clerk". Nevertheless, Dukakis is considered to have done well in the first presidential debate <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush,</b> but in the second debate, his performance was poor and played to his reputation as being cold. During the campaign, Dukakis's mental health became an issue when he refused to release his full medical history and there were, according to The New York Times, [...] "persistent suggestions" [...] that he had undergone psychiatric treatment in the past. [...] In the 2008 film Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story, journalist Robert Novak revealed that Republican strategist Lee Atwater had personally {{tried to get him to}} spread these mental health rumors. Editors at The Washington Times contributed to these rumors when they ran a story headlined [...] "Dukakis Kin Hints at Sessions," [...] suggesting that a member of the Dukakis family had said [...] "it is possible" [...] that Dukakis saw a psychiatrist. A week later the reporter, Gene Grabowski, revealed that Times editors had taken the full quote out of context. The full quote was [...] "It's possible, but I doubt it." ...|$|E

However, the year also saw a growing EU irritation, especially from France and Germany, at Tony Blair's close relations <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush,</b> and the gulf widened towards its end as war with Iraq looked increasingly likely. For its part, Britain was irritated by the watering down of a reform package by France and Germany. In addition, signs of a rift between Blair and Gordon Brown over the euro and proposals for closer union emerging from the European Constitutional Convention are both likely to make Britain relations with Europe more difficult...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} traces algorithmic citizenship {{as it is}} constituted through war {{on terror}} discourse. Utilizing Ron Greene’s rhetorical materialism, this project analyzes corporate discourse along with presidential address and policy to map how they interpellate citizens’ subjectivity. Specifically, the dissertation follows George Bush’s presidential rhetoric as he defines {{the war on terror}} and invites the public to participate. Then the dissertation examines how the political discourse associated with government 2. 0 is also an economic discourse that works to articulate citizenship alongside consumerism. The next chapter follows the presidential rhetoric of Barack Obama as he intensifies the surveillance and war fighting rhetoric identified <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> and IBM. Finally, the dissertation maps the communicative function and role played by whistleblowers and theorizes how the interactive values of government 2. 0 and algorithmic citizenship offer the potential for rhetorical agency...|$|E
40|$|Although {{both are}} {{fundamental}} {{terms in the}} humanities and social sciences, discourse and knowledge have seldom been explicitly related, and even less so in critical discourse studies. After a brief summary {{of what we know}} about these relationships in linguistics, psychology, epistemology and the social sciences, with special emphasis on the role of knowledge in the formation of mental models as a basis for discourse, I examine in more detail how a critical study of discourse and knowledge may be articulated in critical discourse studies. Thus, several areas of critical epistemic discourse analysis are identified, and then applied in a study of Tony Blair’s Iraq speech on March 18, 2003, in which he sought to legitimatize his {{decision to go to war}} in Iraq <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush.</b> The analysis shows the various modes of how knowledge is managed and manipulated of all levels of discourse of this speech...|$|E
