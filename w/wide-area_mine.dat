50|$|The M93 Hornet mine is an American {{anti-tank}} mine, it is a <b>wide-area</b> <b>mine,</b> {{capable of}} attacking targets up to 100 meters {{away from its}} position.|$|E
5|$|And {{there were}} already {{problems}} with the system. The anti-personnel portion of the program had already failed. The presence and movements of enemy troops were to be detected by the utilization of small, <b>wide-area</b> Gravel <b>mines</b> that were to alert the acoustic sensors. Unfortunately, the mines rapidly deteriorated in the heat and humidity of Laos, nullifying their effectiveness. The focus of any interdiction campaign, therefore, would have to concentrate on PAVN supply transportation. The war against trucks was about to begin.|$|R
500|$|The {{deployment}} of Gravel <b>mines</b> and the <b>Wide-Area</b> Anti-Personnel <b>Mine</b> System became integral {{parts of the}} operation. Other weapons were specifically developed or otherwise became associated with the campaign as well. These notably included the BLU-31/B and Mk 36 air-dropped mines, BLU-43/B and BLU-44/B landmine system (Dragontooth), the BLU-72/B fuel-air explosive (Pave Pat), and the BLU-52/A chemical bomb (filled with bulk CS-2 powder). [...] Anti-vehicle operations in support of Muscle Shoals/Igloo White were designated Mud River, while anti-personnel operations received the codename Dump Truck.|$|R
500|$|PAVN {{personnel}} {{moving on}} foot through the trail {{system would be}} detected by the detonation of air-sown, aspirin-sized, <b>wide-area</b> Gravel <b>mines,</b> which would activate the sensors. Subsequent bomb damage assessment missions and hand emplacement of sensors and mines in support of Muscle Shoals would {{be carried out by}} the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG). [...] A number of hand emplaced units were developed for this role, including the MICROSID and MINISID, and a device designed to work with either called MAGID, a magnetic detector, designed to be triggered by amounts of metal as small as an infantry rifle.|$|R
5|$|There {{were some}} initial {{problems}} with the system. During Operation Commando Hunt I, for example, {{there were so many}} aircraft piling up in the air space over southern Laos that the air controllers and FACs could not keep track of them. Pilots, many of whom were veterans of Rolling Thunder, tended to arrive over the area in large waves instead of spacing out their arrivals over time. One technical failure, however, would have huge ramifications for the entire program. The anti-personnel system, which was based on the dispersal of <b>wide-area</b> Gravel <b>mines</b> (the explosions of which would activate acoustic sensors) failed completely. The mines deteriorated too rapidly in the heat and humidity of Laos, thereby negating the system.|$|R
5000|$|The sensors {{reported}} their data via radio frequency channels ranging upward from 162 megahertz (MHz) to 174 MHz {{on the very}} high frequency band. 31 channels were assigned to each type of sensor with a 375 kHz separation between each channel. Every channel contained 27 identification codes or addresses which could be set in the field prior to emplacement. Thus, a total of 837 individual sensors (27x31) could be deployed {{at any one time}} without signal duplication in a single operational zone.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} anomaly detection in hyperspectral images based on the support vector data description (SVDD), a kernel method for modeling {{the support of a}} distribution. Conventional anomaly-detection algorithms are based upon the popular Reed–Xiaoli detector. However, these algorithms typically suffer from large numbers of false alarms due to the assumptions that the local background is Gaussian and homogeneous. In practice, these assumptions are often violated, especially when the neighborhood of a pixel contains multiple types of terrain. To remove these assumptions, a novel anomaly detector that incorporates a nonparametric background model based on the SVDD is derived. Expanding on prior SVDD work, a geometric interpretation of the SVDD is used to propose a decision rule that utilizes a new test statistic and shares some of the properties of constant false-alarm rate detectors. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the authors report results that demonstrate the improved performance and reduction in the false-alarm rate when using the SVDD-based detector on <b>wide-area</b> airborne <b>mine</b> detection (WAAMD) and hyperspectral digital imagery collection experiment (HYDICE) imagery.
