Seabait uses some of the excess hot water that the plant generates to grow <b>worms</b> four {{times as fast as}} in the wild. The <b>worms</b> are used for several purposes, {{primarily}} for providing <b>worms</b> as bait while fishing. However, the <b>worms</b> are also frozen, packaged and exported to seafood farms. This is seen as environmentally beneficial as it reduces the need for bait digging in natural habitats.|$|E
5|$|<b>Worms</b> Armageddon is a 2D {{artillery}} turn-based tactics {{video game}} developed by Team17 {{and part of}} the <b>Worms</b> series. The player controls a team of up to eight <b>worms</b> in combat against opposing teams either AI- or player-controlled, using weapons both based on real-life weapons and ones that are cartoonish. The player can customize battles, teams, and maps for near-infinite gameplay options.|$|E

The Steam release included all improvements from the previously-released updates. This release was made available on 12 September 2012. On 20 March 2013, <b>Worms</b> Armageddon was released onto the Steam store as a standalone game.|$|E

5|$|<b>Worms</b> Armageddon was {{originally}} intended to be an expansion pack to <b>Worms</b> 2, but it was eventually developed as a standalone game. It {{was intended to be}} the last game of the <b>Worms</b> franchise, but Andy Davidson, the creator of <b>Worms,</b> felt that it needed more content before being released, leading to the development of <b>Worms</b> World Party. It was also going to be released under the name Wormageddon, but Team17 changed the name to <b>Worms</b> Armageddon because of close similarities to {{the name of the game}} Carmageddon. It was released initially for PCs in 1999 in Europe and on 31 May 1999 in North America and has since been ported to Dreamcast and PlayStation on 30 November 1999, Game Boy Color on 19 January 2000, and Nintendo 64 on 30 March 2000. The Nintendo 64 version is one of the first Nintendo 64 games to feature a terrain editor and generator. A Macintosh version was being developed by MacSoft, but it has since been cancelled. <b>Worms</b> Armageddon was produced by Martyn Brown and composed by Bjørn Lynne, Karl Morton was the game's lead programmer, and Dan Cartwright was the game's lead artist.|$|E
5|$|Despite its age, <b>Worms</b> Armageddon still {{receives}} periodic updates, {{mainly from}} two programmers known as Deadcode and CyberShadow, recruited by Team17. These updates address bugs and compatibility issues, and also add new features to the game, such as {{support for a}} greater number of <b>worms</b> in a match and support for arbitrarily-sized colour levels. The latest update was on 19 March 2013.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay is turn-based, {{with each}} team moving in sequence, which is {{determined}} randomly, across two-dimensional terrain. During a single turn, a team can only move {{one of their}} <b>worms</b> (unless an item that allows the team to select their worm is used). <b>Worms</b> can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) swing by rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee. The objective of a traditional match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their <b>worms,</b> although in the campaign some missions have other objectives such as collecting a specific crate.|$|E

5|$|Paterson's <b>worms</b> are {{a family}} of {{cellular}} automata devised in 1971 by Mike Paterson and John Horton Conway to model the behaviour and feeding patterns of certain prehistoric <b>worms.</b> In the model, a worm moves between points on a triangular grid along line segments, representing food.

5|$|The PC {{version of}} <b>Worms</b> Armageddon was {{critically}} successful. Whilst writing that veterans of <b>Worms</b> 2 {{would find the}} game to be similar, Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the game for being easy to play and control and humorous and the game's graphics, physics, and seemingly endless customization {{as well as the}} game's WormNet. He also likened the single-player missions to the classic game of Lemmings in that the missions often required the player to precisely utilize a limited supply of weapons and tools to accomplish the objective. Among his only criticisms are that the AI-controlled <b>worms</b> do not utilize their full arsenals and that the player would wish that there were more weapons, more diverse graphics and sound, and more content. Matthew Pierce of PC Gamer UK commended Team17 for addressing the problems of single-player (i.e. the missions and AI) that the original <b>Worms</b> and <b>Worms</b> 2 had always been criticized for.|$|E
5|$|The {{grasshopper}} nematode (Mermis nigrescens) {{is a long}} slender worm that infects grasshoppers, {{living in}} the insect's hemocoel. Adult <b>worms</b> lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic <b>worms</b> that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the <b>worms</b> are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite {{to continue with the}} next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.|$|E

5|$|<b>Worms</b> Armageddon {{includes}} {{a very high}} level of customizability – in multiplayer games or skirmishes, the player can create custom game modes with preferred gameplay options and weapon sets. Regular options include starting health, whether the <b>worms</b> can move, how long a turn lasts, and sudden death options. Weapons settings include what weapons the teams start with, which weapons will fall in crates and how often, and how powerful individual weapons are. <b>Worms</b> Armageddon offers several levels of customizability outside of direct gameplay options.|$|E

Males can reach a maximum total length of 40 cm.|$|R
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} performed since the 1990s has extended {{the understanding of}} the relationship between different organisms. It is now clear the brachiopods do not belong to the Deuterostomata (such as echinoderms and chordates) as was hypothesized earlier, but {{should be included in the}} Protostomia (with mollusks and annelid <b>worms),</b> in a subgroup now called Lophotrochozoa. Although their adult morphology seems rather different, the nucleotid sequence of the 18S rRNA indicates that the horseshoe <b>worms</b> are the closest relatives of the inarticulate brachiopods rather than articulate brachiopods. For now, the weight of evidence is inconclusive as to the exact relations within the inarticulates. Consequently, it has been suggested to included horseshoe <b>worms</b> in the Brachiopoda as a class named Phoronata B.L.Cohen in addition to the Craniata and Lingulata, within the subphylum Linguliformea. The other subphylum Rhynchonelliformea only contains one class, which is subdivided in the orders Rhynchonellida, Terebratulida and Thecideida.|$|E

Many seamounts also have hydrothermal vent communities, for example Suiyo and Loihi seamounts. This is helped by geochemical exchange between the seamounts and the ocean water.|$|E
