Papyrus is a thick, paper-like material produced from the pith of the Cyperus papyrus plant, which was used in ancient Egypt and other Mediterranean cultures for writing before the introduction of paper into the Middle East and Europe. Although the <b>word</b> <b>paper</b> <b>is</b> etymologically derived from papyrus, the two are produced very differently {{and the development of}} the first is distinct from the development of the second.

Mindfulness based interventions (MBIs) mitigate stress and prevent relapse in depression and {{are increasingly being}} used in healthcare. However, there are currently no systematic reviews of MBIs in people with MS. This review aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of MBIs in people with MS. Methods Systematic searches were carried out in seven major databases, using both subject headings and key <b>words.</b> <b>Papers</b> <b>were</b> screened, data extracted, quality appraised, and analysed by two reviewers independently, using predefined criteria.

40|$|PURPOSE: This is a {{narrative}} systematic synthesis of qualitative research investigating patients' accounts {{of living with}} psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Qualitative methodologies allow patients to share lived experiences in their own words. The examination of patients' own accounts is likely to offer revealing insights into a poorly understood, heterogeneous disorder. METHODS: We identified 21 separate studies about PNES published after 1996 and based on analyses of patients' own <b>words.</b> <b>Papers</b> <b>were</b> synthesised inductively and deductively using an iterative approach. RESULTS: Five key themes emerged from the synthesis of studies capturing accounts from over 220 patients, reflecting experiences of seizure events, diagnosis, treatment and management, emotional events, and impact on daily life. Patients with PNES discussed the phenomenology of their seizures differently from those with epilepsy. PNES were experientially heterogeneous. Many patients shared a sense of uncertainty surrounding PNES, often resisting psychological explanations. Negative experiences with healthcare professionals were common. Patients seeking validation of their experiences often reported feeling ignored or doubted. Many reported past or current stressful events. Some demonstrated insight into their methods of emotional processing. PNES were described as a significant burden associated with financial and psychosocial losses. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative studies have produced helpful insights into patients' experiences of living with PNES, but many patient groups (men, young people, elderly, non-Western patients) are underrepresented in studies carried out to date. Research capturing these patient groups and using new methods of data collection and qualitative analysis could help to deepen our understanding of this disorder...|$|R

This paper details a case study focused on two kindergarten classes of five year-old children and their teachers and took place in Cyprus.

Through the analysis of children’s responses {{it was possible to}} identify specific misconceptions related to the concept of rain. The results indicate that it is very important for teachers to be aware of what misconceptions children have, because this can help them plan lessons for children to overcome their misconceptions.

A word in a sentence， generally has the function(s) which can be defined {{in relation to other}} elements of the sentence. In this paper we wiI 1 refer to this sort of function as grammatical function of word. And sometimes it is the case that a word can fulfill different functions in different sentences. Thus the word "there" is used either a. s a. deictic locative adverb or as an expletive element. The problem for a retrieval system is the following: when we are in search of expletive "there"，sentences， for example， the sentences containing locative "there" are irrelevant. It is necessary to decrease the number of these unexpected sentences in the result of retrieval， possibly up to zero.
