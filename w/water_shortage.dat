5|$|At the hearing, new {{evidence}} was heard, that heavy rain {{had fallen on}} the ship {{on the second day}} of the killings, but a third batch of slaves was killed after that. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo. One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as the jury had heard testimony that the <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain. Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by Zong crew.|$|E

40|$|Most {{urban centres}} across Australia are facing <b>water</b> <b>shortages.</b> In part, these <b>water</b> <b>shortages</b> {{are due to}} the {{variability}} {{of supply and demand}} caused by variable climatic conditions. Permanent supply augmentation to meet periodic <b>water</b> <b>shortages</b> can be costly. Water trade between rural and urban areas, through urban water options contracts, may be a less costly way to meet variability. Urban water options could be used to improve system reliability and may reduce costs by delaying investment and reducing the frequency and severity of <b>water</b> <b>shortages.</b> This paper investigates the potential to use urban water options contracts, and develops a methodology for evaluation. † The views presented in this paper, drawn from preliminary work in progress, are those of the author...|$|R
40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>shortages</b> {{are often}} viewed as a problem facing {{emerging}} economies, but with changes in weather patterns developed economies are discovering that the water supply infrastructure {{that was designed to}} meet their needs is failing to provide an adequate supply of water for consumers. In regions where an adequate supply of water was taken for granted households and businesses are ill-prepared to manage <b>water</b> <b>shortages.</b> Many businesses are able to manage changing resource availability however responding to changes requires that they understand the risks associated with <b>water</b> <b>shortages</b> and they have sufficient time to implement operational changes to meet the scarity of water. The paper reports on the approach taken by an association of businesses in Australia to understand and manage the risks associated with ongoing <b>water</b> <b>shortages...</b>|$|R
5|$|Coral Springs' {{water supply}} {{comes from the}} Biscayne Aquifer, South Florida's primary source of {{drinking}} water. There are four different water districts within the city; the providers are the City of Coral Springs Water District, Coral Springs Improvement District, North Springs Improvement District and Royal Utilities. The South Florida Water Management District provides flood control protection and water supply protection to local residents, controls all <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> management efforts and assigns water restrictions when necessary. Collection and disposal of city's trash or garbage is provided by Waste Pro. Electric power service is distributed by Florida Power & Light.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} the {{population}} of the nearby village of Burnside was expanding and required a new water supply. First Creekwhich runs down Waterfall Gully and enters the River Torrens near today's Botanic Gardenswas seen as the perfect solution to the <b>water</b> <b>shortage.</b> A weir was built during 1881 and 1882, and was made to hold approximately two megalitres (530,000USgallons) of water. A pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at Burnside South, and from there the water was used throughout the surrounding area. As a side effect, the weir also reduced the volume of water available to the local market gardeners, and over many years that aspect of the region disappeared.|$|E
5|$|In Grenada, the island's {{governor}} {{issued an}} emergency order against the hoarding {{of food in}} the aftermath of Janet, due to the food and <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> that resulted from Janet. A United States destroyer and a British frigate were sent to bring relief supplies to Grenada, and ships departing from Jamaica and Trinidad were redirected to the island to help send supplies. The British government later announced that it would send £50,000 (US$155,000) in relief to the Grenadines. The Crown Agents and Red Cross delivered relief supplies to Barbados and the Grenadines, which included aluminum roofing sheets and portable electric generators.|$|E

5|$|Delhi's {{municipal}} water supply is {{managed by the}} Delhi Jal Board (DJB). , it supplied 650million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963MGD. The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute <b>water</b> <b>shortage.</b> Research on Delhi suggests that {{up to half of}} the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD. The daily domestic waste water production is 470MGD and industrial waste water is 70MGD. A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 18th century, the region came under the Kingdom of Mysore, {{following}} a series of wars with the Madurai Nayak dynasty. After the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British East India Company annexed Coimbatore to the Madras Presidency in 1799. The Coimbatore region played a prominent role in the Second Poligar War (1801), when it was the area of operations of Dheeran Chinnamalai. In 1804, Coimbatore was established as the capital of the newly formed Coimbatore district and in 1866 it was accorded municipality status. Sir Robert Stanes became the first Chairman of the Coimbatore City Council. The region was hard hit during the Great Famine of 1876–78 resulting in nearly 200,000 famine related fatalities. The first three decades of the 20th century saw nearly 20,000 plague-related deaths and acute <b>water</b> <b>shortage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Quolls {{are mostly}} carnivorous. The smaller quolls {{primarily}} eat insects, birds, frogs, lizards and fruit; the larger species eat birds, reptiles, and mammals, including echidnas and possums. The tiger quoll's diet {{is dominated by}} mammals such as brushtail possums, rabbits and hares. The exact mix is variable depending {{on the availability of}} prey after bushfires, and can include carrion or bandicoots when food is scarce. The other species of quoll have also been known to eat carrion. The paws and vibrissae of quolls allow them to reach into small burrows to find prey. Quolls hunt by stalking. Depending on the size of its prey, a quoll may leap or pounce on it. Quolls pin small prey down with their front paws while devouring it, and jump onto larger prey, sinking in their claws and closing their jaws around the neck. Quolls can obtain all the water they need from their food, making them quite adaptable during droughts or other periods of <b>water</b> <b>shortage.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{continued}} to advance into {{the outskirts of}} Singapore throughout 14 February. Threatened with being isolated, the Australians made plans to make a last stand. With the Japanese closing in, the island's civilian population began to suffer heavily as they were subjected to heavy artillery bombardment and aerial attacks from Japanese aircraft that were increasingly unopposed as anti-aircraft guns ran out of ammunition. Supplies of water and food also dwindled, and the <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> was made worse {{by the loss of}} the island's reservoirs. Finally, in the morning of 15 February, after the Japanese had succeeded in infiltrating towards Mount Pleasant Ridge, Percival determined that a counterattack was not viable and instead decided to surrender the garrison. The battalion's final involvement in the fighting came that afternoon when 'A' and 'D' Companies were heavily shelled. A short time later, at 8:30pm, the surrender came into effect and the men of the 2/18th received orders not to escape.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} routes towards Syria from Iraq, one was via Daumat-ul-Jandal (Now known as Skaka) {{and the other}} was through Mesopotamia passing though Raqqa. Since the Muslim forces in Syria were in need of urgent reinforcement, Khalid avoided the {{conventional}} route to Syria via Daumat-ul-Jandal because it was a long and would take weeks to reach Syria. He also avoided the Mesopotamian route {{because of the presence of}} Roman garrisons in northern Syria and Mesopotamia. Engaging them at the time when Muslim armies were being outflanked in Syria, was also ruled out since it would mean fighting on two fronts. Khalid selected a rather shorter route to Syria which unconventionally passed though the Syrian Desert. He marched his army though the desert, where traditions tells that his soldiers marched for two days without a single drop of water, before reaching a pre-decided water source at an oasis. Khalid is said to have solved the <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> issue using a Bedouin method. Camels were made to drink water after intentionally denying them water for a lengthy time period, encouraging the camels to drink a lot of water at one time. Camels have the ability to store water in their stomach which in turn could be obtained by slaughtering them when necessary. Muslim troops rode entirely on camels and this method became an effective one for the Muslim army.|$|E
