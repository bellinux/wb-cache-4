5|$|Chesney served {{again as}} the leader of Stephen's army at Wallingford Castle in 1153 and in August he was {{defeated}} by Henry of Anjou. The subsequent peace settlement, the Treaty of Wallingford, gave Henry the English throne after Stephen's death. A part of the treaty awarded control of Oxford Castle to Roger de Bussy. Although Chesney had lost control of the castle, none of his lands were confiscated. Early in 1154, Chesney was <b>with</b> <b>Henry,</b> as he was a witness on two charters of Henry's. After Henry's ascension to the throne, Chesney came to terms with the new king, and received confirmation of his lands from the king by 1157. He spent time in Normandy <b>with</b> <b>Henry</b> from 1159 through to 1161. He continued to receive favours from the king, such as exemption for payment of danegeld on his manor of Deddington in 1156.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{also notes}} two flaws in Rhys's achievement. One was the {{personal}} {{nature of his}} accord <b>with</b> <b>Henry</b> II, which meant {{that it did not}} survive Henry's death.

He was not summoned to the Parliament at London in January 1265 because he was abroad. On {{the triumph of the}} king's party in 1265, he returned to England, arriving there in May 1266.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Toulouse episode, Louis made an attempt to repair relations <b>with</b> <b>Henry</b> through an 1160 peace treaty: this promised Henry the lands and the rights of his grandfather, Henry I; it reaffirmed the betrothal of Young Henry and Margaret and the Vexin deal; and it involved Young Henry giving homage to Louis, a way of reinforcing the young boy's position as heir and Louis's position as king. Almost immediately after the peace conference, however, Louis shifted his position considerably. Louis's wife Constance died and Louis married Adèle, the sister of the Counts of Blois and Champagne. Louis also betrothed daughters by Eleanor to Theobald of Blois's sons, Theobald and Henry. This represented an aggressive containment strategy towards Henry rather than the agreed rapprochement, and caused Theobald to abandon his alliance <b>with</b> <b>Henry.</b> Henry reacted angrily; the King had custody of both Young Henry and Margaret, and in November he bullied several papal legates into marrying them—despite the children being only five and three years old respectively—and promptly seized the Vexin. Now it was Louis's turn to be furious, as the move clearly broke the spirit of the 1160 treaty.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} since its release, modern film {{scholars}} {{have noted the}} possible homosexual reading of the film. Director James Whale was openly gay, {{and some of the}} actors in the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were believed to be gay or bisexual. Although James Curtis, Whale's biographer, rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective, scholars have perceived a gay subtext suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius and his relationship <b>with</b> <b>Henry.</b>|$|E
5|$|John flirts with Catherine at a ball, {{but she is}} more {{interested}} in meeting <b>with</b> <b>Henry</b> and his sister, Eleanor (Catherine Walker). Catherine is pressured by Isabella and John into riding to Blaise Castle, despite her having made plans for a walk <b>with</b> <b>Henry</b> and Eleanor. John assures her that he saw Henry driving a phaeton to Wick Rocks, but while Catherine is in John's carriage, she sees the Tilneys walking along the street. Catherine asks John to stop, knowing he lied to her, but he refuses. Catherine runs into the Tilney family at the opera and makes her apologies, before planning another walk. John tells Henry's father, General Tilney (Liam Cunningham), that Catherine is the Allens' heir, and the General invites her to spend the day with the family. Catherine is delighted when she learns Henry and Eleanor love books as much as she does.|$|E
5|$|King Henry's Mound, a Neolithic burial barrow, is {{the highest}} point within the park and is located within the public gardens of Pembroke Lodge.

5|$|Stephen's {{early life}} was heavily {{influenced}} by {{his relationship with his}} uncle Henry I. Henry seized power in England following the death of his elder brother William Rufus. In 1106 he invaded and captured the Duchy of Normandy, controlled by his eldest brother, Robert Curthose, defeating Robert's army at the battle of Tinchebray. Henry then found himself in conflict with Louis VI of France, who took the opportunity to declare Robert's son William Clito the Duke of Normandy. Henry responded by forming a network of alliances with the western counties of France against Louis, resulting in a regional conflict that would last throughout Stephen's early life. Adela and Theobald allied themselves <b>with</b> <b>Henry,</b> and Stephen's mother decided to place him in Henry's court. Henry fought his next military campaign in Normandy, from 1111 onwards, where rebels led by Robert of Bellême were opposing his rule. Stephen was probably <b>with</b> <b>Henry</b> during the military campaign of 1112, when he was knighted by the King, and was definitely present at court during the King's visit to the Abbey of Saint-Evroul in 1113. Stephen probably first visited England in either 1113 or 1115, almost certainly as part of Henry's court.|$|E
