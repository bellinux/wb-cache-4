6000|$|She {{had listened}} eagerly, as I say; {{and it was}} her nature to {{understand}} quickly. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> appreciate what <b>you</b> say. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> do, you take a great responsibility." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's {{the last}} thing I remember, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would. You seemed such miles and miles away. It was like looking at {{something}} in a mist through {{the wrong end of}} a telescope. Oh, Kirk!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll see if they'd like to play." [...] He sauntered to {{the other}} end of the room, abashed before the mystic woman, and ventured: [...] "I saw Ray, to-day....

6000|$|Nasmyth smiled. [...] "That," [...] he remarked, [...] "is in {{one sense}} a pity, as I couldn't repeat it to-day. If we are to do {{business}} together, I should {{have to ask you}} for a considerably larger share of the profit.

[...] "Still, you see, I hadn't a dollar then, and what could I do? Any way, that's done with, and I was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would let me congratulate you. Potter seems to be a general favorite." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thanks, I {{hope you}} will. This long voyage {{will give you}} new experiences, and being an officer, you will have new duties and responsibilities. Are you ready for them? You take {{everything}} so gaily, I've been <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> realized that now you will have not only to obey but to command also, and power is a dangerous thing. Be careful that you don't abuse it or let it make a tyrant of you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're quite right," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "I was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would {{recognize}} him. The fact is, he's a man I once employed over in New York, and, when I came across him over here, {{he was so}} evidently wanting a bit of help that I took him on again. As a matter of fact, I needed somebody to look after my things, and Spike can do {{it as well as}} anybody else." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{took one}} or two prizes myself," [...] said Mrs. Phillips. [...] "But, of course, one forgets things. I was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would mind if I ran up {{occasionally}} {{to ask you a}} question. Of course, as you know, my 'usband 'as 'ad so few advantages"--the lady's mind was concerned with more important matters, and the aspirates, on this occasion, got themselves neglected--"It is wonderful what he 'as done without them.

60|$|It {{had been}} hers {{for a week}} or more. Tommy had bought it in a certain Scottish town whose {{merchant}} princes are so many, and have risen splendidly from such small beginnings, that after you have been there a short time you beg to be introduced to someone who has not got on. When you look at them they slap their trouser pockets. When they look at you they are <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> know how much they are worth. Tommy, one day, roaming their streets (in which he was worth incredibly little), and thinking sadly of what could never be, saw the modest little garnet ring in a jeweller's window, and attached to it was a pathetic story. No other person could have seen the story, but it was as plain to him {{as though it had been}} beautifully written on the tag of paper which really contained the price. With his hand on the door he paused, overcome by that horror of entering shops without a lady to do the talking, which all men of genius feel (it is the one sure test), hurried away, came back, went to and fro shyly, until he saw that he was yielding once more to the indecision he thought he had so completely mastered, whereupon he entered bravely (though it was one of those detestable doors that ring a bell as they open), and sternly ordered the jeweller, who could have bought and sold our Tommy with one slap on the trouser leg, to hand the ring over to him.|$|E

Though {{the fellows}} usually call me 'Eddie'--Julius Edward Schwirtz is my full name--my father was named Julius, and my mother's oldest brother was named Edward--my old {{dad used to}} say it wasn't respectful to him because I always {{preferred}} 'Eddie'--old codger used to get quite het up about it. Julius sounds like you was an old Roman or something, and in the business {{you got to have}} a good easy name. Say, speaking of that, I ain't with Lowry any more; I'm chief salesman for the Ætna Automobile Varnish and Wax Company. I certainly got a swell territory--New York, Philly, Bean-Town, Washi'nun, Balt'more, Cleveland, Columbus, Akron, and so on, and of course most especially Detroit. Sell right direct to the jobbers and the big auto companies. Good bunch of live wires. Some class! I'm rolling in my little old four thousand bucks a year now, where before I didn't hardly make more 'n twenty-six or twenty-eight hundred. Keeps me on the jump alrightee. Fact. I got so tired and run-down-- I hadn't planned to take any vacation at all, but the boss himself says to me, 'Eddie, we can't afford to let you get sick; you're the best man we've got,' he says, 'and you got to take a good vacation now and forget all about business for a couple weeks.' 'Well,' I says, 'I was just <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> was smart enough to get along without me if I was to sneak out and rubber at some scenery and maybe get up a flirtation with a pretty summer girl'--and I guess that must be you, Miss Golden!--and he laughs and says, 'Oh yes, I guess the business wouldn't go bust for a few days,' and so I goes down and gets a shave and a hair-cut and a singe and a shampoo--there ain't as much to cut as there used to be, though--ha, ha!--and here I am." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't want to think--I don't care," [...] she replied. [...] "I {{only know}} that I love <b>you.</b> I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{will ever know}} how much!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{struck me}} some time ago," [...] he rejoined. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can guess why I thought it worth while {{to put up}} with them?" ...|$|R
