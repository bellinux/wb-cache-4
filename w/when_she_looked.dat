For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from her music videos. The stage had four video screens, multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle. Patrick Leonard, who was the music director, encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of remixing and presenting her older songs for the show. The title Who's That Girl came to Madonna's mind when during rehearsals one-day <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at a gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage.|$|E

She decided to stay when her father told her the grand prize was US$1 million.

She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as [...] "a typical New York butch" [...] and [...] "a dyke–stone butch", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a baton for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight. Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown (Stormé DeLarverie has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary), sparked the crowd to fight <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at bystanders and shouted, [...] "Why don't you guys do something?"

500|$|In October 2017, former New York Times {{reporter}} Sharon Waxman {{wrote on}} TheWrap that, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> into {{the allegations of}} sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein in 2004, Russell Crowe and Damon made direct phone calls to her to vouch for the head of Miramax Italy, Fabrizio Lombardo, whom she suspected of having [...] "no film experience" [...] and whose [...] "real job was {{to take care of}} Weinstein’s women needs" [...] in Europe. Damon responded in an interview with Deadline, [...] "For the record, I would never, ever, ever try to kill a story like that... It’s not something I would do, for anybody". He said that he had known Lombardo [...] "in a professional capacity" [...] while working on The Talented Mr. Ripley, so he called the reporter and relayed his experience with Lombardo at Weinstein's request. [...] "That was the extent of it....I’m sure I mentioned to her that I didn’t know anything about the rest of her piece, because I didn’t." [...] Waxman has since endorsed Damon’s statement on Twitter.|$|E
500|$|In the Hebrew Bible, {{there are}} thirty-five verses which mention salt. One of these {{mentions}} Lot's wife, who {{was turned into}} a pillar of salt <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> back at the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19:26) as they were destroyed. When the judge Abimelech destroyed the city of Shechem, he is said to have [...] "sown salt on it," [...] probably as a curse on anyone who would re-inhabit it (Judges 9:45). The Book of Job contains the first mention of salt as a condiment. [...] "Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?" [...] (Job 6:6). In the New Testament, six verses mention salt. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus referred to his followers as the [...] "salt of the earth". The apostle Paul also encouraged Christians to [...] "let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt" [...] (Colossians 4:6). Salt is mandatory in the rite of the Tridentine Mass. Salt is used in the third item (which includes an Exorcism) of the Celtic Consecration (cf. Gallican Rite) that is employed in the consecration of a church. Salt may be added to the water [...] "where it is customary" [...] in the Roman Catholic rite of Holy water.|$|E
500|$|Between 1901 and 1903, Leno {{recorded}} {{more than}} twenty-five songs and monologues on the Gramophone and Typewriter Company label. He also made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, in which he portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle or opening a bottle of champagne. On 26 November 1901, Leno, along with Seymour Hicks and his wife, the actress Ellaline Terriss, was invited to Sandringham House {{to take part in a}} Royal Command Performance to entertain King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, their son George and his wife, Mary, the Prince and Princess of Wales. [...] Leno performed a thirty-five-minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: [...] "How to Buy a House" [...] and [...] "The Huntsman". After the performance, Leno reported, [...] "The King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with me and told me how much they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales was just going to shake hands with me, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at my face, and couldn't do it for some time, because she laughed so much. I wasn't intending to look funny– I was really trying to look dignified and courtly; but I suppose I couldn't help myself." [...] As a memento, the king presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal tie pin, and thereafter, Leno became known as [...] "the King's Jester". Leno was the first music hall performer to give a Royal Command Performance during the king's reign.|$|E

500|$|... "The Only One" [...] was {{originally}} called [...] "Tuna Afternoon" [...] and lyrically delves on Lee's experiences with close-mindedness and {{people around her}} who seemed lost {{in a world in}} which they did not belong. It starts with a piano introduction similar to that of the band's Fallen era and songs by Sarah McLachlan. In the song, Lee [...] "decries human guidance" [...] with the chorus lines, [...] "All our lives / We've been waiting / For someone to call our leader / All your lies / I'm not believing / Heaven shine a light down on me". [...] "Your Star" [...] was motivated by Lee's loneliness during the band's tour in support of Fallen. She was inspired to write the chorus in Lisbon <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at the night sky and could see no stars. Other inspiration came from the works of [...] Pantera. Guitars and piano provide the track's instrumentation; while Lee sings about God according to Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone. [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] was co-written by guitarist John LeCompt; it describes Lee's night-time writing process, which is showcased in the opening line, [...] "I can feel the night beginning / Separate me from the living". It contains [...] "power chords", elements of electronica, and abrasive guitars. [...] "Good Enough" [...] was solely written by Lee, and was placed at the end of the album for symbolizing its themes and those of the singer's life. While featuring a string section, it resembles Tori Amos' and Sarah McLachlan's songs. Inspired by her then-future husband Josh Hartzler, [...] "Good Enough" [...] has a similar composition to [...] "My Immortal" [...] because of their piano sounds.|$|E
500|$|Calling {{the show}} a [...] "theatrical {{multimedia}} spectacular", Madonna wanted a huge stage {{with a central}} platform from which {{a flight of stairs}} descended. The central [...] platform was flanked by two lower platforms, which housed the band and the musicians. A large video screen was suspended above the stairs, which descended during the show. Two projectors were situated {{at the front of the}} stage, which projected images of The Pope and President Ronald Reagan during the show. Patrick Leonard, who had produced True Blue, joined as the musical director for the shows. Instead of following every note on the records, Leonard encouraged the musicians to come up with new ideas for the songs. Hence a number of the old songs were rearranged, including introducing a medley of [...] "Dress You Up", [...] "Material Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin"—which contained a sample from the Four Tops song [...] "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". American choreographer Shabba Doo was signed to choreograph the show. 13-year-old Christopher Finch was signed to play the part of the small boy from the [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] video, since Felix Howard, who played the original part, did not get a working license, and hence could not join the tour. Madonna wanted three backup singers, a team of male dancers and a succession of costume changes. She took inputs from her then husband, actor Sean Penn saying, [...] "I really respect Sean's opinion. He has great taste and is a very brilliant man. When I was putting my tour together, it was always in the back of my mind: 'I wonder what Sean will think of this?' He's extremely opinionated and has really high standards, and that sometimes pushed me into making decisions I wouldn't have otherwise made."
