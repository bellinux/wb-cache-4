5|$|As the Great Lakes assumed {{their present}} levels, the {{waterfall}} was inundated and Mackinac Island took on its current size.

The limestone formations are still part of the island's appeal. However, tourists are attracted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic formations is Arch Rock, a natural limestone arch, 146feet (45m) above the ground. Other popular geologic formations include Devil's Kitchen, Skull Cave, and Sugar Loaf.|$|E
