Since research on Freemasonry became important at some universities the Masons gained some visibility. This article examines first the reasons for excluding women {{and the history of}} their active presence since the origins of Freemasonry. This discussion on the origins is presented before showing current issues and trends. The history of the Freemasons is not more universal than that of Freemasonry. It is closely related to national contexts. Both internal factors and social progress have contributed to <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>empowerment.</b> The history of Freemasonry t is therefore written differently in English-speaking countries than in France.

A multilevel random effects model is applied to study the mother 4 s participation and the schooling status of her children in a joint framework. Using the second National Family Health Survey (NFHS- 2) for India, we find that, controlling for many covariates among which wealth {{is the most powerful}} predictor, children of working mothers have a lower probability of attending school. This, together with the result that only illiterate and poor mothers with unskilled or unemployed partners have a high probability of working, points to the need for decent labour market opportunities for females.

But why do some post-conflict states show improvements in women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>empowerment</b> while others do not? Using a quantitative analysis and a qualitative analysis, this study shows that the interaction between international actors and domestic women 2 ̆ 7 s movements accounts for variation in women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>empowerment</b> in post-conflict states. Using an original dataset of 45 low-income and middle-low-income countries, this study shows states that experience civil war are distinctive in their changes in women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>empowerment</b> compared to countries that have not experienced internal armed conflict.

40|$|A Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) to {{development}} has been adopted by numerous international NGOs, multilateral and bilateral agencies. In theory, the HRBA {{has the potential to}} dislodge inequalities and discrimination that perpetuate poverty. However, the implementation of the HRBA at the local level has been a challenge. This thesis is an examination of how the HRBA is operationalized at the local level by international NGOs and its actual impact on <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>empowerment.</b> In order to achieve this, a case of ActionAid s intervention on women s rights in Malawi s Rumphi district, was studied. Contrary to what an HRBA assumes, the study indicates a top-down approach during the implementation of the project. This shows that the HRBA as applied by AAM did not lead to a radical transformation of power relations among development actors namely: the donor, AAM staff, the RWF and the right-holders. This in turn limited the desired empowerment outcomes among the right-holders. The study established that there are many challenges that affect the implementation of the HRBA. These include low education levels among the right-holders, high poverty levels and lack of financial resources to implement a holistic approach. The study further indicates that the HRBA aided in filling the knowledge gap among women on various developmental issues. However, the study confirmed that such intangible benefits do not address the immediate needs of the right-holders. The study suggests that for effective poverty reduction, development actors must consider blending the HRBA with other approaches in order to address the immediate needs of the right-holders...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} shed light on microcredit policies and practices, and attempts to contribute to the understanding of how microcredit relates to the lives of the borrowers in rural Bangladesh. More specifically, this study delves into whether the group-based micro-loans that are channeled through women facilitate social capital, reconstruct gender relations and provide a way out of poverty at the village level in Bangladesh. The empirical data of this study was collected from 151 married women microcredit borrowers of two project areas of the Grameen Bank (GB) and two project areas of the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) in the Sylhet District, Bangladesh where both the GB and the BRAC have been operating micro-loans {{over a period of several}} years. The ethnographic description relates to the questions of how NGOs use neoliberal policies and credit on the one hand, and also how local people appropriate credit on the other hand. I have endeavoured to contribute to understanding the focuses of microcredit initiatives within the context of Foucault s disciplinary power (1977) and governmentality (1978, 1979, 1988) against the background of neoliberalism. I stress the power relations, implications of enforced institutional discipline of microcredit organizations, and vulnerability of microcredit borrowers. By applying Scott s notions of hidden resistance (1990) and weapons of the weak (1985), I have focused on how microcredit borrowers criticize rules of programmes and procedures out of earshot and out of sight of the officials of the NGOs. Following the entitlement approach detailed by Sen (1981, 1987, 1999) I have also addressed the mechanism whereby poor people take credit year after year and get further mired in debt. Fundamentally, the objective of this study has rotated around some complex questions: To what extent microcredit programmes, a product of neoliberalism and the capitalist world system, intersect and connect with the local women borrowers to facilitate social capital, <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>empowerment</b> and poverty alleviation in rural Bangladesh? Does the group lending tenet really work, or is it only a process of getting access to credit for the borrowers or does it fulfil a governing strategy of microcredit organizations to the borrowers in accordance with the market rationality? Are women microcredit borrowers really rational economic actors who invest credit themselves at the local level? Is credit through women a policy of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>empowerment</b> or a project of covert regulative practice? Are the microcredit borrowers undergoing the win-win situation of increased financial outcomes and enhanced well-being that microcredit programmes have pledged to offer? My work draws attention to what microcredit NGOs aim to change, and the techniques they apply. My study is an analysis of what microcredit initiatives fail to do: mobilize social capital, reconstruct gender relations, and alleviate poverty. The study argues that microcredit can be regard as a form of governmentality that is exercised via a generalised control over people s behaviour and over their beliefs, and by spreading the values of entrepreneurship with the market as the solver of all ills. Whilst the much lauded microcredit organizations (such as GB, BRAC) push neoliberal ideologies onto rural borrowers, they have failed because many borrowers cannot yield sufficient profit and or use credit for the purposes for which it is supposed to be used for. The package of training and consciousness raising lessons that originally went alongside the GB or BRAC microcredit programme is now missing from their rural operations. Therefore, ensuring a win-win situation that microcredit originally promised has been failed. Microcredit organizations reinforce pre-existing kinship and gender structures, and there has been a wide scale mission creep, which has turned micro-lending NGOs into money-lending businesses or installment collecting organizations.

The {{research was}} designed to provide new understandings {{of the ways in which}} women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>empowerment</b> is conceptualized. More specifically, the research looked for alternative ways to measure gender empowerment as opposed to existing global measures, such as the UNDP 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Gender <b>Empowerment</b> Measure (GEM) which dominate discourse vis-à-vis women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>empowerment</b> in developing nations.

However, as a related theme it was explored further; and violence against women in Sri Lankan society does indeed appear to be a major problem. The fact that a majority of the factory women who participated in this research rated violence against women (or lack of it) as a major way in which to measure women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>empowerment</b> (over time) is a reflection of the problem itself (at the societal level) and provides new and constructive ways in which to conceptualize and measure women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>empowerment...</b>|$|R

Women 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> lack of <b>empowerment</b> is believed to be an important factor in the persistent prevalence of undernutrition. In India, women 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>empowerment</b> often varies by community, with tribes sometimes being the most progressive. This paper explores the relationship between women 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>empowerment,</b> domestic violence, maternal nutritional status, and the nutritional status and growth over six months in children aged 6 to 24 months in a rural and tribal community. This longitudinal observational study undertaken in rural Karnataka, India included tribal and rural subjects. Structured interviews with mothers were conducted and anthropometric measurements were obtained for 820 mother-child pairs, the follow-up rate after 6 months was 82 per cent. The data were analyzed by multivariate regression. Some degree of undernutrition was seen in 83. 5 per cent of children and 72. 4 per cent of mothers in the sample, moreover the prevalence of undernutrition increased among children at follow up. Domestic violence was experienced by 34 per cent of mothers in the sample. In multivariate analysis, biological variables explained most of the variance in nutritional status and child growth, followed by health-care seeking and women 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>empowerment</b> variables; socio-economic variables explained the least variance. Women 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>empowerment</b> variables were significantly associated with child nutrition on enrolment and child growth at follow-up.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Increasing urbanisation has increased waste generation. This {{has led to an}} increase in waste being left uncollected in certain areas of low-income countries. With the inability of municipal authorities to provide the required collection services, there has been the emergence of private sector initiatives in waste management. Nonetheless, this does not offer a complete solution as waste still adorns many of these streets. This however, provides sources of livelihood for the urban poor, both men and women. They can be found in virtually all cities in low-income countries occupied in collecting, recovering, sorting, and recycling waste materials. Their activity not only creates a means of livelihood for them but also ensures sustainability in solid waste management. In most low-income countries, women still enjoy fewer rights and access to assets and resources than men. Accordingly in Nigeria, women are highly represented in low paid employment. The emphasis in development on issues of equity and inclusion, and <b>women</b> <b>s</b> autonomy and <b>empowerment</b> shows that women still count among the most vulnerable and excluded social groups. This doctoral study examines the issue of women in solid waste livelihoods in Lagos, Nigeria. The focus of the study is to identify gender and other socially-related constraints to participation by men and women in solid waste livelihoods in five Lagos dumpsites. It also analyses how these constraints affect their income levels. The research draws on a feminist approach using mixed methods of participant observation, questionnaire survey and interviews. The fieldwork commenced with identification of waste workers activities on the five dumpsites through participant observation. This was followed by the questionnaire survey which was piloted, refined and administered face to face to 305 dumpsite workers. Findings from the questionnaire survey revealed gender differences amongst waste scavengers, waste buyers and waste merchants according to the following criteria: age, marital status, other income-earning household members, hours worked daily, years spent working, education level, and number of dependent children. These factors also further reinforce gender differences in income generation. Further enquiry through qualitative interviews highlighted gender differences in tool usage and the types of waste resources handled. Inequality was also evident in terms of social equality, political power and decision making. The results also highlight childcare {{as one of the most}} important challenges that women alone face. Other findings include the impact of current modernisation policies on <b>women</b> <b>s</b> financial security, autonomy, and well-being. The waste livelihood activities observed offer positive economic benefits, and incomes higher than the minimum wage. However, it is important for those engaged in modernisation policy to understand the potential impact of these measures on the livelihood of waste workers, and to ensure their commitment to change will not reinforce inequality...|$|R
