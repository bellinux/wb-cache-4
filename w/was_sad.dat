He was particularly experimental {{with the front}} line, and was willing to use the loan market to bring in fresh talent. On 24 March, it was announced Gannon would leave Peterborough {{at the end of}} the season. Unable to avoid relegation despite a vast upturn in results, he announced that family commitments made him unwilling to stay for longer. Gannon had been satisfied with the board's contract offer, but his family still resided in Stockport. He was replaced by Gary Johnson on 6 April, following Gannon's own recommendation of Johnson. Though Gannon insisted that this was not ultimately his decision, but instead was down to the board. Striker Liam Dickinson <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> to seem him go, and told the media that Gannon would have little trouble finding a new management post.|$|E

25|$|But {{his skills}} and {{reputation}} as a lawyer had meanwhile grown immensely. He took silk in 1898. As a brilliant lawyer of great integrity, who had won the support of both Afrikaner and English, he was the natural choice for appointment to the bench in the former Boer colonies after the War. He was duly appointed Chief Justice of the Transvaal Colony in 1902 by Lord Milner soon after it came under British control. Innes <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> to leave politics, but never regretted his decision, and described his years on the Transvaal bench as the most rewarding of his professional life. After the Union of South Africa was created in 1910, Innes became a judge of the Appellate Division, and in 1914 was appointed Chief Justice of the Union.|$|E
25|$|Antony and Cleopatra {{was never}} {{intended}} to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could not live without the other, it does not take much to be able {{to point out that the}} basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he never believed their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be in the palm of her hands, to always be in control of his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> or fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.|$|E

[...] Đính claimed to know nothing of Có's activities and vowed to have his deputy killed. Nhu opposed this and stated that he wanted keep Có alive to catch the plotters, and tried to use Đính to this end. Nhu ordered Đính and Tung, both of whom took their orders directly from the palace instead of the ARVN command, to plan a fake coup against the government. One objective was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another aim of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime.|$|E

The episode showed how protective he could be over someone, even when that person annoyed him.

This concept was echoed by the Seattle Times Julia Waterhous, who noted that Clark, despite all his flaws, always put others before himself. Welling's fellow actors also had their own insights into the character. Kristin Kreuk saw Clark as a kindred spirit who <b>was</b> <b>sad,</b> lonely, but also endearing; whereas John Schneider classified Clark as a special needs child.|$|E

The Prime Minister, Asquith, was invited by Beauchamp to use the castle during the First World War as a weekend retreat, as it had good communication links with the front line in France. Asquith's wife, Margot, was not initially impressed by Walmer, noting in her diary that while it was [...] "very distinguished" [...] and had [...] "great charm", it was [...] "terribly exposed" [...] with [...] "cold... noisy corridors and small rooms"; she later came to like the castle and noted that she <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> to finally leave it.|$|E

Watros took the news of the death of her character badly and <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> about the decision. The producers felt sorry for her and tried to help her get a new job.

Basil Rathbone, who was playing Tybalt, later recounted that [...] "he was drinking and unreliable on the set... It <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> to see him in such a state." [...] Opinions on his portrayal were divided. Some critics, such as Welford Beaton of the Hollywood Spectator, thought [...] "Barrymore is an acting gem", although Gielgud was uncomplimentary, writing to Peggy Ashcroft that [...] "Barrymore, who is like a monstrous old male impersonator jumping through a hoop, should really have been shot." ...|$|E
