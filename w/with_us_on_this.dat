50|$|When Pennsylvania first legislated {{routes in}} 1911, {{what is now}} PA 873 was {{incorporated}} as part of Legislative Route 163, which ran between Allentown and Mauch Chunk (present-day Jim Thorpe). With {{the creation of the}} U.S. Highway System in 1926, the section of road between Schnecksville and Lehigh Gap was designated as part of US 309, a route that ran from Philadelphia north to Wilkes-Barre. At this time, the entire road was paved. PA 22 was designated concurrent <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 309 <b>on</b> <b>this</b> stretch of road in 1927. A year later, PA 130 replaced the PA 22 designation along US 309. By 1930, the concurrent PA 130 designation was removed along this stretch of US 309, which intersected PA 29 in Schnecksville and PA 45 in Lehigh Gap. US 309 was shifted west to a new alignment between Allentown and Hazleton in the 1950s, and PA 29 was shifted east to follow the road running between Schnecksville and Lehigh Gap. In the 1960s, the PA 29 designation between Allentown and Wilkes-Barre was removed, splitting the route into two segments. As a result, PA 873 was designated onto the former alignment of PA 29 between PA 309 in Schnecksville and PA 248 in Lehigh Gap.|$|R

40|$|This {{development}} paper emphasises {{the importance}} of researcher reflexivity. Previously at BAM we presented an autoethnography of our career transitions interpreting our difficulties in making our voluntary career moves {{in terms of a}} series of stages through which we undertook identity-work to overcome forces of identity regulation and achieve an aspired and stable sense-of-self. While this paper was well received and made a contribution to identity theorising, we have, as all autoethnographers should, engaged in ever deeper reflexivity and also in dialogue with peers. As a result, we are engaging with psychoanalytical theorising, particularly facets of Lacan’s work, to reconceptualise our data and further extend our contribution to identity theorising. The Lacanian lens is enabling us to learn that our identities were more regulated than we recognised and unconscious drives and processes can serve to contain subjectivities. We ask delegates to continue <b>with</b> <b>us</b> as guides <b>on</b> <b>this</b> journey...|$|R

Clumps of stately hollyhocks and scarlet peonies; roses of every hue, purple, blush, gold-color, and white, were {{showering}} down their leaves on the grassy turf; honeysuckles climbed and clambered over arbors; and great, stately tufts of virgin-white lilies exalted their majestic heads in saintly magnificence. The garden was Miss Grace Seymour's delight and pride. Every root in it was fragrant with the invisible blossoms of memory,--memories of the mother who loved and planted and watched them before her, and the grandmother who had cared for them before that. The spirit of these charming old-fashioned gardens is the spirit of family love; and, if ever blessed souls from their better home feel drawn back to any thing on earth, we think it must be to their flower-garden.|$|E

We are no longer, like the western tribes, mere hunters living in shelters of boughs and roaming the forests. Our dress, with our long mantles, our loose vests and trousers, differs as widely from that of these western tribes as it does from the Romans. We live in towns, and if our houses are rude they are solid. We no longer depend solely on the chase, but till the ground and have our herds of cattle. I daresay there were many of our ancestors who set themselves as much against the Gaulish customs as you do against those of the Romans; but we adopted them, and benefited by them, and though I would exult in seeing the last Roman driven from our land, I should like after their departure to see us adopt what is good and orderly and decent in their customs and laws." ...|$|E

40|$|It {{is assumed}} the {{hypothesis}} that the noun ‘metaphor’ is already the result of a metaphoric transfer. Thus every noun which designates something, even when it does so in a ‘literal’ manner, will be the result of such a sense transfer from one place of signification to another place of signification. This does not mean that nouns are only floating. In fact every noun not only has a "connotative" function, whereby it provides <b>us</b> <b>with</b> information <b>on</b> <b>this</b> or that ‘property’ of the designatum, but also a denotative function, whereby it fixes the reference of the designatum. This twofold function is attributed not merely to so-called ‘common’ nouns, but to ‘proper’ nouns too. Both ‘common’ nouns and ‘proper’ nouns not only conserve the traces of that metaphoric transfer, but they also show twofold features: epistemic and contingent (‘connotative function’) as well as identitary and necessary (‘denotative function’) ...|$|R
500|$|In 1930, a {{concrete}} cut-off {{was built in}} Glen Burnie that allowed MD 2 traffic to bypass the community's central intersection to the northeast. In 1934, the Maryland State Roads Commission recommended expanding BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard to at least [...] in width for its entire length, with a width of [...] urged from MD 177 to MD 3 and on MD 2 {{from the center of}} Glen Burnie to Furnace Branch. The first portion of Governor Ritchie Highway was completed as a four-lane divided upgrade to existing MD 2 from the Baltimore city limit in Brooklyn Park to Furnace Branch in 1934 and 1935. Construction on the remainder of Governor Ritchie Highway began in 1936 and was completed south from Furnace Branch to the Severn River in 1938. All old segments of MD 2 were redesignated MD 648 by 1939, with MD 2 designated on the Governor Ritchie Highway. This highway was named for former Maryland Governor Albert C. Ritchie. The Governor Ritchie Highway portion of MD 2 was upgraded to a divided highway in 1950. Throughout the mid 20th-century, a commercial district developed along MD 2 in Glen Burnie, which included several car dealerships and the Harundale Mall. In 1953, the freeway to the north of Annapolis was completed.

50|$|The {{section of}} road south of {{downtown}} Allentown was originally designated {{as part of}} US 309 when the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926. Between 1928 and 1930, PA 312 ran concurrent <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 309 <b>on</b> <b>this</b> stretch of road. PA 145 was first designated in 1928 between intersections with PA 45 (now PA 248) in Weiders Crossing and Bath, heading south to Cementon before turning east to Bath. A portion of PA 329 was designated between Cementon and Allentown along Coplay Road, Mickley Pike, and 7th Street, ending at US 22, US 309, PA 29, and PA 43 at 7th and Hamilton streets. The Seventh Street Pike was built between the 1920s and 1941 as a straight north-south road in Whitehall Township; PA 329 was relocated onto it in the 1930s. In 1941, PA 145 and PA 329 switched alignments, with PA 145 heading south along Seventh Street Pike and 7th Street to US 22/US 309/PA 29 at Tilghman Street in Allentown and PA 329 heading east to Bath. Seventh Street Pike was renamed to MacArthur Road in the early 1950s. In the 1950s, the southern terminus of PA 145 was cut back to the US 22 freeway in Whitehall Township and US 309 and PA 29 were rerouted to bypass Allentown. The MacArthur Road section of PA 145 was widened into a divided highway in 1970. In the 1980s, a proposal was made to extend PA 145 and US 222 through Allentown to provide numbered routes in the city. PA 145 was extended south to its current terminus by 1991.|$|R

We have notified our Provider Enrollment Operations Group (PEOG) of your concerns about not being allowed to file your opt-out affidavit prior to it expiring since they initially provided <b>us</b> <b>with</b> guidance <b>on</b> <b>this</b> matter. PEOGsuggested that we seek additional guidance on the interpretation of 42 CFR§ 40 S. 44 S(a) from the Centers for Medicare (CM), the component of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services responsible for writing this policy. CM advised us that 42 CFR 40 S. 44 S(a) and Pub. 100 - 2, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, Section 40. 34 indicate that in order to renew an opt-out without interruption, the affidavit must be filed within 30 days after the current opt out period expires. CM further interprets this to mean that these sections do not require the opt-out physician to wait until his current opt-out period expires before filing a renewal opt-out affidavit. Therefore, you may file a renewal opt-out affidavit before your current opt-out period expires...|$|R
