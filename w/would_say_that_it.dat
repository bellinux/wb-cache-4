[...] He noted [...] "Only eight denominations have been represented in the office." [...] In light of this Williams put forward Senate Resolution 90 which [...] "resulted in the Senate's decision to appoint a new chaplain annually, rather than let the incumbent serve for life." [...] The appointment would also [...] "rotate among the nation's three major religious groups." [...] When asked by reporters about the question of Constitutionality raised by his citing Madison he replied [...] "If this were tested, I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could go either way. It could be declared unconstitutional. Any taxpayer could question this, but no one ever has." [...] He held that in places where people were isolated by acts of government, such as people in the armed services, hospitals or prisons that chaplains serving them would be Constitutional, [...] "But, I don't know anybody less isolated than members of Congress."
