500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Robbins as [...] "confident", [...] "ambitious", and [...] "cheerful". Shortly {{after her}} {{arrival in the}} show, Robbins became a love-interest for Torres (Ramirez). The {{relationship between the two}} is referred to by fans by the portmanteau [...] "Calzona". Torres' previous girlfriend Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) was written out of Grey's Anatomy in 2008, {{due to a lack of}} chemistry between the characters. Rhimes praised the chemistry between Robbins and Torres in contrast, comparing it to that between the show's primary couple Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Shepherd (Dempsey), and stating: [...] "They have that little thing that makes you want to watch them." [...] Rhimes named the addition of Capshaw to the cast as one of the elements of the season she was most proud of, commenting that she <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have found Callie a love interest that [...] "sparkled" [...] sooner, but was pleased with eventually having found one in Robbins.|$|E
500|$|Despite having {{released}} two {{highly successful}} albums, Mariah Carey and Emotions (1991), the singer {{had yet to}} embark on world tour because of stage-fright and the possible negative effects of singing vocally strenuous songs every night. Many critics were unconvinced with her reasoning, and accused her of manipulating her vocals in the studio. In response, Carey appeared on MTV Unplugged to perform a small selection of her songs live in 1992. For her rendition of [...] "Someday", she altered the arrangement and stripped it back {{to give it a}} rawer sound. This version was produced by Carey and Afanasieff and recorded live at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York City on March 16, 1992. In the liner notes of #1 to Infinity, Carey expressed her dislike toward the original studio version on Mariah Carey and stated that she <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> [...] "delete some of the overproduction," [...] which is why she decided to include the MTV Unplugged version on the compilation instead. In addition to MTV Unplugged, the song was included on the set-list of Carey's Las Vegas residency show, Number 1 to Infinity (2015–17).|$|E

2500|$|On April 1, 2007, Morissette {{released}} a tongue-in-cheek cover of The Black Eyed Peas's selection [...] "My Humps", which she recorded in a slow, mournful voice, accompanied {{only by a}} piano. The accompanying YouTube-hosted video, in which she dances provocatively {{with a group of}} men and hits the ones who attempt to touch her [...] "lady lumps", had received 16,465,653 views on February 15, 2009. Morissette did not take any interviews for a time to explain the song, and it was theorized that she did it as an April Fools' Day joke. Black Eyed Peas vocalist Stacy [...] "Fergie" [...] Ferguson responded by sending Morissette a buttocks-shaped cake with an approving note. On the verge of the release of her latest album, she finally elaborated on how the video came to be, citing that she became very much emotionally loaded while recording her new songs one after the other and one day she <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do a simple song like [...] "My Humps" [...] in a conversation with Guy Sigsworth and the joke just took {{a life of its own}} when they started working on it.|$|E
