40|$|Examination of a {{large number}} of apple trees {{infected}} with Trametes versicolor, indicated that the fungus was a facultative parasite which caused a white rot of the sapwood. Papery bark was a distinctive but non-specific external symptom of the disease. The development of papery bark was influenced by seasonal and nutritional conditions and was not a reliable indicator of susceptibility of trees to T, versicolor. Discoloration of the sapwood always occurred in advance of fungal colonisation and decay. The formation of discolored wood involved the loss of starch and nuclei from ray and xylem parenchyma and the eventual necrosis of these cells. Necrotic cells were filled with a brown amorphous material which appeared to be oxidised phenolics. In young wood, ray and xylem parenchyma formed polysaccharide <b>wound</b> <b>gum</b> which was deposited in the vessels of the sapwood-discolored wood transition zone. The levels of K, Ca, Mg, moisture, pH, neutral solvent extractable materials and phenolics in discolored wood, differed from those in the adjacent sapwood. Bacteria were present in discolored wood in advance of the fungus. Discoloration was a non-specific response of the sapwood to mechanical or pethological stimuli. In vitro decay tests indicated that discolored wood was more resistant to decay than normal sapwood. Discoloration of the wood and gum formation therefore appeared to be an active host resistance mechanism to fungal penetration and decay. The host reaction to wounding was related to the physiological cycle of the tree and with age cells lost the ability to synthesise <b>wound</b> <b>gum</b> and reduced amounts of extraneous material were formed in the ray and xylem parenchyma. Evidence indicated that the resistance of young apple sapwood to colonisation and decay by T. versicolor was due to its vital nature and ability to elaborate an effective fungal inhibitory barrier. The susceptibility of living wood to fungal decay increased with age, due to a natural decline in host resistance...|$|E

The wound healing effect of the snail mucin was evaluated with special attention to the effect when combined with honey in Brachystegia eurychoma gel preparation. Brachystegia eurycoma gum, snail mucin and honey were combined in different concentrations in the treatment of wound made by excision model in rats. It was observed that mucin when combined with honey and in the Brachystegia eurycoma gel heals faster than when used alone. Brachystegia eurycoma gum was also observed to effect fast healing of the wounds when used alone. Complete healing was observed in 15 days post treatment. Honey in combination with mucin as well as the Brachystegia eurycoma gel should be harnessed in pharmaceutical formulations for the treatment of <b>wounds.</b> Brachystegia eurycoma <b>gum</b> in right combinations with mucin and honey for wound healing, prevents bacteria infection, scar formation and promotes regeneration of hair follicles...|$|R
60|$|An old Indian {{who lives}} and hunts on Vancouver Island told me {{recently}} {{that he has}} several times caught beaver that had previously cut their legs off to escape from traps, and that {{two of them had}} covered the <b>wounds</b> thickly with <b>gum,</b> as the muskrat had done. Last spring the same Indian caught a bear in a deadfall. On the animal's side was a long rip from some other bear's claw, and the wound had been smeared thickly with soft spruce resin. This last experience corresponds closely with one of my own. I shot a big bear, years ago, in northern New Brunswick, that had received a gunshot wound, which had raked him badly and then penetrated the leg. He had plugged the wound carefully with clay, evidently to stop the bleeding, and then had covered the broken skin with sticky mud from the river's brink, to keep the flies away from the wound and give it a chance to heal undisturbed. It is noteworthy here that the bear uses either gum or clay indifferently, while the beaver and muskrat seem to know enough to avoid the clay, which would be quickly washed off in the water.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe fibers {{with smaller}} pores and higher surface area than regular fibers have {{enormous}} applications in tissue scaffolds, protective clothing, and <b>wound</b> healing. Iranian <b>Gum</b> Tragacanth (IGT) {{is the most}} common natural polymers which has found with lots of applications recently, and has attractive characteristic like nontoxic nature, biodegradability, higher resistance, antibacterial and good biological properties to bacterial attacks. In the current work, poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) /IGT biocomposite fiber is prepared using electrospinning (ELS) method in aqueous solutions with PVA blended system in a volume ratios of 60 / 40, 70 / 30, 80 / 20, and 90 / 10 composite with different amount of nano-clay (NC) powder (1 % and 3 %) to enhance the chemical and mechanical stability. The blended nanofibers are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) techniques. The FTIR analysis indicated that PVA and IGT may be having H+ bonding interactions. The current study reveals that with a higher percentage of IGT in the blend nanofibers, superior degradation, higher chemical and mechanical stability could be obtained. Moreover, the blend nanofibers with 80 / 20 with 3 % NC exhibit improvement in unique properties compared to pure PVA/IGT...|$|R

This plant finds applications for the treatment of diarrhea, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hypertension, diabetes, caries and pain relief and for improvement in locomotors coordination. Its leaf’s extract is being used as a medicine in cough, diarrhea, and oral ulcers and in some swollen <b>gums</b> <b>wound.</b> Its fruit is rich in vitamins A, C, iron, phosphorus and calcium and minerals. It contains high content of organic and inorganic compounds like secondary metabolites e.g. antioxidants, polyphenols, antiviral compounds, anti-inflammatory compounds. The phenolic compounds in guava help to cure cancerous cells and prevent skin aging before time. The presence of terpenes, caryophyllene oxide and p-selinene produces relaxation effects. Guava leaves contain many compounds which act as fungistatic and bacteriostatic agents. Guava has a high content of important antioxidants and has radio-protective ability. Quercetin is considered as most active antioxidant in the guava leaves and is responsible for its spasmolytic activity. Its ethyl acetate extract can stop the germ infection and thymus production. Guava possesses anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-plaque and anti-mutagenic activities. Guava extract shows antinociceptive activity and is also effective in liver damage inflammation and serum production. Ethanolic extract of guava can increase the sperm quality as well as quantity and can be used for the treatment of infertile males.|$|R

5000|$|Cassie's {{fighting}} {{style is}} similar to that of her parents, being able to fight with her hands in close combat, as well as with her pistols from long range like Stryker. In addition, Cassie is noted for adopting her father's attitude, and her mother's combat styles. She is playable in the game's twelfth and final chapter, in which she fights Sindel, Kitana, and D'Vorah, before battling and defeating Corrupted Shinnok. Like the game's other selectable characters, Cassie's special moves and attacks are split into three gameplay variations, hers being [...] "Hollywood", [...] "Spec Ops", and [...] "Brawler". The [...] "Hollywood" [...] variation has Cassie taking after Johnny Cage, wearing sunglasses during battle and adopting his groin-punch move, in addition to using her handguns both on the ground and in midair. [...] "Spec Ops" [...] features a military-style offensive similar to that of Sonya, featuring attacks such as air strikes with missiles and lasers, which she calls in through an earpiece. For [...] "Brawler", Cassie performs takedowns and tackles, as well as midair tosses. Her [...] "Testi-Kill" [...] X-ray move has her assaulting her opponent's groin area, which, when performed on male characters, ruptures their testicles entirely. Cassie's [...] "Bubble Head" [...] Fatality has her shooting her opponents in both legs to incapacitate them, then once in the forehead; she then removes her gum from her mouth and sticks it onto the <b>wound,</b> causing the <b>gum</b> to expand as it fills with the victim's blood before they fall dead. For [...] "Selfie", she knocks off her opponent's lower jaw with her nightstick, then proceeds to take a selfie image with their corpse, which she then uploads to a fictitious social media site.|$|R
