500|$|The American film {{reviewer}} Leonard Maltin {{has suggested}} that {{if it had been}} Connery in the leading role instead of Lazenby, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have epitomised the series. On the other hand, Danny Peary wrote, [...] "I'm not sure I agree with those who insist that if Connery had played Bond it would definitely be the best of the entire Bond series... Connery's Bond, with his boundless humor and sense of fun and self-confidence, would be out of place in this picture. It actually works better with Lazenby because he is incapable of playing Bond as a bigger-than-life hero; for one thing he hasn't the looks... Lazenby's Bond also hasn't the assurance of Connery's Bond and that is appropriate in the crumbling, depressing world he finds himself. He seems vulnerable and jittery at times. At the skating rink, he is actually scared. <b>We</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> him... On Her Majesty's Secret Service doesn't have Connery and it's impossible to ever fully adjust to Lazenby, but I think that it still might be the best Bond film, as many Bond cultists claim." [...] Peary also described On Her Majesty's Secret Service as [...] "the most serious", [...] "the most cynical" [...] and [...] "the most tragic" [...] of the Bond films.|$|E

60|$|In {{one of his}} least convincing phrases, Nietzsche {{had said}} that just as the ape {{ultimately}} produced the man, so should we ultimately produce something higher than the man. The immediate answer, of course, is sufficiently obvious: the ape did not worry about the man, so why should <b>we</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> the Superman? If the Superman will come by natural selection, may we leave it to natural selection? If the Superman will come by human selection, what sort of Superman are we to select? If he is simply to be more just, more brave, or more merciful, then Zarathustra sinks into a Sunday-school teacher; {{the only way we}} can work for it is to be more just, more brave, and more merciful; sensible advice, but hardly startling. If he is to be anything else than this, why should we desire him, or what else are we to desire? These questions have been many times asked of the Nietzscheites, and none of the Nietzscheites have even attempted to answer them.|$|E

The greatest joy I get as a filmmaker is to slip into an audience for one of our movies anonymously, and watch people watch our film. Because people are 100 percent honest when they're watching a movie. And to see the joy on people's faces, to see people really get into our films...to me is the greatest reward I could possibly get. —John Lasseter, reflecting on the impact of the film ...|$|E

The Anxiety of Meaninglessness and Emptiness attacks {{our being}} as a whole. <b>We</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> {{the loss of}} an {{ultimate}} concern or goal. This anxiety is also brought on by a loss of spirituality. We as beings feel the threat of non-being when we feel we have no place or purpose in the world. “It Nonbeing threatens man’s spiritual self-affirmation, relatively in terms of emptiness, absolutely in terms of meaninglessness” (41).b. We display the courage to be when facing this anxiety by displaying true faith, and by again, self-affirming oneself. We draw from the “power of being” which is God for Tillich and use that faith to in turn affirm ourselves and negate the non-being. We can find our meaning and purpose through the “power of being” (172-73).|$|E

Our worries aren’t unique.

5000|$|The group {{started writing}} {{sessions}} in Elora Sound Studio, Ontario on September 27, 1986. Lifeson showed his experimental tapes, while Lee brought his Soundcheck Jams {{he had done}} that year. According to Peart, Lifeson's tapes [...] "would yield some good parts for several songs", and Lee's Soundcheck jams were [...] "sorted and labeled as potential verses, bridges, choruses or instrumental bits, and thus they served as a reference library of spontaneous ideas that could be drawn upon at will". Lifeson used a drum machine to write the drum parts, which Lee tracked on a Lerxst Sound recorder. By early November, eight songs had been written, which the group felt wasn't enough for the album {{to have a good}} amount of musical variety. Peart said, [...] "We decided we'd go a bit further this time. We were {{aware of the fact that}} only a small percentage of people actually buy records any more, the vast majority choosing cassettes or CDs. Thus, we figured, why should <b>we</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> the time limitations of the old vinyl disc? We thought we'd like to have ten songs, and go for fifty minutes or so of music. So we did." [...] Producer Peter Collins came in to Elora Sound in early December to give the band suggestions of improving the songs. Among many small changes, a couple of major suggestions were new verses to [...] "Mission" [...] and chorus revisions to [...] "Open Secrets". With nine songs already written, Collins also suggested the band make a tenth track for the album, and the song [...] "Force Ten" [...] would be written on the last day of pre-production, December 14.|$|E
5000|$|In 775, the {{soldiers}} {{stationed at the}} important base Heyang (河陽, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan) mutinied and expelled their commander Chang Xiuming (常休明). Emperor Daizong made Ma the commander of Heyang to replace Chang. [...] In 776, {{following the death of}} Tian Shenyu (田神玉) the acting military governor of Biansong Circuit (汴宋, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), Tian's subordinate Li Lingyao seized the control of the circuit. Initially, Emperor Daizong tried to appease Li Lingyao by making him the acting military governor, but after Li Lingyao continued to be defiant of imperial authorities, Emperor Daizong commissioned Ma, Li Zhongchen, Li Mian, assisted by Chen Shaoyou (陳少遊) and Li Zhengji, to attack Biansong. In fall 775, Ma and Li Zhongchen rendezvoused at Zheng Prefecture. Li Lingyao launched a surprise attack against their forces and causing them to withdraw; a large portion of Li Zhongchen's army, from Huaixi Circuit (淮西, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), deserted, while the people of Zheng Prefecture panicked and fled to the eastern capital Luoyang. Li Zhongchen wanted to retreat, but Ma opposed, stating, [...] "We are regular troops attacking rebels. Why do <b>we</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> defeat? Why do we give us this chance for battlefield accomplishments?" [...] He dug in, and in response, Li Zhongchen gathered his soldiers and also dug in. They then moved toward Bian Prefecture, with Ma marching north of the Bian River (a canal connecting the Yellow River and the Huai River, flowing through Bian Prefecture) and Li Zhongchen marching south of the Bian River. They were joined by Chen's forces, and together they battled Li Lingyao's forces to the west of Bian Prefecture's capital, defeating Li Lingyao. Li Lingyao withdrew within the capital, and Ma and Li Zhongchen put it under siege. After they further defeated relief forces commanded by Tian Yue (the nephew of Tian Chengsi, who was allied with Li Lingyao), Li Lingyao fled but was eventually captured by Li Mian's forces and delivered to Chang'an to be executed. Ma, knowing that Li Zhongchen was fierce and cruel, decided not to contend with Li Zhongchen as to the credits for the victory and therefore refused to enter Bian Prefecture's capital. Li Zhongchen entered Bian Prefecture and, on his subsequent reports, credited only himself, as Ma predicted, going as far as killing the Biansong general Li Senghui (李僧惠), who had turned against Li Lingyao and who also contributed much to the victory.|$|E
