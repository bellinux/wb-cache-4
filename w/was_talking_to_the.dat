5|$|When Virgil Earp {{learned that}} Wyatt <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop, {{he went there}} himself. Virgil testified {{afterward}} {{that he thought he}} saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.|$|E

To avoid {{alarming}} Tombstone's public, Virgil returned to Hafford's Saloon carrying the shotgun under his long overcoat. He gave the shotgun to Doc Holliday who hid it under his overcoat. He took Holliday's walking-stick in return. From Spangenberg's, the Cowboys moved to the O.K. Corral where witnesses overheard them threatening to kill the Earps. They then walked a block north to an empty lot next to C. S. Fly's boarding house where Doc Holliday lived.|$|E

25|$|Barrett <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second engineer, Mr. Hesketh, {{when the}} red light and bells came on {{signalling}} the order to stop the engines. He shouted to {{the men in the}} boiler room to shut the dampers, the doors to the furnaces and to shut off the wind for the fires. Then he felt a crash and water came pouring in on him from a large tear in the ship's starboard side. Barrett made his way through the water tight door into boiler room 5. He was ordered to go back into boiler room 6, but there was 8 feet of water there. As some of the engineers attended the pumps, the engine room rang for all the stokers to go up on deck. Barrett was ordered to stay behind by an engineer, Mr. Harvey, in boiler room 5 to get some lamps, draw fires, and lift the manhole plate until water started to rush in.|$|E

500|$|Gielgud was {{uninterested in}} {{religion}} or politics. As a boy {{he had been}} fascinated by the rituals at Westminster Abbey, but his brief attraction to religion quickly faded, and as an adult he was a non-believer. His indifference to politics was illustrated at a formal dinner {{not long after the}} Second World War when he asked a fellow guest, [...] "Whereabouts are you living now?", unaware that, as he <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prime minister, Clement Attlee, the answer was [...] "10 Downing Street". In his Who's Who entry Gielgud listed his hobbies as music and painting, but his concentration on his work, which Emlyn Williams called fanatical, left little scope for leisure activities. His dedication to his art was not solemn. The critic Nicholas de Jongh wrote that Gielgud's personality was [...] "such infinite, mischievous fun", and Coward's biographer Cole Lesley recalled the pleasure of Gielgud's company, [...] "the words tumbling out of his mouth in an avalanche, frequently having to wipe away his own tears of laughter at the funniness of the disasters he recounted, disasters always against himself." ...|$|E

500|$|The Doctor takes Clara to {{the next}} morning in the TARDIS, and {{they go to a}} cafe to try to {{understand}} the happenings. [...] Clara uses computer skills that she picked up from her uploading experience to track the uploaders to their base at the Shard. [...] The Doctor encounters people inside the café under the control of Miss Kizlet who distract him long enough for a server disguised as the Doctor to upload Clara completely. An angered Doctor sets out to the Shard on an anti-gravity motorbike and crashes it into Miss Kizlet's office. He demands that she release all the minds that have been uploaded, but Miss Kizlet refuses. The Doctor then reveals that he is still at the café and she <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> server he had hacked which he then uses to upload Miss Kizlet to the network. Trapped in the network, she orders her subordinates to release her (with the Doctor ensuring that they do so using a pad that controls her employees). By doing this, everyone else including Clara, is restored.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} of the script portrayed Leslie and Mark as {{slightly}} less likable characters. Originally, Mark asked Ron to green-light the park project not to help Leslie, but because he was attracted to Ann and wanted another excuse to keep seeing her. These elements of the script were changed after press tours and focus group screenings. The show's writers spent time researching local California politics and attended Los Angeles City Council meetings. Daniels and Schur wanted the pilot to establish that one of Leslie's duties <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public on a regular basis, and they deliberately portrayed her public forum meetings as poorly attended except by {{a select group of}} angry residents. Schur said, [...] "I've been to some community meetings in my life, and it is often this feeling of utter sparseness. That nobody cares." [...] In writing the script, Schur wanted Mark and Leslie to have a long history together before the events of the episode, rather than having the two characters meet {{for the first time on}} screen, which he felt had already been done in many television shows. The first shot of the pilot was originally a scene with Ann standing over the pit and staring at it with an annoyed expression, followed by a documentary interview with Ann and Andy. The opening scene was changed because Daniels and Schur decided they wanted the first scene of the series to be set in a park. As a result, the episode started with a cold open of Leslie interviewing children in a park, then using a broom to push a drunk man out of spiral slide. Daniels had such a specific vision for the scene, he drew an elaborate and detailed storyboard sketch of a drunk man stuck in a tubular slide.|$|E

2500|$|Lionsgate's {{president}} of theatrical marketing Tim Palen {{thought of the}} idea to make 1,000 posters {{with a small amount}} of Bell's blood, which was mixed with the printing ink.

I asked if it would be possible to use actual blood. There was silence. He said, 'We could try, but are you serious?' I said I was dead serious." [...] The posters were sold for $20, with the first being auctioned off; all the proceeds from the auctioned poster were donated to the Red Cross. [...] Lionsgate also held the third annual [...] "Give Til It Hurts" [...] blood drive for the Red Cross and collected 23,493 pints of blood.|$|E

[...] In August 1859, he succeeded in moving the Indians without loss of life to a new reservation in Indian Territory. [...] Forced to return to Texas on business, he stopped at the village near Fort Belknap. [...] On September 14, 1859, while he was speaking with one settler, a man named Edward Cornett shot him in the back while he <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first man, and killed him. [...] Historians believe his assassination was a direct result of his actions protecting the Comanche. [...] Neighbors probably did not even know his assassin. He was buried in the civilian cemetery at Fort Belknap.|$|E
2500|$|Recalled to {{the army}} with {{the start of the}} Second World War, Wilkinson was a {{temporary}} lieutenant colonel commanding the 14th Battalion, Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) when a number of his men strayed into a minefield. Several were killed, and one injured man could be seen {{in the middle of the}} mined area, still moving. Royal Engineers had been sent for to clear the mines, and a doctor who happened to be present gave the opinion that the wounded man was unlikely to survive. Whilst the doctor <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other officer present, Wilkinson entered the minefield, and managed to bring out the wounded man single-handed. For these actions, Wilkinson was awarded the George Medal (GM) on 8 July 1941, as was the Royal Engineer officer, Major Arthur Henry Musgrave Norris who subsequently cleared the remainder of the minefield, and Regimental Sergeant Major Ernest Joseph Legg (West Surreys) and Lance-Sergeant Harry Fred Hardy (RE) who assisted., The National Archives (fee required to view full original recommendation).

2500|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 1943, realizing the war was lost, Papen began {{attending}} secret meetings with the agents of the OSS in Istanbul. The meetings were held in Istanbul as Papen was afraid to meet in Ankara because the SD officer Ludwig Carl Moyzisch had orders from Heinrich Himmler to monitor Papen, which the ambassador knew about. The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer described Papen as [...] "… a loner, an outsider, a man of tremendous personal ambition and great vanity". Papen exaggerated his power in Germany to the OSS, and asked for American support to make him dictator of a post-Hitler Germany, as Papen wanted a right-wing regime that would avoid the [...] "excesses" [...] of the Nazis. Moyzisch had been monitoring Papen, and was aware of Papen meeting the OSS, but Himmler was seeking a separate peace with the Western Allies to allow Germany to focus on defeating the Soviet Union, and ordered Moyzisch to allow the meetings to go ahead. On 5 October 1943, Papen met with the American OSS agent and journalist Theodore Morde of Reader's Digest, to tell him that he wanted American support to overthrow Hitler and make himself the new dictator of Germany, saying the terms of peace would be that Germany would remain the dominant power in Europe and suggested under his leadership that Germany and the United States would become allies against the Soviet Union. President Franklin Roosevelt rejected this offer when he heard of it, saying he was very doubtful that Papen had the sort of power that he claimed to have to overthrow Hitler, and told the OSS to stop talking to Papen. At the same time, Papen hedged his bets, telling Hitler that he had information from his American contacts to the effect that if the Republicans won the 1944 election, then the United States would make peace with Germany in order to focus on defeating Japan, thereby allowing Germany to defeat Britain and the Soviet Union, and therefore German foreign policy should aim at ensuring President Roosevelt lost the 1944 election. Papen claimed to Hitler that he <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> OSS with the intention of making contact with the Republicans to ensure Roosevelt's defeat in the 1944 election.|$|E
