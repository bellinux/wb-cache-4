5|$|During World War II, {{rationing}} {{was imposed}} almost immediately. Restrictions <b>were</b> <b>immediately</b> more stringent {{than in the}} Great War as with effect from 8 January 1940 ration books were issued and most foods were subject to ration.

Eighty-two mutineers <b>were</b> <b>immediately</b> executed on Bagumbayan Field, while the rest were imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|The RPF advance caused {{panic in}} France, which had long {{supported}} the Habyarimana regime. Several hundred French troops <b>were</b> <b>immediately</b> dispatched to Rwanda, along with arms and ammunition, {{to bolster the}} FAR forces. The arrival of these French troops in Kigali significantly changed the military situation on the ground. The RPF now found themselves under attack, with French shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards.|$|E
5|$|The Skye Bridge {{opened in}} 1995 under a private finance {{initiative}} {{and the high}} tolls charged (£5.70 each way for summer visitors) met with widespread opposition, spearheaded by the pressure group SKAT (Skye and Kyle Against Tolls).

However, some Volkssturm members, without basic military knowledge and training, escaped into the woods, hoping to simply survive. Refugee trains leaving East Prussia were also extremely crowded, and due to the very low temperatures, children often froze to death during the journey. The last refugee train left Königsberg on January 22, 1945.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the WHA's Calgary Cowboys, who folded {{three years}} earlier, the Flames <b>were</b> <b>immediately</b> {{embraced by the}} city of Calgary.

5|$|After {{construction}} of the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge was completed in late 1902, tolls <b>were</b> <b>immediately</b> charged along the one lane structure. However, unlike the other two bridges, the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge cost $0.22 (1902 USD). A person traveling on foot {{did not have to}} pay to cross the structure. This decision was different compared to the other bridges, which made it separate. Another decision was that ministers were not tolled so they could better serve their communities. However, when one minister began to abuse the special privilege, he was charged $0.05 for crossing. The tollhouse for collection was in Milanville and was run by the Dexter family.|$|E

5|$|Although most justices <b>were</b> <b>immediately</b> convinced, Warren {{spent some}} time after this famous speech convincing {{everyone}} to sign onto the opinion. Justices Jackson and Reed finally decided to drop their dissent. The final decision was unanimous. Warren drafted the basic opinion and kept circulating and revising it until he had an opinion endorsed by {{all the members of}} the Court. Reed was the last holdout and reportedly cried during the reading of the opinion.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{successful}} surprise attack, the Polish army in Vilnius managed to appropriate sizable stocks of supplies and take hundreds of prisoners. When Piłsudski entered the city, a victory parade was held in his honour. The city's Polish citizens on the whole were delighted; their politicians envisaged a separate Lithuanian state closely allied with Poland. Representatives from the city <b>were</b> <b>immediately</b> sent to the Paris Peace Conference, and the Stefan Batory University in Vilnius, which had been closed in 1832 following the November 1830 Uprising, was reopened.|$|E
5|$|Chinese media {{coverage}} of the Ürümqi riots was extensive, and was compared favourably to that of the unrest in Tibet in 2008. When the riots began, communications <b>were</b> <b>immediately</b> cut off. In the weeks that followed, official sources reported that over 1,000 Uyghurs were arrested and detained; Uyghur-run mosques were temporarily closed. The communication limitations and armed police presence remained in place as of January 2010. By November2009, over 400 individuals faced criminal charges for their actions during the riots. Nine were executed in November 2009, and by February 2010, at least 26 had received death sentences.|$|E

Four hundred of these <b>were</b> <b>immediately</b> paid out to the Bank of Pennsylvania, which had deposited gold at the Mint for striking into eagles. One piece was put aside for the Mint's coin collection by Eckfeldt.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} vandalism and violence, only twenty arrests {{were made on}} the day. The strikers intimidated the police, {{and only a few}} were willing to arrest vandals. Chief Hyland and many officers were sympathetic to the strike, but the local judicial magistrates were not. According to one union report, union members who were arrested faced fines up to $50, while the arrested strikebreakers <b>were</b> <b>immediately</b> acquitted by a local judge.|$|E
