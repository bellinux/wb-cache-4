25|$|The {{neatness}} of his attire {{was almost}} incredible; I believe {{a speck of}} dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> to see, now limped badly, {{had been in his}} time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police.|$|E
25|$|His {{leadership}} of the group had been strong and colorful. He had been rough on {{those who did not}} produce but fine to those who had. He had given a lot of character to the group, and although he had been rough at times, had been fair always. The group <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> to see him go.|$|E

25|$|Although {{reaction}} to the game's announcement satisfied the studio, they realized that its fast pace would make extensive use of the GamePad while muting the TV display's utility; players must focus on one screen while ignoring the other. The tiny monsters were problematic, since shooting them was unsatisfying. The issues were singled out by Ubisoft management at a Ubisoft Paris meeting, and the team decided to slow the game's pace. The enemies were changed from small monsters to zombies, since their movement is slower and they are easily identified as monsters. According to Jean-Karl Tupin-Bron, the team <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> to realize that Killer Freaks would not work but delighted {{by the results of}} the transition. By September 2011, most of the Killer Freaks team had joined the zombie-game team. During the transition, the game's tone became more serious. The team tried to distinguish itself from other zombie games in the video-game market, making the GamePad its central feature. They were inspired by the 2007 film, I Am Legend, in which the protagonist is the only survivor left in a city and must be constantly on guard against zombies. ZombiU, the game's working title, became its official name since it was a zombie game for Wii U.|$|E

Well, but I'll answer you. I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. That's why." ...|$|R

500|$|During {{the decade}} Adeline became {{increasingly}} immobilised by arthritis, and the numerous stairs in their London house finally caused the Vaughan Williamses {{to move in}} 1929 to a more manageable home, [...] "The White Gates", Dorking, where they lived until Adeline's death in 1951. Vaughan Williams, who {{thought of himself as}} a complete Londoner, <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> to leave the capital, but his wife was anxious to live in the country, and Dorking was within reasonably convenient reach of town.|$|E
500|$|Hunter and Winchester-ally Bobby Singer {{makes his}} debut, and {{is played by}} Jim Beaver.

500|$|Another general {{attitude}} and prejudice of Fleming's that Bond gives voice to includes {{his approach to}} homosexuality. While Fleming {{had a number of}} gay friends, including Noël Coward and his editor, William Plomer, he said that his books were [...] "written for warm-blooded heterosexuals". His attitude went further, with Bond opining that homosexuals were [...] "a herd of unhappy sexual misfits – barren and full of frustrations, the women wanting to dominate and the men to be nannied", adding that [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> for them, but he had no time for them." ...|$|E
500|$|Verdi {{accepted}} {{the need to}} trim Shakespeare's plot to keep the opera within an acceptable length. He <b>was</b> <b>sorry,</b> nonetheless, to see the loss of Falstaff's second humiliation, dressed up as the Wise Woman of Brentford to escape from Ford. He wrote of his desire {{to do justice to}} Shakespeare: [...] "To sketch the characters in a few strokes, to weave the plot, to extract all the juice from that enormous Shakespearian orange". Shortly after the premiere an English critic, R A Streatfeild, remarked on how Verdi succeeded: ...|$|E
500|$|West said He {{looked over}} the Shakespeare prints and <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> to see them of such {{inferior}} quality. [...] He said that excepting that from His Lear by Sharpe, that from Northcote's children in the Tower, and some small ones, there were few that could be approved. [...] Such a mixture of dotting and engraving, and such a general deficiency in respect of drawing which He observed the Engravers seemed to know little of, that the volumes presented a mass of works which He did not wonder many subscribers had declined to continue their subscription.|$|E

I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> that there <b>were</b> times I didn’t stand up to people publicly “on my side” who called you names like sodomite—or worse. I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> that I, knowing some of you so well, failed to share publicly that the gay and lesbian people I know were every bit as capable of being amazing parents as the straight people that I know. I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> that when I celebrated a person coming to Christ and surrendering their sexuality to Him that I callously celebrated the end of relationships that broke your heart.

Treadway called him [...] "the {{straight}} man for his neighbor's antics". Film critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, in his review of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, that Squidward is one of his favorite secondary characters on the show, along with Sandy Cheeks and Mrs. Puff.

500|$|In August 2009, a {{confidential}} memo {{written by the}} consul general of Israel in Boston, Nadav Tamir, was leaked to the Israeli media. In the memo, Tamir said that Israel's dealings with the Obama administration on differences over settlements were eroding US support. After Tamir was reprimanded by the Israeli government, Frank defended Tamir in a letter sent to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which Frank wrote: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> to learn that he (Tamir) is being criticized because of his accurate reporting of significant (negative) sentiment in the United States... If {{the people who work}} for me did not give me the kind of straightforward, thoughtful analysis that the consul is providing, even if it wasn't the most welcome news, that failure - not the information - would cause me unhappiness." ...|$|E

Series producer Kieran Roberts added that he <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> to see Taylor go, but understood her decision to move on. Taylor later explained that she chose to leave because she and the writers struggled to come up with storylines for Toyah. She told the Liverpool Echo's Janet Tansley [...] "I was asked where she would go from there and couldn't think what she could do. If I couldn't see a future for her, I couldn't play her."
