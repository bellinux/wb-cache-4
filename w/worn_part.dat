In particular, {{the performance of the}} crusher, the action of solids and air in the impeller and the mechanism responsible for the localised abrasion of the impeller <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> were investigated. Computer programs were developed, which modelled the performance of the Breakring for impellers having simple, idealised <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> profiles. Contour plots were produced, which illustrated the dependence of impeller power, absolute particle exit speed and anvil angle for normal impact on the <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> sweep angle and the coefficient of friction between the feed material and the <b>wear</b> <b>part.</b> The significance of the contours was investigated. A computer program was developed, which modelled the action of a single particle in the Breakring impeller for <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> having various complex profiles. The results indicated that the cause of the localised <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> abrasion was the reattachment of feed material to the <b>wear</b> <b>part,</b> following separation at the downstream end of the depression caused by action of material after entry to the impeller. The accuracy of the results was confirmed by the profiles of abraded <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> and various other factors. A full-scale model impeller was constructed. The flow of air in the model and, following failure of the model, the flow of air and solids in a prototype impeller were investigated by a surface flow visualisation technique and high speed cinematography. The results neither verified the wear-mechanism outlined above nor indicated any other wear-mechanism. It was concluded that the wear mechanism indicated by the mathematical modelling was accurate and that there is no indication of abrasion by airborne fines...|$|R

5000|$|One {{advantage}} of phonograph and gramophone discs over cylinders in the 1890s - before electronic amplification was available—was that {{large numbers of}} discs could be stamped quickly and cheaply. In 1890, the only ways of manufacturing copies of a master cylinder were to mold the cylinders (which was slow and, early on, produced very poor copies), to record cylinders by the [...] "round", over and over again, or to acoustically copy the sound by placing the horns of two phonographs together or to hook the two together with a rubber tube (one phonograph recording and the other playing the cylinder back). Edison, Bettini, Leon Douglass and others solved this problem (partly) by mechanically linking a cutting stylus and a playback stylus together and copying the [...] "hill-and-dale" [...] grooves of the cylinder mechanically. When molding improved somewhat, molded cylinders were used as pantograph masters. This was employed by Edison and Columbia in 1898, and was used until about January 1902 (Columbia brown waxes after this were molded). Some companies like the United States Phonograph Co. of Newark, New Jersey, supplied cylinder masters for smaller companies so that they could duplicate them, sometimes pantographically. Pantographs could turn out about 30 records per day and produce up to about 150 records per master. In theory, pantograph masters could be used for 200 or 300 duplicates if the master and the duplicate were running in reverse and the record would be duplicated in reverse. This, in theory, could extend the usability of a pantograph master by using the unworn/lesser <b>worn</b> <b>part</b> of the recording for duplication. Pathé employed this system with mastering their vertically-cut records until 1923; a 5 in, 4 or 6 in master cylinder, rotating at a high speed, would be recorded on. This was done as the resulting cylinder was considerably loud and of very high fidelity. Then, the cylinder would be placed on the mandrel of a duplicating pantograph that would be played with a stylus {{on the end of a}} lever, which would transfer the sound to a wax disc master, which would be electroplated and be used to stamp copies out. This system resulted in some fidelity reduction and rumble, but relatively high quality sound. Edison Diamond Disc Records were made by recording directly onto the wax master disc.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> {{with respect to the}} different heat treatments applied have been investigated. Two different alloys and a total of nine different heat treatment procedures were tested. Alloy 35 M 13 B have been tested with respect to tempering temperature and represents one <b>wear</b> <b>part.</b> The other <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> 30 M 12 CB have been tested with respect to both tempering temperatures and effect of direct hardening. The main goal of this work has been to improve the understanding of how the steel alloys used for the <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> responds to different tempering temperatures and heat treatments. During this work both alloys were tested using the following test methods; charpy impact testing, tensile testing and Vickers hardness testing. From production, <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> 30 M 12 CB as currently produced and when directly hardened was to be investigated for its mechanical properties, thus alloy 30 M 12 CB was heat treated at different temperatures with the aim to find two heat treatments that would match the <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> pulled from production. The two chosen temperatures for 30 M 12 CB were 850 *C representing the current production and 1100 *C representing direct hardening. Then, <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> 30 M 12 CB and 35 M 13 B was heat treated accordingly and tempered. The current tempering temperature of 220 *C was compared with 180 *C and no tempering. Charpy test specimens and tensile test specimens for 35 M 13 B and 30 M 12 CB were then tested with three parallels. The results recorded was then compared with respect to mechanical properties for the different tempering temperatures and heat treatments. For all parts the strength increased slightly by lowering tempering temperature from 220 *C to 180 *C. No tempering did not affect the ductility of 35 M 13 B and improved the strength and hardness for this alloy, in contrast no tempering left 30 M 12 CB- 850 very brittle. Directly hardening <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> 30 M 12 CB will result in a slight reduction in quality, however the difference in quality will likely be slightly greater than the results from this work indicates. It is reasonable to say that reducing the temperature of tempering for 35 M 13 B may be preferable as it saves space, reduces production time and cost, while maintaining or increasing the hardness and strength of the material. Further, the slight reduction in ductility should not lead to brittle fractures and thus may not affect the end product negatively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{evaluation}} of a novel soft cable-driven exosuit that can apply forces to the body to assist walking. Unlike traditional exoskeletons which contain rigid framing elements, the soft exosuit is worn like clothing, yet can generate moments at the ankle and hip with magnitudes of 18 % and 30 % of those naturally generated by the body during walking, respectively. Our design uses geared motors to pull on Bowden cables connected to the suit near the ankle. The suit has the advantages over a traditional exoskeleton in that the wearer's joints are unconstrained by external rigid structures, and the <b>worn</b> <b>part</b> of the suit is extremely light, which minimizes the suit's unintentional interference with the body's natural biomechanics. However, a soft suit presents challenges related to actuation force transfer and control, since the body is compliant and cannot support large pressures comfortably. We discuss {{the design of the}} suit and actuation system, including principles by which soft suits can transfer force to the body effectively and the biological inspiration for the design. For a soft exosuit, an important design parameter is the combined effective stiffness of the suit and its interface to the wearer. We characterize the exosuit’s effective stiffness, and present preliminary results from it generating assistive torques to a subject during walking. We envision such an exosuit having broad applicability for assisting healthy individuals as well as those with muscle weakness.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{document}} contact lens prescribing {{trends in}} the United Kingdom {{over the past decade}} (between 1996 and 2005). METHODS: An annual survey of contact lens prescribing trends was conducted each year by asking a random selection of optometrists and dispensing opticians to provide information relating to 10 consecutive contact lens fits between January and March. RESULTS: Over the 10 -year survey period, 1251 practitioners returned survey forms representing a total of 12, 050 contact lens fits. The mean (+/-standard deviation) age of lens wearers was 33 +/- 13 years of which 64 % were female. Over the survey period, rigid lens new fits decreased from 22 % to 4 %. Low water content lenses reduced from 20 % to 2 % of new soft lens fits. Soft toric lenses gradually increased {{to the point where they}} accounted for the expected proportion of patients with astigmatism>or= 1. 00 DC (i. e. > 20 % of soft lens fits). Monthly and daily disposable lenses accounted for > 90 % of all soft lens fits between 2003 and 2005. The proportion of new soft fits and refits prescribed as extended wear has gradually increased, stabilizing at about 5 % of new fits and 12 % of refits. Multi-purpose lens care solutions increased from 60 % of all care systems in 1997 to 91 % in 2005. Rigid lenses and monthly replacement soft lenses are predominantly worn on a full time basis, whereas daily disposable soft lenses are mainly <b>worn</b> <b>part</b> time. CONCLUSIONS: This survey indicates that technological advancements such as the development of new lens materials, manufacturing methods and lens designs have had a significant impact on the contact lens market over a relatively short period of time...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} laser metal {{deposition}} (LMD) for repair or fabrication of near-net shaped metals components directly from computer aided design (CAD) solid models without use of time and cost-prohibitive conventional techniques, such as five-axis milling, linear friction welding and electro chemical machining depends {{on the availability of}} a close CAD/ computer aided manufacturing (CAM) chain. Distortion and defects of a <b>worn</b> <b>part</b> implies that the nominal CAD model from the design stage is no longer suitable for the representation of the part geometry. This means that first of all the actual and the target geometry have to be constructed from which the deficit volume is determined. Only with this volume being available the tool paths can be programmed. The original data format of laser scanned data is a polygonal modelling approach for surface representation. The further step of creating a non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) representation of the geometry requires a major commitment in time, both in instruction and in amount of work. For this reason the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology (ILT) designed a process chain for the laser material deposition (LMD) whose CAM module termed LMDCAM, is based on a polygonal modelling approach for geometry representation. NURBS are only used for the reduction of data noise in the scanned data. The target geometry of worn parts is derived by a best fit with the CAD model from the design stage. LMDCAM supports the generation of all sorts of path pattern within a layer which for example may be derived from a distortion reduction analysis. The functionalities of LMDCAM are exemplified by a repair application and the near-net fabrication of a blade-integrated disk (BLISK) blade direct from the CAD model...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe main {{motivation}} for coating industrial parts {{with a different}} material lies on the following needs: (1) to improve functional performance, (2) to improve the component life by reducing wear due to abrasion, erosion and/or corrosion, (3) to extend the component life by rebuilding the <b>worn</b> <b>part</b> to its original dimensions, and (4) to improve the functionality of a low-cost material by coating it with a high performance but more expensive coating. Coating technologies can be roughly divided into thin- and thick- film technologies. Thin films, with thickness of less than 20 μm can be produced by dry coating processes like Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) or Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD); they offer excellent enhancement of surface properties and are for example used in optical and electronic device and cutting tools, Davis J. R. (2004). However, most of these thin-film technologies require a reduced pressure environment and, therefore, are more expensive with a limit on {{the size and shape}} of the substrate. Thick films have a thickness over 20 μm and can be several millimeters thick. They are required when the functional performance depends on the layer thickness, e. g. in thermal barrier coatings, when high erosion and corrosion conditions result in wear and the component life depends on the layer thickness, or when the original dimensions of worn parts have to be restored. Thick film deposition methods include chemical/electro-chemical plating, brazing, weld overlays, and thermal spray. Thermal spray processes, Davis J. R. (2004), are well-established surface treatments aiming at forming a coating by stacking of lamellae resulting from impact, flattening and solidification of impinging molten particles. "Thermal spraying comprises a group of coating processes in which finely divided metallic or non-metallic materials are deposited in a molten or semi-molten condition to form a coating. The coating material may be in the form of powder, ceramic rod, wire or molten materials, Hermanek, F. J. (2001). ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis has {{attempted}} to reduce costs associated with <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> in test equipment at Ericsson’s master and industrialization center (MIC) in Kista. Two different cases have been pursued, and each {{has been designed to}} follow a, for the purpose, adapted version of the design research methodology (DRM). The adapted model was presented and its use in both cases was additionally evaluated. Both cases were based on products that already have been launched and are used in production. In order to avoid expensive changes to surrounding equipment, incremental product development was chosen in both cases. The first case focused on test equipment used in the production of digital units for radio base stations. After the <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> of this test equipment were examined, it was found that a plastic detail was manufactured through milling and as a result was quite expensive. The plastic detail was redesigned so that it could be manufactured using the injection molding process instead. This resulted in an estimated cost reduction of 48 %. The second case focused on <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> of test fixtures used in the production of radio filters, also used in Ericsson’s radio base stations. A more process-oriented view was adopted in this case and parameters believed to be causing added wear such as positional and angular misalignment were examined further. Tolerance chains for each <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> in the assembled test fixture were calculated to determine the degrees of possible misalignment. The resulting data did however not correlate with each <b>wear</b> <b>part’s</b> individual <b>wear</b> interval, and no concrete cost reductive improvements could be delivered.
