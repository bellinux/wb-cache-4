5|$|Saint Paul has a {{variation}} of the strong mayor-council form of government. The mayor is the chief executive and chief administrative officer for the city and the seven-member city council is the legislative body. The mayor is elected by the entire city, while members of the city council are elected from seven different geographic wards of approximately equal population. Both the mayor and council members serve four-year terms. The current mayor is Chris Coleman (DFL), <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> relation to former mayor Norm Coleman. Coleman is Saint Paul's ninth Irish-American mayor since 1900. Aside from Norm Coleman, who became a Republican during his second term, Saint Paul has not elected a Republican mayor since 1952.|$|E

5|$|Max's {{daughter}} Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) becomes {{angry at}} Max for never mentioning Bradley, leading to his confessing {{that he knows}} Bradley did not kill Archie. Lauren starts to suspect Max as he has become violent towards other people, but he tells her he promised {{to look after the}} real killer, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer a danger. When Lauren sees Stacey dancing with Max, she accuses her of trying flirting with Max, but Stacey says they are just friends and he promised he would always look out for her. Lauren realises that Stacey is the killer and tells Max she knows this. She confronts Stacey, who confesses, and Lauren records it on her mobile phone. Lauren later hands the recording to Janine as Stacey and Ryan have begun having an affair. Max wipes the recording so on Christmas Eve, Janine publicly announces in the pub after trying to play the recording that Stacey killed Archie. Outside, Stacey privately tells Ryan that Janine is telling the truth.|$|E
5|$|S. Sivasekaram's 1980 Tamil poem Ahalikai {{examines}} the stone motif in Ahalya's tale: she marries a husband <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> {{more interested in}} her than a stone and briefly encounters joy with Indra, only to end up cursed to become a lifeless stone. The poet asks if it was better for Ahalya to remain physically a stone and retain her dignity rather than return to a stony marriage. Uyir Maga ("Life-woman") by the Tamil poet Na. Pichamurthy (1900–76) presents Ahalya as an allegorical representation of life, with Gautama as the mind and Indra pleasure. The Marxist critic Kovai Gnani, in his poem Kallihai, represents Ahalya as the oppressed class and Rama as an ideal future without exploitation. Gautama and Indra represent feudalism and capitalism. The character of Ahalya played by Kamala Kotnis in the 1949 movie Sati Ahalya ("chaste Ahalya") was described as still relevant by contemporary film critics due to its portrayal of the predicament of a stained woman.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{worthy of}} note that the Dorothy of the books is only a little girl <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> older than twelve-years-old. However, she is mature and very resourceful, only crying when faced with {{ultimate}} despair, whereas the older Dorothy of the movie (portrayed as a twelve-year-old by sixteen-year-old Judy Garland) spends several portions of the film crying and being told by others what to do, however her fear was overshadowed by the Cowardly Lion's. This is more consistent with Thompson's portrayal of Dorothy—Baum {{is known for his}} strong and independent female characters.|$|E

Answering her questions truthfully, Orlok concedes that East-Meg One started the war by sending him to attack Mega-City One with the Block Mania virus, as well as launching the first missiles. He also accepts that, had a similar attack been launched against his own city, his response would have been similar to Dredd's.|$|E

He also has the fifth-most points among active players after Nowitzki, James, Pierce and Carter, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>No.</b> 24 in the scoring list. It was the 12th time Anthony has scored at least 17 points in his last 13 games that included his season-high of 45 points in a quadruple-OT loss to the Atlanta Hawks.

She was recently reunited with the Exiles, including her lover Thunderbird <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer comatose.

25|$|A {{priest of}} Aaron's lineage (i.e. Kohen) is {{forbidden}} by the Mosaic Law (Torah) {{to marry a}} divorced woman even {{if she were a}} native Israelite. Likewise, a male descendant from Aaron's line is prohibited to marry a Jewish woman who has had intercourse with a non-Jew, whether she had been raped or she had willfully done so. So, too, he cannot marry a Jewish woman whose birth was by a father who is a Kohen but who violated one of these prohibitions. If he went ahead and did one of these three things, his male issue born from such union is no longer a priest (i.e. Kohen), but rather becomes a Ḥallal (Lev. 21:7, 14) - a term designating one <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer a priest, but profaned. A priest must maintain an untainted lineage, and his mother must be of Jewish birth. If he married a non-Jewish woman from the gentile nations, his children are no longer priests, but gentiles. Had a priest of Aaron's lineage transgressed this prohibition and married a divorced woman, and they had children together, all of his female issue - whether his, or his sons, or his grandchildren - would be prohibited from marrying into the priestly stock for all generations.|$|E

The vicious battle ends with almost all members of the expedition killed, including Erwin, save for Eren and his companions, but Zeke ends up forced to flee, leaving a captured Bertoldt behind, which is later consumed by Armin to save his life. With Shiganshina secured, Eren fulfills his promise to his father by reaching the basement of their old house, where he and his friends retrieve some books and a photograph of Grisha, his first wife, Dina, who Eren recognizes as the same Titan who killed his mother, and their son, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> other than Zeke. Upon returning home, Eren realizes that to control the power of the coordinate, he must obtain the blood of someone from the royalty, as the only moment when he managed to use it was when he got into contact with Dina, a descendant of the Eldian kings herself, in her Titan form.|$|E

25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E

He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E
