5|$|Geldray {{took part}} in the Normandy {{landings}} with the Prinses Irene Brigade, but was injured by a bomb blast and spent time in a military hospital. Although he did not incur long-term injuries, he suffered from recurring nightmares in the following years. After the liberation of Amsterdam, Geldray travelled to the city to find his parents who had been resident when the Germans invaded. He found that both parents and his sister Xaviere had been killed in a concentration camp by the Nazis. At the end of the war, Geldray returned to Paris and once again found work <b>with</b> <b>Ray</b> Ventura's orchestra for two years, before returning to London in 1947.|$|E

At a town hall meeting, Homer is fired from his post and replaced <b>with</b> <b>Ray</b> Patterson, who declines reinstatement.

5|$|On October 24, 2007, Olli Jokinen {{scored two}} goals against the Philadelphia Flyers {{to become the}} franchise's all-time leader in both goals and points. Both marks were {{previously}} held by Scott Mellanby. Jokinen also became the all-time leader in assists, surpassing Robert Svehla. However, with the Panthers' struggles to make the playoffs, Jokinen never played a playoff game for the franchise. No one player holds as many playoff records for the Panthers as Jokinen does for the regular-season versions. Robert Svehla holds the career record for assists, Ed Jovanovski is the leader in games played, Paul Laus owns the record for most penalty minutes and Dave Lowry shares the goal scoring lead <b>with</b> <b>Ray</b> Sheppard, who also holds the franchise record for playoff points.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, with Test {{vacancies}} beckoning, Davidson and Benaud became training {{partners and}} decided to bowl for three hours continuously {{on a daily basis}} through the winter off season. <b>With</b> <b>Ray</b> Lindwall dropped, Davidson and Benaud became Australia's leading paceman and spinner when the team for the 1957–58 tour of South Africa was announced. It was a heavy burden on Davidson, who had only taken two Test wickets in an innings four times, and three wickets in a Test match on one occasion. The team was to be led by Ian Craig, who had played only six Tests, and at the age of just 22 years, he was the youngest ever Test captain from any country.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} rounds were played Thursday and the final two rounds on Friday. Strong's fine results in the {{first two rounds}} put him on 149, tied for second place <b>with</b> <b>Ray,</b> two strokes behind the second round leader, Vardon, who stood at 147. Strong's play was {{remarkable}} for its steadiness, rather than any particular brilliancy, as he methodically hit fairways and greens and seldom found himself in trouble. Strong beat or tied eventual winner Francis Ouimet in rounds 1, 2 and 4. A disappointing third round 82, however, ruined any chance he had to win the tournament and he would eventually finish on 310, +18 to par, for a ninth-place finish. He won $40 as his share of the purse.|$|E

5|$|Australia and England {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Following his unbeaten 159 in {{the previous}} match and Brown's struggles when playing in the middle-order, Loxton took Brown's position. Brown had scored 25, 26, 17, 24 and 32 in the middle-order in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and the first two Tests. As fast bowling all rounder Keith Miller had been struggling with a back injury that prevented him from bowling from time to time, Loxton {{was seen as a}} necessary reinforcement for the frontline bowlers. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, and Loxton bowled first change, sending down seven overs for the loss of 18 runs. The Australians themselves opened <b>with</b> <b>Ray</b> Lindwall and Bill Johnston taking the new ball, but Bradman had misjudged the breeze and needed to swap his bowlers' ends. For this purpose, Loxton bowled a solitary over, his first in Ashes cricket. He was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at the debutant George Emmett, who ignored the opportunity to attack and let the balls pass.|$|E
5|$|For the club's centenary {{season of}} 197475, Saunders brought {{in only two}} new players, Frank Carrodus and Leighton Phillips.

Villa beat Norwich City 10 <b>with</b> <b>Ray</b> Graydon scoring the winning goal. At the beginning of the 197576 season Doug Ellis resigned as chairman but remained on the board. Ellis left the club in a good position on the field. They were in the First Division and the UEFA Cup for the first time due to the League Cup win of 1975. The club's first season of European football was short-lived though as they were beaten 51 by Antwerp in the first round. In the following season, Villa finished fourth in the League, and reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. In the 197677 season, two years after their last League Cup win, they beat Everton 32 in the 1977 Final after a second replay.|$|E
