5|$|Iridion 3D {{features}} five {{types of}} weapons, with {{three levels of}} power each. Players boost weapon power by collecting powerups of the color that matches the current weapon. Collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that weapon type. If the player's ship is destroyed the power level of the weapon is reduced by one. Each weapon has advantages and disadvantages. The player starts with the red weapon, which is relatively weak but fires rapidly in a large spread. Green <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> inaccurate but fill the screen with shots. Purple weapons spin in a counterclockwise motion slowly and are fairly strong. Yellow torpedo-like <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> very powerful but powerups are rare and the weapon fires slowly. Blue weapons, a more powerful version of Yellow <b>weapons,</b> <b>are</b> found only on the last level. Flashing powerups restore the craft's shields.|$|E
5|$|Deus Ex {{features}} twenty-four weapons, {{ranging from}} crowbars, electroshock weapons, and riot baton, to laser guided anti-tank rockets and assault rifles; both lethal and non-lethal <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> available. The player {{can also make}} use of several weapons of opportunity, such as fire extinguishers.|$|E

50|$|This <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> {{used in the}} Koei {{video game}} Dynasty Warriors by Diao Chan. However, this <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> only {{available}} to her in Dynasty Warriors 1-5, but {{is referred to as}} a set of maces. After the 5th installment her main <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> changed to a Chain Whip.|$|R
50|$|In 1894 the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{adopted as}} army rifle for the Norwegian Army. The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> in service until World War II.|$|R

5|$|Before the war, Brihannala {{asks the}} chariot to be {{directed}} to a shami tree (prosopis cineraria) where the Pandavas' divine <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> hidden. The 13th year ends on that day and Brihannala regains his form of Arjuna. On realising who Brihannala is, Uttara Kumara is happy to serve him. Arjuna then uses the Sammohanastra weapon, which puts the Kaurava army to sleep. The cattle is rescued and the Pandavas declare that their 13 year exile has been successfully completed. Krishna visits Matsya and the marriage of Uttaraa with Abhimanyu is finalised.|$|E
5|$|Modules and <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> built using a {{resource}} {{represented by a}} lug nut. This resource slowly accrues on its own, but destroyed targets drop varying amounts that can be collected by moving the cursor over them. Each corporation provides {{a different type of}} cargo, which must be placed or arranged according to its characteristics. One corporation provides simple cargo crates, as well as a mechanic module that can produce more cargo crates during the mission in order to increase the mission reward. Another corporation provides passenger modules, which must face outward, limiting space for weapons.|$|E
50|$|Production of the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{funded by}} a Swedish steel {{producer}} and banker (later weapons maker) named Thorsten Nordenfelt, who was working in London. The name of the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> changed to the Nordenfelt gun. A plant producing the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> set up in England, with sales offices in London, and long demonstrations were conducted at several exhibitions. The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> adopted by the British Royal Navy, as an addition to their Gatling and Gardner guns.|$|R
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{intended as a}} replacement for the coaxial weapon in the American M60 tank. The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> evaluated by both the US Army and the US Naval weapon center, who reported that the performance of the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> outstanding during all phases of testing. However, neither chose to adopt the weapon.|$|R
50|$|This <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{traditionally}} {{used with}} brute force, as the strength needed to heft such <b>weapons</b> <b>was</b> considerable. As a result, this <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> not often practiced by kung fu enthusiasts, and newly made replicas may be hollow. However, routines for this weapon still exist in some styles. Chui {{are almost always}} used in pairs.|$|R
5|$|The British Army's basic {{infantry}} {{weapon is}} the L85A2 assault rifle, sometimes {{equipped with an}} L17A2 under-barrel grenade launcher or other attachments with the Picatinny rail. The rifle has several variants, including the L86A2, the Light Support Weapon (LSW) and the L22A2 carbine (issued to tank crews). These <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> usually equipped with iron sights or an optical SUSAT, although optical sights have been purchased to supplement these.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of weapons, including melee, projectile, and explosive weapons, as well as airstrike-based attacks. Some are based on real-life arms, such as the shotgun, bazooka, and hand grenade; others are rather fanciful and cartoonish, such as the sheep, which serves as a mobile explosive, and the skunk, which releases poisonous gas. In a normal match, all teams begin with the same weapons, based on the chosen weapon set. Some weapons may not become available until a certain number of turns pass. Depending on the game options, additional weapons may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported crates. In addition to normal weapons, during team creation, each team chooses a special weapon which becomes available to them after a certain number of turns. The special <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> more powerful than regular weapons and often offer special abilities; super weapons will rarely fall in weapon crates. These <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, one of the game weapons is a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.|$|E
5|$|<b>Weapons</b> <b>are</b> {{equipped}} on {{both hands}} of the characters and are used with the circle and cross buttons. Pressing both buttons in succession is necessary to execute combos. The other buttons are used to lock focus onto an enemy, guard, dash, or manually change the camera angle. The number of attacks and blocks is limited by an energy meter for each arm, which decreases after each move but replenishes with time.|$|E
50|$|An anti {{ballistic}} <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> any <b>weapon</b> (<b>be</b> it a missile, a laser {{or another}} type of object) designed to counter threats which are ballistic objects.|$|R
50|$|Aliens {{demonstrated}} its capabilities {{with the}} M56 Smartgun, a handheld light machine gun. This <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{connected to the}} user's Head-Up Display, showing where the <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> aimed. It was also equipped with a motion-sensitive auto-tracking system, capable of autonomous and accurate targeting of moving objects (the real <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> a MG42 with a Steadicam harness).|$|R
25|$|The {{theory of}} peace without <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> {{as old as}} {{philosophy}} and human consciousness. This theory holds that <b>weapons</b> per se <b>are</b> a threat to peace, and a removal of all <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> the way to everlasting peace.|$|R
5|$|While <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> personified {{in ancient}} Hindu epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the ayudhapurushas were {{depicted}} in sculpture {{starting from the}} Gupta era. They might be depicted as humans with the weapons against them or holding the weapon or with the weapon on their head or emerging from it. The most popular ayudhapurushas {{are associated with the}} god Vishnu and appear in his iconography.|$|E
5|$|Worms Armageddon {{includes}} {{a very high}} level of customizability â€“ in multiplayer games or skirmishes, the player can create custom game modes with preferred gameplay options and weapon sets. Regular options include starting health, whether the worms can move, how long a turn lasts, and sudden death options. Weapons settings include what weapons the teams start with, which weapons will fall in crates and how often, and how powerful individual <b>weapons</b> <b>are.</b> Worms Armageddon offers several levels of customizability outside of direct gameplay options.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} throughout the game, two additional ships become available for use. Each of the game's three ships offers a different balance of speed, weapons, and maneuverability. Within the levels, the player may collect power-ups that enhance the ship's weaponry. <b>Weapons</b> <b>are</b> categorized into three different types: primary weapons, secondary weapons, and countermeasures. Primary weapons {{range from a}} variety of laser weapons to the Plasma Cannon and the Napalm Cannon, which projects a stream of burning fuel. Secondary weapons include different types of missiles, while countermeasures range from proximity mines to portable turrets. Most primary weapons consume energy in different rate, but some, such as the Napalm Cannon, use their own type of ammunition. In contrast, all secondary weapons and countermeasures require their own ammunition suppliers.|$|E
50|$|More <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> {{supplied}} {{throughout the}} uprising, {{and some were}} captured from the Germans. Some <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> handmade by the resistance; sometimes such weapons worked, other times they jammed repeatedly.|$|R
50|$|Native Americans used many {{variations}} of striking <b>weapons.</b> These <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> mainly used for melee combat with other tribes. In some cases these <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> thrown for long range attacks.|$|R
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> first deployed, but not used, during Operation Allied Force when NATO {{entered the}} Kosovo War. Sensor-fused <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> first fired in combat during the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq.|$|R
5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} the screen is a power bar, a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. <b>Weapons</b> <b>are</b> upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.|$|E
5|$|For example, the Security Council passed no resolutions on {{most major}} Cold War conflicts, {{including}} the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Vietnam War, and the Sovietâ€“Afghan War. Resolutions addressing more current problems, {{such as the}} conflict between Israel and Palestine and Iran's suspected development of nuclear <b>weapons,</b> <b>are</b> also heavily influenced by the veto, actual or threatened. Additionally, the veto applies to {{the selection of the}} UN's Secretary-General, as well as any amendments to the UN Charter, giving the P5 great influence over these processes. Recently China also exercised its VETO on India's Resolution to put Masood Azhar on list of Global terrorist list. He is proclaimed head of Jaish E Mohammad a terror Outfit which is already designated as Global terrorist group by UNSC.|$|E
5|$|Local {{multiplayer}} {{allows the}} player to select which teams {{participate in the}} battle {{as well as the}} number of worms and handicaps, which options and <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> used, and the level to be played on. The matches can use any combination of human and computer teams, provided at least one team is human. Additionally, multiple worm teams can form an alliance for the match by selecting the same team color â€“ they will still operate separately in movement rotation but share weapons and score. If multiple human players are using the same computer, the game functions in a hotseat mode.|$|E
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Mahlon J. Gallager, who licensed the design to Richardson and Overman of Philadelphia for production. On 31 August 1861 the first <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> {{sold to the}} Army.|$|R
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{refitted}} in 1859 (T.59) {{and again}} in 1867 (T.67) with a Milbank-Amsler receiver system to convert it to a breech loader. Some <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> also retrofitted with rifled barrels in the 1860s.|$|R
50|$|A three-position, {{firing pin}} {{blocking}} safety lever on the bolt shroud allows the bolt to be manipulated with the safety on. If the <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> cocked, {{the firing pin}} can be felt {{at the end of}} the bolt action, making it possible in poor visibility to feel whether the <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> ready to fire. The safety-catch of the <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> also positioned at the rear, showing white if the safety is on, red if not.|$|R
5|$|Ravenloft is an {{adventure}} module for the Dungeons & Dragons (D) fantasy role-playing game. The American game publishing company TSR, Inc. released it as a standalone adventure booklet in 1983 {{for use with}} the first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. It was written by Tracy and Laura Hickman, and includes art by Clyde Caldwell with maps by David SutherlandIII. The plot of Ravenloft focuses on the villain Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire who pines for his lost love. Various story elements, including Strahd's motivation and the locations of magical <b>weapons,</b> <b>are</b> randomly determined by drawing cards. The player characters attempt to defeat Strahd and, if successful, the adventure ends.|$|E
5|$|TNA held a No Disqualification {{match between}} Abyss, who was {{accompanied}} by James Mitchell, and Sabu next. Its duration was 11 minutes and 30 seconds. This was originally promoted as Abyss versus Sabu, however, a No Disqualification stipulation was added during the event. In a No Disqualification match, <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> legal, as well as outside interference, with a victor determined only by pinfall or submission. In the final minutes, Abyss retrieved a bag of thumbtacks which were hidden under the ring. He then poured the contents onto the ring mat before slamming Sabu back-first into the tacks with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Defence Force {{seeks to}} be a {{high-technology}} force, {{and much of}} its equipment {{is scheduled to be}} replaced or upgraded in the near future. Australia does not possess {{weapons of mass destruction and}} has ratified the Biological Weapons Convention, Chemical Weapons Convention and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Although most of the ADF's <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> only used by single service, there is an increasing emphasis on commonality. The three services use the same small arms and the FN Herstal 35 is the ADF's standard hand gun, the F88 Austeyr the standard rifle, the F89 Minimi the standard light support weapon, the FN Herstal MAG-58 the standard light machine gun and the Browning M2HB the standard heavy machine gun.|$|E
