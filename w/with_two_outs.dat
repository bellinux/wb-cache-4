At 20 years old he was the youngest player in the majors and came close to picking up the win, but the team's closer, Jeremy Affeldt, gave up the lead <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning.|$|E
5|$|Signed as a pinch hitter for the Cleveland Indians at age 19, Paschal {{appeared}} in nine games, collecting one hit on August 16, which broke up a no-hitter by Bernie Boland <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> {{in the ninth}} inning. The Indians declared Paschal too inexperienced, and {{he was sent to}} the Muskegon Reds of the Central League. The league disbanded {{in the middle of the}} 1917 season, and Paschal became a free agent.|$|E

The team wins the title and Homer, still unconscious, is paraded as a hero.|$|E
5|$|Cueto walked Murphy <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> in {{the ninth}} before getting Cespedes to fly out to right to finish the {{complete}} game, becoming the first AL pitcher to accomplish this feat in the World Series since Jack Morris in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series, as the Royals defeated the Mets and took a two games to zero lead in the series.

5|$|The 1993 season saw long-time Red Sox fan {{favorite}} Wade Boggs defect to the Yankees after eleven {{seasons with}} Boston. Later in September 1993, the Yankees defeated Boston at Yankee Stadium via a last-moment reprieve. Trailing 3–1, Mike Stanley's apparent fly out <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> {{in the ninth}} was nullified by a fan running onto the field prior to the pitch being thrown.

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> in the 9th {{inning of}} {{a game against the}} Arizona Diamondbacks on May 28, 1998, Bonds became only the fifth player in {{baseball}} history to be given an intentional walk with the bases loaded. Nap Lajoie (1901), Del Bissonette (1928) and Bill Nicholson (1944) were three others in the 20th century who received that rare honor. The first to receive one was Abner Dalrymple in 1881. During a game against the Philadelphia Phillies on August 2, Bonds was hit by a pitch thrown by Ricky Bottalico, leading to Bonds charging the mound and triggering a bench-clearing brawl.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from baseball, Grove {{continued to work}} with his uncle. His legacy lived on in his nephew, Wayne Grove. While playing for the Bellwood Lions of the Chicago Little League, Wayne pitched a no-hitter and struck out 15, and narrowly missed a perfect game when a runner got on base <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning. Despite an unimpressive Major League career, Grove earned a few votes for induction into the Hall of Fame, receiving five votes in the 1958 balloting (1.9% of the required votes needed) and seven in the 1960 balloting (2.6% of the required votes needed).|$|E
50|$|Agee led off {{the game}} for the Mets with a home run off of Jim Palmer, then saved at least five runs with his defense. <b>With</b> <b>two</b> <b>out</b> in the fourth and Oriole runners on first and third, Agee raced to the 396-foot sign in left-center and made a backhanded running catch of a drive hit by Elrod Hendricks.

5|$|In 1896, Young lost {{a no-hitter}} <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> {{in the ninth}} inning when Ed Delahanty of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a single. On September 18, 1897, Young pitched the first no-hitter of his career in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Although Young did not walk a batter, the Spiders {{committed}} four errors while on defense. One of the errors had originally been ruled a hit, but the Cleveland third baseman sent a note to the press box after the eighth inning, saying he had made an error, and the ruling was changed. Young later said, that, despite his teammate's gesture, he considered the game to be a one-hitter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} inning, the Yankees cut the Cardinals' lead. <b>With</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs,</b> Joe Dugan hit a single. Hank Severeid {{followed}} with a double, scoring Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3–2 lead. In {{the bottom half of}} the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game.|$|E
5|$|Neither team got {{a hit in}} {{the third}} or fourth innings. The only runners to reach base were Whitey Kurowski and Marion, both on walks. The fifth started that the same way, with Slaughter and Moore flying out. <b>With</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> however, the Cardinals started hitting. Musial doubled, Kurowski walked, Slaughter tripled, and Dusak singled. All but Dusak scored on the hits, {{bringing}} the score to 5–1 and ending Hatten's day. Hank Behrman came on in relief. Behrman kept any more runs from scoring, and after another inning in which the Dodgers did not record a hit, the score was 5–1 {{at the end of the}} fifth.|$|E

5|$|Nick Swisher {{walked to}} lead off {{the fifth inning}} and {{advanced}} to second on a Melky Cabrera single. Swisher restored the Yankees' lead, scoring on a single by Jeter, and Cabrera added to it by scoring a run on a Damon single. Brett Gardner replaced Cabrera in center field as a defensive substitution {{in the bottom of}} the sixth inning after Cabrera left the game due to a hamstring injury. Chan Ho Park relieved Phillies starter Joe Blanton in the seventh and held the Yankees scoreless in that inning. Chase Utley hit his third solo home run of the series {{in the bottom of the}} seventh <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs,</b> bringing the game to 4–3. Dámaso Marte relieved Sabathia and got the final out of the seventh without further scoring.|$|E
5|$|On August 9 {{against the}} Kansas City Royals, Molina came in <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> and the bases loaded. After drawing a 1–0 count against Peter Moylan, a brief delay {{occurred}} when a stray kitten had {{made its way}} onto the outfield. On the very next pitch to Molina, he hit it 387 feet into the left field seats for a go-ahead grand slam. This was the 5th grand slam of his career, tying him with Tim McCarver for second-most career grand slams by a Cardinals catcher.

5|$|On September 27, 1989, the Phillies {{faced the}} Mets {{in their home}} finale at Shea Stadium in New York after a disappointing Mets season. The Mets had won the East in 1988 but were in third place on September 26 behind the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals. McDowell was closing out a 5–3 win for the Phillies when, <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> in the ninth, he induced former {{teammate}} Gregg Jeffries to ground out to second to end the game. As Jeffries was running out the play, McDowell said something to him prompting Jeffries to charge the mound and wrestle McDowell to the ground. The benches cleared and punches were exchanged before the umpires could separate the teams. Jeffries later claimed that McDowell had thrown at him during a 2–1 Phillies victory on September 25.|$|E

50|$|Against the California Angels at Tiger Stadium on August 20, 1986, Terrell had {{a no-hitter}} broken up <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>out</b> {{in the ninth}} by a Wally Joyner double. It was the only hit he would allow in a 3-0 Tiger victory.|$|R
5|$|After {{a single}} and a stolen base from Andrus, Ríos {{doubled in the}} bottom half of the sixth to cut the score to 4–2. A small {{controversy}} arose in the top of the seventh inning. Longoria and Myers were on first and second base respectively <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> when Young hit a line drive to center field. Replays showed that the ball bounced into Leonys Martín's (the Rangers' center fielder) glove after hitting the ground, making it a trap and therefore should have been a hit. However, the umpires ruled the play an out, ending the inning without a run scoring. Ultimately, the issue did not affect the outcome. The Rays added onto their lead in the ninth inning when Sam Fuld stole third and a scored on a throwing error from Rangers reliever Tanner Scheppers, extending their lead to 5–2. Price closed the game in the ninth, recording three straight outs and finishing off a complete game.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season with the Giants, Tenney led MLB with 684 plate {{appearances}} and finished third in runs scored, with 101. In {{a game against the}} Chicago Cubs on September 23, Tenney could not play due to an attack of lumbago; it was the only game he did not play in during the season. Rookie Fred Merkle took his spot at first base. The game was at a 1–1 tie {{in the bottom of the}} ninth. Merkle, after hitting a single, was at first, and Moose McCormick was at third, <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs.</b> Al Bridwell singled to center field, but Hank O'Day called Merkle out because Merkle had not touched second base. O'Day ruled the game a 1–1 tie due to darkness. With both teams finishing the season at a 98–55 record, a replay game had to be played to determine who would win the National League pennant. The game was held on October 8, with the Cubs winning, 4–2.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Monte Irvin {{was hit by}} a pitch between outs by Mueller and Whitey Lockman. Bobby Thomson then hit a home run to put the Giants up, 2–1. After the third out, the Dodgers came back to the plate. Reese {{grounded}} out, but Snider and Robinson hit back-to-back singles. Campanella grounded into a double play to end the inning. The Giants got one man on base {{in the top of the}} fifth inning, when Stanky singled <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>outs.</b> Pafko reached on an error to start off the bottom of the fifth, but was caught stealing second base; Gil Hodges and Branca both struck out to end the fifth. The only hit in the sixth inning was a single by Lockman, and the two teams entered the seventh inning with the score still 2–1.|$|E
50|$|On August 3, 1990, {{while with}} the Pirates, Drabek had a no-hitter broken up by a Sil Campusano single <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>out</b> in the ninth. The hit {{was the only}} one Drabek would allow in {{defeating}} the Philadelphia Phillies 11-0.|$|R

25|$|The Angels {{returned}} the favor in Game 3 with a walk-off win of their own. Vladimir Guerrero hit a huge game tying two-run homer off Andy Pettitte <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>out</b> {{in the bottom}} of the 6th, and Jeff Mathis laced a game-winning RBI double {{in the bottom of}} the 11th to win the game for the Angels, 5-4. This came after a controversial decision from manager Joe Girardi to lift David Robertson for Alfredo Aceves <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>out</b> and no one on in the 11th. Aceves served up a single to Howie Kendrick, followed by the Mathis double. Four solo home runs accounted for the Yankees' scoring, hit by Derek Jeter, Rodriguez, Johnny Damon and Jorge Posada.|$|R
