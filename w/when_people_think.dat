25|$|Studies {{show that}} people who forgive are happier and {{healthier}} than those who hold resentments. The first study {{to look at how}} forgiveness improves physical health discovered that <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> about forgiving an offender it leads to improved functioning in their cardiovascular and nervous systems. Another study at the University of Wisconsin found the more forgiving people were, the less they suffered {{from a wide range of}} illnesses. The less forgiving people reported a greater number of health problems.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> of {{the desert}} southwest, the {{landscape}} of the Sonoran Desert is what mostly comes to mind. The Sonoran Desert makes up the southwestern portion of the Southwest; most {{of the desert}} lies in Mexico, but its United States component lies on the southeastern border of California, and the western 2/3 of southern Arizona. Rainfall averages between 4–12 inches per year, and the desert's most widely known inhabitant is the saguaro cactus, which is unique to the desert. It is bounded on the northwest by the Mojave Desert, to the north by the Colorado Plateau and to the east by the Arizona Mountains forests and the Chihuahuan Desert. Aside from the trademark saguaro, the desert has the most diverse plant life of any desert in the world, and includes many other species of cacti, including the organ-pipe, senita, prickly pear, barrel, fishhook, hedgehog, cholla, silver dollar, and jojoba. The portion of the Sonora Desert which lies in the Southwestern United States is the most populated area within the region. Six of the top ten major population centers of the region are found within its borders: Phoenix, Tucson, Mesa, Chandler, Glendale, and Scottsdale, all in Arizona. Also within its borders are Yuma and Prescott Arizona.|$|E

Early in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in stage diving as well as crowd surfing. During {{the early part of}} Pearl Jam's career, Vedder was known to climb the stage {{lighting}} rig and hang from the stage roof. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, [...] "It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> we were on fire and young. Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. And I find it kind of hard to watch those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality.
