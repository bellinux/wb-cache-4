Konnan introduced himself and explained how he was brought here by his manager/agent, John Roberts. Roberts had already bragged to de los Santos that Carlos had been a wrestler in Florida.

[...] American pop singer Katy Perry {{was the first person to}} be offered the track but turned it down because she felt its message was too similar to that of her song [...] "Firework".

[...] According to Sia's manager, Jonathan Daniel of Crush Management, Sia wrote the song for American R singer Alicia Keys.

When the couple arrived in Washington from Keokuk, Iowa in 1869, Belknap rented a large house recently vacated by Secretary of State William H. Seward.
