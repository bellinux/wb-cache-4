John Kubicek of BuddyTV stated that the episode [...] "does a lot of things right when it comes to the plot", and Billboard Rae Votta described the plot as [...] "consistent and well managed, with believable motivation, response and action all around". However, Jen Chaney of The Washington Post wrote that the episode [...] "brought more narrative developments that didn’t make sense", and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman stated that aside from Martin's scenes, [...] "the rest of the episode found us back in scatterbrained plot territory". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times liked the episode and described it as [...] "the kind that makes you belly-laugh and chortle and snicker despite your better judgment".|$|E

This work aims at analyzing the possible e ects of a potential economic growth downturn in China, Germany and United States on the growth of other economies. We use global autoregressive regression approach to assess interdependence among countries. Two types of phenomena are simulated. The rst one is a one time shock that hit these economies.

60|$|During {{the rest}} of this day we pursued our journey, and {{examined}} {{the other end of the}} large valley, which we found to be so much alike to the parts already described that I shall not recount the particulars of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> this place. I may, however, remark that we did not quite recover our former cheerful spirits until we arrived at our bower, which we did late in the evening, and found everything just in the same condition as we had left it three days before.|$|E
60|$|From this curious comparison, {{it becomes}} {{apparent}} that the variations {{of the difference in}} question depend upon the amount of variations of temperature which take place in the free air, and on the slowness with which such changes are communicated to the stagnant atmosphere of woods; in other words, as Herr Rivoli boldly formulates it, a forest is simply a bad conductor. But this is precisely the same conclusion as we have already arrived at with regard to individual trees; and in Herr Rivoli's table, what we see is just another case of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> M. Becquerel's--the different progression of temperatures. It must be obvious, however, that the thermal condition of a single tree must be different in many ways from that of a combination of trees and more or less stagnant air, such as we call a forest. And accordingly we find, {{in the case of the}} latter, the following new feature: The mean yearly temperature of woods is lower than the mean yearly temperature of free air, while they are decidedly colder in summer, and very little, if at all, warmer in winter. Hence, on the whole, forests are colder than cleared lands. But this is just what might have been expected from the amount of evaporation, the continued descent of cold air, and its stagnation in the close and sunless crypt of a forest; and one can only wonder here, as elsewhere, that the resultant difference is so insignificant and doubtful.|$|E

40|$|A new {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} to design excited coherent states. where the states β,α denote the Glauber two variable minimum uncertainty coherent states, which minimize minimum uncertainty conditions while carrier nonclassical properties too and n is an integer. They are converted into the Agarwal's type of the photon added coherent states, arbitrary Fock {{states and the}} Glauber two variable coherent states, respectively depending on which of the parameters e̱ṯa̱,α and n equal to zero. It {{has been shown that}} the resolution of identity condition is realized with respect to an appropriate measure on the complex plane, too. We have compared our results with the similar quantum states of Agarwal's type and seen that in our case amount of quantum fluctuations are much controllable. Moreover, we have also more flexibility to establish and set-out of their features. Also, there is a discussion on the statistical properties, can unveil (non-) classical properties of these states. For instance their Poissonian statistics are significant similar to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> earlier <b>in</b> the Glauber two variable coherent states. Interestingly, depending on the particular choice of the parameters of the above scenarios, we are able to determine the status of compliance with squeezing properties in field quadratures. The last stage is devoted to some theoretical framework to generate them in cavities. Comment: 16 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
60|$|Our ascent {{was mostly}} through winding and {{climbing}} streets of little dirty houses, with frowsy gardens beside them, {{and the very}} dirtiest-faced children in England playing about them. From time to time our driver had to ask his way of the friendly flat- bosomed slatterns, with babies in their arms, on their thresholds, or the women tending shop, or peddling provisions, who were all kind to him, and assured him {{with varying degrees of}} confidence that the Old Manor was a bit, or a goodish bit, beyond. All at once we came upon the sight of it on an open top, hard by what is left of the ruins of the real Manor, where Wolsey stayed that little while from death. The relics are broken walls, higher here, lower there; with some Tudor fireplaces showing through their hollow windows. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> tolerable repair was the tower of the Manor, or the lodge, and we drove to it across a field, on a track made by farm carts, and presently kept by a dog that showed his teeth in a grin not wholly of amusement at our temerity. While we debated whether we had not better let the driver get down and knock, a farmer-like man came to the door and called the dog off. Then, in a rich North Country accent, he welcomed us to his kitchen parlor, where his wife was peeling potatoes for their midday dinner, and so led us up the narrow stone stairs of the tower to the chambers where Mary miserably passed those many long years of captivity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{same year}} Robert Antoine Pinchon showed in Paris {{for the first}} time. The {{occasion}} was the 1905 Salon d'Automne (18 October to 25 November), an exhibition that witnessed the birth of Fauvism. [...] "A pot of paint has been flung {{in the face of}} the public," [...] wrote the critic Camille Mauclair. Louis Vauxcelles coined the phrase les fauves ('the wild beasts') to describe a circle of painters exhibiting in the same room as a classical sculpture. He stated his criticism of their works by describing the sculpture as [...] "a Donatello amongst wild beasts" [...] (Donatello chez les fauves). Another art critic responding to the Salon d'Automne, , wrote in the Journal de Rouen on 20 November that these works have [...] "no relation to painting" [...] and compared them to [...] "the barbaric and naïve games of a child who plays with a box of colors". Of Pinchon's three paintings (Le Pont Transbordeur à Rouen, Le Pont de Boieldieu, à Rouen, Vieilles Cabanes dans l'Île Lacroix, à Rouen) he wrote: [...] "Showing for his first time in Paris... the technique is a bit heavy, but we shouldn't be too severe toward a beginner, especially after <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> elsewhere <b>in</b> the Salon". Though Pinchon had not exhibited in room VII with the fauves, his palette was already pure and his impasto thick.|$|R
60|$|A {{long while}} ago I jotted down {{in it the}} history of the events that it details with more or less completeness. This I did for my own satisfaction. You will have noted how memory fails us as we advance in years; we recollect, with an almost painful exactitude, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{experienced}} and <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> our youth, but the happenings of our middle life slip away from us or become blurred, like a stretch of low-lying landscape overflowed by grey and nebulous mist. Far off the sun still seems to shine upon the plains and hills of adolescence and early manhood, as yet it shines about us in the fleeting hours of our age, that ground on which we stand to-day, but the valley between is filled with fog. Yes, even its prominences, which symbolise the more startling events of that past, often are lost in this confusing fog.|$|R
60|$|Wednesday.--I {{got your}} letter {{this morning and}} have to {{thank you so much}} for it. Bob is much better; and I do hope out of danger. To-day has been more glorious than I can tell you. It has been the first day of blue sky that we have had; and it was {{happiness}} for a week to see the clear bright outline of the hills and the glory of sunlit foliage and the darkness of green shadows, and the big white clouds that went voyaging overhead deliberately. My two cousins from Portobello were here; and they and I and Maggie ended the afternoon by lying half an hour together on a shawl. The big cloud had all been carded out into a thin luminous white gauze, miles away; and miles away too seemed the little black birds that passed between this and us as we lay with faces upturned. The similarity of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> struck <b>in</b> us a curious similarity of mood; and in consequence of the small size of the shawl, we all lay so close that we half pretended, half felt, we had lost our individualities and had become merged and mixed up in a quadruple existence. We had the shadow of an umbrella over ourselves, and when any one reached out a brown hand into the golden sunlight overhead we all feigned that we did not know whose hand it was, until at last I don't really think we quite did. Little black insects also passed over us and in the same half wanton manner we pretended we could not distinguish them from the birds. There was a splendid sunlit silence about us, and as Katharine said the heavens seemed to be dropping oil on us, or honey-dew--it was all so bland.|$|R
