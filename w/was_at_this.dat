5|$|Arbroath {{was made}} a royal burgh in 1178 by King William the Lion {{at the same time}} as the Abbey was established. The burgh of regality {{permitted}} the monks to hold a weekly market, dispense basic justice and to establish a harbour. In 1559, the town's burgh of regality was reconfirmed in 1599 by King James VI of Scotland. A provost and a town council were appointed and it <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point Aberbrothock became a fully fledged royal burgh.|$|E
5|$|Both Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus where {{discovered}} {{during the}} 1965 joint Polish-Mongolian expedition. Before the remains were prepared and described, the expedition crew believed both finds {{to belong to}} the same species of sauropod. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka deemed Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus to represent separate genera because Nemegtosaurus <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time considered {{to be a member of}} the Dicraeosauridae, while Opisthocoelicaudia seemed to be a representative of a different group, the Camarasauridae.|$|E

5|$|By 1901, the town's {{population}} had reached 5,102, and by 1931 had further doubled to 10,104. The {{early twentieth century}} saw a period of increased urbanization of the area; in the period from the First World War to 1937, 312 council houses were built, and public services, such as electricity supplies and sewerage, were completed. The steep gradient of the Rath <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time constructed, and in 1939 a Town Hall was opened on Hamilton Terrace, at that time possessing an inbuilt fire station. 1939 also saw the opening of an outdoor swimming pool on the Rath.|$|E

Rendra, which convinced her {{to drop out of}} university and join the troupe. In 1974 she founded Satu Merah Panggung Theater, which performed adaptations of foreign works such as the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet– in the latter, Sarumpaet played the titular role.|$|E

In February 1817, she was again re-rated, this time to 60 guns.|$|E

5|$|En {{route to}} Albany, the ship {{carrying}} Montgomery up the Hudson River ran aground near Clermont Manor, {{seat of the}} politically powerful Livingston family. While the ship was refloated, the Livingstons played host to the officers who were aboard the vessel. Montgomery <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time introduced to Robert Livingston's 20-year-old daughter Janet. While it has never transpired exactly what happened between them at this time, Janet noticed that the young Montgomery was not with the regiment (having been given leave to return to England early) when it returned to New York.|$|E
5|$|Further {{sedimentary}} deposits {{were formed}} through the Cambrian period (541–485 Ma), some of which, {{along with the}} earlier Precambrian sediments, metamorphosed into the Dalradian series. This is composed {{of a wide variety}} of materials, including mica schist, biotite gneiss schist, schistose grit, greywacke and quartzite. The area that would become Scotland <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time close to the south pole and part of Laurentia. Fossils from the north-west Highlands indicate the presence of trilobites and other primitive forms of life.|$|E

The characters were to create a family unit for then, already existing character Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin).|$|E
5|$|In May 1098, Kerbogha of Mosul {{approached}} Antioch {{to relieve}} the siege. Bohemond bribed an Armenian guard named Firouz to surrender his tower, and in June the crusaders entered the city and killed most of the inhabitants. However, {{only a few days}} later the Muslims arrived, laying siege to the former besiegers. According to Raymond D'Aguilers, it <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point that a monk named Peter Bartholomew claimed to have discovered the Holy Lance in the city, and although some were skeptical, this was seen as a sign that they would be victorious.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point in Morris's life that he accepted that he would never realize his early dream of becoming a minister.|$|E

B. indicated that he understood and then proceeded to provide further details about the crime, including the location of the stolen property. J. D. B. wrote a statement at the investigator's request.

5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> {{point that}} the Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent.

In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's preparedness for war.|$|E

5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> {{stage that}} the attack began to go seriously wrong.

The same wind disclosed the Inshore Squadron to the German defenders who immediately opened up a withering fire on the blockships. With their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties, the commanders increased speed despite the poor visibility and continued groping through the narrow channels inshore, searching for the Stroom Bank buoy which directed shipping into the canal.|$|E

On 24 November, Giáp ordered the 148th Infantry Regiment and the 316th Division to attack Lai Chau, while the 308th, 312th, and 351st divisions assault Điện Biên Phủ from Việt Bắc.|$|E
5|$|Llanbadarn Fawr was {{the focus}} of the English forces {{assembled}} in south Wales against the insurrection of Rhys ab Meredydd in 1287. By this time the rector was invariably an absentee cleric; John de Camera, Rector 1329–1334 was also canon of St David's, Hereford and Abergwili, and was a government clerk. Then, as now, such a large and remote charge invited pluralism and non-residence. There <b>was,</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time, a comparatively small amount in tithes, but the rector was nonetheless equivalent in substance to an abbot, owing to the ownership of extensive lands by Frankalmoin tenure.|$|E
