Women were empowered to <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> Communist rule also brought {{about the end of}} practices such as foot binding, child marriages, prostitution, and arranged marriages. China has seen a decrease in domestic violence due to government-supported grassroots programs to counter these practices. Women in rural areas remain largely uneducated.|$|E

The tools used in the evaluator process were: a questionnaire, Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Results indicated that high school age children of mothers who <b>worked</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> beyond school hours exhibited lower self-esteem levels than did high school aged children of mothers who may have <b>worked</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> but not beyond school hours.

She first earned a teaching diploma and became a school teacher, then graduated in medicine in 1911. After completing her residency, she applied to teach at the university level, but instead was offered a teaching post at the School of Midwifery. Outraged, she fought for 13 years against the prejudices which prevented her advancing in her career. In 1927, Ferrari won her fight and was granted a professorship as an alternate. Finally in 1939, she was awarded a full professorship.|$|E
5|$|World War II had a {{significant}} impact on changing family roles. Because of the draft, workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women, mainly in nontraditional positions. This increase in working women became one of the few times in history where women were praised for <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> Divorce rates also reached a new high during this period. Not only had many women found a new sense of independence, but cultural shifts were underway, including the rise of feminism and the development of reliable methods of birth control. Such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages.|$|E

25|$|Though large {{segments}} of the female population remained illiterate through the turn of the century, a growing number of middle-class women began to pursue higher education and <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> Many early female workers found employment in schools, government and commercial offices. The formation of the Union of Professional Women in the 1920s, which embraced university and professional women, played a large role in the suffrage movement.

50|$|During {{the late}} 19th century through the 1920s, very few women <b>worked</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> They were young single women who {{typically}} {{withdrew from the}} labor force at marriage unless family needed two incomes. These women worked primarily in the textile manufacturing industry or as domestic workers. This profession empowered women and allowed them {{to earn a living}} wage. At times, they were a financial help to their families.|$|R

25|$|Over time, Moroccan {{women have}} gained {{more access to}} employment. However, this {{quantitative}} increase in labor participation for women has not been accompanied by higher qualitative standards of labor. The labor of rural women in Morocco remain unacknowledged and unpaid. Women are put into {{a higher risk of}} poverty as their domestic workload is added onto their unpaid labor. This balance of domestic labor and <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> imposes a burden on rural women. Since the socioeconomic exclusion of women deprive them of the capabilities to be educated and trained for certain employment skills, their susceptibility to poverty is heightened. Low educational skills of women directly relate to the limited employment options they have in society. Although both men and women are affected by unemployment, {{women are more likely to}} lose their jobs than men. Recent research in Morocco shows that economic recessions in the country affect women the most.|$|E

50|$|The five {{buildings}} in this Beaver Street subdivision were built c. 1916, {{at a time}} when Worcester more fashionable development was moving from the Woodland Street area to the west side, and when the streetcar made the area more readily accessible to factory workers.

25|$|However, {{the larger}} {{societal}} context of Bedouin culture is changing, {{particularly in the}} Negev. For the past several decades, {{the policy of the}} Israeli government has been to move the Negev Bedouin from the desert to official settlements. This has had several significant effects on Negev Bedouin society. Significantly, the move from a nomadic lifestyle to a sedentary one has displaced the Bedouin women from their previously critical economic roles. Moreover, the shift to a sedentary lifestyle means that wage labor has largely replaced agriculture as the main economic structure for the Negev Bedouin. Traditionally, women in Negev Bedouin society were not allowed to <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> This expectation is still in place today. As the Negev Bedouin have shifted away from agriculture, the productive responsibilities have shifted to the men. Meanwhile, the patriarchal system that developed around the traditional economic structure has been maintained. Ultimately, this has resulted in a loss of power within the household for Bedouin women. It is still considered culturally inappropriate for women to interact with strangers (especially strange men), and the men of the family still mediate their families' interactions with society as a whole. The loss of their economic capabilities has meant that Negev Bedouin women are increasingly excluded from decision-making within the household. As a result, the overwhelming majority of important household decisions are made by men.|$|E
25|$|As {{decreases}} in job security and wages for males have negatively impacted {{the ability of}} the sole male-breadwinner family model, there is now increasing pressure for women to <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> in a dual-earner family model. The percentage of young women who believed that a man should work outside a home and that women should work inside dropped from 41.6% in 1997 to 27.8% in 2008, while for men the rate went from 40.7% to 34.3% respectively. Similarly, the proportion of young women who expected to work until retirement rose from 15.3% in 1987 to 24.7% in 2010, while the proportion of men who expected their wives to do so rose from 10.5% to 32.7% in the same time period. The increasing acceptance of young Japanese adults of the dual-earner model has resulted in an increase of dual-earner young households from 32.4% in 2000 to 42.8% in 2009. Women are also delaying or avoiding marriage altogether. The mean age of first marriage rose from 24.2 in 1970 to 28.8 in 2010, while the proportion of women aged 25â€“29 who have not married increased from 18.1% in 1970 to 60.3% in 2010. The education levels of young women are also drastically increasing, at a rate higher than their male counterparts. 45.2% of women in 2010 progressed to university from high school, a dramatic increase from 15.2% in 1990. These changes in Japanese society have narrowed the wage gap between men and women, as wages of female 25â€“29 years old have reached 88% of their male counterparts in 2007, as opposed to 76% in 1981. However, a large part of this reduction in the wage gap is due to the stagnation of male wages, which was at the same levels in 2007 as in 1991.|$|E
500|$|The Industrial Revolution led to {{extensive}} mechanization, {{resulting in}} a shift from home manufacturing to large-scale factory production. As this rapid transition took place, families lost many of their production functions. Instead, family members had to <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> to support their families.

25|$|The first pre-schools were {{established}} in the 1820s by a private initiative intended to instruct the children of working families, where both parents <b>worked</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> During <b>the</b> period between 1850 and 1900, private educational institutions appeared that were open only on a part-time basis.

According to Gould, even Athenian women forced to <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> for economic reasons would have had a conceptual (if not physical) boundary preventing them from interacting with unrelated men.

Wilderspin's schools were based on the reform education theory of Swiss thinker Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.
