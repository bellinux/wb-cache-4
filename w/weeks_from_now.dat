I don't know, though, as {{we can afford to}} pay you quite the same salary at first, even if we can work you in--the season's been very slack. But I'll do what I can for you. Come in and see me in about a week. Goo' day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said I; [...] "but {{put some}} {{corrosive}} sublimate on {{it just the}} same.

[...] "Kinney {{would never}} write it out, {{and if he}} did, I've put the {{material}} in better shape for him here than he could ever have given it. Six <b>weeks</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> nobody will remember a word of it; and he could tell the same things right over again, {{and they would be}} just as good as new." [...] He went on to argue the point.|$|E

"You {{will never}} see Jolnes," [...] I continued, [...] "until this murder has been forgotten, two or three <b>weeks</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> I had a better opinion of your shrewdness, Knight. During the three hours and a half that you waited he has got out of your ken.

6000|$|But {{let that}} pass. All day long, and every day, since I {{finished}} (in the rough) I have been diligently altering, amending, re-writing, cutting down. I finished finally today. Can't {{think of anything}} else in the way of an improvement. I thought I would stick to it while the interest was hot--and I am mighty glad I did. A <b>week</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> it will be frozen--then revising would be drudgery.

I'll wager even, sir, just a nominal bet of a pound of tobacco, that inside twenty-four hours we'll he hove to under upper-topsails.

I wouldn't touch a [...] dollar of another man's money now for a million. After I get [...] married I'm going to sell out and go West, where there won't [...] be so much danger of having old scores brought up against [...] me. I tell you, Billy, she's an angel.

Do, dear Mr. Somerset, since you find {{yourself}} condemned, for a week at least, to the society of a very interesting character, display some of that open favour, some of that interest in life’s obscurer sides, which stamp {{the character of the}} true artist.

"Squire Nigel," [...] {{said the}} Abbot, [...] "it was for you, who are, as all men know, of ancient lineage in this land, {{to give a}} fair example by which others should set their conduct. Instead of this, your manor house has ever been a center for the {{stirring}} up of strife, and now not content with your harsh showing toward us, the Cistercian monks of Waverley, you have even marked your contempt for the King's law, and through your servants have mishandled the person of his messenger. For such offenses it is {{in my power to}} call the spiritual terrors of the Church upon your head, and yet I would not be harsh with you, seeing that you are young, and that even last week you saved the life of a servant of the Abbey when in peril. Therefore, it is by temporal and carnal means that I will use my power to tame your overbold spirit, and to chasten that headstrong and violent humor which has caused such scandal in your dealings with our Abbey. Bread and water for six <b>weeks</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> to the Feast of Saint Benedict, with a daily exhortation from our chaplain, the pious Father Ambrose, may still avail to bend the stiff neck and to soften the hard heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR BROTHER,--.... Ward and I held a long consultation, Sunday morning, and {{the result}} was that we two have {{determined}} to start to Brazil, if possible, in six <b>weeks</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> in order to look carefully into matters there and report to Dr. Martin in time for him to follow on the first of March. We propose going via New York. Now, between you and I and the fence you must say nothing about this to Orion, for he thinks that Ward is to go clear through alone, and that I am to stop at New York or New Orleans until he reports. But that don't suit me. My confidence in human nature does not extend quite that far. I won't depend upon Ward's judgment, or anybody's else--I want to see with my own eyes, and form my own opinion. But you know what Orion is. When he gets a notion into his head, and more especially if it is an erroneous one, the Devil can't get it out again. So I know better than to combat his arguments long, but apparently yielded, inwardly determined to go clear through. Ma knows my determination, but even she counsels me to keep it from Orion. She says I can treat him as I did her when I started to St. Louis and went to New York--I can start to New York and go to South America! Although Orion talks grandly about furnishing me with fifty or a hundred dollars in six weeks, I could not depend upon him for ten dollars, so I have [...] "feelers" [...] out in several directions, and have already asked for a hundred dollars from one source (keep it to yourself.) I will lay on my oars for awhile, and see how the wind sets, when I may probably try to get more. Mrs. Creel is a great friend of mine, and has some influence with Ma and Orion, though I reckon they would not acknowledge it. I am going up there tomorrow, to press her into my service. I shall take care that Ma and Orion are plentifully supplied with South American books. They have Herndon's Report now. Ward and the Dr. and myself will hold a grand consultation tonight at the office. We have agreed that no more shall be admitted into our company.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} {{acknowledged}} that a durable life date is NOT {{an indicator of}} food safety. Once something is opened, depending on how it is stored, the shelf life can change.

6000|$|... "Madam Borne {{sent me to}} a swell {{house on}} Madison Avenue this morning, because all her women were engaged. I dressed the lady's hair in my best style, Major, and {{she said it was}} much more {{becoming}} than Juliette ever made it. Indeed, she wrote a note to Madam, asking her to send me, hereafter, instead of Juliette, and Madam patted my head and said I would be a credit to her, and my wages would be ten dollars a <b>week,</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> on. Ten dollars. Major! As much as you earn yourself at that miserable bookkeeping!" ...|$|R

All I got now is a Leyland boat that starts from Portland Saturday. Le's see; this is Wednesday. Thursday, Friday--you'll have to wait three days. Now you want me to fix you up, don't you?

Now, the Emperor Isaac of Cyprus is my friend, and over him Saladin has no power. Once in his court, you would be safe {{until such time as}} you found opportunity to return to England. This, then, is my plan--that you should escape from the ship at night as I can arrange." ...|$|R

It would be foolish to provoke this man to wrath too soon.

5000|$|First, 4 April Call options {{contracts}} with strikes nearest to current stock price (spot) are selected—they {{are used to}} calculate IV Index for April. [...] "IVX Call April" [...] is their weighted average, where weighting is by Vega (option price sensitivity {{to a change in}} implied volatility). Some of these options, however, can be considered [...] "bad" [...] and filtered out of further calculations. For example, options with expiry less than 1 <b>week</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> are always discarded. The other check is that so-called put-call parity relation should not vary significantly. This means that implied volatility values of Call and Put option in the pair are sufficiently close. Briefly, the filtering algorithm tries to eliminate suspicious option contract {{to make sure that the}} resulting IV Index figure is relevant.|$|R
5000|$|He kills {{many people}} who are on God's list (and some who are not) until he is asked to kill Marge. Homer does not want to kill his wife (or himself, an {{alternative}} he is given but quickly rejects), and pleads with God that he wants {{to get out of the}} job after leading Him to believe that he killed Marge. God agrees, but he finds that Homer tricked him by substituting Patty's body (which God initially mistakes for Selma's) for Marge's. The annoyed deity tries to punish Homer with a deadly sunbeam but gives up after a chase, proclaiming that he is [...] "too old and too rich". Marge thanks Homer by giving him extra pork chops. Homer then jokes that he will make sure to not kill Marge every <b>week</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> on.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2015, it was {{reported}} that Alexandre Desplat, who had worked with Edwards on the Godzilla reboot, would compose the score for Rogue One. Despite rumors that a contract had not been initially set in place by Lucasfilm, Desplat confirmed in an April 2016 interview that he would serve as composer for the film. Concerning the film, Desplat commented that [...] "and I had a great partnership on Godzilla, and I can't wait to be starting with him. It will be in a few <b>weeks</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> and it is very exciting and frightening at the same time because it's such a legendary project. To be called to come after John Williams... it's a great challenge for me." [...] However, in September 2016, it was announced that Michael Giacchino would be replacing Desplat as composer, after the film's reshoots altered the post-production schedule, and reportedly left Desplat no longer available.|$|E
5000|$|Lauren Hoffman from Vulture thought [...] "the {{performances}} {{themselves are}} pretty flat", but later commented [...] "it {{feels like a}} few short <b>weeks</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> even after we've said good-bye to these characters, they'll still exist on each other's couches, laughing and singing in a happy heap." [...] Christopher Rogers from Hollywood Life believed that [...] "Rachel found the mojo she was missing {{and used it to}} take charge of her life." [...] The A.V. Club's Brandon Nowalk stated in his review [...] "The episode sneaks up on you, until finally you realize this is the most energized anyone in the cast has been in years." [...] Miranda Wicker from TV Fanatic believed that [...] "Mercedes gave the final season the best subtitle it could possibly have when she noted that this, rehabilitating a defunct glee club, was a step on The Rachel Berry Rebuilding Project. That's really what this season has become, and hey, I don't mind." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Gladiator Maximus: [...] "Three <b>weeks</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> I will be {{harvesting}} my crops. Imagine {{where you}} will be, {{and it will be}} so. Hold the line! Stay with me! If you find yourself alone, riding in the green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled. For you are in Elysium, and you're already dead!" [...] Additionally, Maximus' description of his home in Hispania to Marcus Aurelius evokes Elysium, an idealic paradise on earth that Maximus calls home. It is these golden fields that Maximus imagines himself walking through {{at the start of the}} movie. When Maximus is dying in the Coliseum at the movie's end, he hallucinates a gate, which when pushed open reveals a giant poplar, inhabited by his deceased wife and son. When he finally dies, he is seen one last time walking through this field towards his family. This evocation of Elysium is evidently an intentional link made by Ridley Scottby basing Maximus' imagination of heaven on his description of home, he gives the concept of Elysium itself a tangible link to the real world.|$|E

I wrote and asked him, with a withering air of technicality, to have the roof repaired [...] "as per agreement," [...] and added, [...] "if not done in one <b>week</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> we shall be obliged to take proceedings." [...] I had not mentioned this high line of conduct to my mother at first, and so when old Pettigrew came down {{in a state of}} great agitation with my letter in his hand, she was almost equally agitated.|$|R
