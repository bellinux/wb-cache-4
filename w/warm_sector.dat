40|$|Statistical {{structure}} functions {{have been}} computed independently for nine satellite-derived mesoscale wind fields that were obtained {{on two different}} days. Small cumulus clouds were tracked at 5 min intervals, but since these clouds occurred primarily in the <b>warm</b> <b>sectors</b> of midlatitude cyclones the results cannot be considered representative of the circulations within cyclones in general. The field structure varied considerably with time and was especially affected if mesoscale features were observed. The wind fields on the 2 days studied were highly anisotropic with large gradients in structure occurring approximately normal to the mean flow. Structure function calculations for the combined set of satellite winds were used to estimate random error present in the fields. It is concluded for these data that the random error in vector winds derived from cumulus cloud tracking using high-frequency satellite data is less than 1. 75 m/s. Spatial correlation functions were also computed for the nine data sets.

5|$|Polar front {{theory is}} {{attributed}} to Jacob Bjerknes, and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the warm front. The trailing convergence zone {{was referred to as}} the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones. A conveyor belt, also referred to as the warm conveyor belt, is a term describing the flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within the <b>warm</b> <b>sector</b> (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface warm front.

40|$|AbstractThe {{large-scale}} {{structures that}} occur in turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection in a wide-aspect-ratio cylindrical domain are studied by means of direct numerical simulation. The simulation is performed in a 6. 3 aspect-ratio cylindrical cell with a Rayleigh number of 9. 6 × 107 and Prandtl number equal to 6. 7. Single-point and double-point statistics compare well against experimental results under nearly identical conditions. Large-scale thermal motions with coherence times exceeding 20 eddy-turnovers (∼ 600 free-fall time units) are seen in the instantaneous fields. Temporally filtering them by integrating over approximately one eddy-turnover time scale reveals a clear pattern consisting of seven discrete thermal structures: three <b>warm,</b> rising <b>sectors,</b> three cool, falling sectors and a single plume of warm, rising fluid that wanders around {{the center of the}} cylindrical cell. Smoothing over still longer times (10 and 20 eddy turn-over time scales) yields a clear hub-and-spoke pattern of <b>warm</b> and cool <b>sectors</b> in a dominantly 120 ° periodic pattern separated by concentrations of radial vortex lines (the spokes) plus a nearly circular plume {{at the center of the}} test section (the hub).

On the first formation, in correspondence to marly rocks, the new Lonicero etruscae-Cornetum sanguineae association, belonging to the edapho-hygrophilous meso and submediterranean pre-apennine series of the elm (Symphyto bulbosi-Ulmeto minoris sigmetum), develops.

25|$|By 1630 UTC, {{the large}} MCS began to {{splinter}} into two sections: {{the southern part}} slowed, lagging into southeast Tennessee, while the northern part accelerated, reaching Pennsylvania by 1930 UTC. The split was related to several factors, including a band of subsidence over eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia; local downslope winds over the Appalachians; and an inversion over the same area. These factors allowed {{the northern part of}} the MCS to accelerate due to efficient ducting, while the southern part slowed as the boundary layer warmed and moistened. Numerous surface-based supercells began to develop in the southern area, beginning with one that produced an F3 tornado at about 1630 UTC near Cleveland, Tennessee. Meanwhile, a new band of scattered thunderstorms developed at 1500 UTC over eastern Arkansas and Missouri; over the next four hours, this band became the focus for several intense supercells, starting in eastern Illinois and southern Indiana. In the wake of the MCS, backing low-level winds, rapid diurnal destabilization, and perhaps cool, mid-level advection had occurred over the <b>warm</b> <b>sector,</b> weakening the convective inhibition (CINH) layer, and favorable wind profiles bolstered helicity to over 230 m²/s²—a combination of factors conducive to tornadogenesis. Consequently, the storms increased in intensity and coverage as they moved into Illinois, Indiana, and northern Kentucky, producing several tornadoes, including the first F5 tornado of the day, at 1920 UTC, near Depauw, Indiana. Several of the storms to form between 1920 and 2020 UTC became significant, long-lived supercells, producing many strong or violent tornadoes, including three F5s at Depauw; Xenia, Ohio; and Brandenburg, Kentucky. These storms formed the second of three convective bands to generate tornadoes.|$|E

The ENSO-filtered coral delta O- 18 and Sr/Ca time series are well matched to each other (r= 0. 73) and to similarly filtered coral delta O- 18 records from Papua New Guinea (r 3 ̆e 0. 56). There is no long-term trend in the coral delta O- 18 record, but there is a long-term trend of increasing coral Sr/Ca from 1867 to 1997. This trend in coral Sr/Ca suggests a cooling of similar to 0. 7 degrees C, which is rather unlikely and implies that factors other than SST may be influencing the coral Sr/Ca record. The trend in coral Sr/Ca is not an analytical artifact, nor a product of time varying riverine input, nor a product of skeletal diagenesis, nor the results of kinetic effects, but may reflect surface-water variability in Sr/Ca. Despite the presence of a nonclimatic trend in coral Sr/Ca, the Rabaul coral records contain abundant interannual- to multidecadal-scale variability, much of which is coherent with other proxy records from the WPWP and with instrumental records of ENSO variability...|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{observations}} of low-level clouds have challenged {{the assumption that}} adiabatic liquid water content combined with constant physical thickness {{will lead to a}} negative cloud optics feedback in a decadal climate change. We explore the reasons for the satellite results using four years of surface remote sensing data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Cloud and Radiation Testbed site in the Southern Great Plains of the United States. We find that low cloud liquid water path is approximately invariant with temperature in winter but decreases strongly with temperature in summer, consistent with the satellite inferences at this latitude. This behavior occurs because liquid water content shows no detectable temperature dependence while cloud physical thickness decreases with warming. Thinning of clouds with warming is observed on seasonal, synoptic, and diurnal time scales; it is most obvious in the <b>warm</b> <b>sectors</b> of baroclinic waves. Although cloud top is observed to slightly descend with warming, the primary cause of thinning is the ascent of cloud base due to the reduction in surface relative humidity and the concomitant increase in the lifting condensation level of surface air. Low cloud liquid water path is not observed to be a continuous function of temperature. Rather, the behavior we observe is best explained as a transition in the frequency of occurrence of different boundary layer types: At cold temperatures, a mixture of stratified and convective boundary layers is observed, leading to a broad distribution of liquid water path values, while at warm temperatures, only convective boundary layers with small liquid water paths, some of them decoupled, are observed. Our results, combined with the earlier satellite inferences, imply that the commonly quoted 1. 50 C lower limit for the equilibrium global climate sensitivity to a doubling of CO 2, which is based on models with near-adiabatic liquid water behavior and constant physical thickness, should be revised upward...|$|R

Here, potential vorticity (PV) tracer diagnostics are used to investigate the representation of processes in the Met Office Unified Model (MetG:l 1). An exact budget of the PV tracers is derived and a "dynamics-tracer inconsistency" diagnostic implemented to quantify non-conservation of PV by the dynamical core which was not previously accounted for. It is shown that non-conservation of PV by the dy¬namical core can have comparable tendencies to the dominant physical processes implying that non-conservation of PV by a dynamical core can, and should, be quantified alongside PV modification by physical processes. Recent work {{has shown that the}} sharpness of the extratropical tropopause declines with lead time in KWP models. In the MetUM, the advection scheme is shown to result in an exponential decay of tropopause sharpness and non-conservative processes are shown to sharpen the tropopause. The systematic errors in tropopause-level PV are comparable to the tendencies associated with physical processes, suggesting that the systematic error in tropopause sharpness could be significantly rednced through realistic adjustments to the model physics. I' Turbulent mixing within the boundary layer has been previously shown to produce positive PV anomalies that can be advected into cyclones and reduce growth rates through an increase in static stability; however, it is unclear whether N models correctly represent this mechanism.

The SSTAs were investigated using daily data of ocean weather station &quot;C&quot; (52. 75 °N; 35. 5 °W) from 1 January 1976 to 31 December 1980 (1827 days). There were 47 positive and 50 negative significant SSTAs (lifetime longer than 3 days, absolute value greater than 0. 10 °C) with four main intervals of the lifetime repetitions: 1. 4 – 7 days (45 % of all cases), 2. 9 – 13 days (20 – 25 %), 3. 14 – 18 days (10 – 15 %), and 4. 21 – 30 days (10 – 15 %) and with a magnitude 1. 5 – 2. 0 °C. An upper layer balance model based on equations for temperature, salinity, mechanical energy (with advanced parametrization), state (density), and drift currents was used to simulate SSTA. The original method of modelling taking into account the mean observed temperature profiles proved to be very stable. The model SSTAs are in a good agreement with the observed amplitudes and phases of synoptic SSTAs during all 5 years. Surface heat flux anomalies are the main source of SSTAs. The influence of anomalous drift heat advection is about 30 – 50 % of the SSTA, and the influence of salinity anomalies is about 10 – 25 % and less. The influence of a large-scale ocean front was isolated only once in February-April 1978 during all 5 years. Synoptic SSTAs develop just in the upper half of the homogeneous layer at each winter. We suggest that there are two main causes of such active sublayer formation: 1. surface heat flux in the <b>warm</b> <b>sectors</b> of cyclones and 2. predominant heat transport by ocean currents from the south. All frequency functions of the ocean temperature synoptic response to heat and momentum surface fluxes are of integral character (red noise), though there is strong resonance with 20 -days period of wind-driven horizontal heat advection with mixed layer temperature; there are some other peculiarities on the time scales from 5. 5 to 13 days.

The open shortwave, likely somewhat negatively tilted, was continuing to approach from the northwest and an apparent outflow boundary moved {{just south of the}} warm front over northeastern Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee. Several weak pressure troughs were traversing the cool sector over the north-central US. Surface temperatures in the <b>warm</b> <b>sector</b> near the dryline and warm front ranged from [...] and the dew point was , with higher values farther south and increasing over time as the deepening low-pressure area continued to pull up Gulf air. This resulted in unstable air and lower cloud bases, or low LCL heights, which is favorable to tornadogenesis. From southeastern Kansas to Kentucky and Indiana, early morning showers and thunderstorms north of the low and warm front cooled and stabilized that air, retarding northward advancement of the front and led to sharp contrast in temperature from north to south. Such baroclinic zones are also associated with tornadic storms. Ahead of the surface dryline, which are not common as far east as the Mississippi River, an apparent [...] "dry punch" [...] of air aloft served to further increase instability. Concurrently, a capping inversion likely suppressed storms throughout the <b>warm</b> <b>sector</b> leaving the Tri-State supercell undisturbed by nearby convection.|$|E

The grid. The results provide values for the combined effects of mesoscale variability and communication noise on the individual SASS winds. These superobservations winds are then processed further to obtain estimates of synoptic scale vector winds stress fields, the horizontal divergence of the wind, the curl of the wind stress and the vertical velocity at 200 m above the sea surface, each with appropriate standard deviations of the estimates for each grid point value. They also explain the concentration of water vapor, liquid water and precipitation found {{by means of the}} SMMR Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer at fronts and occlusions in terms of strong warm, moist air advection in the <b>warm</b> air <b>sector</b> accompanied by convergence in the friction layer.

40|$|Links between {{trade and}} the {{environment}} have aroused considerable interest, {{both in terms of}} the impact of trade liberalisation on the environment, and also the impact of environmental policy on production and trade. A key environmental concern is global <b>warming.</b> The agricultural <b>sector</b> both contributes to, and will be affected by, climate change. Various mitigation strategies have been proposed for agriculture, including a limit on animal numbers, and restrictions on Nitrogen fertiliser application. The effects of these mitigation options on production, trade and emissions are analysed in this paper, using a partial equilibrium, agricultural multi-country, multi-commodity trade model, extended to include production systems and GHG emissions.

40|$|Agriculture {{operates}} in an uncertain environment. Yields, prices, and resource usage can change dramatically {{from year to}} year. However, most analyses of the agricultural sector, at least those using mathematical programming methods, assume decision making is based on average yields, ignoring yield variability. This study examines how explicit consideration of stochastic yield outcomes influence a sector analysis. We develop a model {{that can be used}} for stochastic sector analysis. We extend the risk framework developed by Hazell and others to incorporate discrete yield outcomes as well as consumption activities dependent upon yield outcomes. An empirical application addresses a comparison between sector analysis with and without considerations of the economic effects of yield variability in a global <b>warming</b> context.
