5|$|Although {{they all}} share the forest, {{relationships}} between different Clans are tense. They often come {{into conflict with}} one another, becoming aggressive if a cat from a neighboring Clan accidentally crosses a border. This rivalry can increase in times of deprivation, such as if one Clan is suffering from a shortage of prey but another is thriving. An attempt for one Clan to steal all of or part of another Clan's territory is not unusual. To prepare for this, cats in all Clans are taught battle moves {{in order to protect}} their territory. Each Clan has signature battle moves that are taught to them from an early age (6 months/moons old). Border fights are the most common source of battle (a cat intentionally or unwittingly steps into another Clan's territory), and are often short-lived and cause no real damage to either side. However, bigger and more brutal battles can occur; at this point, casualties are to be expected. Despite this rivalry, the Clans can also show concern for another's well being; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep distress, and will prompt urgent action on behalf of all four Clans. On the night of every full moon, the Clans <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>at</b> a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace. This is known as a 'Gathering', and is the only time in which fighting is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Ellen rides back to {{town and}} accosts Cort. During sex, they promise {{to help each other}} {{overcome}} Herod. Ellen directly challenges Herod but is sickened to hear that he has already accepted a fight against The Kid. Ellen and Cort are the only other fighters left and are ordered by Herod to face off. They both proclaim they won't fight each other, but Herod tells them he will have them gunned down by his men if they refuse. Herod takes The Kid aside and asks him to withdraw from the contest, telling him his time will come. The Kid refuses and they fight, with The Kid wounding Herod in the neck while Herod delivers a fatal bullet to The Kid who dies in Ellen's arms. Ellen and Cort then face each other, but both refuse to draw their weapons. Herod begins a countdown from ten, declaring that if neither draws by the time he gets to zero he will have them both killed. Cort begs Ellen to kill him but she still refuses. When Herod reaches one Cort draws and fires. Doc Wallace declares Ellen dead, and Cort angrily storms up to Herod and demands they fight immediately. Herod refuses, telling Cort they <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>at</b> dawn. Later that night, one of Herod's men, Ratsy, chains Cort to a table and beats him severely before smashing Cort's gunfighting hand and breaking it.|$|E

25|$|North of Fürth, the S-Bahn to Eltersdorf {{branches}} off {{the existing}} line. There, the existing line, the S-Bahn {{and the new}} line to Nuremberg freight yard <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>at</b> a grade-separated junction. Between Fürth Hbf and Eltersdorf, the line will therefore have two tracks, with a third track in Vach station. From Eltersdorf, the existing line towards Erlangen/Bamberg will be supplemented to its east with two more tracks that can be operated at up to 230km/h. The line between Großgründlach and Bamberg will also be upgraded to four-tracks. The Nuremberg S-Bahn and freight traffic would use the two middle tracks. The planned two tunnels of the extension would have a total length of eight kilometres and there would also be two new viaducts with a total length of 400metres.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{chip design}} process begins with {{system-level}} design and microarchitecture planning. Within IC design companies, management and often analytics will draft {{a proposal for}} a design team to start the design of a new chip to fit into an industry segment. Upper-level designers <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>at</b> this stage to decide how the chip will operate functionally. This step is where an IC's functionality and design are decided. IC designers will map out the functional requirements, verification testbenches, and testing methodologies for the whole project, and will then turn the preliminary design into a system-level specification that can be simulated with simple models using languages like C++ and MATLAB and emulation tools. For pure and new designs, the system design stage is where an Instruction set and operation is planned out, and in most chips existing instruction sets are modified for newer functionality. Design at this stage is often statements such as encodes in the MP3 format or implements IEEE floating-point arithmetic. At later stages in the design process, each of these innocent looking statements expands to hundreds of pages of textual documentation.|$|E

Bird tells Michael that they <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>at</b> his house, but when Michael gets there, Hawkins has killed Bird and tries to kill Michael. Hawkins, however, only manages to injure him. Hawkins calls in that Michael killed Bird and Captain Harper tells her precinct to use deadly force to bring Michael in, much to Detective Vega's surprise. Vega tries to tell Harper that, even deranged, Michael would never kill Bird, but Harper emotionally rebuts him, saying he is showing sympathy for a killer. This leaves Vega confused and suspicious. Michael manages to escape Hawkins, but passes out from his wound and wakes up back in the green reality.|$|E

2500|$|Clause 2 fixes {{an annual}} date upon which Congress must meet. By doing so, the Constitution {{empowers}} Congress to meet, {{whether or not}} the President called it into session. [...] does grant the president limited authority to convene and adjourn both Houses (or either of them) and mandates that it <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>at</b> least once in a year to enact legislation on behalf of the people. Some delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention believed yearly meetings were not necessary, for there would not be enough legislative business for Congress to deal with annually. Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts argued that the time should be fixed to prevent disputes from arising within the legislature, and to allow the states to adjust their elections to correspond with the fixed date. A fixed date also corresponded to the tradition in the states of having annual meetings. Finally, Gorham concluded that the legislative branch should be required to meet {{at least once a year}} to act as a check upon the executive department.|$|E
