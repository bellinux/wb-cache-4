This research uses the ten aspects of the big five personality model to determine a correlation between personality and employment preference.

40|$|Isla Palenque is a {{small island}} located on the western coast of Panama’s Chiriquí province.

This investigation aims for that more detailed understanding through a settlement study to elucidate aspects of the social complexity of this site. This nuance is extremely important in trying to understand this part of Central America that is characterized by much variability in the material culture.

Mandarin is based on the language of Beijing, has official status, and is the language of the dominant ethnicity, the Han. But it’s by no means the first language of the rural poor in China’s vast and less-developed western and southern provinces.

40|$|Homosexuality – is {{that your}} sex or your gender? That is the main problem in this project. In the poststructuralistic perspective, {{there has been a}} lot of talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{distinction}} between sex as a biological way of defining a man or a woman and gender as a social way of defining a man from a woman and vice versa. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> homosexual <b>people</b> who feel like neither? What gender are they? I have analyzed that homosexuality is a gender and not a sex. It is socially constructed and only distinctive through the social discourses and not through the biological differences in our anatomy. It is only through the actions that we perform our identity and by that, our gender. This is called gender performativity, and it is through this that people are defined as being homosexual. This is analyzed in an episode of the American television series “Will & Grace” and in a promotional picture from the same series. The two have a lot of discourses in common and can exist without the other, though they make more sense together. And by analyzing the episode of “Will & Grace”, I have found that the episode show the homosexual as the funny man as well as the “normal” human being. The positions that the subjects take in the series, are the same positions that they are seen to have in the picture...|$|R
