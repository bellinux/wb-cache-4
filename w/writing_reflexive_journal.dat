40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{understand}} and document how sex workers in a community in Kalighat, India communicate about health and HIV/AIDS. Sex worker voices have been largely erased from mainstream HIV/AIDS discourse, which has sought to instruct them and persuade them about increased condom use and regular HIV screenings. This study aims to question the absence of sex worker voices in the dominant HIV/AIDS discourse by locating how sex workers inscribe cultural understandings {{at the core of}} their HIV/AIDS-related practices. The culture-centered approach to health communication provides the theoretical lens and the methodological framework for this study because it calls for a recalibration of mainstream health discourse in terms of culture, structure, and the enactment of participant agency. I conducted an eight-week field study in the Kalighat sex worker community, over which I engaged in 46 face-to-face interviews and <b>wrote</b> <b>reflexive</b> <b>journal</b> entries and field notes. I learnt that communication on HIV/AIDS in the Kalighat sex worker community is navigated around an autonomous consciousness. This autonomous rationality is locally constituted and is enacted through an engagement with local cultural meanings, availability of healthful structures, and through contested communication modalities of resistance, assimilation, and restructuring of the dominant discourse. Key to this fractured HIV/AIDS discourse is New Light (a NGO) and a community participatory effort it initiates and partakes in. It is through an understanding of this local participatory discourse that my study contributes, in several meaningful ways, to research and praxis on HIV/AIDS communication in sex worker spaces. ...|$|R

Culture Centered Approach (CCA) (Airhihenbuwa, 1995, Dutta, 2008) foregrounds equity and social justice as sine qua non for addressing disparities. It promotes engagement of cultural members as equal partners in social change processes, a move that reverses the unequal power that characterize dominant projects (Dutta, 2008). Seeped in the theoretical framework of CCA, I conducted 11 -month ethnographic study to uncover the communicative and processes of engaging teenagers as equal partners in the planning and implementing of a heart campaign targeting their peers. I conducted face-to-face interviews, <b>wrote</b> <b>reflexive</b> <b>journal</b> entries, and participated in message tailoring workshops. Through these multiple data sets, I uncovered the following (a) the infusion of cultural voices reverses the unequal power that characterize dominant projects (b) engaging communities as equal partners is a complex process and often characterized by tensions that border on power inequities (c) a culture centered project evolves through organic process that is often characterized by dialogue and collective decision making (d) participation in culture centered process is complex and also characterized by tensions about power, individual versus collective subjectivities (e) Reflexivity is a crucial methodological tool in culture centered process. The findings corroborate culture centered stance on rupturing structural barriers as an entry point to addressing disparities and creating a just world. From programming perspective, this study echo the need for ‘recalibrating’ health projects from below. ...|$|R

This paper develops some observations made after teaching practice activities, performed by students on the third year who are preparing to become teachers. We started from the premise that the <b>reflexive</b> <b>journal</b> can be a tool to evaluate the activity of these students. The <b>reflexive</b> <b>journal</b> was completed by students during on the three months of pedagogical practice. In this journal the students have passed pedagogical experiences, feelings, opinions, knowledge and skills obtained in the schools of application. The <b>reflexive</b> <b>journal</b> has become a dialogue of student carried with himself in learning about their own mental processes. The centralization of data collected has demonstrated that the students were interested in following problems: expressing feelings concerning to teaching in general; specifying efforts individuals lodged for self-regulation of learning (by examining the attitudes of dedication and attention focused towards overcoming a learning task); mentioning how to do controlling the actions performed to accomplish learning tasks (by analyzing planning, methodological demarches solving the task and results); expressing how to do controlling the knowledge obtained (by analysis of similar notions, the shortcomings registered and their causes);Of course, were students who did not complete journal with seriousness and responsibility. The cause may be the lack of usual of students to reflect on their work. Therefore, the main condition of success is the presentation of importance journal to their professional training, especially the habit of students to regularly reflecting in writing on their work. Our conclusions recommend the using of this tool, as a means of stimulating interest in the teaching profession, also as a way for individual training in this profession.

It described the patterns of motivation and learning styles of former State 4 -H Council members, {{as well as the}} demonstration of leadership life skills. This study also described the leadership experiences of former State 4 -H Council members after their council year concludes. The researcher used a purposive sampling technique to identify former members of the Texas State 4 -H Council who were willing to discuss their experiences. A snowball sampling technique was used in which the members of the first group identified the remainder of the sample. There were fifteen individuals interviewed. Traditional qualitative research methodologies were used to collect and triangulate data. These methods included interviews, participant observation, and document analysis. The researcher used documented methods of dependability (dependability audit and <b>reflexive</b> <b>journaling),</b> transferability (thick description, purposive sample, and <b>reflexive</b> <b>journaling),</b> confirmability (confirmability audit and the <b>reflexive</b> <b>journal),</b> and credibility (persistent observation, triangulation, peer debriefing, member checking, and <b>reflexive</b> <b>journaling)</b> to establish trustworthiness. The major findings of the study were as follows: 1) State 4 -H Council members tend to be extrinsically motivated individuals that follow self-determining pattern of motivational needs including the needs for a sense of competence, inter-relatedness, and autonomy; 2) Eight of the State 4 -H Council members demonstrated a mix of social learning theory and experiential learning theory during the years of preparation prior to attaining their State 4 -H Council positions; 3) State 4 -H Council members demonstrated a command of the seven leadership life skill categories; and 4) The transfer of skills and knowledge by State 4 -H Council members is affected both positively and negatively by the elements of training transfer. Recommendations include implementation of a needs assessment to determine training content and greater experiential training opportunities. The addition of personality types, gender and sensitivity training, and positive conflict resolution should be added to training agendas. State 4 -H Council members should be afforded greater decision-making power, beyond that of deciding themes for state events...|$|R

Students who fail to succeed early in their studies are less likely to be retained, and students in the online environment are more likely to fail than their campus counterparts. Motivational techniques have been shown to support course retention and success, but studies of online motivational course support methods are limited. Some evidence exists that motivational messages can affect student performance in online courses, but the message format that is most effective has yet to be definitively established. A survey research design was employed and quantitative and qualitative data were collected to determine how motivational messages and message type affect student performance and retention in an introductory online community college course. The population consisted of students in three sections of an introductory online IT course. The data included student course grades, final course scores, responses to three surveys, and the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s <b>reflexive</b> <b>journal</b> of motivational message design decisions made throughout the course. Due to low course participation levels and low survey return rates, only the descriptive data were reported. Additional exploration of the literature to explain low participation was sought.

40|$|This is a {{collection}} of texts that speak of experiences of the education of one woman, me. I have learned more of who I am. This autoethnography seeks to ground personal experiences in social and cultural contexts. I seek to tell truthfully and deeply of personal experiences. I draw upon others‟ voices to legitimate mine. The words of others facilitate my own. I come to realise that I do belong in this work; the work takes form and from this I take form. I find a home in this work. This work is an educational experience. Stories of emotions founder education. Reflective and <b>reflexive</b> <b>journal</b> <b>writing</b> have been stimuli.

Research was conducted with a community of patients who frequent the most renowned public hospital of Bangladesh. Being socially marginalized, the voices of this community are primarily absent from the dominant discourses on health, health care, and health policy development. Theoretically and methodologically grounded in the culture-centered approach to health communication, this research focused on foregrounding {{the voices of the}} community participants by listening to their narratives and stories of their experiences. The culture-centered approach was chosen as the theoretical lens for this study. Over a period of two months, I conducted 34 in-depth interviews, and wrote field notes and <b>reflexive</b> <b>journal</b> entries. The study revealed a complex construction of health by the community participants, a constant interaction between structural/economic barriers and participant agency, and reflexivity as the core to transformative change. ^ The understanding of these localized participatory discourses assist in this study 2 ̆ 7 s contributions to theory, research, and praxis on the localized needs of this marginalized community. ...|$|R
