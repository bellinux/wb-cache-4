5|$|Many feminist economists argue {{economics}} {{should be}} focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) {{and more on}} <b>well-being,</b> a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment and social status. They argue that economic success {{can not be measured}} only by goods or gross domestic product, but must also be measured by human <b>well-being.</b> Aggregate income is not sufficient to evaluate general <b>well-being,</b> because individual entitlements and needs must also be considered, leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.|$|E

5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} {{teaches that}} Christians {{are entitled to}} <b>well-being</b> and, because physical and spiritual realities are seen as one inseparable reality, this is interpreted as physical health and economic prosperity.|$|E
5|$|The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) was {{introduced}} in 1995 in the Human Development Report written by the United Nations Development Program in order to add a gender-sensitive dimension to the Human Development Index. The GDI takes into account not only the average or general level of <b>well-being</b> and wealth within a given country, but also how this wealth and <b>well-being</b> is distributed between different groups within society, especially between genders. However, feminist economists do not universally agree {{on the use of}} the GDI and some offer improvements to it.|$|E

25|$|The {{relative}} {{influence of}} wealth {{together with other}} material components on overall subjective <b>well-being</b> of a person is being studied through new researches. The <b>Well-being</b> Project at Human Science Lab investigates how material <b>well-being</b> and perceptual <b>well-being</b> works as relative determinants in conditioning our mind for positive emotions.|$|E
25|$|Generally, the <b>well-being</b> {{of those}} who are {{employed}} is higher than those who are unemployed. Employment itself may not increase subjective <b>well-being,</b> but facilitates activities that do (such as supporting a family, philanthropy, and education). While work does increase <b>well-being</b> through providing income, income level is not as indicative of subjective <b>well-being</b> as other benefits related to employment. Feelings of autonomy and mastery, found in higher levels in the employed than unemployed, are stronger predictors of subjective <b>well-being</b> than wealth.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{retirement}} on subjective <b>well-being</b> {{vary depending on}} personal and cultural factors. Subjective <b>well-being</b> can remain stable for those who retire from work voluntarily, but declines {{for those who are}} involuntarily retired. In countries with an average social norm to work, the <b>well-being</b> of men increases after retirement, and the <b>well-being</b> of retired women is at the same level as women who are homemakers or work outside the home. In countries with a strong social norm to work, retirement negatively impacts the <b>well-being</b> of men and women.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{economists have}} said that <b>well-being</b> is a simple {{function}} of income. However, {{it has been found}} that once wealth reaches a subsistence level, its effectiveness as a generator of <b>well-being</b> is greatly diminished. Happiness economists hope to change the way governments view <b>well-being</b> and how to most effectively govern and allocate resources given this paradox.|$|E

25|$|Nature {{connectedness}} {{is related}} to subjective <b>well-being</b> and other indicators of positive functioning such as solving a problem in one's life. Subjective <b>well-being</b> is defined as feeling pleasant emotions or having pleasant experiences. To assess <b>well-being,</b> participants complete measures of how often they feel positive emotions (an affective measure), how often they feel negative emotions (an affective measure), and how satisfied they are with their lives (a cognitive measure). Individuals {{with higher levels of}} <b>well-being</b> typically indicate that they are satisfied with their lives, feel more positive emotions, and less negative emotions.|$|E
25|$|In psychology, {{happiness}} is a mental or emotional state of <b>well-being</b> {{which can be}} defined by, among others, positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy. Happy mental states may reflect judgements by a person about their overall <b>well-being.</b>|$|E
25|$|Finally, even subtle nature {{manipulations}} {{can increase}} <b>well-being</b> or other indicators of <b>well-being.</b> For instance, simply having plants {{in a lab}} can increase intrinsic aspirations, decrease extrinsic aspirations, and encourage more generous decision making. These effects were also mediated by nature connectedness and autonomy. Also, virtual nature {{has been found to}} provide some psychological benefits (but not as much as real nature). These studies demonstrate the positive relationship between nature exposure, feeling connected to nature, and subjective <b>well-being.</b>|$|E
25|$|DeNeve (1999) {{argued that}} there are three trends in the {{relationship}} between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies (emotional stability, positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. trust, affiliation) are important for subjective <b>well-being.</b> Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for subjective <b>well-being.</b> Appraising events in an optimistic fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective <b>well-being.</b> Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective <b>well-being.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of domains that are thought to {{contribute}} to subjective <b>well-being.</b> In a study by Hribernik and Mussap (2010), leisure satisfaction was found to predict unique variance in life satisfaction, supporting its inclusion as a distinct life domain contributing to subjective <b>well-being.</b> Additionally, relationship status interacted with age group and gender on differences in leisure satisfaction. The relationship between leisure satisfaction and life satisfaction, however, was reduced when considering the impact of core affect (underlying mood state). This suggests that leisure satisfaction may primarily be influenced by an individual's subjective <b>well-being</b> level as represented by core affect. This has implications for possible limitations in the extent to which leisure satisfaction may be improved beyond pre-existing levels of <b>well-being</b> and mood in individuals.|$|E
25|$|These {{arguments}} {{have prompted}} some {{to suggest that}} animals' <b>well-being</b> should enter a social welfare function directly, not just indirectly via its effect only on human <b>well-being.</b> In one survey of United States homeowners, 68% {{of respondents said they}} actually consider the price of meat a more important issue.|$|E

25|$|Human complexities, like {{reason and}} cognition, can produce <b>well-being</b> or happiness, but such form is limited and transitory. In {{temporal}} life, {{the contemplation of}} God, the infinitely Beautiful, is the supreme delight of the will. Beatitudo, or perfect happiness, as complete <b>well-being,</b> is to be attained not in this life, but the next.|$|E
25|$|Occupation has a {{positive}} effect on health and <b>well-being.</b>|$|E
25|$|Employment status {{effects are}} not {{confined}} to the individual. Being unemployed can have detrimental effects on a spouse's subjective <b>well-being,</b> compared to being employed or not working (and not looking for work). Partner life satisfaction is inversely related to the number of hours their partner is underemployed. When both partners are underemployed, the life-satisfaction of men is more greatly diminished than women. However, just being in a relationship reduces the impact unemployment has on the subjective <b>well-being</b> of an individual. On a broad scale, high rates of unemployment negatively affect the subjective <b>well-being</b> of the employed.|$|E
25|$|The {{construct}} of nature connectedness is {{also related to}} a branch of psychology called ecopsychology. This branch seeks to examine how human <b>well-being</b> {{is related to the}} <b>well-being</b> of the natural environment. This theory is {{based on the idea that}} the needs of humans and nature are interdependent so human health will suffer if nature does as well.|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} {{longitudinal}} {{studies found that}} measures of baseline subjective <b>well-being</b> constructs such as optimism and positive affect predicted longer-term health status and mortality. Conversely, {{a number of studies}} found that baseline depression predicted poorer longer-term health status and mortality. Baseline health may well have a causal influence on subjective <b>well-being</b> so causality is difficult to establish.|$|E
25|$|According to the Gallup-Healthways <b>Well-Being</b> Index, Maryland ranks sixth nationally, and is {{the highest}} ranked state in the eastern United States.

25|$|A {{number of}} studies have found that SWB {{constructs}} are strongly associated with a range of personality traits, including those in the five factor model. Findings from numerous personality studies show that genetics account for 20-48% of the variance in Five-Factor Model and the variance in subjective <b>well-being</b> is also heritable. Specifically, neuroticism predicts poorer subjective <b>well-being</b> whilst extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience tend to predict higher subjective <b>well-being.</b> A meta-analysis found that neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were significantly related to all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect.|$|E
