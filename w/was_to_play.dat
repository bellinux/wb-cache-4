5|$|Born in the New South Wales bush town of Cobar on 8 December 1914, Toshack {{was one of}} five {{children}} born to a stationmaster.

At this time, Toshack's ambition <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> rugby league for Australia. One of his childhood friends, Edgar Newham, also played both sports and wanted to play Test cricket. However, the town's doctor, a local community leader, advised that they were targeting the wrong sport, and the two boys followed his recommendation. Newham later played rugby league for Australia.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} of the insurgency, the MNLA had largely split into small groups of guerrillas, which existed by basing {{themselves}} in a chosen rural area, subverting local villagers and accumulating from them manpower and supplies. The lot of any security forces posted nearby <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a constant game of hide-and-seek with the communists, whereby the army would indefinitely search for and destroy any base camps and food caches the MNLA set up. The Commonwealth leaders surmised that the MNLA could not possibly resist such a campaign forever, and would, in time, simply give up attempting to regroup.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, Jean Cocteau, who greatly {{admired the}} film, insisted on Tiefland being {{shown at the}} Cannes Film Festival, which he was running that year. In 1960, Riefenstahl {{attempted}} to prevent filmmaker Erwin Leiser from juxtaposing scenes from Triumph des Willens with footage from concentration camps in his film Mein Kampf. Riefenstahl had high hopes for a collaboration with Cocteau called Friedrich und Voltaire ("Friedrich and Voltaire"), wherein Cocteau <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> two roles. They thought the film might symbolize the love-hate relationship between Germany and France. Cocteau's illness and 1963 death {{put an end to}} the project.

Difficulties in drawing spectators led the Mariners to schedule matches in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons away from Central Coast Stadium, at North Sydney Oval and Brookvale Oval. The club's goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> closer to its fan base in north Sydney, which majority owner Michael Charlesworth estimated to be about 20% of its total supporters. Following attendances at North Sydney Oval that {{were similar to those}} at Central Coast Stadium, Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop suggested in December 2014 that it would be unlikely that the club would be permitted to continue playing in north Sydney.|$|E

Kring admitted that the virus being released <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go into a different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they {{wanted to make sure that}} they tied up all the loose ends.|$|E

5|$|As at Orsogna, the 18th Armoured Regiment <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a {{supporting}} role in the forthcoming attack on Cassino, with the infantry of the 5th and 6th Brigades bearing {{the brunt of the}} battle. When the attack began on 15 March, the regiment was initially held as a reserve, ready to exploit any breakthrough by the infantry but this did not eventuate. The infantry struggled to make progress in the face of determined resistance. The regiment's tanks were first used at Cassino as artillery support for two weeks, each squadron being rotated in three-day stints to a position overlooking the town. Then in mid-April, one squadron was detached to remain on the Cassino front while the other two squadrons were withdrawn for training. The regiment remained fragmented into May, for once training was completed, another squadron was detached and sent into Cassino itself to man tanks which had been effectively set up as pillboxes.|$|E
5|$|As at Orsogna, the 20th Armoured Regiment <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a {{supporting}} role in the forthcoming Cassino attack, with the infantry of the 5th and 6th Brigades bearing {{the brunt of the}} battle. When the attack began on 15 March, the regiment was initially held as a reserve, ready to exploit any breakthrough by the infantry but this did not eventuate. The infantry struggled to make progress in the face of determined resistance. Over the next week, some of the squadrons of the regiment became involved in small scale raid actions. On 24 March, the regiment moved into the area of Cassino controlled by the New Zealand infantry, and essentially became mobile pillboxes. The tanks were vulnerable to artillery and German patrols and the troops of the various squadrons of the regiment were rotated {{in and out of the}} town in two day shifts. While the New Zealand infantry had been relieved by the Guards Brigade in the early April, the 20th Armoured Regiment stayed in the line until the end of the month.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier's first {{role with}} Basel <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the Uhrencup as they {{defeated}} German-side FC Köln 2–1, {{to share the}} trophy with Zürich. Basel had finished the previous season as runners-up in the league to Zürich on goal difference and so qualified for the following season's UEFA Cup. Burgmeier made his Basel debut in the competition as they defeated Kazakhstan's Tobol 3–1 on 13 July, before he was replaced by Scott Chipperfield. The second leg ended in a draw, sending Basel through. The second qualifying round draw gave Burgmeier a chance to return to Vaduz. He was a substitute in both games as his new team won on away goals. They went on {{to qualify for the}} group stages, in which they finished bottom of their division, with two points from four games. Burgmeier scored his first goal for his new club in a 4–2 away defeat against Sion, but again the side only ranked in the Championship behind Zürich, this time by one point. Their disappointment was offset by an extra time victory over Luzern in the final of the Swiss Cup.|$|E
