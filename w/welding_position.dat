40|$|Abstract. Detecting the <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> is the {{precondition}} of {{seam tracking}} during an arc welding process, and {{is crucial to}} achieve high-quality welds. Visual sensing {{is one of the}} most attractive approaches to detect the <b>weld</b> <b>position,</b> which provides valuable information to control the arc following the expected path. The weld edge is main characteristics of the <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> image, here the visual technique for detecting the <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> based on Hough transformation is proposed. The <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> can be detected and recognized through Hough transformation, while the weld edge image is detected using the Canny operators. And Hough transformation is modified based on the actual weld situation. Therefore, the precision of the weld detection can be improved. From the analysis of experiments, it has been proved that the proposed method can detect the width and the center of the weld, and is suitable for the seam tracking system based on the computer vision...|$|R

For components with complex shapes, the <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> needs be continuously adjusted during laser welding, which makes it necessary to know {{the effects of the}} <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> {{on the quality of the}} laser welds. In this paper, the weld quality under two (flat and horizontal) welding positions were studied comparatively in the laser welding of Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy, in terms of weld profiles, process porosity, and static tensile strengths. Results show that the flat <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> led to better weld profiles, less process porosity than that of the horizontal <b>welding</b> <b>position,</b> which resulted from the different actions of gravity on the molten weld metals and the different escape routes for pores under different welding positions. Although undercuts showed no association with the fracture positions and tensile strengths of the welds, too much porosity in horizontal laser welds led to significant decreases in the strengths and specific elongations of welds. Higher laser powers and travel speeds were recommended, for both flat and horizontal welding positions, to reduce weld porosity and improve mechanical properties...|$|E

40|$|To obtain {{satisfactory}} welds in positional {{laser beam}} welding, {{it is necessary}} to know how process parameters will influence the quality of welds in different welding positions. In this study, the titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V sheets were laser welded in two vertical welding positions (vertical up and vertical down), and the appearance, porosity, strength, and ductility of the laser joints were evaluated. Results show that undercuts of the vertical up welds were greater than that of vertical down welds, while the porosity contents were much higher in vertical down welds than that in vertical up welds. When welding with a higher heat input, the vertical up <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> resulted in poor weld profiles (undercuts and burn-through holes), whereas the vertical down <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> led to excessive porosity contents in welds. Both severe undercut and excessive porosity were detrimental to the tensile properties of the welds. Weld appearance was improved and porosity contents were reduced by using a lower heat input, achieving better weld quality. Therefore, it is suggested that process parameter settings with relatively high laser powers and welding speeds, which can result in lower heat inputs, are used when laser welding the Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloys vertically...|$|E
40|$|In most {{laser welding}} {{applications}} the welding result is highly {{sensitive to the}} <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> and the initial determination of process parameters requires time-consuming adjustments to be made. In case of manufacturing individual parts with low quantities {{this is a significant}} cost driver. State-of-the-art CAD/CAM based manufacturing systems ease the creation of welding contours significantly but position deviations resulting, e. g., from workpiece tolerances or misplacements must still be compensated. Seam tracking systems are rather complicated to handle during process qualification as they require adjustment to a start position and are subject to be misguided by disturbances in the material. Besides, it is difficult to apply seam tracking to scanner-based micro welding operations. Therefore, we developed a system that enables the user to <b>position</b> <b>welds</b> easily and accurately by marking the intended <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> in a calibrated live-image of the workpiece, which is us ed as reference. Thereby, positioning errors are compensated.
