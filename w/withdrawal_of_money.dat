500|$|The {{financial}} operations made in dollars {{were subject to}} a strong currency substitution to pesos, the [...] "pesification". There were disputes over the exchange rate of such substitution, as the current price of the dollar in the open market would force most firms and individual debtor to bankruptcy. The initial policy was to make 1 to 1 substitutions to the operations below 100,000 dollars. Another conflict was the corralito, imposed by De la Rúa, which attempted to stop the bank run by forbidding the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> from bank accounts. Duhalde promised in his oath of office speech that [...] "The one who deposited dollars will receive dollars". The minister of economy Jorge Remes Lenicov pointed out {{that that would be}} impossible, as the amount of dollars required was higher than even the foreign-exchange reserves of the Central Bank. Duhalde acknowledged two weeks later that he was mistaken. The bank accounts in dollars would be [...] "pesified" [...] at a 1.4 exchange rate, and the state financed the banks for the different rates with other operations. The taxes of public services were [...] "pesified" [...] and fixed at their current values. Most industries benefited from the [...] "pesification" [...] and the devaluation, as they could now export at higher prices, and the economy started to improve. The jump in the international price of soybean in July 2002 also proved highly beneficial. The devaluation also increased the price of imported products, which allowed import substitution industrialization. As the local prices became cheap in dollars, international tourism to the country was increased. The national state absorbed the debts of the provinces and the bonds used as alternative currency, on the condition that they transferred the power to issue bonds.|$|E

40|$|Economists {{believe that}} money supply or money stock {{relates to the}} total amount of money {{available}} in an economy at a particular point in time either exogenously determined by the Central bank or endogenously determined by changes in the economic activities, which affects people’s desire to hold currency relative to deposits or rate of interest. Therefore, what role or impact does the injection and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> stock into the economy has on the economic growth performance in Nigeria and what are the trends of such contribution to the Nigerian economy. This paper in providing solution to the above question therefore uses the ordinary least square method of simple regression models to analyze the effect of the injection and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> stock on real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as examining the transmission channel of the relationship between growth and money stock index covering the period of 1970 to 2008. In conclusion, observation of the theoretical and empirical analysis indicates that, injection of money stock into the economy tends to reduce interest rate thereby increasing investment. The study therefore recommends that the Central Bank of Nigeria needs to develop a strategic plan to deal with failing banks as well as deals with monetary policy in a more transparent manner so as to address the issues of expectations as inflation exhibits a high degree of inertia...|$|E

The charging fee for providing service is not only happening in Bangladesh, other similar service providers such as M-PESA—one the successful mobile money service providers based in Kenya—also charged a fee during the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> (Jack and Suri 2011). Some of the respondents were confused about mobile money charge rates and stated that this varies geographically. In some instances, agents ask for extra charge. One of the potential solutions in regard to this issue is that regular (at least monthly) in-person/on-site visit with the agents by the mobile money service provider. Taking example from the M-PESA, the service provider is in full control even to their agents as it eventually helped to built good relation and gain trust from their agents and as well as the consumers (Mas and Morawczynski 2009; Ngugu and Pelowski 2010). We noted that the service charges could be the main barrier to the use of mobile money. Some respondents pointed out that they would support the traditional cash system, if they find that mobile money costs them extra money.

Among some of those challenges include the need for a mobile money transfer service that allows transfer of money across all mobile service providers, provide a link to a customer’s other electronic sources of money and also allow the user to push money to a group of people with a single transaction. Nexcash is proposed as a platform that allows for the transfer of funds across various network service providers efficiently and effectively using a mobile phone. It provides a link between the user’s mobile accounts to other electronic sources of money that they have, particularly banks. It also allows batch sending of money. Among some of the functionalities it has include: sending of money to either an individual or a group, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> from Nexcash accounts, deposit of money to Nexcash account, transfer of money to user’s different accounts. Nexcash runs on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks. The user interacts with the application using their mobile phones, to which transaction menus are forwarded by the application depending on some key-word that the user sends to the application. Nexcash brings in four new benefits into the money transfer solutions industries.

The study incorporates questionnaire 5 Likert scale format which distributed to 350 EPF contributors within the Klang Valley region of which 174 were filled and returned. It is consistent with Roscoe (1975) who suggests to have a sample sizes of larger than 30 and less than 500 to minimize committing Type II errors. Klang Valley was chosen due to availability of significant white collar workers which displays a significant presence of middle and high income families which associates with private sector workers since they are the main contributors’ for EPF. All variables display meaningful relationship with each other but {{as shown in the}} regression analysis, the main variable that really influences one’s attitude towards the hajj withdrawal scheme is the perceived convenience of the program itself. The contradictory issue in this study is on the permission of hajj registration itself; whereby the permission is only for registration and not to the extent of withdrawal the money for the hajj except if the contributor has reached the age of 55. In other word, the authors view it as a non holistic approach. The findings are useful for the EPF to enhance its initiative by allowing physical <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> from the account 1 once the depositor gets the hajj call-up even though the person has not meet the age of 55. The limitation of the study can arise from the demographic influence pertinent to other areas in the country.
