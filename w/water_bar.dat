500|$|Stationed on {{the border}} with France, Bär {{achieved}} his first victory—a Curtiss P-36 Hawk—on 25 September 1939 during the Phoney War air skirmishes with the Armée de l'Air (French air force), earning him the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 27 September 1939. During the Battle of France, he was credited with two more aerial victories before adding a further 10 during the Battle of Britain. During this time, he had several emergency landings in badly damaged aircraft and was shot down over the English Channel on 2 September 1940 by a Spitfire. Bär was summoned to appear before Hermann Göring and report on this battle. When Göring asked him what he was thinking about while in the <b>water,</b> <b>Bär</b> immediately replied, [...] "Your speech, Herr Reichsmarschall, in which you said that England is no longer an island!", alluding to an address that Göring had made before the German fighter pilots. Incidents like this are testimony to his often blatant disregard for higher authority. His outspokenness frequently landed him in trouble with Göring. In early 1941, he was credited with an additional four aerial victories against the Royal Air Force (RAF), bringing his total to 17.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>water</b> <b>bar</b> or {{interceptor}} dyke is a {{road construction}} feature {{that is used}} to prevent erosion on sloping roads, cleared paths through woodland (for utility companies such as electricity pylons), or other accessways by reducing flow length. It is a diagonal channel across the road that diverts surface water (that would otherwise flow down the whole length of the road) off the road and into a stable drain way. By constructing a series of water bars at intervals along a road, the volume of water flowing down the road is reduced. Without water bars, flooding, washouts, and accelerated road degradation can occur.|$|E

50|$|Ever {{since their}} first {{collaboration}} in 2004, Coachella Music + Arts Festival {{has been a}} platform for Global Inheritance to highlight environmental issues. Innovative and interactive experiences like TRASHed: Art of Recycling and Carpoolchella {{were among the first}} programs designed to trigger a major reaction from the festival’s audience and raise awareness on sustainability issues inherent to major events. Thanks to their long-term commitment to each other, Global Inheritance and Coachella Music + Arts Festival have implemented new initiatives almost every year to continue to raise awareness among more and more festival attendees, reduce the festival’s carbon footprint, and offer entertaining and educational activities for everyone. Featured programs include Portal Potties (2016), Energy FACTory Museum (2007, 2008), 18 & Up (2009) Energy FACTory DJ Mixer (2010, 2011), Recyclosaurus Rex (2012), Oasis <b>Water</b> <b>Bar</b> (2013), Saving Nature Solar Arcade (2014), Poltar the Great (2015), Polar Bear Dating Game (2016), and the Saving Nature Claw Machine (2017).|$|E

50|$|Global Inheritance {{worked with}} Coachella in 2013 to {{introduce}} a program dedicated to bringing awareness to the complexities, issues, and significance of drinking water. This Oasis <b>Water</b> <b>Bar</b> {{provides an opportunity for}} festival-goers to learn about the future of drinking water and the potential of fourteen different H2O sources. The Oasis presents its visitors with a refreshing perspective on the future of drinking water by offering shot glasses full of water from several varying sources. The Oasis has its very own bartenders/scientists that are experts in water conservation and ready to offer festival-goers a better understanding of their own water consumption. As shots are poured by the bartenders/scientists, patrons of the bar also hear the back-story of each water type such as where it originated from, how far it traveled to get to the festival grounds, the types of filtration methods used to purify it, and more. Festival-goers can learn what they might be drinking five years, twenty years or fifty years in the future and what needs to happen to preserve certain sources. Visitors to the Oasis taste waters like Purified Wastewater, Desalinated Pacific Ocean Water, Los Angeles Tap Water, Glacier Water, Oregon Rainwater, Hot Spring Water, and more.|$|E

40|$|Increasing energy demand, {{coupled with}} the recent {{emphasis}} on domestic production, has resulted {{in an increase in}} natural gas exploration and pipeline construction in the central Appalachian region. Very {{little is known about the}} effects of natural gas pipeline construction on sediment production. The goals of this project were to measure erosion and examine the effects of vegetation and precipitation characteristics on erosion on a newly constructed pipeline in the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia. The study explored whether seed rate, slope class, or aspect, influenced erosion. The cross country pipeline was buried beneath the surface on study hillslopes ranging from 30 - 68 % and beneath a less steep segment with slopes ranging from 18 - 26 %. A mixture of native herbaceous-plant seeds and straw mulch were applied following construction. Two different seeding rates were applied to compare vegetative recovery and to determine if increasing the seed rate would decrease erosion. A 1 -time seed rate, or the normal Forest Service application rate, and a 3 -time seed rate (1 -time + twice that rate) were tested. Two aspects (northwest-facing and southeast-facing) and four precipitation variables (30 -minute maximum intensity, duration, total rainfall amount, and time since last event) were defined. Sediment concentrations were compared for differences between two slopes, two seed rates, and two aspect classes. Precipitation variables were analyzed to identify those that could explain significant amounts of the variability in erosion from the pipeline. The 1 -time seed rate sections produced less sediment than the 3 -time seed rate sections, but this was probably more a function of subsurface flow differences associated with the sections seeded with the lighter rate and the <b>water</b> <b>bar</b> construction. Precipitation intensity explained the most variability in erosion. Study sites with gentler slopes produced less sediment than the steeper sections, as expected. As vegetation became established, sediment concentrations decreased for all study sections and reached low and relatively constant levels by approximately the end of August 2009...|$|E
