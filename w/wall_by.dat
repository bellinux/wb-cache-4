5|$|Operation Grange {{was led by}} Commander Simon Foy. Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard's Homicide and Serious Crime Command was {{the first}} senior {{investigating}} officer, reporting to Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell. The team consisted of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables, and around six civilian staff. When Redwood retired in 2014, he was replaced by DCI Nicola <b>Wall.</b> <b>By</b> July 2013 the review had become an investigation.|$|E
5|$|The current {{building}} {{was constructed in}} the 15th century {{on the site of}} a wooden building dating from the 12th century. In the 16th century a new facade was added to the original building. It is possible that the stonework and window of the front wall were removed from the abbot's lodgings behind the great kitchen of the Abbey as similar features can be identified in a 1712 engraving, and it is known that the {{building was}} ruined and without its front <b>wall</b> <b>by</b> 1723.|$|E
5|$|The garden's {{features}} include a Palladian architecture bridge (one of {{only four of}} this design left in the world), Gothic temple, gravel cabinet, Mrs Allen's Grotto, the ice house, lodge and three pools with curtain walls {{as well as a}} serpentine lake. The curtain <b>wall</b> <b>by</b> the lake is known as the Sham Bridge and is similar to Kent's Cascade at Chiswick House and Vunus Vale at Rousham House. Ralph Allen was also responsible for the construction of Sham Castle on a hill overlooking Bath.|$|E

5|$|Elara's archers, {{shooting}} from the walls, inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers, while soldiers {{on top of}} the walls prevented any attempt to breach the <b>wall</b> <b>by</b> puring down molten metal on them. The elephant Kandula, attempting to break the southern gate, was injured in such an attack. After tending to his injuries and protecting him using thick animal hides, Dutthagamani encouraged Kandula and drove him against the wall. The wall was breached and Dutthagamani's army entered the city. The ten champions, unwilling to enter through an opening made by another, destroyed the wall themselves in different places and broke into the city. Led by them, Dutthagamani's army destroyed the defenders and took control of the fortress city of Vijithapura. The survivors retreated to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|From the 3rd century are {{the first}} records of {{a small number of}} regular units bearing the names of barbarian tribes (as opposed to peregrini tribal names). These were foederati (allied troops under a {{military}} obligation to Rome) converted into regular units, a trend that was to accelerate in the 4th century. The ala I Sarmatarum, based in Britain, was probably composed of some of the 5,500 captured Sarmatian horsemen sent to garrison Hadrian's <b>Wall</b> <b>by</b> emperor Marcus Aurelius in c. 175. There is no evidence of irregular barbarian units becoming part of the regular army of the Principate until the 3rd century.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} years, Larwood withdrew his claims that Bradman had been frightened of him, and {{acknowledged}} his Australian foe {{as the greatest}} batsman of all time. He was gradually losing his sight, although he retained his alertness, and on his 90th birthday was able to join {{in a game of}} garden cricket with his great-grandchildren. He died in hospital on 22 July 1995, following a brief illness, in his 91st year. He was cremated, and his ashes placed in a memorial wall at Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Kingsford. A plaque with a simple inscription was placed on the <b>wall</b> <b>by</b> his daughters. His wife Lois died in 2001, and her ashes were placed alongside his.|$|E

5|$|Most Jews, {{religious}} and secular, consider {{the wall to}} be important to the Jewish people since it was originally built to hold the Second Temple. They consider the capture of the <b>wall</b> <b>by</b> Israel in 1967 as a historic event since it restored Jewish access to the site after a 19-year gap. There are, however, some haredi Jews who hold different views. Most notable are the adherents of the Satmar hasidic dynasty who retain the views espoused by their Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, who would not approach the Wall after the 1967 conquest because of his opposition to Zionism, although he did visit the site during his visits to the Holy Land in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game {{in which}} the player controls the player character Ryu Hayabusa as he investigates the events behind Irene Lew's death. In the game, Ryu can jump, hang, and climb up and down walls with the control pad; pressing the jump button while holding the control pad the direction {{away from the wall}} causes Ryu to spring off the wall. Ryu is also able to attack enemies with secondary weapons while on a <b>wall</b> <b>by</b> pressing the attack button. A new feature introduced in Ninja GaidenIII is the ability for Ryu to hang overhead from pipes or ivy; he can swing up on top or drop from them, and as with walls, he can only attack enemies while hanging with secondary weapons.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{achieved}} international {{success with}} the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The <b>Wall.</b> <b>By</b> the early 1980s, they {{had become one of}} the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in the history of popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years passed before he performed with them again.|$|E

5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single <b>wall</b> <b>by</b> springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.|$|E
5|$|The rain {{continued}} {{throughout the}} second session, so most teams concentrated on their wet weather setups {{in preparation for}} a wet race. About halfway through the session the No. 7 Peugeot in the hands of Marc Gen√© missed the turn at Arnage and hit a tire barrier. The car was unable to return to the pits and was taken behind the <b>wall</b> <b>by</b> the marshals. This was soon followed by the No. 73 Luc Alphand Corvette missing the same turn as well, but it continued on without significant damage. The No. 70 PSI Corvette had a minor accident in the last five minutes of the session, bringing out the only red flag of the day and ending all of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} embrasured watchtower {{constructed in}} 1378, {{was destroyed by}} fire in 1926 {{during the civil war}} of 1926, and was restored in September 2014. This was done after a careful historical review of documents related to the historical features that existed before it was damaged. The other three watchtowers forming the northern, eastern and western gates of the wall were also examined during the planning phase of the modifications done for the South Tower. They were modified, without affecting the integrity of the <b>wall,</b> <b>by</b> an encompassing hall offering protection to the structures by using steel, wood work and the ancient-type tiles and bricks structure. Major gates have ramp access except the South Gate which has entry outside the walls.|$|E

5|$|The {{stone was}} venerated at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic pagan times. According to Islamic tradition, {{it was set}} intact into the Kaaba's <b>wall</b> <b>by</b> the prophet Muhammad in the year 605 AD, five years before his first revelation. Since then it has been broken {{into a number of}} {{fragments}} and is now cemented into a silver frame {{in the side of the}} Kaaba. Its physical appearance is that of a fragmented dark rock, polished smooth by the hands of pilgrims. Islamic tradition holds that it fell from heaven as a guide for Adam and Eve to build an altar. It has often been described as a meteorite, a hypothesis which is now uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The work of Thirty Seconds to Mars {{generated}} {{the interest of}} record producer Bob Ezrin, who had previously worked on several groundbreaking projects, including The <b>Wall</b> <b>by</b> Pink Floyd, Love It to Death by Alice Cooper, and Destroyer by Kiss. Thirty Seconds to Mars contacted Ezrin because they {{felt that he had}} the ability to help them achieve their own vision and create a distinct sound; moreover, the band's members grew up listing to his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper. Brian Virtue, who had previously worked with Jane's Addiction, joined the band and Ezrin in producing the record.|$|E

Andrew and Samantha escape, but none of the guards survive. Continuing on, they discover the bodies of dead travellers and bond at the top of an ancient pyramid in sight of the US border <b>wall.</b> <b>By</b> the time they reach the border, the creatures have crossed into the United States. Andrew and Samantha travel through a severely damaged, evacuated town in Texas, find an abandoned gas station with power and call the army for help.|$|E

5|$|Two events {{affected}} me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school <b>wall</b> <b>by</b> writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school.

5|$|With {{the spiders}} distracted, Finn and Jake {{try to escape}} from the web, but to no avail. Ed later returns with a flaming sword, which he {{presents}} to Barb. However, she gets angry, arguing that he picked the gift because he liked, not because she would like it. Angered, Ed cuts the web, releasing Finn and Jake; he claims that Barb is dependent on him for food, as she cannot spin her own webs due to some unknown dysfunction. Barb attacks Ed, noting that she will have to eat him instead. Finn tries to help, but is pinned to a <b>wall</b> <b>by</b> Barb, who suddenly beings to moan as if in pain. Just then, an enormous egg sack emerges from her epigyne. The sack bursts, giving birth to thousands of tiny spiders, who proceed to bury Finn and Jake.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell {{felt the}} best way to compete against imitators was to create better products, leading Atari to produce sequels in the years followings the original's release: Pong Doubles, Super Pong, Ultra Pong, Quadrapong, and Pin-Pong. The sequels feature similar graphics, but include new {{gameplay}} elements; for example, Pong Doubles allows four players to compete in pairs, while Quadrapong‚Äîalso released by Kee Games as Elimination‚Äîhas them compete against each other in a four way field. Bushnell also conceptualized a free-to-play version of Pong to entertain children in a Doctor's office. He initially titled it Snoopy Pong and fashioned the cabinet after Snoopy's doghouse with the character on top, but retitled it to Puppy Pong and altered Snoopy to a generic dog to avoid legal action. Bushnell later used the game in his chain of Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants. In 1976, Atari released Breakout, a single-player variation of Pong where the object of the game is to remove bricks from a <b>wall</b> <b>by</b> hitting them with a ball. Like Pong, Breakout was followed by numerous clones that copied the gameplay, such as Arkanoid, Alleyway, and Break 'Em All.|$|E
