From tongue lashings to catfights, underhanded tricks to boldface lies, the characters <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> hate have each brought a fair share of great moments to primetime soaps. While Larry Hagman played the bad guy on Dallas, Donna Mills played bad girl on its spin-off, Knots Landing. Unapologetically going after what she wanted, Mills' character engaged in affairs with two of the husbands on the Knots Landing cul-de-sac. But, like most vixens on primetime soaps, she was only out for money, not love." [...] Steve Eighinger of the Quincy Newspapers listed Abby as the third-most memorable TV character in an article he wrote for the Quincy Herald-Whig.

As her character developed, life on the cul-de-sac made Knots Landing destination TV every Thursday night for more than a decade." ...|$|E

No points for current wife Rebecca, ten for naming Lynn, Gail, or Christina Alessi, and 1,400 points for remembering first wife, plumber Terry [...] Yes, Paul's been around the block." [...] They also branded him as the reason Neighbours, in their opinion was good viewing in the 2000s adding: [...] "It's his cackling soap villain role that <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> hate him for: his return in 2004, torching Lassiter's and befriending Dylan, marked the start of Neighbours getting awesome in the mid-noughties. Although it's probably {{safe to say that}} period was over by the time he suffered amnesia of everything after 1989." [...] He has also been branded as a [...] "legend character". Entertainment reporting website Last Broadcast praised Paul's development, stating: [...] "As the kind of shady character who'd do anything to make a fast buck, he even planned to bulldoze Ramsay Street {{to make way for a}} new supermarket development. And that's not all: fraud, blackmail, murder; there is no level to which Paul wouldn't have sunk. Yet, the infamous bad boy of Erinsborough, has, thankfully, turned over a new leaf." ...|$|E
