ABSTRACT: The study {{was carried out in}} three communities namely, Pekyi, Kokpong and Cheyohi in the Tolon Kumbungu District (TKD) to assess the growth performance of lambs kept under the traditional system of production. The parameters studied were birth weight, pre-weaning weight gain, ewe weight at birth, and pre-weaning ewe weight. Data was collected from 26 animals (14 lambs and 12 ewes) and analysed using anova, regression and graphs. The study lasted 12 weeks. Lambs had a mean birth weight of 1. 6 kg, pre-weaning average <b>weekly</b> <b>gain</b> was 742 g and pre-weaning mean weight at 12 weeks was 10. 7 kg. Mean birth weight (1. 5 kg), mean pre-weaning <b>weekly</b> <b>gain</b> (730 g) and mean pre-weaning weight at 12 weeks (10. 2 kg) of male lambs were lower than those of females which were 1. 9 kg, 770 g and 11. 2 kg respectively. Also single born male lambs had significantly higher birth weight (1. 7 kg), pre-weaning average <b>weekly</b> <b>gain</b> (773 g) and pre-weaning weight at 12 weeks (11. 1 kg) than female lambs which were 1. 4 kg, 620 g and 9. 3 kg respectively.

30|$|Without {{comparing}} their gain {{relative to}} that of native-born workers, the total <b>weekly</b> <b>gain</b> for immigrants holding a medical degree amounts to 6.8  % of the total weekly wage bill. The comparative gain, on the other hand, is 585, 000 dollars, which is 4  % of the weekly wage bill. Since the improvement in matching for immigrants {{would be much better}} among medical degree holders than for others, the comparative gain is twice as much as the average of 2  % shown in Table  6. Although similar calculations can be done for different groups of workers to ascertain differential underutilization costs, the observed magnitude of the cost would likely be smaller. This is because jobs requiring medical degrees would likely be ones that display the highest degree of occupational distinctiveness among regulated or self-regulated professions. It is interesting to see that while medical degree holders (13, 360) account for only 2  % of all immigrant workers (661, 675), their comparative weekly wage gain (30.4 million dollars) makes up more than 6  % of the total weekly wage gain of all immigrant workers (537 million dollars).|$|E

Two hundred and forty (240) unsexed Hubbard day old broiler chicks were fed iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous maize-soyabean diets (3, 000 cal/kg and 22 % crude protein) for four weeks. There were eight treatment groups, T 1 -T 8, each replicated three times. T 1 had no methionine, T 2 had 3 % methionine, T 3 had 3 % sodium sulphate, T 4 had 3 % sodium sulphite, T 5 had 1. 5 % methionine and 1. 5 % sodium sulphate, T 6 had 1. 5 % methionine and 1. 5 % sodium sulphate T 7 had 1. 5 % methionine and 1. 5 % sodium sulphite while T 8 had 1. 5 % methionine and 1 % sodium sulphite. Chicks in T 6 had the highest average <b>weekly</b> weight <b>gain</b> of 106. 58 g while birds in T 8 had the lowest average <b>weekly</b> weight <b>gain</b> (79. 94 g).

40|$|Background: Weight {{restoration}} is {{a crucial}} element in the treat-ment of patients with anorexia nervosa. Therefore, the validity of different methods for measuring body composition is important. Objective: We tested the concurrent validity of hydrodensitome-try (underwater weighing) and anthropometry (12 skinfold thick-nesses) and assessed body composition and subcutaneous fat before and after a refeeding program and a multifaceted program of therapy in a specialized inpatient unit for eating disorders. Design: The body composition of a large sample of anorexia ner-vosa patients (97 restricting type, 33 binging-purging type) was studied by using 2 methods {{both before and after}} weight gain. We applied a behavioral contract for weight restoration with a minimum <b>weekly</b> <b>gain</b> of 700 g and a maximum of 3 kg. Bland-Altman analysis of agreement, Pearson correlation analysis, t tests, and analysis of covariance were used. Results: There was good agreement between the results obtained by underwater weighing and by skinfold-thickness measurement (r = 0. 76, P < 0. 001); the results produced by the 2 methods did not differ significantly. On average, a significant weight gain (11. 9 kg) was observed, composed of 6. 6 kg fat and 5. 3 kg fat-free mass. Conclusions: Body fat estimation by skinfold-thickness equa-tion appeared to be as accurate as underwater weighing. The refeeding program led to a significant increase in body weight, of which 55. 5 % was body fat. The mean ratio of fat-free mass to fat mass {{at the end of the}} treatment was 3. 4 : 1.

Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} pre-pregnancy body mass index(BMI),as well as maternal weight gain during pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. Methods Black pregnant volunteers (n = 94) visiting the Potchefstroom Clinic were followed-up during pregnancy. A regression {{analysis was used to}} estimate the mother's pre-pregnancy weight for those whose first visit was during the second trimester of pregnancy. Weight gain between visits was used to calculate <b>weekly</b> weight <b>gain.</b> Partial correlation coefficients were calculated for the association between pre-pregnancy BMI, as well as <b>weekly</b> weight <b>gain</b> and birth weight, length and head circumference of the baby, with adjustment for smoking and HIV status. Results and discussion Participants were categorized into three groups: Pre-pregnancy BMI 26. In reference to the Institute of Medicine's recommendations for weight gain, it was found that most of the women tended to gain too much weight. Overweight women tended to have a higher blood pressure during pregnancy. Significant positive correlations were found between age and parity, age and Pre-pregnancy BMI and household income and baby's birth weight. For women with a BMI 26 positive correlations between household income and baby's head circumference and <b>weekly</b> weight <b>gain</b> and age were found. In the total group no significant correlations were found between <b>weekly</b> weight <b>gain</b> or mother's pre-pregnancy BMI and the baby's weight, height or head circumference. Conclusion Pregnant women tended to gain too much weight. Overweight women are more prone to a higher blood pressure and other health risks, therefore the importance of weight monitoring of pregnant women must be emphasized. Master...|$|R

We studied 1233 mothers who delivered single term newborns: 144 IUGR-birth weight less than one 10 th percentile for sex and gestational age and 1119 controls-birth weight between the 10 th and the 90 th percentile. Maternal anthropometric factors (height, weight before and at the end of pregnancy, total and weekly weight gain and body mass index) were stratified according to quartiles of distribution in the studied population. Unconditional multiple logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR), adjusting each anthropometric parameter for non nutritional confounders (parity, smoking, gestational illness and history of low birth weight) and the effect of prepregnancy weight or weight gain. Mothers of IUGR cases showed significantly lower mean values of pre and end pregnancy weight, body mass index and total or weekly weight gain. Compared to the reference category (first quartile) women in upper quartiles of total or weekly weight gain, or end pregnancy weight showed significantly lower risks. For a total weight gain of 10 - 11 kg an OR of 0. 43 was found, and that for a <b>weekly</b> <b>gain</b> of 238 - 297 g was 0. 35. An end pregnancy weight between 63 and 68 kg had an OR or 0. 45. However, compared to the second no evident benefit was found for the third or fourth quartiles of weight gains, where an increased risk of macrosomia can be anticipated. These results indicate that attitudes during prenatal care towards adequate weight gains may further reduce the risk of IUGR and the associated morbidity and mortality.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{cannibalism}} in communally reared crabs can be eliminated by separating the growing crabs into holding compartments. There is currently no information on optimal compartment size for growing crabs individually. 136 second instar crablets (Portunus sanguinolentus) (C 2 ca. 7 - 10 mm carapace width (CW)) were grown for 90 days in 10 different-sized opaque and transparent walled acrylic compartments. The base area for each compartment ranged from small (32 mm × 32 mm) to large (176 mm × 176 mm). Effects of holding space and wall transparency on survival, CW, moult increment, intermoult period and average <b>weekly</b> <b>gain</b> (AWG) were examined. Most crabs reached instars C 9 -C 10 (50 - 70 mm CW) {{by the end}} of experiment. The final survival rate in the smallest compartment was 25 % mainly due to moult-related mortality predominantly occurring at the C 9 instar. However, crabs in these smaller compartments had earlier produced significantly larger moult increments from instar to instar than those in the larger compartments (P < 0. 05). Crabs in the smaller compartments (< 65 mm × 65 mm) also showed significantly longer moult periods (P < 0. 05). The net result was that AWG in CW was 5. 22 mm week- 1 for the largest compartment and 5. 15 mm week- 1 in smallest and did not differ significantly between compartment size groups (P = 0. 916). Wall transparency had no impact on survival (P = 0. 530) but a slight impact on AWG (P = 0. 014). Survival rate was the best indicator of minimum acceptable compartment size (? 43 mm × 43 mm) for C 10 crablets because below this size death occurred before growth rate was significantly affected.

30|$|The {{number of}} workers in Table  6 is taken from Table 9 in the Appendix, while the total weekly wage bill for the native born and {{immigrants}} {{is the product of}} the {{number of workers}} and average weekly wages in each of the five classifications of the NRI. The <b>weekly</b> <b>gain</b> from a move to the highest level of relatedness (the 0.8 – 1 range of NRI) is given in the third and sixth rows of the table by the estimated coefficients of Eq. (1) reported in Table  5, for internationally educated immigrants and the native born, respectively. The total weekly WG is then the product of these coefficients and the total weekly wage bill for immigrants and native-born workers. The ratio of the TWB terms serves the role of an adjustment rate for the native born and makes both WGs comparable. Since this adjustment rate, which works out to 9.35  % (as shown in Table  5), removes from the WGs differences in average wages and labor market sizes, the difference between WGs in (2) shows the wage gain of immigrant workers had their occupational matching improved to what native-born workers experience in labor markets. The calculations in Table  6 show that, when the occupational match of immigrants is measured relative to that of native-born workers, the total weekly wage gain that immigrants would experience amounts to no more than 2  % of the total weekly wage bill (10.3 / 554.9), implying that the wage gain of 8.8  % calculated earlier using conventional methods largely overestimates the true underutilization cost. The important point is that, regardless of whether we use a narrower or broader NRI classification than the five-category classification reported in this paper, the cost associated with immigrants’ occupational mismatch should be calculated in relative terms when immigrants have the same occupational distribution as native-born workers. That this would entail a smaller cost of underutilization is also evident from the fact that our estimate of the annual cost of underutilization of about 540 million dollars is substantially smaller than that suggested by Reitz (2001), as well as the 5 billion dollars cost estimated by the Conference Board of Canada (2001).|$|E

The effects were evaluated by measuring the growth performances, health indices, immunity responses and antioxidant enzyme activity and finally validated by comparing the marron performance results with other currently employed probiotics under outdoor commercial marron farm environment. Various marron sizes, mean initial weights of 3. 6; 40 and 76 g, were used and reared inder laboratory conditions in the plastic cylindrical tanks with filtration, aeration; automatic heater and PVC pipes for shelter. The marron were fed at a rate of 3 % of body weight every second day. Uneaten food and faeces were siphoned out before the next feeding and sufficient freshwater was added to maintain 70 L of water in every tank. During each experiment, water parameter such as temperature, pH, nitrate, nitrite and ammonia levels were measured once a week. To evaluate the effects of Sel-Plex® supplementation, growth and physiology parameters such as, initial and final weight; carapace and total length; specific growth rate (SGR); daily weight gain (DWG); average <b>weekly</b> <b>gain</b> (AWG); relative growth rate (RGR) and organosomatic indices were used as a tool to evaluate of OS supplementation on the marron‘s growth and health performance. Meanwhile, immune parameters such as total and differential haemocyte count (THC and DHC); neutral red dye retention time (NRRT); lysosomal membrane integrity and bacteraemia were also used as an indicator of the health of marron fed OS. Besides growth, physiological and immune indices, the health of digestive tract such as histology of midgut and hepatopancreas; condition of microvilli; amylase and protease activity of marron fed OS were assessed {{to examine the effects of}} OS supplementation. As selenium (Se) can be retained in the various tissues and influence on antioxidant enzymes activity, total Se retention in the hepatopancreas and muscle were determined in the backdrop of antioxidant enzyme activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and lipid peroxidase (LPO) measurements. Sel-Plex® supplementation of 0. 1 - 0. 3 g kg- 1 showed improvements in survival, physiological and immunological responses in the marron. The optimum level of Sel-Plex® supplementation was found at 0. 2 g kg- 1 of feed which improved the survival, health and immune status of the cultured marron. Dietary inclusion of Sel-Plex® also enhanced the health of the digestive system as shown by a healthier midgut and hepatopancreatic condition in term of the number of microvilli and structural improvements, respectively. In addition, marron fed 0. 2 g kg- 1 of Sel-Plex® also improved the digestive enzyme activity and increased resistance ability of marron against Vibrio mimicus infections. Further, dietary 0. 2 g kg- 1 Sel-Plex® in the diet showed higher antioxidant enzymatic activity and improved lysosomal membrane integrity, reduced LPO and higher total soluble Se retention in the muscle of marron compared to inorganic form of Se and mannan oligosaccharide (MOS). Higher levels of dietary Sel-Plex®, however, led to increased stress in the cultured marron. The LC 50 - 96 h of Sel-Plex® was calculated at 166. 28 g L- 1, indicating that natural presence of OS in the water is not harmful to marron. The trial in commercial ponds found that pond-water temperature was significantly higher than the temperature under laboratory conditions resulting in higher growth performances. Further, THC and total soluble Se retention in the muscle of the marron fed any supplement were higher than in marron fed the control diet under outdoor commercial environment. The pond-reared marron fed OS had significantly higher SGR and total Se retention in the muscle tissues but lower THC than laboratory-reared marron. The DHC of marron fed OS did not show significantly difference (P> 0. 05) between pond-reared marron and laboratory-reared marron. The present research concludes that Sel-Plex® as a source of OS can be used as a dietary supplement to improve growth and health of marron. 0. 2 g kg- 1 of Sel-Plex® which approximately equates to 0. 4 mg kg- 1 OS is suggested to be added in the basal diet in order to attain the optimum benefit of OS...|$|E

METODOLOGIA: Neste estudo, avaliou-se a influência de fatores sociodemográficos, história gestacional, tabagismo, trabalho fora de casa e estado nutricional inicial sobre o ganho ponderal excessivo (GPE). O GPE foi estimado a partir das. recomendações do IOM (ganho semanal > 0, 58 g, > 0, 53 g e > 0, 39 g, correspondentes a estado de nutricional no início da gestação: desnutrida, adequada e sobrepeso/obesidade, respectivamente). Estudou-se uma coorte de 141 gestantes saudáveis, inscritas em serviço público de pré-natal, entre março de 1997 e março de 1998. A influência dos fatores de estudo sobre o GPE foi testada separadamente no 2 º e 3 º trimestres mediante análise de regressão de Poisson múltipla hierarquizada. RESULTADOS: Dentre as 237 elegíveis houve 37, 8 % de perdas, não se detectando diferenças estatisticamente significativas para as variáveis centrais do estudo. A incidência de GPE no 2 º trimestre foi de 38, 6 % (IC 95 % 30, 5 - 47, 2) e no 3 º trimestre foi de 36, 4 % (IC 95 % 28, 5 - 45, 0). No 2 º trimestre, apenas a escolaridade mostrou-se associada ao GPE. Em relação às mulheres com menos de 5 anos de escolaridade, as gestantes com 5 a 8 anos e acima de 8 anos de escolaridade apresentaram riscos relativos correspondentes a 2, 09 (IC 95 % 1, 03 - 4, 25) e 2, 62 (IC 95 % 1, 32 - 5, 22), respectivamente. No 3 º trimestre mostraram significância estatística as variáveis: escolaridade > 8 anos (RR= 1, 91 [IC 95 % 1, 22 - 2, 97], ausência de companheiro (RR= 1, 66 [(IC 95 % 1, 06 - 2, 59], primiparidade (RR= 2, 13 [IC 95 % 1, 20 - 3, 85] e estado nutricional inicial adequado e sobrepeso/obesidade (RR= 1, 53 [IC 95 % 0, 82 _ 2, 84] e RR= 2, 02 [IC 95 % 1, 04 - 3, 92], respectivamente) em relação às desnutridas. CONCLUSÃO: Em função da elevada freqüência de GPE, particularmente em mulheres de escolaridade mais alta, as sem companheiro, as primíparas e aquelas com estado nutricional inicial adequado ou sobrepeso/obesidade durante a gestação, mais atenção deveria ser dada à prevenção e ao controle do problema durante o pré-natal. INTRODUCTION: Excessive {{weight gain}} during {{pregnancy}} tends {{to result in}} postpartum weight retention and contributes to obesity in women. METHODS: This study evaluated the influence of socio-economic factors, obstetric history, smoking, having a job, and initial nutritional status on excessive weight gain (EWG). EWG was estimated according to IOM recommendations (<b>weekly</b> <b>gain</b> > 0. 58 g, > 0. 53 g and > 0. 39 g which correspond to an initial nutritional status of underweight, eutrophic, overweight/obesity, respectively). We studied a cohort of 141 healthy pregnant women enrolled in public health services, between March 1997 and March 1998. The influence of each study variable on EWG was checked separately for the 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters using the Poisson model for hierarchy multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Amongst the 237 eligible pregnant women, there were 37. 8 % of patient losses, but no statistical significance was detected for the main study variables. The incidence of EWG during the 2 nd trimester was 38. 6 % (CI 95 % 30. 5 - 47. 2) and during 3 rd trimester it was 36. 4 % (CI 95 % 28. 5 - 45. 0). During the 2 nd trimester only schooling was associated with EWG. When comparing women who studied less than 5 years, with the ones who studied 5 to 8 years and those with more than 8 years of schooling, relative risks were 2. 09 (CI 95 % 1. 03 - 4. 25) and 2. 62 (CI 95 % 1. 32 - 5. 22), respectively. In the 3 rd trimester the variables that resulted in statistical significance were: less than 8 years of schooling (RR= 1. 91 [CI 95 % 1. 22 - 2. 97], living without a partner (RR= 1. 66 [(CI 95 % 1. 06 - 2. 59], primiparas (RR= 2. 13 [CI 95 % 1. 20 - 3. 85]; adequate initial nutritional status and overweight/obesity (RR= 1. 53 [CI 95 % 0. 82 - 2. 84] and RR= 2. 02 [IC 95 % 1. 04 - 3. 92], respectively) in comparison {{to those who were}} underweight. CONCLUSION: Based on the high incidence of EWG, more attention should be given during antenatal care, particularly in women with more schooling, those living without partner, primiparas and those who have an initial adequate nutritional status or overweight/obesity during pregnancy, in order to prevent and control the problem...|$|E

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} {{to determine the effect}} of Telfairia occidentalis and Cnidoscolus acornitifolius on the growth of African giant land snails (Archachatina marginata). A total of thirty six (36) juvenile snails were used for the feeding trials which covered a period of eight weeks. There were four treatments which were replicated thrice with each replicate having three snails. The control experiment, treatments 2, 3, and 4 were designed with 0 %, 15 % of Telfairia occidentalis, 15 % of Cnidoscolus acornitifolius and mixture of 7. 5 % Telfairia occidentalis and 7. 5 % of Cnidoscolus acornitifolius respectively. Weight gain, feed intake, feed efficiency, shell length and shell circumferences were part of the parameters assessed. There were significant differences in average <b>weekly</b> weight <b>gain,</b> feed intake, final weight gain as well as dressing weight. Snails in treatment 2 with 15 % of Telfairia occidentalis had the highest average <b>weekly</b> weight <b>gain</b> of (6. 20 g), while treatment 3 had the lowest (3. 80 g).

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} a postnatal weight-gain algorithm (WINROP) to identify sight-threatening retinopathy of prematurity (ROP type 1) in a nation-based extremely preterm infant cohort. Methods: This study enrolled all 707 live-born extremely preterm (gestational age [GA] < 27 weeks) infants, born 2004 – 2007 in Sweden; the Extremely preterm Infants in Sweden Study (EXPRESS). WINROP analysis was performed retrospectively in 407 of the infants using <b>weekly</b> weight <b>gain</b> to assess the preterm infant’s risk of developing ROP type 1 requiring treatment. GA, birthweight (BW), and weekly postnatal weight measurements were entered into WINROP. WINROP signals with an alarm to indicate if the preterm infant is at risk for ROP type 1. Results: In this extremely preterm population, WINROP correctly identified 96 % (45 / 47) of the infants who required treatment for ROP type 1. The median time from alarm to treatment was 9 weeks (range, 4 – 20 weeks).

40|$|Summary- Seven {{hundred and}} two squabs (young pigeons) from 144 pairs of Silver King x White King cross parents were reared by either their genetic or foster parents. Heritabilities were {{estimated}} for body weight at hatch, 3 d, 1 wk, 2 wk, 3 wk and 4 wk (market age) {{of age and}} the values were 0. 70, 0. 23, 0. 22, 0. 21, 0. 30 and 0. 57, respectively. Genetic correlations among these body weight traits ranged from 0. 26 to 0. 82. Heritability estimates for <b>weekly</b> <b>gains</b> were 0. 13, 0. 00, 0. 12 and 0. 05. These estimates indicated that simultaneous genetic improvement of body weight at the different ages would be feasible. Production efficiency could be increased through selection to improve wk 3 body weight so that squabs could be marketed a week earlier than the current practice. pigeon / heritability / genetic correlations / body weight / weight gain Résumé- Estimation des paramètres génétiques pour des caractères de poids corporel chez le pigeonneau.

Treated straws were used as basic diet (900 g day) associated to 100 g of cotton cake for 24 growing Djallonke rams in comparison to non treated straws. Four groups of animals were fed for 98 days with: urea treated sorghum (UTSS), not treated sorghum straw (NTSS), treated millet (UTMS), non treated millet straw (NTMS). Treated straws presented an increase of NDF of about 9 %, of total nitrogen from 2 to 3 times while digestibility of dry matter increased respectively by 8, 8 % and 23, 0 % respectively in treated sorghum and millet.
