25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I {{think it is a}} fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E
500|$|After {{folding the}} Colonels, Brown stated that {{basketball}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of business {{he wanted to}} be involved in. Despite this declaration, he purchased half-ownership in the NBA's Buffalo Braves later in 1976. The Braves had posted a dismal 30–52 record in the 1975–76 season, and Brown immediately set out to make moves that would improve the franchise's fortunes in the next season. He re-signed All Star guard Randy Smith, who had threatened to leave as a free agent, then traded the club's first-round draft pick to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Swen Nater. In a single day, he made two significant trades. In the first, he swapped reigning Rookie of the Year Adrian Dantley for the Indiana Pacers' Billy Knight, who was second in the league in scoring the previous season. Four hours later, he acquired Nate [...] "Tiny" [...] Archibald from the New York Nets for George Johnson and a first-round draft pick in 1979. In 1977, Brown purchased the remaining share of the team from owner Paul Snyder.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{director}} Brett Goldstein contacted Vincent D'Onofrio's agent {{about playing}} {{the part of}} John Lange, but the agent said D'Onofrio would never work in television and refused to even suggest the part to the actor. Goldstein remained convinced the actor was right for the role, and mailed the script directly to D'Onofrio; the actor liked the script and agreed to play the part. The agent later contacted Goldstein a second time, and they got into a dispute over how much money D'Onofrio would be paid. Yoshimura said that D'Onofrio <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of actor he originally envisioned for the part, although he later praised his performance. D'Onofrio said he was attracted to the part based {{on the strength of}} the script and the reputation of Homicide: Life on the Street, although he had never seen the show himself. Fleder, D'Onofrio and Andre Braugher had only between two and three hours to read the script, discuss the characters and rehearse the material. Braugher said his first reaction to the episode premise was that it was a [...] "horrifying idea" [...] because {{he thought it would be}} sensational and end with a clichéd moral, which Braugher said [...] "frankly, nauseated me, the idea of that". But Braugher said that he was extremely satisfied with Yoshimura's final script.|$|E

[...] Thomas K. Arnold of USA Today said the show [...] "turned out to be more rehearsal than comeback", although [...] "all those post-rehab workouts were worth the effort." [...] On May 2, 2007, scalpers outside the House of Blues in San Diego were selling tickets with a face value of $35 for prices between $200 and $500. Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "her 'comeback'– {{if you want to call}} it that– cemented Spears' place as pop music's reigning drama queen, capable of capturing worldwide tabloid headlines with a bare minimum of creative expenditure." ...|$|E

2500|$|Salvemini {{was among}} the first and most {{effective}} opponents of Fascism. The political culture he embodied, made that, according to his biographer, Charles L. Killinger, [...] "the Fascists were anti-Salvemini before he became anti-Fascist, and their efforts to silence him made his name synonymous with early Italian resistance to the new regime." [...] Although a prolific historian, he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of person to separate scholarship from political activity. Throughout his exile he actively organized resistance to Mussolini, assisting others in escaping Italy, while he {{played an important role in}} spurring both elite and public opinion in America against the Fascist regime.|$|E

2500|$|Murasaki {{suffered}} overwhelming loneliness, {{had her own}} {{concerns about}} aging, and was not happy living at court. She became withdrawn, writing that perhaps the other women considered her stupid, shy or both: [...] "Do they really look on me as such a dull thing, I wonder? But I am what I am.... too has often remarked that she thought I <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of person with whom one could ever relax.... I am perversely stand-offish; if only I can avoid putting off those for whom I have genuine respect." [...] Keene speculates that as a writer who required solitude Murasaki's loneliness may have been [...] "the loneliness of the artist who craves companionship but also rejects it". He points out she had [...] "exceptional powers of discernment" [...] and probably alienated the other women, about 15 or 16 of whom she describes in her diary. Although she adds praise for each woman, her criticism is more memorable because she saw through and described their flaws.|$|E

2500|$|The Wii Vitality Sensor was a {{cancelled}} peripheral; a fingertip {{pulse oximeter}} sensor that connected through the Wii Remote. According to Nintendo, the device [...] "will initially sense the user's pulse {{and a number}} of other signals being transmitted by their bodies, and will then provide information to the users about the body’s inner world." [...] The Wii Vitality Sensor was announced by President and CEO Satoru Iwata at Nintendo's E3 2009 media briefing on June 2, 2009. No specific applications were revealed for the device, but when presenting the device Iwata suggested that video games may soon be used for relaxation. According to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime, more details concerning the Wii Vitality Sensor were to be showcased during E3 2010, although no mention of the device occurred. Reggie told GameTrailers, [...] "(E3) <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of environment for a game based on relaxation", mentioning they are saving news on the device for another time and place. At E3 2010, Ubisoft introduced their own pulse oximeter sensor, [...] "Innergy". However, at E3 2011, Nintendo announced more about the Wii Vitality Sensor. Shigeru Miyamoto said that the Wii Vitality Sensor has a difficult time performing consistently across a variety of situations but still may be released.|$|E
2500|$|The Waffle {{was also}} the {{progenitor}} of the NDP Socialist Caucus and the New Politics Initiative (NPI). The NPI were seen as {{a major force in}} the federal NDP during the period after the 2000 federal election. [...] Like the Waffle, they too wanted the party to move left, and were aiming to do this by closing down the NDP and forming a new party. The NPI's attempts at reforming the party were crushed, similar to the Waffle, at the 2001 Winnipeg convention. However, it seems that the party did learn a lesson from how it dealt with the Waffle, because there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of acrimony that occurred after the 1971 federal leadership convention. Unlike the Waffle, the NPI was not seen as a party within the party, and the establishment did not try to disband it. Many of the NPI supporters ended up in Jack Layton's 2003 leadership campaign, though they were outnumbered by the forces that opposed the NPI, such as NDProgress, which was a moderate reform group comparable to the Waffle's old foe NDPNow. [...] After he won the leadership, Layton was able to unite the many factions within the party, and that facilitated the NPI choosing to dissolve itself in 2004, again without any of the same bitterness that infused the Waffle's dissolution.|$|E
2500|$|A few of {{the cables}} {{released}} by WikiLeaks concerned Clinton directly: they revealed that directions {{to members of the}} foreign service had gone out in 2009 under Clinton's name to gather biometric details on foreign diplomats, including officials of the United Nations and U.S. allies. These included Internet and intranet usernames, e-mail addresses, web site URLs useful for identification, credit card numbers, frequent flier account numbers, work schedules, and other targeted biographical information in a process known as the National Humint Collection Directive. State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley said that Clinton had not drafted the directive and that the Secretary of State's name is systematically attached to the bottom of cables originating from Washington; it was unclear whether Clinton had actually seen them. The guidance in the cables was actually written by the CIA before being sent out under Clinton's name, as the CIA cannot directly instruct State Department personnel. The disclosed cables on the more aggressive intelligence gathering went back to 2008 when they went out under Condoleezza Rice's name during her tenure as Secretary of State. The practice of the U.S. and the State Department gathering intelligence on the U.N. or on friendly nations was not new, but the surprise in this case was that it was done by other diplomats rather than intelligence agencies, and that the specific types of information being asked for went beyond past practice and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of information diplomats would normally be expected to gather. In any case, the instructions given in these cables may have been largely ignored by American diplomats as ill-advised. Responding to calls from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and a few others that Clinton possibly step down from her post due to the revelation, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said, [...] "I think that is absurd and ridiculous. I think Secretary of State Clinton is doing a wonderful job." ...|$|E
