25|$|For example, if {{a player}} <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a priest role in his MMORPG world, he might buy a cope from a shop and learn priestly skills, {{proceeding}} to speak, act, and interact with others as their character would.

25|$|If {{the team}} is {{uncertain}} {{about the nature of}} the pitch or simply <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> safe, they often bat first. If the opposition bowling is strong, batting first is often considered a good option. Sometimes the nature of the pitch deteriorates while the game progresses, making batting more difficult especially if facing spin bowling. Another advantage of batting first is that the batting team sets a target for the team batting second to chase. This can create pressure on the teams batsmen and cause problems for the team batting second.|$|E

He left his AHL team, the Hartford Wolf Pack, during their playoff run to join Russia at the tournament. Wolf Pack general manager Al Coates was disappointed to lose Lyashenko from his club, but understood the decision: [...] "Everyone <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for his country, and he shouldn't be portrayed as a bad guy. He's a good guy and a good player." [...] In nine games, he recorded two assists and 14 penalty minutes. Russia captured a silver medal at the tournament.|$|E

500|$|Kosar, {{who wanted}} to play for Cleveland because his family lived {{in a suburb of}} nearby Youngstown, Ohio, signed a five-year {{contract}} worth nearly $6 million in 1985 and was immediately embraced by the Browns organization and the team's fans. [...] "It's not an everyday occurrence that somebody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in Cleveland", Modell said. [...] "This has lent such an aura to Bernie." [...] Kosar saw his first action in the fifth week of the 1985 season against the New England Patriots, when he substituted before halftime for Gary Danielson, a 34-year-old veteran who the Browns had acquired in the offseason from the Lions. Kosar fumbled his first-ever NFL snap, but rebounded and led the team to a 24–20 win. A mix of success and failure followed, but Kosar progressed a bit more each Sunday and led the team to an 8–8 record. Two young running backs, Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack, complemented Kosar's aerial attack with more than 1,000yards rushing each.|$|E
500|$|Henderson {{was known}} for being an illeist, {{referring}} to himself in the third person. One unconfirmed story reports seeing him standing naked {{in front of a}} mirror before a game, practicing his swing, and declaring, [...] "Rickey's the best! Rickey's the best!" [...] According to Verducci, during one off-season, Henderson called Padres general manager Kevin Towers and left this message: [...] "Kevin, this is Rickey. Calling on behalf of Rickey. Rickey <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> baseball." [...] However, Henderson denied that this happened in a February 26, 2009 interview on Mike and Mike in the Morning. In 2003, he discussed his unusual phraseology, saying, [...] "People are always saying, 'Rickey says Rickey.' But it's been blown way out of proportion. Rickey says it when Rickey doesn't do what Rickey needs to be doing. Rickey uses it to remind himself, like, `Rickey, what you doing, you stupid....' Rickey's just scolding himself." [...] Henderson did use the first person pronoun on occasion, such as when he defended his position during a contract dispute: [...] "All I'm asking for is what I want." ...|$|E

In 1914, when war broke out, my father invested most of his money in a war loan to help the country. By the time the bonds matured, they were worthless." [...] Mor Stern was a religious man, but his son was less so. Late in life Solti recalled, [...] "I often upset him because I never stayed in the synagogue for longer than ten minutes." [...] Teréz Stern was from a musical family, and encouraged her daughter Lilly, eight years the elder of the children, to sing, and György to accompany her at the piano. Solti remembered, [...] "I made so many mistakes, but it was invaluable experience for an opera conductor. I learnt to swim with her." [...] He was not a diligent student of the piano: [...] "My mother kept telling me to practise, but what ten-year-old <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the piano when he could be out playing football?" ...|$|E

500|$|Liverpool midfielder Vladimír Šmicer {{was looking}} forward to playing a part in the final: [...] "Everyone <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the final, I'm no different. I was just happy to be on the pitch against Auxerre because I didn't know even the day before whether I'd be fit enough after my injury problem. I'm still not 100% fit, I just wanted to train well this week and be fit for the final." [...] Šmicer was hopeful that victory in the final would rescue Liverpool's season: [...] "I hope that this re-ignites our season. Our season is not good, we know, but there is still plenty to play for. We have not said this is a bad season, let's forget about it and {{concentrate}} on the next one, we have been criticised and we are intent on responding on the pitch." [...] Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy was eager to win the match: [...] "Winning in Cardiff would be a massive result for us, we have to be honest, we haven't been as good as Manchester United over the last 10 years. And winning would bring European football next year, which isn't guaranteed at the moment." ...|$|E

In June 2016, Roberts returned to the Welsh Premier League to play for Bangor City. He signed a contract extension four months later. The [...] "Citizens" [...] finished in fourth-place in 2016–17, and qualified for the UEFA Europa League after beating Cardiff Metropolitan University 1–0 in the play-off final; Roberts said [...] "It means everything to the club [...] We’ve worked hard as a unit, not just the players but all the staff". He credited the club with turning his life around and helping him to overcome his drink and gambling problems. However he left the club in July 2017 after having his contract cancelled; Bangor City made a statement to say [...] "when a player states in the week leading up to a massive European game that he no longer <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for the club, we were left with no alternative other than to release him from his contract. We wish him well for the future, and hope that one day he realises what a massive opportunity he has given up." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} episode of the third season, [...] "The Purple Piano Project", Blaine {{transfers}} to McKinley High {{at the beginning of}} his junior year to be closer to Kurt, who is a senior, and joins New Directions. He later auditions for the role of Bernardo in the school musical West Side Story, so as not to compete against Kurt who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the male lead, Tony, but is cast as Tony himself. In the episode [...] "The First Time", Blaine is pursued by Sebastian Smythe (Grant Gustin), a new Dalton Academy Warbler. Kurt and Blaine meet up with Sebastian at a gay bar, Blaine gets drunk, and afterward tries to get Kurt to have sex with him in the car. Kurt refuses, they have a fight, and Blaine decides to walk home. After the West Side Story opening night, they apologize to each other, and decide to go to Blaine's house. They are later shown in bed together, apparently having just had sex for the first time. When New Directions and the Warblers informally compete in [...] "Michael" [...] to determine which club can perform Michael Jackson's music at the upcoming show choir Regionals, Sebastian throws a slushie containing rock salt at Kurt, but Blaine interposes himself and is hit in the eye; his cornea is badly scratched and requires surgery. His eye heals, and he is back in time for New Directions to defeat the Warblers at Regionals. Blaine's older brother Cooper (Matt Bomer), a successful actor in commercials, visits Ohio, and the two achieve a rapprochement. Blaine's relationship with Kurt is later strained when Kurt text-flirts with a boy he met while preparing for his NYADA audition, and by Kurt's eagerness to leave for New York after graduation, which would separate the two at least until Blaine graduated the following year. The two patch things up, the glee club wins at Nationals, and the pair is still a couple at the end of the school year, though Blaine is still uneasy about the prolonged physical separation facing them.|$|E
