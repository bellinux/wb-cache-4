5|$|Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case {{decided in}} 2001. The case {{concerned}} {{the extent of}} the government’s power to limit an individual’s complete control of his or her home pending the arrival of a search warrant. A divided Court held that the search was not unconstitutional because there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> law-enforcement need to acquire a warrant, namely, to prevent the potential destruction of evidence within the home.|$|E
5|$|In Multani v. Marguerite-Bourgeoys (Commission scolaire) (2006), {{the issue}} was whether a ban {{in a public school}} on Sikh {{students}} carrying kirpans (ceremonial daggers) for religious purposes was justifiable. Justice Louise Charron, who delivered the Court's majority opinion, applied the Oakes test to section 2(a) of the Charter. She held that the school could not discharge its burden of proving that prohibiting the kirpan <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> limit on the student's constitutional freedom of religion.|$|E
5|$|The {{crux of the}} High Court's holding {{rested on}} stage 3(b), as {{illustrated}} in the table below. In analysing {{the constitutionality of the}} provision with regards to this portion of the reasonable classification test, the Court first ascertained the object of section 37(1) of the PCA. It subsequently considered if differentiation on the basis of citizenship <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> means of attaining the objective.|$|E

5|$|Lam Wing-kee (林榮基, age 60), {{the founder}} of Causeway Bay Books, has been missing since 24 October 2015. He habitually spent long hours at the {{bookshop}} and occasionally slept there. His wife filed a missing persons report with the police on 5 November and his family received {{a telephone call from}} him several hours later; he refused to reveal his whereabouts. When filing the police report, they were referred to the Immigration Department, who said it was against privacy policy to reveal a person's records of entry and exit of Hong Kong without the subject's permission. However, legislator James To said this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> request that was exempt from privacy policy. Police followed up on his case once, asking whether they had heard from him. His family allege that upon learning that he had contacted his family, the officer who called them informed that the case would be closed as resolved.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{style of}} warfare had been honed over the {{preceding}} centuries. It {{revolved around the}} hoplite, members of the middle-classes (the zeugites) who could afford the armour necessary to fight in this manner. The hoplite was, {{by the standards of}} the time, heavily armoured, with a breastplate (originally bronze, but probably by this stage a more flexible leather version), greaves, a full helmet, and a large round shield (the aspis). Hoplites were armed with a long spear (the doru), which was evidently significantly longer than Persian spears, and a sword (the xiphos). Hoplites fought in the phalanx formation; the exact details are not completely clear, but it was a close-knit formation, presenting a uniform front of overlapping shields, and spears, to the enemy. Properly assembled, the phalanx was a formidable offensive and defensive weapon; on occasions when it is recorded to have happened, it took a huge number of light infantry to defeat a relatively small phalanx. The phalanx was vulnerable to being outflanked by cavalry, if caught on the wrong terrain, however. The hoplite's heavy armour and long spears made them excellent troops in hand-to-hand combat and gave them significant protection against ranged attacks by light troops and skirmishers. Even if the shield did not stop a missile, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> chance the armour would.|$|E

25|$|Applying {{the test}} to Washington's case, the Court {{concluded}} that counsel {{did not perform}} deficiently and that Washington suffered no prejudice. The counsel's decision to focus on remorse and emotional distress <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> strategic decision {{in light of the}} trial judge's stated views on remorse, the heinousness of Washington's crimes, and Washington's own statements to counsel. In view of those considerations, the Court could not conclude that additional mitigating evidence would have given rise to a reasonable probability that the trial judge would have sentenced Washington to life in prison rather than death.|$|E
25|$|Fireforce was an {{operational}} assault or response usually {{composed of a}} first wave of 32 soldiers carried to the scene by three Alouette III helicopters and one Dakota transport aircraft, with another Alouette III helicopter as a command/gunship aircraft and a light attack aircraft in support.

25|$|In its ruling, the Court first {{considered}} {{whether the}} case was moot. The constitutional amendment that the appellants had opposed had been defeated {{by the time the}} case came to the Court's attention. The Court used the scrutiny described in Weinstein v. Bradford in its determination that {{the case was}} not, in fact, moot. The Court's rationale was twofold: first, the interval between the amendment's proposal and its referendum was too short for complete judicial review to have occurred; and second, the Court found that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> expectation that the appellants would be adversely affected by the statute again.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{ruled in}} favour of the LSUC; stating that its refusal to {{automatically}} accredit TWU graduates <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> balancing of the Charter rights to equality and freedom of religion, and that the refusal of automatic accreditation was not a violation of TWU students' rights to freedom of expression or freedom of association. The ruling further noted that TWU graduates are free to apply independently to the LSUC for accreditation following their graduation. TWU filed a motion to appeal with the Court of Appeal for Ontario September 2015, and the Court of Appeal upheld the ruling {{in favour of}} LSUC in June 2016.|$|E
25|$|Although early polling in January had {{suggested}} that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> possibility of a Liberal win should the party contest the seat, the party refused to speculate if they would nominate a candidate until mid-February, and finally ruled it out on 18 February. There had been some speculation that former rugby player Paul Langmack would nominate as a star candidate for the Liberals, but he had {{announced that he would}} not run on 7 February. The decision by the Liberal Party not to run changed the dynamics of the race significantly, as with the only threat now from minor parties and independents, Labor became the solid favourite to retain the seat.|$|E

25|$|About {{the same}} time, Professor Alice Kober studied Linear B {{and managed to}} {{construct}} grids, linking similar symbols in groups of threes. Kober noticed {{that a number of}} Linear B words had common roots and suffixes. This led her to believe that Linear B represented an inflected language, with nouns changing their endings depending on their case. However, some characters {{in the middle of the}} words seemed to correspond with neither a root nor a suffix. Because this effect was found in other known languages, Kober surmised that the odd characters were bridging syllables, with the beginning of the syllable belonging to the root and the end belonging to the suffix. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> assumption, since Linear B had far too many characters to be considered alphabetic and too few to be logographic; therefore, each character should represent a syllable.|$|E
25|$|The first {{occurred}} on 5 February 1994; 68 {{people were killed}} and 144 more were wounded. The second {{occurred on}} 28 August 1995 when five mortar shells killed 43 people and wounded 75 others. This latter attack was the stated reason for NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces that would eventually lead to the Dayton Peace Accords {{and the end of the}} war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The responsibility of the Army of the Republika Srpska for the first shelling is contested, since investigations to establish the location from where the shells had been fired did not lead to unambiguous results. It was claimed that actually the Bosnian army had shelled its own people in order to provoke intervention of Western countries on their side. Even though ICTY in its appeal judgement of Stanislav Galić in 2006 summarized the evidence and ruled that the conclusion that the shells had been fired from a location occupied by Serbian forces <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> one, still Radovan Karadžić during his trial before ICTY tried to use this rumour to his defense, but to no avail.|$|E
25|$|For {{several decades}} after the Constitution was ratified, the {{interpretation}} of the Necessary and Proper Clause continued to be a powerful bone of contention between the Democratic-Republican Party and the Federalist Party, and several other political parties in the United States. The first practical example of this contention came in 1791, when Hamilton used the clause to defend the constitutionality of the creation of the First Bank of the United States, the first federal bank in the new nation's history. Concerned that monied Northern aristocrats would take advantage of the bank to exploit the South, Madison argued that Congress lacked the constitutional authority to charter a bank. Hamilton countered that the bank <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> means of carrying out powers related to taxation and the borrowing of funds, claiming the clause applied to activities reasonably related to constitutional powers, not just those that were absolutely necessary to carry out said powers. To embarrass Madison, his contrary claims from The Federalist Papers were read aloud in Congress: Eventually, Southern opposition to the bank and to Hamilton's plan to have the federal government assume the war debts of the states was mollified by the transfer of the nation's capital from its temporary seat in Philadelphia to a more southerly permanent seat on the Potomac, and the bill, along with the establishment of a national mint, was passed by Congress and signed by President Washington.|$|E
