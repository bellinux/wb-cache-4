25|$|Pine forests (with Pinus sylvestris) are {{the most}} {{widespread}} and occupy 51% of the forested area of the Karelian Isthmus, followed by spruce forests (with Picea abies, 29%) and birch forests (with Betula pendula and B. pubescens, 16%). Stands on more fertile soils and in more favorable locations are occasionally dominated by Norway maple, black alder, grey alder, common aspen, English oak, grey willow, dark-leaved willow, tea-leaved willow, small-leaved lime or European white elm. Common vegetation of various types of pine forests includes heather, crowberry, common juniper, eared willow, lingonberry, water horsetail, bracken, graminoids (i.e. grasses in the wider sense) Avenella flexuosa and Carex globularis, mosses Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum angustifolium and S. russowii, and lichens Cladonia spp. Prominent in various spruce forests are <b>wood</b> <b>horsetail,</b> common wood sorrel, bilberry, lingonberry, graminoids Avenella flexuosa, Calamagrostis arundinacea, Carex globularis, and mosses Polytrichum commune and Sphagnum girgensohnii. Prominent vegetation of various birch forests include meadowsweet, common wood sorrel, bilberry and graminoids Calamagrostis arundinacea and C. canescens.|$|E

50|$|Equisetum sylvaticum, the <b>wood</b> <b>{{horsetail}},</b> is a horsetail (family Equisetaceae) {{native to}} the Northern Hemisphere, occurring in North America and Eurasia. Because of its lacy appearance, it is considered among the most attractive of the horsetails.|$|E

5000|$|... an {{inventory}} of aquatic plants in 1998 resulted in the following list: reed, club-rush, narrow-leafed cattail, water <b>horsetail,</b> <b>wood</b> club-rush, greater spearwort, yellow iris, water hemlock, water-plantain, marsh cinquefoil, marsh-bedstraw, bog-bean, yellow water-lily, white water-lily, broad-leaved pondweed, curled pondweed, bladderwort, and Fontinalis moss.|$|R
50|$|The area is {{surrounded}} with woods consisting mainly of spruces, which are replaced with mountain pines towards the centre. The meadows are very rich in species of various plants. Among {{the most common}} ones there are <b>horsetails,</b> <b>wood</b> club-rush, Cirsium rivulare and meadowsweet. There are {{also a lot of}} rare species, such as few-flower sedge, fibrous tussock-sedge, flea sedge, tufted loosestrife or Gladiolus imbricatus.|$|R
5000|$|These horsetails are {{commonly}} found in wet or swampy forest, open woodlands, and meadow areas. The species name sylvaticum is Latin for [...] "of the forests", emphasizing that the <b>wood</b> <b>horsetail</b> is most {{commonly found in}} forested habitats. The plant is an indicator of boreal and cool-temperate climates, and very moist to wet, nitrogen-poor soils.|$|E
50|$|Dense forest {{ecosystems}} occupy a smaller and wetter {{area in the}} southeast. These are deciduous tree species (Caucasian ash, moss-capped oak, yoke elm, white poplar, Mahaleb cherry) covered with climbing plants: old man’s beard, wild vines, ivy, hop, and silk vine. These forests are surprisingly similar to tropical forests. Grasses include <b>wood</b> <b>horsetail,</b> oriental iris, wild orchids, and cuckoo pint.|$|E
50|$|The {{main feature}} of the marsh is club-rush which forms dense stands {{together}} with bulrush, great willowherb and common reed. The alder and birch wood on the drier areas has a good ground flora which is dominated by grasses, Remote-sedge and horsetails. The species reported include common spotted-orchid, marsh pennywort, common valerian, skullcap and creeping jenny. <b>Wood</b> <b>horsetail</b> is abundant in a damp area.|$|E
50|$|A zone of acidic bog {{vegetation}} consisting of: {{purple moor-grass}} (Molinia caerulea), common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), sedges (Carex spp.) including star sedge (Carex echinata), green-ribbed sedge (Carex binervis) and flea sedge (Carex pulicaris); bog moss (Sphagnum spp.), heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), devils-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), marsh violet (Viola palustris), meadow thistle (Cirsium dissectum), <b>wood</b> <b>horsetail</b> (Equisetum sylvaticum), lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) and pale butterwort (Pinguicula lusitanica).|$|E
50|$|Several {{plantation}} {{areas are}} present {{others have been}} felled. Unusally several roundels or roughly circular plantations are shown on the old maps at Little Sevenacres, {{on the road to}} Clonbeith, on the old road from Hullerhill and one that is now merged into the plantation within Sevenacres Wood. Roundels were often planted on estates as landscape features. The surviving roundel near Sevenacres House still has its bank and ditches that were built to keep stock from entering. The 1747 map by Roy shows a number of roundels on the Eglinton Estate lands between High and Mid Moncur Farms. The flora within the Sevenacres Wood roundel is much more diverse than the surrounding self-seeded plantation with old woodland indicators such as <b>wood</b> <b>horsetail,</b> hard fern, wood sorrel, enchanter's nightshade, etc. Sevenacres Wood appears to be of 19th-century origin and had a number of access tracks running through it.|$|E

50|$|This site {{comprises}} {{a mosaic}} of broadleaved woodland, scrub, bracken, mires and unimproved grassland which provides the habitat for several species of butterfly which are now scarce in Britain. The site is also important for its lichens. The ground flora includes a number of species normally found only in ancient woodland such as woodruff (Galium odoratum) and wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa). <b>Wood</b> <b>horsetail</b> (Equisetum sylvaticum), which is rare in Somerset, is abundant and widespread on this site also being found {{in the areas of}} bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). The epiphytic lichen flora is also typical of ancient woodland and includes species such as Lobaria pulmonaria. The nationally scarce Opegrapha corticola and the nationally rare Chaenotheca stemonea also occur. The woodland rides and glades provide ideal habitat for the nationally scarce wood white (Leptidea sinapsis) butterfly, this site having by far the strongest colony known in Somerset. The grassland provides habitat for the nationally scarce marsh fritillary (Eurodryas aurinia) butterfly. The breeding birds include nightingale (Luscinia megarhyches), redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) and wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix). Adder (Vipera berus), grass snake (Natrix helvetica), slowworm (Anguis fragilis) and common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) have all been recorded from the site.|$|E
