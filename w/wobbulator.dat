5000|$|A <b>wobbulator</b> is an {{electronic}} device primarily {{used for the}} alignment of receiver or transmitter intermediate frequency strips. It is usually {{used in conjunction with}} an oscilloscope, to enable a visual representation of a receiver's passband to be seen, hence simplifying alignment; it was used to tune early consumer AM radios. The term [...] "wobbulator" [...] is a portmanteau of wobble and oscillator. A [...] "wobbulator" [...] (without capitalization) is a generic term for the swept-output RF oscillator described above, a frequency-modulated oscillator, also called a [...] "sweep generator" [...] by most professional electronics engineers and technicians. A <b>wobbulator</b> was used in some old microwave signal generators to create what amounted to frequency modulation. It physically altered the size of the klystron cavity, therefore changing the frequency.|$|E
5000|$|When capitalized, [...] "Wobbulator" [...] {{refers to}} the trade name of a {{specific}} brand of RF/IF alignment generator. The <b>Wobbulator</b> was made by a company known as [...] "TIC" [...] (Tel-Instrument Company) although some units branded [...] "Allen B. Du Mont Laboratories" [...] and [...] "Stromberg-Carlson" [...] are rumored to exist. These were apparently made under some form of license and branded {{with the name of}} the licensee, much as Radio Corporation of America through subsidiary Hazeltine Corp., licensed its KCS-20A television chassis design (used in models 630TS, 8TS30, etc.) to other television manufacturers (Air King, Crosley, Fada, et al.) for production under their brand names. The <b>Wobbulator</b> generator, designated model 1200A, combined sweep and marker functions into a single self-contained pushbutton-controlled device which, when connected to an oscilloscope and television receiver under test, would display a representation of the receiver's RF/IF response curves with [...] "markers" [...] defining critical frequency reference points as a response curve on the oscilloscope screen. Such an amplitude-versus-frequency graph is also often referred to as a Bode (pronounced [...] "bodee") plot or Bode graph.|$|E
40|$|This article {{participates in}} new materialist discussions by {{examining}} the practices of Nam June Paik as a negotiation between the materiality of media and an articulation of identity. Following Nam June Paik's lead, this scholarly analysis at times {{takes the form of}} a letter, intertwining personal voices with an investigation of media technologies. Reproductions of Paik's letters inform written records about his early interactive video technologies such as the <b>Wobbulator</b> (1972) that invite us to mix our voices with his. Paik's playful approach to identity as mediated by technology can be seen as an early precursor to social media sites such as YouTube.

Anthony Institute, University of Rochester, and the Experimental Television Center in Oswego, New York...|$|E
