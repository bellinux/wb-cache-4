5|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} breed associations have been testing the F94L status of cattle registered in their herd books. The absence of F94L genes in some tested cattle {{might be a}} result of a sire or dam ancestor that had double muscling (MH) genes, or more likely that the myostatin gene was the normal or wild type variant found most commonly in beef cattle. In the latter case, loss of the F94L variant <b>will</b> <b>arise</b> when grading up to purebred when base animals are not Limousins.|$|E

40|$|Whence {{comes the}} evil will? My paper {{examines}} Kant’s notion of radical evil and Kierkegaard’s analysis of sin {{in order to}} uncover the existential-ontological dynamic of the evil will. Ultimately, I argue, the evil <b>will</b> <b>arises</b> {{in response to the}} anxiety inherent in freedom itself. I conclude with an examination of Kierkegaard’s ‘formula of faith’ as a solution to the dilemma of freedom, and consider the role faith may play in freedom’s moral maturation...|$|R

25|$|Joint ventures, {{as opposed}} to {{business}} partnerships], are not presumed to carry a fiduciary duty; however, {{this is a matter}} of degree. If a joint venture is conducted at commercial arm's length and both parties are on an equal footing then the courts will be reluctant to find a fiduciary duty, but if the joint venture is carried out more in the manner of a partnership then fiduciary relationships can and often <b>will</b> <b>arise.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{circumstance}} where a fiduciary duty <b>will</b> <b>arise</b> is between a trustee, whether real or juristic, and a beneficiary. The trustee to whom property is legally committed is the legal—i.e., common law—owner of all such property. The beneficiary, at law, has no legal {{title to the}} trust; however, the trustee is bound by equity to suppress their own interests and administer the property only {{for the benefit of}} the beneficiary. In this way, the beneficiary obtains the use of property without being its technical owner.|$|E

However, from the several parasites present in the plasma, {{a small number of}} them will experience changes in their surface coats resulting in the formation of new VSGs. Thus, the antibodies produced by the immune system will no longer recognize the parasite leading to proliferation until new antibodies are created to combat the novel VSGs. Eventually the immune system will {{no longer be able to}} fight off the parasite due to the constant changes in VSGs and infection <b>will</b> <b>arise.</b>|$|E

40|$|Wegner’s {{analysis}} of the illusion of conscious will is close to my own account of how conscious experiences relate to brain processes. But our analyses differ somewhat on how conscious will is not an illusion. Wegner argues that once conscious <b>will</b> <b>arises</b> it enters causally into subsequent mental processing. I argue that while his causal story is accurate, it remains a first-person story. Conscious free will is not an illusion {{in the sense that}} this first-person story is compatible with and complementary to a third-person account of voluntary processing in the mind/brain...|$|R

25|$|In 1805, Detroit {{experienced}} a devastating fire, which destroyed {{most of the}} city's French colonial architecture. Shortly afterward, Father Gabriel Richard said, Speramus meliora; resurget cineribus, meaning, We hope for better things; it <b>will</b> <b>arise</b> from the ashes, which became the city's official motto. For Detroit, Justice Augustus B. Woodward devised a plan similar to Pierre Charles L'Enfant's design for Washington, D.C.. Detroit's monumental avenues and traffic circles fan out in a Baroque styled radial fashion from Grand Circus Park {{in the heart of}} the city's theater district.|$|E

The same difficulty applies to both side of the way, and as traffic is great in Arkwright-street, the double line will be rather awkward unless the foot-way is reduced.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} {{to think of the}} advancing wave of depolarisation as a dipole with a head and a tail. The length of the refractory period and the time taken for the dipole to travel a certain distance—the propagation velocity—will determine whether such a circumstance <b>will</b> <b>arise</b> for re-entry to occur. Factors that promote re-entry would include a slow-propagation velocity, a short refractory period with a sufficient size of ring of conduction tissue. These would enable a dipole to reach an area that had been refractory and is now able to be depolarised with continuation of the wavefront.|$|E

25|$|In September 2012, Feyenoord {{confirmed}} that there <b>will</b> <b>arise</b> {{a new stadium}} in 2018. The stadium will be built by builder VolkerWessels, it will cost around €300million (~£242million). Another option was a plan made by a consortium of BAM, Eneco Energie and Siemens. But the plan {{was rejected by the}} Feyenoord and Stadion Feijenoord direction. The new stadium should be a 63,000 all-seater. Despite the new plans, much of the supporters prefer a renovation of De Kuip. One of those initiatives are Red de Kuip, which is Dutch for Save de Kuip. They made plans of building a third tier on top of the current stadium, increasing the capacity to 68,000. This plan would cost only €117million (~£94million).|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{production}} restart, the U.S. Navy is expected to fall short of its requirement for 94 destroyer or cruiser platforms capable of missile defense starting in FY 2025 and continuing past {{the end of the}} 30-year planning window. While this is a new requirement as of 2011, and the U.S. Navy has never had so many large missile-armed surface combatants, the relative success of the Aegis ballistic missile defense system has shifted this national security requirement onto the U.S. Navy. The shortfall <b>will</b> <b>arise</b> as older platforms that have been refitted to be missile-defense-capable (particularly the cruisers) are retired in bulk before new destroyers are planned to be built.|$|E
