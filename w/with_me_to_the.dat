Originally {{entitled}} [...] "No Te Equivoques", it was re-recorded {{in response to the}} infringement and included on the album retitled [...] "Acércate". Reflecting on the situation Queen stated: [...] "Sometimes they try to hurt you are when you do well. I'm proud and grateful that Wisin & Yandel have gone <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio to record the song. We have good chemistry and friendship. We tried to change the song and lyrics, but with their agenda, which is tight, and mine too, we could not do it again. We have no idea who hacked, all the music was in a studio and to mobilize it to another was what someone did." [...] The collaboration stemmed from Queen's previous collaboration with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album La Revolución (2009) on [...] "Perfecto" [...] which also featured Yaviah.|$|E
500|$|Skye has {{a strong}} folk music tradition, {{although}} in recent years dance and rock music have been growing in popularity on the island. Gaelic folk rock band Runrig started in Skye and former singer Donnie Munro still works on the island. Runrig's second single and a concert staple is entitled Skye, the lyrics being partly in English and partly in Gaelic and they have released other songs such as [...] "Nightfall on Marsco" [...] that were inspired by the island. Celtic fusion band the Peatbog Faeries are based on Skye. Jethro Tull singer Ian Anderson owned an estate at Strathaird on Skye at one time. Several Tull songs are written about Skye, including Dun Ringil, Broadford Bazaar, and Acres Wild (which contains the lines [...] "Come <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Winged Isle, / Northern father's western child..." [...] {{in reference to the}} island itself). The Isle of Skye Music Festival featured sets from The Fun Lovin' Criminals and Sparks, but collapsed in 2007. Electronic musician Mylo was born on Skye.|$|E
500|$|The lead single, [...] "La Vida es Así", was {{released}} on May 11; the music video (directed by Marlon Pena) was shot on May 17 in Miami and premiered on mun2 on June 22 and VEVO on June 28. Queen said that the genre of bachata is meaningful, since it reveals more feelings. The a cappella version of [...] "La Vida es Así" [...] was sent to Tainy and Keko Musik for production, allowing Queen to pick the version she preferred. The Keko Musik version was later released as a pre-order bonus track for Drama Queen on iTunes. The second single, [...] "Amor Puro" [...] {{was released}} for Puerto Rican radio on September 24. The music video (also directed by Marlon Pena) was shot on September 28, and premiered on VEVO November 30. The video was also filmed in Miami, at the Spanish monastery of St. Bernard of Clairvaux (a historic building dating to 1133 in Sacramenia, Segovia, Spain, later reconstructed in Miami). [...] "Acércate" [...] was leaked online before the album was released, the first time Queen experienced copyright infringement in her 15-year career. Originally titled [...] "No Te Equivoques", it was re-recorded {{in response to the}} copyright violation and retitled [...] "Acércate". She said, [...] "Sometimes they try to hurt you are when you do well. I'm proud and grateful that Wisin & Yandel have gone <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio to record the song. We have good chemistry and friendship. We tried to change the song and lyrics, but with their agenda, which is tight, and mine too, we could not do it again. We have no idea who hacked, all the music was in a studio and to mobilize it to another was what someone did". The singer appeared on the television program “Don Francisco Presenta”, where she performed [...] "La Vida es Así".|$|E

2500|$|In 1938, {{he landed}} his famous role as Pepe le Moko, the thief {{on the run}} in Algiers, an English-language remake of the classic French film Pepe le Moko with Jean Gabin. Although in the movie Boyer never said to costar Hedy Lamarr [...] "Come <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Casbah," [...] this line was in the movie trailer. The line would stick with him, thanks to generations of impressionists and Looney Tunes parodies. Boyer's role as Pepe Le Moko was already world-famous when {{animator}} Chuck Jones based the character of Pepé Le Pew, the romantic skunk introduced in 1945's Odor-able Kitty, on Boyer and his most well-known performance. Boyer's vocal style was also parodied on the Tom and Jerry cartoons, most notably when Tom was trying to woo a female cat. (See The Zoot Cat).|$|E
2500|$|As the {{literary}} ambassador of pre-World War II Bermuda, Buechner offers readers a vivid {{guided tour of}} an enchanted time, recounting in exquisite detail its sights and sounds and smells and tastes: [...] cedar-laden, salt-sweet air; houses of sky blue and rose, lemon yellow and lavender, and pastel green; rain moving in curtains across the harbor; pale pink coral beaches; flat, sweet yellow buns; skies full of gulls; rum swizzles on the balcony at Twenty One; miles of coral roads, their chalky smell drying in the rain after a storm; the battered ferry chugging along with its stern nearly awash under a load of bicycles; the clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages, the carriages' fringed roofs, the chime of their bells. [...] For Buechner, this lush detail {{is all part of}} the [...] "sense of another time that I will carry <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of my time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Millar {{became one}} of the most photographed women of the Edwardian period. She had top billing as the Hon. Violet Anstruther in The Orchid, the show that opened the new Gaiety (1903; {{introducing}} the songs [...] "Little Mary", [...] "Liza Ann", and [...] "Come <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> zoo"). She starred as Rosalie in The Spring Chicken (1905; singing [...] "Alice sit by the fire" [...] and [...] "The Delights of London") and as Lally in The New Aladdin (1906). She next starred as Mitzi in The Girls of Gottenberg (1907; singing the duet [...] "Two Little Sausages", with Edmund Payne, and the Wagnerian parody [...] "Rhinegold"). [...] Soon afterwards, Edwardes cast her as Franzi at the Hicks Theatre in the English-language production of Ein Walzertraum (A Waltz Dream, 1908) by Oscar Straus. [...] Although Millar was able to sell the light musical comedy songs composed for her at the Gaiety, Oscar Straus's music was too demanding for her small voice, and she was sent to New York to star in the Broadway production of The Girls of Gottenberg.|$|E
