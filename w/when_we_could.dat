When mixing the soundtrack in Dolby Atmos, as Favreau said, [...] "we isolated instruments <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>could.</b> And in the sound mix, we created a Fantasound mix. If you see the film in Atmos, you will feel that there are instruments that move around the theater." [...] A mention for Fantasound appears in the film's closing credits.|$|E
2500|$|Layton and {{his wife}} kept their life private as much as possible. When one {{reporter}} kept prying, Layton responded: “I have done nothing to cause people {{to want to know}} of my private life. Mrs. Layton and I have given <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{in a way that we}} hoped would be a source of occasional pleasure or benefit to others, but we have had our return in the pleasure of giving and there’s no need of talking of it.” ...|$|E

[...] Thorough the night he and others {{alternatively}} sat and stood, holding their horses in the cold rain and mist. [...] "Never before or since," [...] he wrote in later years, [...] "were hours so laggard or anxiety so great for the coming of dawn <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do something that would heat the blood and cheer the soul to the forgetfulness of that everlasting soaking patter, patter of freezing rain." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sigler calls Stephen King a [...] "'master craftsman', {{who writes}} from the 'regular guy' strata {{from which he}} hails. His older stuff had no pretense, no 'higher message,' no 'I’m {{extremely}} important' attitude, just rock-solid storytelling and character development. He also would whack any character at any time, and that’s what hooked you in – when characters got into trouble, you didn’t know if they’d live, unlike 99% of the books {{out there that are}} trying to develop franchise characters." [...] According to Sigler, Jack London's [...] "The Sea Wolf totally changed my views on life". Sigler saw King Kong (1976 version) {{when he was a little}} kid. He said it, [...] "Scared the crap out of me. I hid behind my dad’s shoulder and begged to leave the theatre. As soon as we were out, I asked <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> see it again – that was the moment I knew I wanted to tell monster stories. I wanted to have that same impact on other people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Survivors of {{the blaze}} {{claimed that the}} factory had sweatshop-like {{conditions}} and blamed the large loss of life on barred windows. The workers worked for [...] "well below minimum wage" [...] and endured foul smells, according to family of the victims and The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines. Pay was dependent {{on the number of}} shoes produced, creating wages as little as 300 pesos (US$6.70) in a 12-hour day (minimum wage is 481 pesos). Other survivors said that the company was not making required social security and health insurance payments. A survivor who escaped from the first floor remarked, [...] "They were screaming for help, holding on to the bars. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> no longer see their hands, we knew they had died... they died because they were trapped on the second floor." [...] Another survivor remarked, [...] "We were running not knowing exactly where to go... if people had known what to do, it would have been different." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, Lee {{accepted}} {{the role of}} Karen Fairgate on Knots Landing, a spin-off of the immensely popular Dallas. Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit {{and became one of}} the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979 - 1993. Due to her long-running tenure, Lee's alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the [...] "First Lady of Knots Landing" [...] during her guest appearance on The Late Show, which Rivers hosted at the time. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: [...] "Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but remember <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? I remember when I was a little girl and my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house." [...] Lee was the only performer to appear in all of the show's 344 episodes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, father," [...] said Rollo, [...] "that is what I meant, <b>when</b> I said <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{not stand}} up straight. I meant the houses. I read in a book that houses would be blown away, if the {{gravitation}} did not hold them down." ...|$|R
50|$|Inertia {{is another}} reason used to explain a bias towards the status quo. Another {{explanation}} is fear of regret in making a wrong decision, i.e. If we choose a partner, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> think there <b>could</b> be someone better out there.|$|R
6000|$|They {{crossed the}} platform, {{and while they}} waited for the bag the man said respectfully, [...] "Might I ask if Mr. Lawrence was better when you left, sir? It was a {{disappointment}} to us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> heard he <b>could</b> not come home." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ay can he!--not so badly, {{considering}} that I only began {{to teach him}} {{two or three months}} ago. But he knew his letters <b>when</b> <b>we</b> began, and <b>could</b> spell out a few words. He's very quick, you see, and a dear boy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{sent that}} adrift. If we are traced up {{we want to}} shield {{ourselves}} by saying we went off hunting and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> got back <b>could</b> find nothing of him and the boat, and {{had to get a}} stranger to take us ashore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Winkle's {{bedroom is}} inside mine,' said Mr. Tupman; 'I couldn't make him {{understand}} what I wanted, if I woke him now, but I {{know he has}} a dress-suit in a carpet bag; and supposing you wore it to the ball, and took it off <b>when</b> <b>we</b> returned, I <b>could</b> replace it without troubling him {{at all about the}} matter.' ...|$|R

60|$|We built a small, rude {{cabin in}} the side of the crevice and roofed it with canvas, leaving a corner open to serve as a chimney, through which the cattle used to tumble occasionally, at night, and mash our {{furniture}} and interrupt our sleep. It was very cold weather and fuel was scarce. Indians brought brush and bushes several miles on their backs; and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> catch a laden Indian it was well--and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not (which was the rule, not the exception), we shivered and bore it.|$|E

60|$|In our rule at Silverado, {{there was}} a melancholy interregnum. The queen and the crown prince with one accord fell sick; and, as I was sick to begin with, our lone {{position}} on Mount Saint Helena was no longer tenable, {{and we had to}} hurry back to Calistoga and a cottage on the green. By that time we had begun to realise the difficulties of our position. We had found what an amount of labour it cost to support life in our red cañon; and it was the dearest desire of our hearts to get a China-boy to go along with us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> returned. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> have given him a whole house to himself, self-contained, {{as they say in the}} advertisements; and on the money question we were prepared to go far. Kong Sam Kee, the Calistoga washerman, was entrusted with the affair; and from day to day it languished on, with protestations on our part and mellifluous excuses on the part of Kong Sam Kee.|$|R

I hope you'll excuse it this once, dear Ned, and not scold me, now I've come so many, many miles!' ...|$|R

60|$|More {{than one}} of the Indians spoke English, and, not unfrequently, the Tories or British {{officers}} came to visit Thayendanega in his own lodge, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> overhear a goodly portion of the conversation.|$|E
60|$|I had {{my share}} of it; for, as soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly, I was put on every {{committee}} for answering his speeches and messages, and by the committees always desired to make the drafts. Our answers, {{as well as his}} messages, were often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive, and, as he knew I wrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> met <b>we</b> <b>could</b> hardly avoid cutting throats; but he was so good-natured a man that no personal difference between him and me was occasioned by the contest, and we often dined together.|$|R
60|$|He was an {{extraordinarily}} chilly devil. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> stopped I <b>could</b> hear his teeth chattering again. I don’t know what came over me, I had {{a sort of}} nervous fit, was incapable of finding my pockets, let alone the latchkey. I had the illusion of a narrow streak of light {{on the wall of the}} house as if it had been cracked. “I hope we will be able to get in,” I murmured.|$|R
60|$|Oh, what a pestilence {{was that}} of which for three weeks or so we were the daily witnesses, for from the flat roof of the hacienda <b>we</b> <b>could</b> see {{straight}} on to the plaza of the little town. And <b>when</b> at night <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not see, still <b>we</b> <b>could</b> hear the wails of the dying and bereaved, the eternal clang of the church bells, rung to scare away the demon of disease, and the midnight masses chanted by the priests, that grew faint and fainter as their brotherhood dwindled, until at last they ceased. And so it {{went on in the}} tainted, stricken place until the living were not enough to bury the dead, or to do more than carry food and water to the sick.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{the laugh}} {{will be on}} him, I guess, Jake," [...] Morrell answered. [...] "Unless, maybe, {{it will be on}} us for {{sticking}} round this old dump <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get away that easy." ...|$|E

6000|$|We {{thought of}} it ourselves, and with {{mounting}} exasperation. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> reflected that he would probably have put it into his paper, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> reflected that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have given so much more color to our essay, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not endure it.
