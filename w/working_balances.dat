40|$|Until now, {{the debates}} around {{financial}} sustainability analysis, estimation and management have converged towards two main issues. The first is about financial analysis practice based on different sources of information, comparative value of financial and managerial accounting. The second is about institutional restrictions that factually replace {{the theory of}} analysis and management. In this paper, we explore an underdeveloped topic by linking these two issues: how the methodology of economic analysis (with reference to financial sustainability analysis) is developed regarding claims of different groups of stakeholders. First, we extend the term “financial sustainability ” putting together financial and nonfinancial indicators and metrics. We regard this as an answer on present-day challenges of turbulent environment, the turbulent nature of economic activity. Secondly, we suggest a system of indicators of financial sustainability analysis. It includes service quality and management quality indicators, financial ratios and other indicators and operating risk indicators. Finally we introduce the main goal of financial sustainability analysis – to search, discover and mobilize the reserves (<b>working</b> <b>balances),</b> disclosed and implicit opportunities of further development. We put forward an idea of socio-economic nature of these opportunities...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} midwives’ views {{and experiences of}} flexible <b>working</b> and work–life <b>balance.</b> Both flexible <b>working</b> and work–life <b>balance</b> are important contemporary agendas within midwifery and can have {{both positive and negative}} consequences for midwives. Full-time midwives and those without caring commitments feel disadvantaged by flexible <b>working</b> and work–life <b>balance</b> policies as they have to fit when they work around part-time midwives and are increasingly expected to cover extra work. They feel their work–life balance is marginalized and this is fuelling discontent and resentment among midwives and leading to divisions between full- and part-time staff that reinforce flexibility stigma.

40|$|A good <b>working</b> <b>balance</b> between {{simplicity}} and reliability in assessing seismic slope stability {{is represented by}} displacement-based methods, in which the effects of deformability and ductility can be either decoupled or coupled in the dynamic analyses. In this paper, a 1 D lumped mass stick slip model is developed, accounting for soil heterogeneity and non linear behaviour, with a base sliding mechanism at a potential rupture surface. The results of the preliminary calibration show a good agreement with frequency-domain site response analysis in no-slip conditions. The comparison with rigid sliding block analyses and with the decoupled approach proves that the stick-slip procedure can result increasingly unconservative for soft soils and deep sliding depths. © 2008 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

40|$|Many of the {{difficulties}} of applying rights in practice lie in competing interpretations of rights by different groups and organisations. This paper illustrates the complexities of putting a theory of children's rights into practice within the everyday contexts of residential child care, in particular, {{as part of the}} routines of food provision and consumption of staff and children. The challenges of operationalising children's rights specifically are also associated with different understandings of the nature of adult-child relations. Furthermore, the paper argues that the ambiguities which arise when translating children's rights into practice are partly due to the tensions involved in striking a <b>working</b> <b>balance</b> between children's protection rights as well as their participation rights. This paper is based on an ethnographic study that explored food practices in three residential children's homes in Scotland...|$|R

The {{design of the}} ESF, as {{set forth in the}} statute, contributed to its obscurity. Its stated mission was to stabilize the exchange value of the dollar, but it has also assumed a role that had no mandate, that of lender to favored countries.

40|$|Firms pursue {{competitive}} advantage through {{both individual and}} collective strategic actions. Because of the difficulties of coordinating collective action, industries are characterized by extended periods of individual activity, punctuated by waves of collective activity. Rational and self-interested firms engage in individual activities unless disrupted by a force ample to overcome the collective action problem. At key points {{in the life of}} an industry, legitimacy challenges arise, presenting incentive to collectivize. In a legitimacy challenge, mobilized groups of constituents attempt to gain control of and change the institutional rules of the game. In order to regain control, firms gradually collectivize in a pattern akin to the resource mobilization perspective of social movement theory. I build a model and offer several testable propositions that trace the dynamic <b>working</b> <b>balance</b> between individual and collective activities within an industry during the emergence, maturity, and decline stages. Over the life of an industry, these ebbs and flows in collective activity take the form of waves of collectivizing...|$|R

Muslims, therefore, have no problem co-existing in peace with the Jews, Christians and the followers of other religions. Problems arise (a) when secular values or principles disturb the <b>working</b> <b>balance</b> of the otherwise mutually exclusive religious diversity and harmony in America; (b) when one follows opportunist policies, practices double standards, and is moved by mere worldly or political interests; and (c) when war against the Zionist-and-neoconservative-manufactured terrorism turns into war against Islam. Such misleading and mischievous tendencies or policies prevent peace from prevailing, which ultimately tarnish the image of religions {{in the eyes of}} their followers and those of the rest making a mockery of the idea of religious diversity even in the so-called most democratic country called the United States of America...|$|R

40|$|Collaborative standardization, an {{efficient}} and inclusive form of organized innovation {{under the auspices}} of standard-setting organisations (SSOs), has demonstrated significant technological achievements in the field of wireless telecommunications. At the core of collaborative standardization is a <b>working</b> <b>balance</b> of interests and incentives of all stakeholders involved, i. e. contributors of technology and users of standards, epitomized by licensing on FRAND terms. Standardization contributes to significant gains in consumer welfare, in the form of lower prices, more innovation and more consumer choice and convenience. At the same time, standardization fosters competitive markets, upstream and downstream. Public policy has not always been successful in accommodating collaborative standardization. The enforcement of Art. 102 TFEU by the EU Commission, for instance, reveals an underlying mistrust of the operation of markets in the context of collaborative standardization and a strong preference for court-determined FRAND terms. However, the recent CJEU ruling in Huawei v. ZTE provides strong incentives for private stakeholders to determine FRAND through bilateral commercial negotiations and as such it is a welcome shift in EU competition policy in collaborative standardization...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{little is}} known about the effects of the {{composition}} of skills on academic entrepreneurship. Therefore, in this paper, following Lazear’s (2005) jack-of-all-trades approach, we study how his or her composition of skills affects a scientist’s intention of becoming an entrepreneur. Extending Lazear, we examine how the effect of balanced entrepreneurial skills is moderated by a <b>balanced</b> <b>working</b> time allocations and peer effects. Using unique data collected from 480 life sciences researchers, we provide the first evidence that scientists with more balanced skills are more likely to have higher entrepreneurial intentions, particularly when they are in contact with entrepreneurial peers. Furthermore, we find even higher entrepreneurial intentions when balanced skill sets are combined with <b>balanced</b> <b>working</b> time allocations. Thus, to encourage the entrepreneurial intentions of life scientists, one has to ensure that they are exposed to diverse work experiences, have <b>balanced</b> <b>working</b> time allocations across different activities and work with entrepreneurial peers; i. e., collaborating with colleagues or academic scientists who have started new ventures in the past is important...|$|R
