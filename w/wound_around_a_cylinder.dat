50|$|In projecting, Rose (1883) explained, {{the lines}} in one view are used to mark those in other views, and to find their shapes or {{curvature}} as they will appear in other views. Thus, in Figure 225a we have a spiral, <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> whose end is cut off at an angle. The pitch of the spiral is the distance A B, and we may delineate {{the curve of the}} spiral looking at the cylinder from two positions (one at a right-angle to the other, as is shown in the figure), by means of a circle having a circumference equal to that of the cylinder.|$|E
40|$|Single {{molecule}} {{experiments on}} bacteriophages show an exponential scaling for {{the dependence of}} mobility {{on the length of}} DNA within the capsid. It has been suggested that this could be due to the "capstan mechanism" [...] the exponential amplification of friction forces that result when a rope is <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> as in a ship's capstan. Here we describe a desktop experiment that illustrates the effect. Though our model phage is a million times larger, it exhibits the same scaling observed in single molecule experiments.

40|$|We {{show how}} {{the nature of the}} the phase {{transition}} in the two-dimensional bimodal Ising spin glass model can be understood in terms of elementary excitations. Although the energy gap with the ground state is expected to be 4 J in the ferromagnetic phase, a gap 2 J is in fact found if the finite lattice is <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> of odd circumference $L$. This 2 J gap is really a finite size effect that should not occur in the thermodynamic limit of the ferromagnet. The spatial influence of the frustration must be limited and not wrap around the system if $L$ is large enough. In essence, the absence of 2 J excitations defines the ferromagnetic phase without recourse to calculating magnetisation or investigating the system response to domain wall defects. This study directly investigates the response to temperature. We also estimate the defect concentration where the phase transition to the spin glass glass state occurs. The value $p_c = 0. 1045 (11) $ is in reasonable agreement with the literature. Comment: 7 pages, 11 figure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{structural}} {{model of the}} murine PrP small beta-sheet was obtained by synthesizing the RGYMLGSADPNGNQVYYRG peptide comprising the two beta-strands 127 - 133 and 159 - 164 linked by a four-residue sequence of high turn propensity. The DPNG turn sequence is a "short circuit" replacing the original protein sequence between the two strands. This 19 -residue peptide spontaneously forms very long single fibrils as observed by electron microscopy. The X-ray diffraction patterns of a partially oriented sample reveals an average arrangement of the hairpin peptides into a structure which can be geometrically approximated by an empty-core cylinder. The hairpins are oriented perpendicular to the cylinder axis and a 130 A helix period is observed. Based on X-ray diffraction constraints and on more indirect general protein structure considerations, a precise and consistent fibril model was built. The structure consists of two beta-sheet ribbons <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> and assembled into a single fibril with a hairpin orientation perpendicular to the fibril axis. Subsequent implicit and explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations provided the final structure at atomic resolution and further insights into the stabilizing interactions. Particularly important are the zipper-like network of polar interactions between {{the edges of the}} two ribbons, including the partially buried water molecules. The hydrophobic core is not optimally compact explaining the low density of this region seen by X-ray diffraction. The present findings provide also a simple model for further investigating the sequence-stability relationship using a mutational approach with a quasi-independent consideration of the polar and apolar interactions...|$|E
