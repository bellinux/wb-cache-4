25|$|Cars {{could also}} be transported through the Severn Tunnel. In the 1950s three trains a day made round trips between Severn Tunnel Junction and Pilning. The {{vehicles}} were loaded onto open flat bed carriages and pulled by a small pannier tank locomotive, although sometimes they were joined to a scheduled passenger train. The prudent owner paid to cover the vehicle <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet,</b> as sparks often flew when the steam locomotive tackled the slope leading to the tunnel exit. A railway coach was provided for passengers and drivers. Reservations could be made and the fee for the car was about thirty shillings (£1.50) in the early 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The vessel {{contained}} framing {{composed of}} various elements (keel, fore foot, stempost, cutwater, sternpost, inner post, false post), double planking (assembled entirely by mortise-and-tenon joints pegged from the inside) and was covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of lead. What {{is referred to}} as a large keelson is actually a 7.5m long mast-step timber made of oak which doubles the axial frame. The stringers, nailed onto the frames, reinforced the hull longitudinally. Regularly alternated floor timbers and half frames comprised the framing of the vessel. The wreck indicates the vessel was about 40m long (35.10m remains preserved on the seabed), 9m wide, and 4.5m deep with a length-to-beam coefficient of 4.4(if L=40m, L/W=4.4). This coefficient of elongation-rate of length to width allows the ship to be much faster than those with a lower coefficient.|$|E
25|$|On July 15, Dahmer {{encountered}} 24-year-old Oliver Lacy at {{the corner}} of 27th and Kilbourn. Lacy agreed to Dahmer's ruse of posing nude for photographs and accompanied him to his apartment, where the pair engaged in tentative sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Lacy. On this occasion, Dahmer intended to prolong the time he spent with Lacy while alive; after unsuccessfully attempting to render Lacy unconscious with chloroform, he phoned his workplace to request a day's absence; this was granted, although the next day, he was suspended. After strangling Lacy, Dahmer had sex with the corpse before dismembering him. He placed Lacy's head and heart in the refrigerator and his skeleton in the freezer. Four days later, on July 19, Dahmer received word that he was fired. Upon receipt of this news, Dahmer lured 25-year-old Joseph Bradehoft to his apartment. Bradehoft was strangled and left lying on Dahmer's bed covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> for two days. On July 21, Dahmer removed these sheets to find the head covered in maggots, whereupon he decapitated the body, cleaned the head and placed it in the refrigerator. He later acidified Bradehoft's torso along with those of two other victims killed within the previous month.|$|E

25|$|Ink for {{the invitations}} was {{supplied}} by Chicago company BuzzInk, and the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies selected Precise Continental of Brooklyn, New York to print the invitations. Precise Continental {{was selected because}} it is a union company, uses recycled paper, and is Forest Stewardship Council certified. The printing technique for the invitations was engraving. The design was cut into the surface of a copper plate, which was then inked and inserted into a printing press <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper. The result is a slightly raised impression {{on the front of the}} page and a slightly indented impression on the bottom. The first plate had to be scrapped because it was engraved without the President's middle initial. The golden seal was engraved in three printing runs. The first print laid down a rough-textured basic gold shape. The second run added smoothness and shine, and the final print run added the fine details to the seal. One million invitations were printed over 20 hours every day between December 11, 2008, and January 2, 2009, with employees working in two shifts and taking breaks only on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The invitations were printed one at a time on 11×17 sheets of paper, which were then cut in half to 8½×11 sheets.|$|E
500|$|In January2008 {{numerous}} videos {{capturing the}} change from Cyrus to the body double during the performance of [...] "We Got the Party" [...] surfaced on the Internet. The videos showed how, during the song's bridge, backup dancers crowded her as a crew member covered Cyrus <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> and ushered her into a trap door and, through the adjacent side, a body double exited. She wore the same wardrobe as Cyrus and used the blonde wig and large glasses to obscure her face. Furthermore, live cameras barely captured her and did not film close-ups as she danced, ran hectically, and lip-synched the rest of [...] "We Got the Party". Numerous fans and critics questioned whether Cyrus lip-synched the entire show during the Best of Both Worlds Tour.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{studying}} the Magyars' religion also {{take into account}} ethnographic analogies, folklore, linguistic evidence, and archaeological research. Artifacts depicting a bird of prey or a tree of life imply both symbols were important elements of the Magyar religion. Trepanationthe real or symbolic wounding of the craniumwas widely practiced by 10th-century Magyars. Gyula László writes that real trepanationsthe opening of the skull with a chiesel and {{the closing of the}} wound <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of silverwere actually surgical operations similarly to those already practiced by Arab physicians, whereas symbolic trepanationsthe marking of the skull with an incised circlewere aimed at the disposal of a protective talisman on the head. According to Róna-Tas, a Hungarian word for cunning, (agyafúrt)verbatim [...] "with a drilled brain"may reflect these ancient practices.|$|E

500|$|When the pin {{is removed}} {{and the small}} doors opened, there is now nothing to see but [...] "a flat layer of plaster, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of nineteenth-century paper or vellum in front of it". Whatever was {{designed}} to be displayed has now gone; it must have been flat, and was perhaps another relic, probably a textile, or a picture on vellum. The Veil of Veronica, in either form, is a possibility; the face of Christ at the top in a circular setting often represents this. Outside the doors the foliate border of the front is continued, uninterrupted by figures. Below two of the angels with trumpets can be seen, with an unpopulated stretch of the green hillside, and below it the back of the castle base, which has apparently had another arched [...] "leg" [...] in the centre crudely removed, leaving a jagged edge, and also making the reliquary rather less stable.|$|E
500|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is at the}} axial centre of the building, comprising a temple-like portico {{standing in front of}} the doors—a relatively common motif of administration buildings of the time. The entrance arrangement is regarded by some people as slightly pompous: the entrance and lift doors are of bronze, and the ceiling and walls of the porch are clad in bronze plate and copper friezes. The inner lobby has two curved staircases <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> aluminum treatment, and marble walls with a zigzag pattern. The axial centre at the rear of the building has a round glazed façade; here, the view of the buildings at the rear of the site (the [...] "casino") is maximised by the curved walls that afford vistas to the subsidiary buildings 100 m distant, separated from the main building by parkland and a pool. During the American occupation of the building, this rotunda housed a small kiosk; later, it was used as a conference room. Nowadays, it is called the Dwight D. Eisenhower room and accommodates a café.|$|E
500|$|Visually, {{the film}} uses many golden motifs to {{parallel}} the gold's symbolic {{treatment in the}} novel. All of Goldfinger's female henchwomen in the film except his private jet's co-pilot (black hair) and stewardess (who is Korean) are red-blonde, or blonde, including Pussy Galore and her Flying Circus crew (both the characters Tilly Masterson and Pussy specifically have black hair in the novel). Goldfinger has a yellow-painted Rolls-Royce with number plate [...] "AU1" [...] ("Au" [...] being the chemical symbol for gold), and also sports yellow or golden items or clothing in every film scene, including a golden pistol, when disguised as a colonel. Bond is bound to a cutting bench <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of gold on it (as Goldfinger points out to him) before nearly being lasered. Goldfinger's factory henchmen in the film wear yellow sashes, Pussy Galore twice wears a metallic gold vest, and Pussy's pilots all wear yellow sunburst insignia on their uniforms. Goldfinger's Jetstar hostess, Mei-Lei, wears a golden bottice and gold-accented sarong. [...] The concept of the recurring gold theme running through the film was a design aspect conceived and executed by Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton.|$|E
