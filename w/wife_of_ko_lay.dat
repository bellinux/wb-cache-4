50|$|Ngwe Gaing is {{considered}} one of the great masters of modern Burmese painting. He made an outstanding contribution through his versatility, technical skill and influence on a generation of Burmese painters. In the post-WWII years, many painters sought instruction from Ngwe Gaing, packing his studio to watch him work, just as painters had flocked to Ba Nyan in the pre-war years. Among the painters influenced by Ngwe Gaing were Myat Kyaw, San Win, Hla Shein, <b>Ko</b> <b>Lay,</b> Hla Maung Gyi, Nann Wai, Thein, Han Tin, San Pe, M. Tin Aye, and Lun Gywe.|$|R

40|$|RCCSD(T) calculations, with an {{effective}} core {{potential for the}} inner electrons of potassium, and large polarized valence basis sets, {{have been used to}} calculate ionization energies <b>of</b> <b>KO</b> 2. In addition, the binding energies of the ground electronic states <b>of</b> <b>KO</b> 2, (X) over-tilde(2) A(2), and KO 2 +, X(3) Sigma(-), have been determined. Comparison with previous values is made, where possible, and an estimate made of the errors in our calculations. The binding energy <b>of</b> <b>KO</b> 2 + is found to be very limited. It is concluded that the rôle <b>of</b> <b>KO</b> 2 + in the upper atmosphere will be small...|$|R
40|$|Building {{on results}} of M. Ando, M. J. Hopkins and C. Rezk we show the {{existence}} of uncountably many E_∞-string orientations <b>of</b> <b>KO</b> and tmf. The same holds for E_∞-spin orientations <b>of</b> <b>KO.</b> Further the obstruction of liftability of string orientations from KO to tmf is discussed. The obstruction of liftability is given by an Iwasawa-theoretic condition at every prime. In an appendix due to N. Naumann {{the question about the}} difference between spin- and string-orientations <b>of</b> <b>KO</b> is discussed. Comment: Appendix by Niko Nauman...|$|R
