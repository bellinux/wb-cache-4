5|$|In the {{subsequent}} Battle of Finschhafen, {{it soon became}} clear that the strength of the Japanese forces there had been seriously underestimated, and the 9th Division needed to be resupplied and reinforced, and its casualties evacuated. Herring strove to get the necessary amphibious lift from the navy but the commander of the United States Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender, was reluctant to expose his ships to the Japanese air threat. The matter went up the chain of command to Mackay, to Blamey, and ultimately to MacArthur, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> little, given that he had no real authority over the U.S. Navy.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the titles, Odaenathus {{controlled}} the Roman East {{with the approval}} of Gallienus <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> little but to formalize Odaenathus self achieved status and settle for his formal loyalty. Palmyra itself, although officially still part of the Roman empire, became a de facto allied state to Rome instead of a provincial city. Outside of Palmyra, Odaenathus' authority extended from the Pontic coast in the north to Palestine in the south. This area included the Roman provinces of Syria, Phoenice, Palaestina, Arabia, Anatolia's eastern regions and later (following the campaign of 262) Osroene and Mesopotamia.|$|E

25|$|Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann {{were able}} to do this by {{exceptionally}} good chemistry, fantastically good chemistry, which was way ahead of what any one else was capable of at that time. The Americans learned to do it later. But at that time, Hahn and Strassmann were really the only ones <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it. And that was because they were such good chemists. Somehow they really succeeded in using chemistry to demonstrate and prove a physical process.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{went well}} {{enough that the}} {{designers}} raised their LEED certification target level to gold. The only significant aspect of the building to fall short of original expectations was the photovoltaics in the curtain wall. They had to be manufactured by the French company Saint-Gobain S.A. and shipped to Yellowknife preassembled since there were no workers there <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> that. One of the planned bands of cells had to be abandoned when the euro appreciated enough against the Canadian dollar during construction as to make its cost prohibitive.|$|E
25|$|After the births {{of their}} children, Victoria Eugenie's {{relationship}} with Alfonso deteriorated, {{and he had}} numerous affairs. It {{has been said that}} he had a dalliance with the Queen's cousin, Beatrice, Duchess of Galliera, but this is disputed. There is some evidence that Alfonso tried to seduce Beatrice, but she didn't give in. The king, in anger, expelled her and her husband from Spain. Then members of the king's circle spread rumours that Beatrice had been expelled because of her bad behaviour, which was not true. All this situation was very painful for the Queen, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing to help her cousin.|$|E

25|$|It {{was also}} quite {{common in the}} 1980s to use {{physical}} floppy disks and the postal service for spreading software, in an activity known as mail trading. Prior to the sale of software that came on CD-ROM discs and after hard drives had become available, the software did not require the floppy disc {{to be in the}} drive when starting and using the program. So, a user could install it onto his/her computer and mail the disk to the next person, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> the same. Particularly widespread in continental Europe, mail trading was even used by many of the leading cracker groups as their primary channel of interaction. Software copyright violation via mail trading was also the most common means for many computer hobbyists in the Eastern bloc countries to receive new Western software for their computers.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{sometimes}} drew complaints about his inconsistent checking {{through the first}} half-decade of his career, Johnson was able to effectively use his speed to break up plays and transition the puck. Nevertheless, Johnson was able to round out his defensive game by the midpoint of his career, and became infamous for {{his use of the}} poke check. Combined with his 5’ 11” height and 31-inch wingspan, Johnson’s use of abnormally long sticks gave him a reach of anywhere from 81 to 99 inches. In this way, he was able to check nine feet of ice at any given time. One of very few players <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so at the time, Johnson was as capable skating backwards as he was going forwards. His favourite defensive tactic was to face an oncoming puck carrier head on, skating backwards whilst continuously jabbing and poking at the puck.|$|E
25|$|On 30 April, after {{receiving}} news of Hitler's suicide, orders were issued that those <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so were to break out. The {{plan was to}} escape from Berlin to the Allies {{on the western side}} of the Elbe or to the German Army to the North. Prior to the breakout, Mohnke briefed all commanders (who could be reached) within the Zitadelle sector about the events as to Hitler's death and the planned break out. They split up into ten main groups on 1 May 1945. Mohnke's group included: secretary Traudl Junge, secretary Gerda Christian, secretary Else Krüger, Hitler's dietician, Constanze Manziarly, Ernst-Günther Schenck, Walther Hewel and various others. Mohnke planned to break out towards the German Army which was positioned in Prinzenallee. The group headed along the subway but their route was blocked so they went aboveground and later joined hundreds of other Germans civilians and military personnel who had sought refuge at the Schultheiss-Patzenhofer Brewery on Prinzenallee. On 2 May 1945, General Weidling issued an order calling for the complete surrender of all German forces still in Berlin. Knowing they could not get through the Soviet rings, Mohnke decided to surrender to the Red Army. However, several of Mohnke's group (including some of the SS personnel) opted to commit suicide.|$|E

25|$|With intent only to {{slow down}} the {{progress}} of the Union vessels and not to make a determined stand, the Confederates had set up a pair of batteries on the bluffs near St. Charles, Arkansas, some 80 miles (130km) above the river mouth. The guns were taken from a gunboat which they had then scuttled {{in the middle of the}} stream as a further impediment. On 17 June, the Federal flotilla arrived at that point; the soldiers went ashore to attack the batteries from the land side, while the two armored gunboats came up the river, Mound City leading. Shots were exchanged between the gunboats and the shore batteries, with nothing exceptional until a chance shot from the upper battery happened to penetrate the casemate of the lead gunboat. The shot killed some men in its passage, but most of the damage it caused occurred when it hit the vessel's steam drum. Hot steam immediately filled the entire boat, killing and scalding most of the crew. Those <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so jumped overboard into the river, where Rebel sharpshooters shot them as they tried to swim to safety. By the time the carnage was over, 105 men were dead by the first shot, scalding, drowning, or being shot in the water. An additional 25 were injured by the steam. Among the wounded was Commander Kilty, who survived and later returned to service in the Navy, although he lost his left arm. Only 25 men of the entire crew escaped without major injury. Meanwhile, the soldiers had moved into position to assault the batteries, so the Confederates fled, leaving their wounded and their guns behind.|$|E

Kilmer's neighbors had difficulty in believing that a man <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> that could also be a poet.|$|E

500|$|Another {{factor in}} {{not having a}} studio {{attached}} before was Atchison's desire to direct it as he wanted to ensure his story would remain the one he envisioned. Several studios wanted to turn Larabee's character into a white character but Atchison felt [...] "it was important that Akeelah's mentor be someone that comes from her neighborhood, that looks like her."

500|$|The game's theme song, [...] "Lost In Thoughts All Alone", {{was written}} by Morishita, with lyrics by Maeda, and sung by Japanese pop singer Renka, who also {{provided}} Azura's in-game singing voice.

According to music personnel, several among them cried when they first heard her performance. Multiple versions were used throughout the soundtrack. Azura's normal voice work is performed by Japanese voice actress Lynn. In the English version, Azura's speaking and singing voice were provided by Rena Strober. The lyrics were adapted into English by Audrey Drake.|$|E
500|$|Actor John Barrowman {{himself was}} {{a key factor in}} the {{conception}} of Captain Jack. Barrowman says {{that at the time of}} his initial casting, Davies and co-executive producer, Julie Gardner had explained to him that they [...] "basically wrote the character around [...] ". Davies had singled out Barrowman for the part. On meeting him, Barrowman tried out the character using his native Scottish accent, his normal American accent, and an English accent; Davies decided it [...] "made it bigger if it was an American accent". Barrowman recounts Davies as having been searching for an actor with a [...] "matinée idol quality", telling him that [...] "the only one in the whole of Britain <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it was you". A number of television critics have compared Barrowman's performances as Captain Jack to those of Hollywood actor Tom Cruise.|$|E

500|$|Abbott {{stated that}} there were two reasons for what he {{considered}} to be the show's failure. The first was Rodgers and Hammerstein's overconfidence; they thought of themselves as Broadway's [...] "Golden Boys" [...] <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> no wrong. The other was the play-within-the-play, which had not been thoroughly thought out by anyone. According to Abbott, Hammerstein remained [...] "positively Sphinx-like" [...] on the subject. At a loss to understand the characters of the play-within-the play, Alton came up with nothing more than routine song-and-dance numbers. During the run, the duo approached choreographer Jerome Robbins and asked him if he could fix the dances. Robbins said that he could, but he would not, as [...] "it would kill Bob Alton". According to Hammerstein biographer Hugh Fordin, [...] " [...] intended contrast between onstage and backstage life was never achieved because the onstage show was so tepid and confusing." ...|$|E

His clan {{has the ability to}} use senjutsu, but due to the severe amount of natural energy they absorb they are prone to fits of extreme violence, with {{additional}} side effects being that they can revert to a childlike form if they use it the wrong way. Because of this, in childhood, Jugo was an outcast, eventually finding solace in Kimimaro whom he saw as an older sibling. After meeting Sasuke, he tried to refuse being part of Taka and used his abilities, but Sasuke managed to calm him down. As Kimimaro was the only other person <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this, Jugo decided to follow Sasuke in the belief that he was Kimimaro's reincarnation.

500|$|Vince Gilligan, {{the writer}} of the episode, wanted Bryan Cranston to play the {{antagonist}} because he felt he would humanize the role. “We needed a guy who could be scary and kind of loathsome {{but at the same}} time had a deep, resounding humanity," [...] he later said. [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Gilligan stated, [...] "We had this villain, and we needed the audience to feel bad for him when he died. Bryan alone was the only actor <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it.” Rick Millikan, the casting director for The X-Files noted that Cranston was nearly not chosen for this episode. Initially, the part of Crump had been assigned to a different actor, but Cranston came prepared to audition for the part. Although the character had already been cast, Millikan allowed him to audition and was very pleased with his performance and chose him for the part instead.|$|E
