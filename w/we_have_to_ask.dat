2500|$|The UK {{government}} {{established a}} task force to look at ways of stemming the growth of Islamic extremism in Britain, focusing on the radicalisation of worshippers in mosques, university students and prisoners. The task force – chaired by David Cameron – had its inaugural meeting at 10 Downing Street on 3 June 2013, and includes Cabinet Ministers, and representatives from the police and intelligence services. Later that day Cameron made a House of Commons statement on the Woolwich attack, saying that lessons must be learned. [...] "When young men born and bred in this country are radicalised and turned into killers, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> some tough questions about what is happening in our country. It is as if that for some young people there is a conveyor belt to radicalisation that has poisoned their minds with sick and perverted ideas. We need to dismantle this process at every stage – in schools, colleges, universities, on the internet, in our prisons, wherever it is taking place." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 6, 2007, the 62nd {{anniversary of}} the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, several Nobel Prize winners, Shirin Ebadi, Mairead Corrigan-Maguire and Betty Williams, Harold Pinter and Jody Williams, along with several anti-war groups, {{including}} The Israeli Committee for a Middle East Free from Atomic, Biological and Chemical Weapons, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, CASMII, Code Pink and many others, warned about what they believed was the imminent risk of a [...] "war of an unprecedented scale, this time against Iran", especially expressing concern that an attack on Iran using nuclear weapons had [...] "not been ruled out". They quoted Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein's July 1955 statement ending [...] "The question <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> ourselves is: what steps {{can be taken to}} prevent a military conflict of which the issue must be disastrous to all species?" [...] They listed specific steps which they judged would reduce the risk of nuclear war in the Middle East, including a call for [...] "the dispute about Iran's nuclear programme, to be resolved through peaceful means" [...] and a call for Israel, [...] "as the only Middle Eastern state suspected of possession of nuclear weapons", to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|E
2500|$|Former Ambassador to Egypt [...] Frank Wisner said:"It wasn’t the {{military}} that plotted the seizure {{of the government and}} grabbed it. It was a massive public uprising that, left unchecked, would have produced great violence. It would have left {{the military}} in the miserable position of having to control those demonstrations by force. The cry from the crowd was they wanted new elections … to help decide the country's future, which has been so troubled. The military was faced with, genuinely overheated situation … It isn’t a coup in any classic sense and, yet, the military played a role in upsetting the government. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> ourselves, then, finally, what are the interests of the United States? And here the president wisely has waiver authority and has to make a judgment. Egypt is the largest and most influential country in the Middle East. Egypt is central to peace with Israel. Egypt's fate will influence the course of politics elsewhere in the region. So we want to be very, very careful before we go out and condemn an event that has, by the most recent polling of Egypt's best pollsters, 80 percent support in the population. What is clear is the wave of anger against the government that drove Morsi from power, enjoyed massive, massive public support in the many, many millions of Egyptians.|$|E

60|$|We have {{therefore}} {{no more to}} {{say about}} the supernormal aspects of the origins of religion.

Now, therefore, {{approaching}} our {{subject in}} this balanced temper, which will neither resolve to see only {{what it would}} desire, nor expect to see only what it can explain, we shall find our enquiry into the relation of Art to Religion is distinctly threefold: first, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> how far art may have been literally directed by spiritual powers; secondly, how far, if not inspired, {{it may have been}} exalted by them; lastly, how far, in any of its agencies, it has advanced the cause of the creeds it has been used to recommend.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> do the Homeric {{descriptions}} of shields tally with the representations of shields in works of art, {{discovered in the}} graves of Mycenae, Spata in Attica, Vaphio in Sparta, and elsewhere? If the descriptions in Homer vary from these relics, {{to what extent do}} they vary? and do the differences arise {{from the fact that the}} poet describes consistently what he sees in his own age, or are the variations caused by late rhapsodists in the Iron Age, who keep the great obsolete shields and bronze weapons, yet introduce the other military gear of their day, say 800-600 B.C.-- gear unknown to the early singers? ...|$|E

60|$|It is true, {{all things}} have two faces, a light {{one and a}} dark. It is true, in three centuries much {{imperfection}} accumulates; many an Ideal, monastic or other, shooting forth into practice as it can, grows to a strange enough Reality; and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> with amazement, Is this your Ideal! For, alas, the Ideal always has {{to grow in the}} Real, and to seek out its bed and board there, often in a very sorry way. No beautifulest Poet is a Bird-of-Paradise, living on perfumes; sleeping in the æther with outspread wings. The Heroic, independent of bed and board, is found in Drury-Lane Theatre only; to avoid disappointments, let us bear this in mind.|$|E

When you declare martial law you punish the innocent with the guilty, in one sense; and so you do in a hundred cases. All <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> is, if it be not wiser and better to disarm demagogues, and those disturbers of the public peace who wish to pervert their right of suffrage to so wicked an end, by so simple a process, than to suffer them to effect their purposes by the most flagrant abuse of their political privileges?" ...|$|E

6000|$|First of all, an {{observation}} of epistemological nature. A geometrical-physical theory as such {{is incapable of}} being directly pictured, being merely a system of concepts. But these concepts serve the purpose of bringing a multiplicity of real or imaginary sensory experiences into connection in the mind. To [...] "visualise" [...] a theory, or bring it home to one's mind, therefore means to give a representation to that abundance of experiences for which the theory supplies the schematic arrangement. In the present case <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> ourselves how we can represent that relation of solid bodies {{with respect to their}} reciprocal disposition (contact) which corresponds to the theory of a finite universe. There is really nothing new in what I have to say about this; but innumerable questions addressed to me prove that the requirements of those who thirst for knowledge of these matters have not yet been completely satisfied.|$|E

It matters not so much what the thing is, as that the builder should really love it and enjoy it, and say so plainly. The architect of Bourges Cathedral liked hawthorns; so he has covered his porch with hawthorn,--it is a perfect Niobe of May. Never was such hawthorn; you would try to gather it forthwith, but {{for fear of being}} pricked. The old Lombard architects liked hunting; so they covered their work with horses and hounds, and men blowing trumpets two yards long. The base Renaissance architects of Venice liked masquing and fiddling; so they covered their work with comic masks and musical instruments. Even that was better than our English way of liking nothing, and professing to like triglyphs.|$|E
60|$|The facts now {{set forth}} {{as to the}} almost total absence of {{mathematical}} faculty in savages and its wonderful development in quite recent times, are exceedingly suggestive, and in regard to them we are limited to two possible theories.

In the former case <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> by what means has this faculty been so rapidly developed in all civilised races, many of which a few centuries back were, in this respect, almost savages themselves; while {{in the latter case}} the difficulty is still greater, for we have to assume the existence of a faculty which had never been used either by the supposed possessors of it or by their ancestors.|$|E

60|$|It must {{be remembered}} we are here dealing solely with the {{capability}} of the Darwinian theory {{to account for the}} origin of the mind, as well as it accounts for the origin of the body of man, and we must, therefore, recall the essential features of that theory. These are, the preservation of useful variations in the struggle for life; that no creature can be improved beyond its necessities for the time being; that the law acts by life and death, and by the survival of the fittest. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> therefore, what relation the successive stages of improvement of the mathematical faculty had to the life or death of its possessors; to the struggles of tribe with tribe, or nation with nation; or to the ultimate survival of one race and the extinction of another. If it cannot possibly have had any such effects, then it cannot have been produced by natural selection.|$|E
6000|$|We have {{considered}} the Socialist criticism of {{the present state of}} affairs in relation to the most important of all public questions, the question of the welfare and upbringing of the next generation.

Is it true that humanity is producing all that it can produce at the present time, and managing everything about as well as it can be managed; that, as a matter of fact, there isn't enough of food and care to go round, and hence the unavoidable anxiety in the life of every one (except {{in the case of a}} small minority of exceptionally secure people), and the absolute wretchedness of vast myriads of the poorer sort? ...|$|E
60|$|Now, this {{conception}} of Socialism as being ultimately {{a moral and}} intellectual synthesis of mankind from which fresh growth may come, sets a fresh test of value upon all {{the activities of the}} Socialist--and opens up altogether new departments for research.

We propose to destroy the competitive capitalistic system that owns and sustains our present newspapers, gives and leaves money to universities, endows fresh pulpits, publishes, advertises, and buys books; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> as reasonable creatures, what new media we propose to give in the place of these accidental and unsatisfactory methods of distributing and exchanging thought. It would almost seem as though current Socialism breathes public opinion as the Middle Ages breathed air, without realizing that it existed, that it might be vitiated or withheld. And so we are beyond the range of prepared and digested Socialist proposals here altogether. It is still open to the Anti-Socialist to allege that Socialism may incidentally destroy itself by choking the channels of its own thinking, and the Socialist has still to reply in vague general terms.|$|E
