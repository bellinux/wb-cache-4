50|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of fibres used: natural fibre and man-made fibre (synthetics or petroleum based).Some natural fibres are linen, the first used historically, hemp, cotton, the most used, ramie, wool, silk and more recently bamboo or soya. Some synthetic fibres are polyester, tencel, viscose, etc. Polyester mixed with cotton (poly-cotton) is often used. Fabrics for shirts are called shirtings. The four main weaves for shirtings are plain weave, oxford, twill and satin. Broadcloth, poplin and end-on-end are variations of the plain <b>weave.</b> After <b>weaving,</b> <b>finishing</b> {{can be applied to}} the fabric.|$|R
50|$|The {{first use}} of an {{integrated}} system, where cotton came in and was spun, bleached dyed and <b>woven</b> into <b>finished</b> cloth, was at mills in Waltham and Lowell, Massachusetts. These became known as Lowell Mills and the Waltham-Lowell system.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Spinning is {{the process}} of {{converting}} cotton or manmade fibre into yarn. India enjoys a strong production base of wide range of fibres from natural fibres like cotton, jute, silk and wool to synthetic, man-made fibres like polyster, viscose, nylon and acrylic. No other country except China has such a diverse base in textile fibres. Small scale, non-integrated spinning, <b>weaving,</b> <b>finishing</b> and apparel making enterprises comprise the major part of the Indian textile industry. Tamilnadu {{is one of the few}} States that adopts the strategy of industrial growth with emphasis on small scale industries. The small scale industries form the backbone of textile industry, so any measure taken by the Government to strengthen the textile industry should focus on the capacity building of these small scale industries...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{his return}} from Amritsar, Chaudry Manzur Elahi teamed with Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi to develop a family owned textile {{business}} in Gujrat. After independence in 1947, the two brothers established two textile units under the names of Gujrat Silk Mills and Pakistan Textile Mills. In 1950, the business was expanded to Lahore where they established Parvez Textile Mills, specializing in <b>weaving,</b> <b>finishing</b> and dyeing. In 1951-52, Chaudhry Manzur Elahi went to Japan to import textile machinery for Gujrat and Lahore units. Armed with his textile education and superior business skills, Chaudry Manzur Elahi’s textile units continued to flourish under his leadership. The family continued to dedicate their energies to their business and set up Modern Flour Mills in Lahore and Rawalpindi. The Chaudhry Family of Gujrat {{has never been a}} bank defaulter.|$|R

5000|$|Cristoforo Crespi {{introduced}} {{the most modern}} spinning, <b>weaving</b> and <b>finishing</b> processes in his Cotton Mill. The Hydroelectric power plant in Trezzo, on the Adda river just a few kilometers upwards, was built up around 1906 for the manufacturer Cristoforo Benigno Crespi. The settlement which was built in 1878 next to the cotton-mill was a village, a residential area provided with social services such as a clinic, a school building, a theatre, a cemetery, a wash-house and a church.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the end of}} the {{traditional}} nomadic lifestyle in Anatolia, and the consequent loss of specific traditions, it has become difficult to identify a genuine [...] "nomadic rug". Social or ethnic groups known for their nomadic lifestyle like the Yürük or Kurds in contemporary Turkey have in large parts acquired sedentary lifestyles. Aspects of the tradition, like the use of specific materials, dyes, <b>weaving</b> or <b>finishing</b> techniques or designs may have been preserved, which can be identified as specifically nomadic or tribal.|$|R
50|$|Alpaca fleece is a lustrous and silky natural fiber. While {{similar to}} sheep’s wool, it is warmer, not prickly, and bears no lanolin, {{which makes it}} hypoallergenic. Without lanolin, it does not repel water. It is also soft and luxurious. In {{physical}} structure, alpaca fiber is somewhat akin to hair, being very glossy. The preparing, carding, spinning, <b>weaving</b> and <b>finishing</b> process of alpaca {{is very similar to}} the process used for wool. Alpaca fiber is also flame-resistant, and meets the US Consumer Product Safety Commission's standards.|$|R
50|$|The raw Pashmina wool is then {{transported to}} the valley of Kashmir in {{northern}} India, where it is entirely hand processed. All steps from combing (removing impurities and guard hair, and aligning fibers) and spinning, to <b>weaving</b> and <b>finishing,</b> is entirely carried out by hand by specialized craftsmen and women. The major center of Pashmina fabric production is the old district of Srinagar, capital of Indian Jammu and Kashmir. The approximate craft time put into producing a single Pashmina stole (70x200cm) is 180 hours.|$|R
5000|$|Authentic Madras {{comes from}} Chennai (Madras); {{both sides of}} the cloth must bear the same pattern; it must be handwoven (evidenced by the small flaws in the fabric).Cotton madras is woven from a fragile, {{short-staple}} cotton fiber that can’t be combed, only carded, [...] resulting in bumps known as slubs which are thick spots in the yarn that give madras its unique texture. The cotton is hand-dyed after being spun into yarn, <b>woven</b> and <b>finished</b> in some 200 small villages in the Madras area.|$|R
50|$|In 1941, founder Benjamin Russell {{died on the}} 16th of December and {{the reins}} of the company were passed to his son Benjamin C. Russell. During World War II, Russell's 'Athletic' Division sold {{primarily}} to the military. Shirts, drawers, T-shirts, athletic garments and special outer garments were made for the Army and Navy. Benjamin C. Russell died in 1945 and was succeeded as president by his brother, Thomas D. Russell.

Later, the union also represented workers employed in manufacturing felt hatting.|$|R
25|$|The roller beam loom is used {{in larger}} Turkish manufactures, but {{is also found in}} Persia and India. It {{consists}} of two movable beams to which the warps are attached. Both beams are fitted with ratchets or similar locking devices. Once a section of the carpet is completed, is rolled on to the lower beam. On a roller beam loom, any length of carpet can be produced. In some areas of Turkey several rugs are woven in series on the same warps, and separated from each other by cutting the warps after the <b>weaving</b> is <b>finished.</b>|$|R
50|$|An oriental rug is woven by {{hand on a}} loom, with warps, wefts, and pile made {{mainly of}} natural fibers like wool, cotton, and silk. In {{representative}} carpets, metal threads made of gold or silver are woven in. The pile consists of hand-spun or machine-spun strings of yarn, which are knotted into the warp and weft foundation. Usually the pile threads are dyed with various natural or synthetic dyes. Once the <b>weaving</b> has <b>finished,</b> the rug is further processed by fastening its borders, clipping the pile to obtain an even surface, and washing, which may use added chemical solutions to modify the colours.|$|R

50|$|Lhasa Carpet Factory is {{a factory}} south of Yanhe Dong Lu near the Tibet University in Lhasa, {{the capital of}} the Tibet Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China. It {{produces}} traditional Tibetan rugs that are exported worldwide through Canton. Although the actual <b>weaving</b> and <b>finishing</b> is done by hand using old-style vertical looms, many of the stages of the process are now mechanised and the dyeing is not done at the factory. It is a modern factory; the largest manufacturer of rugs throughout Tibet employing some 300 workers. Traditionally Tibetan women were the weavers, men the spinners, but both work on the rugs today.|$|R
40|$|Polyester fibers (PET) {{are greatly}} used in {{textiles}} but depend on fossil fuel resources. Poly-(lactic acid) (PLA) is an aliphatic polyester {{that can be}} derived from 100 % renewable resources. The load-extension plot of a polylactide fiber seems to be especially compatible with that of wool. Consequently polyester/wool 55 / 45 and polylactide/wool 55 / 45 yarns were spun using the Sirospun process and plain and twill woven fabrics were industrially produced. Washed and heat set fabrics were subjected to a conventional process of dyeing and decatizing. Fabrics were gradually worn by abrasion using a Martindale wear and abrasion tester.; Using the bursting strength test, the viscoelastic behavior of the fabrics when multidirectional extended was simulated and modeled using a modified non-linear Maxwell model. The three steps of fiber decrimping and orientation, fiber stretching and maximum yield and breaking were analyzed. PET/wool fabrics show a more linear behavior than PLA/wool ones and the influence of <b>weave,</b> <b>finishing</b> and wearing on the viscoelastic behavior of PLA/wool fabrics were highly relevant when compared with that on PET/wool ones. It seems that when blended with PET, wool develops its felting effect during finishing and wearing, while when blended with PLA, the felting effect of wool is hardly developed due to the lower resistance of PLA to hydrolysis and its lower thermal stability. PLA fiber properties need to be improved probably through the development of new L-D lactide (PLDLA) copolymers of different ratios between components and molecular weights to reach the optimal desirable properties for the fiber.
