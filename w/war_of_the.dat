5|$|Following {{the success}} of the 1981 title Defender, Williams searched for new {{creative}} staff. Believing video games to be the future of entertainment, Newcomer left his job as a toy designer to work at the company who hired him to create game ideas as support for development staff. After a few days, he generated a list of ideas that included game ideas for The <b>War</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Worlds and Joust, Newcomer's top two choices. Technical specifications dictated the selection; Newcomer's vision of The <b>War</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Worlds was infeasible, but Joust could be accomplished with Williams' available hardware. A development team was formed, which decided to create the game using Defenders hardware.|$|E

5|$|For some historians, the <b>War</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bavarian Succession was {{the last}} of the old-style Cabinet Wars (Kabinettskriege) of the Ancien Régime in which troops maneuvered while diplomats {{traveled}} between capitals to resolve their monarchs' complaints. The subsequent French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars differed in scope, strategy, organization, and tactics.|$|E

5|$|George {{was active}} in {{directing}} British foreign policy during his early reign. In 1717 he contributed {{to the creation of}} the Triple Alliance, an anti-Spanish league composed of Great Britain, France and the United Provinces. In 1718 the Holy Roman Empire was added to the body which became known as the Quadruple Alliance. The subsequent <b>War</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quadruple Alliance involved the same issue as the <b>War</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Succession. The Treaty of Utrecht (1713) had recognised the grandson of King Louis XIV of France, Philip, as the King of Spain on the condition that he gave up his rights to succeed to the French throne. Upon the death of Louis XIV in 1715, however, Philip sought to overturn the treaty.|$|E
