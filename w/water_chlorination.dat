25|$|In the storm's aftermath, {{humanitarian}} agencies {{had about}} 400operations throughout Haiti to provide relief to storm victims. Several non-government organizations worked to provide needs for storm victims, including ACTED, Action Against Hunger, All Hands Volunteers, CARE, Direct Relief, Lutheran World Relief, Mercy Corps, Oxfam, , Project HOPE, Tzu Chi, World Concern, and World Vision International. These agencies provided water, food, blankets, medicine, plastic sheets, and <b>water</b> <b>chlorination</b> tablets.|$|E
25|$|Permanent <b>water</b> <b>chlorination</b> {{began in}} 1905, when a faulty slow sand filter and a {{contaminated}} water supply {{led to a}} serious typhoid fever epidemic in Lincoln, England. Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stem the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride of lime to the water being treated. The chlorination of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution, the chlorination was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was instituted.|$|E

25|$|UV water {{treatment}} devices {{can be used}} for well water and surface water disinfection. UV treatment compares favorably with other water disinfection systems in terms of cost, labor, and the need for technically trained personnel for operation. <b>Water</b> <b>chlorination</b> treats larger organisms and offers residual disinfection, but these systems are expensive because they need special operator training and a steady supply of a potentially hazardous material. Finally, boiling of water is the most reliable treatment method but it demands labor, and imposes a high economic cost. UV treatment is rapid and, in terms of primary energy use, approximately 20,000 times more efficient than boiling.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Doctors Without Borders, in {{cooperation}} with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, runs three cholera treatment units in Freetown, where more than 500 patients have been treated. The organisation has treated approximately 4,600 patients in Sierra Leone and Guinea since February. The group has begun to establish other cholera treatment centres at 34 Military Hospital in the west of Freetown, expanding the total number of beds from 90 to 200. The group is also collaborating with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation to inform the public of how to avoid contracting the disease. Among the other groups helping victims are Action Firm (AF) and the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society. AF provided free medical care for victims while about 400 volunteers of the Sierra Leone Red Cross helped out on sanitation awareness campaigns. Oxfam, a charity group based in the United Kingdom, is another group that provides nearly 67,000 people in Freetown with emergency <b>water</b> <b>chlorination.</b> Oxfam also plans to assist up to 500,000 people with cholera prevention kits, water purification kits and public information campaigns on how to prevent the disease. The Isle of Man donated to assist the activities in the country through Oxfam. The other British groups mobilised include Save the Children, International Rescue Committee, Concern, Care International and the British Red Cross. The Finnish Red Cross sent medication and doctors to the country on 24 and 25 August. World Vision is also working with the government to prevent the disease from spreading through various activities, including the collection of the garbage pills.

40|$|ONE of {{the major}} {{problems}} associated with the disinfection of <b>water</b> supplies by <b>chlorination</b> is that the organoleptic properties of the chlorinated water may be increased. This malodorous water is often produced by a reaction between the added chlorine and trace concentrations of organic compounds present in the water. By far the most notorious of the organic compounds found in water which increase the taste and odors in the <b>water</b> upon <b>chlorination</b> are phenol and some of its homologs. The nature of the compound or compounds which give rise to "chlorophenolic " tastes and odors resulting from the reaction between aqueous chlorine and phenolic compounds, has been repeatedly investigated (ADAMS, 1931; ETTINGER, 1951; ETTINGER and RUCHOFT, 1951; INGOLS and RIDENOUR, 1948; TODD, 1947). However, very little was known with certainty about the chemical reactions involved in the production or destruction of chlorophenolic tastes and odor until recent appearances of a significant paper by BURTTSCHELL, ROSEN, MIDDLETON and ETTINGER (1959). In their important study, the chlorophenols that are formed from the chlorination of phenol in dilute aqueous solutions were for the time isolated and identified. From...|$|R

40|$|Point-of-use <b>water</b> treatment, {{especially}} <b>chlorination,</b> is {{an effective}} intervention to reduce diarrhoea, {{a leading cause of}} death for children under five. Yet success in chlorination uptake has been limited. One obstacle is objection to treated water's taste/odour. Protective chlorine residuals that are not offensive to users require accurate dosing - a challenge in practice. Further, taste sensitivity may be different for populations never exposed to chlorinated <b>water.</b> Here, household <b>chlorination</b> trials in Bangladesh similarly revealed dissatisfaction with treated water due to taste and odour, although attempts to quantify chlorine sensitivity disputed the dissatisfaction at lower residuals. A granular activated carbon (GAC) filter fitted to the spigot of a covered tank removed the remaining chlorine residual prior to drinking and increased user satisfaction. Such a filter removes taste as a barrier and allows over-dosing contaminated water to ensure disinfection, with implications for areas with high source water variability and for emergency situations...|$|R
40|$|Trihalomethanes (THMs) {{are formed}} in water the {{chlorine}} used in water-treatment plants react with organic matter. THMs are suspected carcinogens. The {{goal of this}} study is determination of the concentration of THMS in potable <b>water</b> after <b>chlorination.</b> The study included 60 samples of potable water from water facilities that draw water from accumulations and 70 samples of potable water from water facilities that draw water from boreholes and springs. Samples were analysed by GC-ECD method with headspace technique. The obtained results for individual THMs in samples of potable water that draw water from accumulations, range from 15 – 55 µg/l for chloroform; 12 – 27 µg/l for dichlorobromomethane; 2 - 6 µg/l for chlorodibromomethane and 3 – 13 µg/l for bromoform. The obtained results for individual THMs in samples of potable water that draw water from boreholes and springs range from 5 – 15 µg/l for chloroform; 1 - 5 µg/l for dichlorobromomethane; 1 - 3 µg/l for chlorodibromomethane and 1 - 5 µg/l for bromoform.
