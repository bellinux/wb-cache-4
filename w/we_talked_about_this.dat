30|$|During {{the meeting}} several {{concerns}} arose, e.g., scope of issues is too extensive, {{the most important}} ones which were selected {{to be worked on}} will be discussed here. A major issue was that team members wanted to be more proactive when dealing with problems and bottlenecks. Although they identified a major bottleneck in their workflow, they ignored it for a while and waited for someone else to resolve it for them. This was mentioned by team members as both an advantage and disadvantage of Kanban. On the pro side problems and bottlenecks become visible quite early, but on the con side, if nobody feels responsible and the bottleneck is not resolved, the WIP limit stops the whole development process. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> and it was explained to them, that this is one purpose of WIP limits, to make it impossible to ignore problems and bottlenecks so they have to be resolved and not linger on for all eternity. If they still choose to ignore it, they will soon see the consequences. They understood this explanation and consequently they made a time-phased plan how to resolve this bottleneck and immediately took the first steps. Another effect of this situation was, that they want to give the work on the project more priority, so this “Waiting for Godot” will not happen again. As this is a more vague resolution we plan on examining this strategy in the future.|$|E
30|$|There {{are many}} {{countries}} in the world which are experiencing a variety of problems. Poverty, for example is bad conditions in which people are unable to have their basic needs. Poor people do not have the necessary resources and capacity to have basic needs like food, shelter, health and education. They live under difficult conditions which do not help them to develop their human potential. The other social issue is unemployment. Unemployment and poverty can be harmful for social relations. They can destroy harmony and unity of the family and they can create a feeling of dependence on others. Such effects stop the development of responsibility and self-dependence. Similarly important issue is gender discrimination. Women and men are equally important for the growth and development of individual and social lives. Unfortunately men are thought to have major roles in the society. This discrimination can be seen in work places by giving highly prestigious jobs and higher salary to men. The other important issue is divorce. Much of society has accepted divorce as the solution for a bad marriage. Children of divorce experience psychological harm, health problems, depression and loss of motivation for future life. Crime is one of major social problems presently. Criminal acts of violence may arise within families, within friends or within the whole society. Crime has an impact on {{the quality of life of}} the people in society including human injury, destruction, and dehumanization. Banishing criminals to prisons have also become the ground for future violence. Addiction is also one of the important social issues. It can be the cause or the effect of the problems <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about.</b> <b>This</b> not only affects the people whom it directly touches but its effect spread along the society in the form of various diseases like HIV or criminal acts.|$|E
40|$|A devastating {{earthquake}} {{had been}} predicted for May 11, 2011 in Rome. This prediction was never released officially by anyone, but it {{grew up in}} the Internet and was amplified by media. It was erroneously ascribed to Raffaele Bendandi, an Italian self-taught natural scientist who studied planetary motions. Indeed, around May 11, 2011, a planetary alignment was really expected and this contributed to give credibility to the earthquake prediction among people. During the previous months, INGV was overwhelmed with requests for information about this presumed prediction by Roman inhabitants and tourists. Given the considerable mediatic impact of this expected earthquake, INGV decided to organize an Open Day in its headquarter in Rome devoted to the public who wanted {{to learn more about the}} Italian seismicity and the earthquake as natural phenomenon. The Open Day was preceded by a press conference two days before, in which <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> prediction, we presented the Open Day, and we had a scientific discussion with journalists about the earthquake prediction and more in general on the real problem of seismic risk in Italy. About 40 journalists from newspapers, local and national tv's, press agencies and web news attended the Press Conference and hundreds of articles appeared in the following days, advertising the 11 May Open Day. The INGV opened to the public all day long (9 am - 9 pm) with the following program: i) meetings with INGV researchers to answer scientific questions; ii) visits to the seismic monitoring room, open 24 h/ 7 all year; iii) guided tours through interactive exhibitions on earthquakes and Earth's deep structure; iv) conferences on general topics from the social impact of rumors to seismic risk reduction; v) 13 new short videos on our channel YouTube. com/INGVterremoti to explain the earthquake process and with updates on various aspects of seismic monitoring in Italy; vi) distribution of books and brochures. Surprisingly, more than 3000 visitors came to visit INGV headquarters until 9 p. m. : families, school classes with and without teachers, civil protection groups, journalists. This initiative, built up in a few weeks, had a very large feedback, also due to the media highlighting the presumed prediction. Although we could not rule out the possibility of a strong earthquake in central Italy (with effects in Rome) we tried to explain the real meaning of short term earthquake prediction vs. probabilistic seismic hazard assessment. Despite many people remained with the fear (many decided to take a day off and leave the town or stay in public parks), we contributed to reduce this feeling and therefore the social cost of this strange roman day. Moreover, another lesson learned is that these (fortunately sporadic) circumstances, when people's attention is high, are important opportunities for science communication. We thank all the INGV colleagues who contributed to the May 11 Open Day, in particular the Press Office, the educational and Outreach laboratory, the Graphics Laboratory and the SissaMedialab. P.
