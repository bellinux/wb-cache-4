25|$|This method {{starts to}} fail when the noise source {{is close to}} the signal wires; the closer wire will couple with the noise more {{strongly}} and the common-mode rejection of the receiver <b>will</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> eliminate it.

One pair can induce crosstalk in another and it is additive {{along the length of the}} cable.

25|$|All {{statistical}} hypothesis tests have a probability of making type I and type II errors. For example, all blood tests for a disease will falsely detect {{the disease in}} some proportion {{of people who do}}n't have it, and <b>will</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> detect the disease in some proportion of people who do have it. A test's probability of making a type I error is denoted by α. A test's probability of making a type II error is denoted by β. These error rates are traded off against each other: for any given sample set, the effort to reduce one type of error generally results in increasing the other type of error. For a given test, the only way to reduce both error rates is to increase the sample size, and this may not be feasible.|$|E

25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, {{there will be a}} glow {{discharge}} across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp <b>will</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.|$|E
500|$|Reuters {{reported}} that the amended NZ ETS allowed unlimited imports of offsets and that business groups largely backed the changes, while environmental groups largely felt that the NZ ETS would not do enough to reduce emissions. In March 2010, Reuters {{reported that}} the NZ ETS had [...] "no emissions cap nor any limit {{on the number of}} free carbon permits for energy-intensive companies that export their products". Reuters noted that the absence of a cap and the two-tonnes-for-one-unit surrender arrangement had led to [...] "accusations of some big polluters getting a free ride and that the scheme <b>will</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> cut emissions of planet-warming gases".|$|E
500|$|Duals {{cannot be}} formed for every graph. [...] Duality {{requires}} that every tie set has a dual cut {{set in the}} dual graph. [...] This condition is met {{if and only if}} the graph is mappable on to a sphere with no branches crossing. [...] To see this, note that a tie set is required to [...] "tie off" [...] a graph into two portions and its dual, the cut set, is required to cut a graph into two portions. [...] The graph of a finite network which will not map on to a sphere will require an n-fold torus. [...] A tie set that passes through a hole in a torus <b>will</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> tie the graph into two parts. [...] Consequently, the dual graph will not be cut into two parts and will not contain the required cut set. [...] Consequently, only planar graphs have duals.Suresh, p.517 ...|$|E

500|$|Gaseous {{mercury is}} used in mercury-vapor lamps and some [...] "neon sign" [...] type {{advertising}} signs and fluorescent lamps. Those low-pressure lamps emit very spectrally narrow lines, which are traditionally used in optical spectroscopy for calibration of spectral position. Commercial calibration lamps are sold for this purpose; reflecting a fluorescent ceiling light into a spectrometer is a common calibration practice. Gaseous mercury {{is also found in}} some electron tubes, including ignitrons, thyratrons, and mercury arc rectifiers. It is also used in specialist medical care lamps for skin tanning and disinfection. Gaseous mercury is added to cold cathode argon-filled lamps to increase the ionization and electrical conductivity. An argon-filled lamp without mercury will have dull spots and <b>will</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> light correctly. Lighting containing mercury can be bombarded/oven pumped only once. When added to neon filled tubes the light produced will be inconsistent red/blue spots until the initial burning-in process is completed; eventually it will light a consistent dull off-blue color.|$|E
500|$|Like {{transmission}} line filters, waveguide filters always have multiple passbands, {{replicas of the}} lumped element prototype. [...] In most designs, only the lowest frequency passband is useful (or lowest two {{in the case of}} band-stop filters) and the rest are considered unwanted spurious artefacts. [...] This is an intrinsic property of the technology and cannot be designed out, although design can have some control over the frequency position of the spurious bands. [...] Consequently, in any given filter design, there is an upper frequency beyond which the filter <b>will</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> carry out its function. [...] For this reason, true low-pass and high-pass filters cannot exist in waveguide. [...] At some high frequency there will be a spurious passband or stopband interrupting the intended function of the filter. [...] But, similar to the situation with waveguide cutoff frequency, the filter can be designed so that the edge of the first spurious band is well above any frequency of interest.|$|E

Zenbooks have been generally well received due to their chassis design and appearance {{as well as the}} high quality screens used in later models.

Some models (such as the UX32) suffer from lockdown when the lithium polymer battery cell gets drained or discharged below its recommended threshold, for example if the device is left on and unattended. The result is that the charger <b>will</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> recharge the battery even when plugged in, leaving the machine in a near-complete unresponsive off-state. The machine can often be revived by pressing the power-on key for 10 seconds, whereupon it will start recharging.|$|E
