500|$|The {{predecessor}} to Burger King, Insta-Burger King, began deploying {{the original}} broiling device in 1952 when its owners, Matthew Burns and Kieth Kramer, acquired {{the rights to}} George Read's Inst-Shake and Insta-Broiler machines. The Insta-Broiler cooked the burgers in a <b>wire</b> <b>basket</b> between two broilers, allowing the burgers to be cooked on both sides simultaneously. The machine was capable of cooking over 400 patties per hour, which allowed the company to grow rapidly. When McLamore and Edgarton opened their first Insta-Burger King location in Miami, they revamped the unit into {{what they called a}} [...] "flame broiler" [...] – the forerunner of the modern unit used by Burger King today. After the acquisition of Insta-Burger King in 1954, the pair contracted the construction of the newly designed flame broilers to the SaniServ company of Indianapolis, Indiana, for the initial run of broilers. Eventually, the company moved the manufacturing contract for the broiler units to Nieco Automatic Broilers of Windsor, California, who manufactured all subsequent units until the start of the 2000s.|$|E
500|$|Like its menu, the {{equipment}} the company cooks its hamburgers with has also evolved {{as the company}} grew. The burgers have always been broiled mechanically; the original unit, called an Insta-Broiler, {{was one of two}} pieces of equipment the founders of Insta-Burger King purchased before opening their new restaurant. The Insta-Broiler worked by cooking 12 burger patties in a <b>wire</b> <b>basket,</b> allowing the patties to be cooked from both sides simultaneously. With the acquisition of the chain by its Miami franchisees came an improved unit dubbed a [...] "Flame Broiler". Designed by the new owners, it featured stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain. The unit broke down less often, while maintaining a similar cooking rate. The cooking format remained for the next 40 years until Burger King developed a new, variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times. These new unit began testing in 1999 and eventually evolved into the two models the company deployed system-wide in 2008–2009. Accompanying these new broilers was new food-holding equipment and a computer-based product monitoring system for its cooked products. The new system allows for more concise tracking of product quality, while giving its users a method to streamline costs by more precisely projecting sales and product usage ...|$|E
2500|$|Cretors's {{invention}} {{introduced the}} first patented steam-driven popcorn machine that popped corn in oil. Previously, vendors popped corn by holding a <b>wire</b> <b>basket</b> {{over an open}} flame. At best, {{the result was a}} hot, dry, unevenly cooked snack. Cretors's machine popped corn in a mixture of one-third clarified butter, two-thirds lard, and salt. This mixture can withstand the [...] temperature needed to pop corn and it produces little smoke. A fire under a boiler created steam that drove a small engine; that engine drove the gears, shaft, and agitator that stirred the corn and powered a small automated clown puppet-like figure, [...] "the Toasty Roasty Man," [...] an attention attracting amusement intended to drum up business. A wire connected {{to the top of the}} cooking pan allowed the operator to disengage the drive mechanism, lift the cover, and dump popped corn into the storage bin beneath. Exhaust from the steam engine was piped to a hollow pan below the corn storage bin and kept freshly popped corn uniformly warm for the first time. Excess steam was also used to operate a small, shrill whistle to further attract attention.|$|E

He studied Mr. Wrenn, smiled, put on the look he used when inviting him out for a drink. Mr. Guilfogle was essentially an honest fellow, harshened by The Job; a well-satisfied victim, with the imagination clean gone out of him, so that he took follow-up letters and the celerity of office-boys as the only serious things in the world.

While perfecting his secret recipe with 11 herbs and spices, Sanders found that pan frying chicken was too slow, requiring 30 minutes per order. French frying the chicken in a <b>wire</b> <b>basket</b> immersed in deep fat required half the time, but produced dry, unevenly done chicken. In 1939 he found that using a pressure cooker produced tasty, moist chicken in eight or nine minutes. By July 1940 Sanders finalized {{what came to be}} known as his Original Recipe.|$|E

40|$|BECAUSE of the {{increased}} use of me-chanical techniques for handling eggs during the past few years, a greater loss due to egg shell breakage is occurring. Pre-viously, many of the fragile eggs broke when the producer collected them in <b>wire</b> <b>baskets,</b> but now papier-mache trays which have replaced <b>wire</b> <b>baskets</b> protect the eggs during the mechanical handling process, and more fragile eggs leave the producer for supermarkets and consumers. Breakage of fragile eggs amounted to approximately 3 percent of the total eggs produced during 196 S (Anonymous, 1966) which resulted in a $ 25 million loss. In addition to this eco-nomic loss, a public health hazard is associ-ated with bacterial contamination of broken egg shells. Marketers are also con-cerned about the annoyance customers ex-perience from broken eggs. Improvements in shell quality are not occurring fast enough to meet the need. Ac-cording to Peterson (1965) the following factors have been identified as affecting shell quality: (1) Genetic strain—some genetic strains produce thin-shelled eggs. (2) Rate of egg production—as the pro-duction rate increases the shells be-come thinner. (3) The diet of the hen—calcium is re-quired. (4) The age of the bird—eggs produce...|$|R

The frame and drivetrain must be constructed to handle loads several times that of an ordinary bicycle; as such, extra low gears may be added. Other specific design considerations include operator visibility and load suspension. Many, but not all, cycles used for the purpose of vending goods such as ice cream cart trikes or hot dog vending trikes are cargo bicycles.|$|E

In order to activate the chef's pass, either the contestant or the chef must place their towel into a <b>wire</b> <b>basket</b> just outside the kitchen area.

5000|$|Although the {{invention}} of the salad spinner is considered to be modern, earlier devices, including one from the 19th century, did exist and performed similar functions. When the salad spinner was introduced to the mass market in the 1970s, a number of other techniques and products were already available and employed for the drying of vegetables and salad. One such device was a <b>wire</b> <b>basket</b> dryer, in essence a collapsible colander, which could be shaken or spun to expel the excess water. This method has been criticized by some for its impracticalities and according to one writer, the process was [...] "akin to standing near a dog that’s shaking himself dry." [...] Another product was a wire lettuce dryer designed for use in the sink. A basket was fixed with suction cups {{to the bottom of the}} sink, and pushing a pump caused the basket to spin around a center post, often spraying expelled water on the operator. Paper or fabric towels were also commonly used for drying salad and vegetables after washing, however the method was perceived as time-consuming and costly.|$|E
