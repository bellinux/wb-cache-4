500|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Gray said of her character's persona: I never {{wanted her to be}} boring. She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about what we would do with her. Where <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact is she going to make on her life, on John Ross's life, on her future? Who is she? ...|$|E
500|$|Although Chloe {{appeared}} {{alongside her}} television cohorts in the Smallville comic books, which featured tie-ins to the Chloe Chronicles webisodes, DC writers hoped to bring Chloe into DC continuity {{at least as}} early as 2007. The character ultimately made her first appearance in the mainstream [...] in 2010. According to writer Kurt Busiek, the problem of bringing Chloe into the mainstream comic book universe, and keeping her television background, was {{that she would have}} filled two roles: [...] "the Girl from Back Home and the Reporter". Those roles were already filled by the adult comic book versions of Lana Lang and Lois Lane, so the plan was to give the character a new background. Busiek hoped to make Chloe the younger sister of someone Clark had gone to school with, who was a now interning at the Daily Planet. Busiek believed that this would make her different from Lana and Lois, but still familiar to readers who also watched the show. Another distinguishing feature would be that this version of Chloe would not know Clark's secret, nor <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> meteor infected. These ideas never came to fruition.|$|E

60|$|Had she hidden away? There was {{no place}} to hide in. But Grimes looked about, and Tom also, for he was as puzzled as Grimes himself at her disappearing so suddenly; but look where they <b>would,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not there.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{she feels}} {{as if she is}} the fulcrum, Agnes begins and ends the play on her musings of insanity. She wonders if she could just {{suddenly}} slip off into madness and what that would be like. She wonders what her husband would do if that happened. <b>Would</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> an embarrassment to him? Embarrassment is a very large issue with Agnes. She is easily embarrassed by her sister Claire, who Agnes believes has wasted her life and her potential. When Claire insists that she is not an alcoholic, Agnes states sarcastically, “that’s very nice.” Then she lists times that Claire has vomited, fallen down, and called from the club to have someone come and get her. She concludes this commentary with the words: “If we change for the worse with drink, we are an alcoholic.” ...|$|E

60|$|I {{was miserable}} with curiosity {{to know what}} it <b>was</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> tell him, but she did not say, and I did not expect <b>she</b> <b>would.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> but a child, it <b>is</b> true; but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not a chatterer to tell great matters and make herself {{important}} to little people; no, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> reserved, and kept things to herself, as the truly great always do.|$|R

60|$|Anthea laughed, {{though it}} cost her a slight effort. <b>She</b> <b>was,</b> at least, {{glad that he}} had {{addressed}} her unconcernedly, and as a yacht-hand <b>would.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> also quite aware that young ladies who go rowing in small dories, or venture into the wilderness, have to submit to being carried occasionally; but, for all that, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> sooner the suggestion {{had been made by}} another man.|$|R

60|$|Still Jeanie {{remained}} in the same posture, looking out upon the sea.

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> honest. Here, too, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{have no need}} of allowances. No temptation {{would be}} strong enough to make her do a mean act or think a mean thought, for her courage would give her {{strength}}, and her strength would make her proof against temptation. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> kind.

6000|$|... "That's how <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> You {{could never}} <b>be</b> sure what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> up to next.

5000|$|... "Adelaide Abankwah" [...] {{appeared}} in the USA in 1997 from Ghana. She claimed that she had inherited {{the position of a}} female chief of her tribe after her mother had died. The position, however, demanded that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a virgin. <b>She</b> {{had fallen in love with}} a Christian and if she went back, the tribe <b>would</b> discover <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not a virgin any more and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> forced to submit to genital mutilation. Thus she applied for political asylum on March 29, 1997.|$|R
60|$|Accompanied by Anjou, {{she sought}} {{him in his}} cabinet, nor <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> denied.

6000|$|... "What is the matter?" [...] {{shouted the}} {{newcomer}} {{in the deep}} tones that the girl recognized as belonging to the black sergeant.

6000|$|It was sagely said, and Clement knew {{pretty well}} {{who was the}} one person from whom Sophy had fears.

60|$|So {{it turned}} out. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> an {{eccentric}} creature, full of life, fire, and fun, excessively short and plain, but remarkably strong. <b>She</b> had <b>been</b> forsaken by her nephew, she said.
