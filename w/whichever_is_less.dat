The maximum salary of the replacement player is either 50% of the injured player's salary, or the mid-level exception for a non-taxpaying team, <b>whichever</b> <b>is</b> <b>less.</b> This exception requires an NBA-designated doctor to verify the extent of the injury.

40|$|An F- 14 A {{aircraft}} was modified {{for use as}} the test-bed aircraft for the variable-sweep transition flight experiment (VSTFE) program. The VSTFE program was a laminar flow research program designed to measure the effects of wing sweep on laminar flow. The airplane was modified by adding an upper surface foam and fiberglass glove to the right wing. An existing left wing glove had been added for the previous phase of the program. Ground vibration and flight flutter testing were accomplished to verify the absence of aeroelastic instabilities within a flight envelope of Mach 0. 9 or 450 knots, calibrated airspeed, <b>whichever</b> <b>was</b> <b>less.</b> Flight test data indicated satisfactory damping levels and trends for the elastic structural modes of the airplane.

40|$|Accuracy in dose and position, {{defined as}} {{complementary}} criteria, was determined for blocked photon field calculations {{with a pencil}} beam based treatment planning system. The concept of field accuracy {{has been defined as}} a combination of deviations in dose and position. Absolute dose deviations were measured including the deviations in beam output (monitor units), depth doses and dose profiles. Based on this verification work it was concluded that the pencil bean model is capable of calculating dose distributions in blocked photon fields (6 MV and 25 MV) {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. The measurements and calculations mostly agreed within 3 % or 3 mm, <b>whichever</b> <b>was</b> <b>less,</b> relative to a reference dose at 10 cm depth. Furthermore, the model behaves consistently because a substantial part of the discrepancies found could be ascribed to fundamental assumptions in the model related to electron contamination and primary block transmission. The concept 'field accuracy' allows an easy, quantitative and comprehensive comparison to common quality requirements giving, for example, equal weight to percent dose difference and to millimetre isodose distance. The method offers the possibility to focus on calculation accuracy which excludes some experimental sources of error. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd...|$|R

5000|$|Aid to {{displaced}} families: The act {{created a}} new program to assist states in aiding families displaced by urban highway construction. Families could only be relocated with federal funds if the new housing {{was not in a}} crime-ridden neighborhood, was environmentally sound, and had good-quality sanitation (plumbing, sewage, etc.). States wishing to participate in this program were required to enact enabling legislation by July 1970. States were also required to comply with the provisions of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The federal government assumed 100 {{percent of the cost of}} property acquisition, up to $25,000. It also provided up to $5,000 for a one-, two-, or three-family dwellings (provided the displaced person purchased a new home within the year), and $1,500 for apartment dwellers. Property owners were also reimbursed (tax free) for recording fees, transfer taxes, and any early mortgage payments they were forced to make after purchasing new property consequent to highway construction. Displaced persons were able to apply for 100 percent reimbursement of their relocation moving costs, or in lieu of actual costs a $200 moving allowance and $100 dislocation allowance. Businesses or farms which were relocated were eligible to receive their average annual net earnings or $5,000, <b>whichever</b> <b>was</b> <b>less.</b> (Businesses could only apply if relocation caused a [...] "substantial loss" [...] of patronage and it was a single-site operation.) States were also required to provide relocation counseling for free.|$|R
5000|$|The Cartier Railway is an {{engineering}} marvel and was constructed using all the modern, state-of-the art techniques {{available at the}} time, including making extensive use of aerial mapping to select the best route through the very mountainous terrain. The initial 190 mi rail line used natural drainage extensively by following the Rochers and Toulnustouc River valleys to keep the grades at a minimum. The ruling grade for southbound loaded trains was kept to a very easy 0.4% while the northbound ruling grade was only 1.35%. Numerous rock cuts had to be blasted and five tunnels, ranging from 350 to 1440 ft, were built where rock cuts weren't possible. The heavy haul nature of this railway, all rail, including sidings and yard tracks made all constructed be using [...] rail in 78 ft lengths. Since curves account for 54.3% of the main line, extensive use of flange oilers was needed. The oilers were located every 8 mi or 250 degrees of curvature, <b>whichever</b> <b>was</b> <b>less.</b> Granite, blasted and removed during construction of the harbor at Port Cartier was crushed and used as ballast on the first 54 mi of the line, while local pit-run gravel {{was used for the}} remainder. Twenty-two bridges were needed for the railroad, with the bridge at Milepost 68.5 being the longest (880 ft) and highest (120 ft) on the line. The railway also required the construction of 1,524 culverts for drainage.|$|R
40|$|The joint {{evolution}} of major genes under viability selection and a modifier locus that controls recombination between the major genes, mutation {{at the major}} gene, or migration between two demes is studied. The modifying locus is selectively neutral and may have an arbitrary number of alleles. For each case a class of polymorphic equilibria exists in which the frequencies of the modifying alleles are those computed by assuming that the recombination, mutation, or migration rates were viabilities and in which the major and modifier loci are not statistically associated. These are called viability-analogous Hardy-Weinberg (VAHW) equilibria. A new allele introduced near these equilibria will enter the population if its marginal average rate of recombination, mutation, or migration (<b>whichever</b> applies) <b>is</b> <b>less</b> than the population average prior to its introduction.
