40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{seeks to}} analyze the {{development}} of SB 1070 and the politics that surrounded the bill. Also, I move {{to understand why the}} socially constructed borders in the minds of people on the issue of identification are just as hardened as the US-Mexico divide. By understanding the historical context of SB 1070, I will show that the bill is a mix of a political manipulation of understanding and fear mongering. The operational research questions that guide my inquiry are: 1. What narratives were used to justify SB 1070 in April of 2010 ? a. <b>Why</b> <b>were</b> <b>these</b> narratives successful? b. <b>Why</b> <b>were</b> <b>these</b> issues important {{at the time of the}} debate? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> this issue salient both locally and nationally? c. What specific events and images were used to support each actor's narratives? 2. How do each of these narratives seek to transform social praxis? a. What is the importance of race in each of these narratives? b. How does American nationalism play into these narratives? Throughout the thesis, I argue that SB 1070 came into existence and was passed because of Jan Brewer and Russell Pearce's use of reductionist representations of undocumented immigrants. <b>These</b> representations <b>were</b> made more successful and reified by a series of events highlighted throughout the debate of SB 1070 to include the terrorist attacks of 9 / 11, the economic recession in the United States, and the murder of a well-known rancher in the lead-up to the bill's passage.

60|$|But we will follow, a little, our metaphor. Christ, as I said, has {{put himself}} under {{the term of}} a physician; consequently, he desireth that his fame, as to the {{salvation}} of sinners, may spread abroad, that the world may see what he can do. And to this end, has not only commanded that the biggest sinners should have the first offer of his mercy, but has, as physicians do,11 put out his bills, and published his doings, that things may be read and talked of. Yea, he has, moreover, in these, his blessed bills, the holy scriptures I mean, inserted the very names of persons, the places of their abode, and the great cures that, by the means of his salvation, he has wrought upon them to this very end. Here is, Item, such an one, by my grace and redeeming blood, was made a monument of everlasting life; and such an one, by my perfect obedience, became an heir of glory. And then he produceth their names. Item, I saved Lot from the guilt and damnation that he had procured for himself by his incest. Item, I saved David from the vengeance that belonged to him for committing of adultery and murder. Here is, also, Solomon, Manasseh, Peter, Magdalene, and many others, made mention of in this book. Yea, here are their names, their sins, and their salvations recorded together, that you may read and know what a Saviour he is, and do him honour in the world. For <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>these</b> things thus recorded, but to show to sinners what he can do, to the praise and glory of his grace? And it is observable, as I said before, we have but {{very little of the}} salvation of little sinners mentioned in God's book, because that would not have answered the design, to wit, to bring glory and fame to the name of the Son of God.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>these</b> {{exquisite}} birds so rare, even {{in situations}} so favourable {{to them as}} the one I have described? Are they killed by severe frosts? An ornithological friend from Oxfordshire assures me {{that it will take}} several favourable seasons to make good the losses of the late terrible winter of 1891-92. But this, as every ornithologist knows, is only a part of the truth. The large number of stuffed kingfishers under glass shades that one sees in houses of all descriptions, in town and country, but most frequently in the parlours of country cottages and inns, tell a melancholy story. Some time ago a young man showed me three stuffed kingfishers in a case, and informed me that he had shot them at a place (which he named) quite close to London. He said that these three birds were the last of their kind ever seen there; that he had gone, week after week and watched and waited, until one by one, at long intervals, he had secured them all; and that two years had passed since the last one was killed, and no other kingfisher had been seen at the place. He added that the waterside which these birds had frequented was resorted to by crowds of London working people on Saturday afternoons, Sundays and other holidays; the fact that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pairs of tired eyes would have been freshened and gladdened by the sight of their rare gem-like beauty only made him prouder of his achievement. This young man was a cockney of the small shop-keeping class--a Philistine of the Philistines--hence there was no call to feel surprise at his self-glorification over such a matter. But what shall we say of that writer whose masterly works on English rural life are familiar to everyone, who is regarded as first among [...] "lovers of nature," [...] when he relates that he invariably carried a gun when out of doors, mainly with the object of shooting any kingfisher he might chance to see, as the dead bird always formed an acceptable present to the cottager's wife, who would get it stuffed and keep it as an ornament on her parlour mantelshelf! ...|$|E

Or was it, as the semi-pagan creed of some Christians taught, that God did not constantly overrule the world he had created (i. 1)? With the former Salvian will not argue (iii. 1). To the latter he replies by asserting that [...] "just as the navigating steersman never loses the helm, so does God never remove his care from the world". Hence {{the title of the}} treatise.|$|R
