5|$|Moodu Pani marked A. R. Rahman's first {{association}} with Ilaiyaraaja; the former (then known by his birth name Dilip) {{worked as a}} keyboardist in the film. During the re-recording of Moodu Pani soundtrack and score, Ilaiyaraaja fired his original keyboardist, due to the person's drinking behaviour. At that time, another one of his troupe members asked Ilaiyaraaja to meet a boy named Dilip, <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to play the keyboard. Ilaiyaraaja agreed and sent for Dilip, whom he instructed regarding the notes and tune he had to play. Dilip, under Ilaiyaraaja's supervision, successfully completed the re-recording process.|$|E
5|$|On signing for Roma, Marquinhos {{described}} himself as a quick player with a good sense of position <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to impose himself on a game. He named Thiago Silva as his role model. In March 2015, Marquinhos told FourFourTwo that despite his average height for a defender, he compensated with honing his strength and timing, attributes he learnt from PSG assistant manager Claude Makélélé. He praised manager Laurent Blanc, a former defender himself, for encouraging the PSG defenders to attack in set pieces and teaching them the correct positioning in that situation.|$|E

Nansouty's 9th Cavalry was brigaded together with the 17th Dragoon Regiment, with General Delmas de La Coste as commander. The brigade performed well against Austrian cavalry in two distinct actions {{at the end of}} May of that year. General of Division Michaud, the commander-in-chief of France's Army of the Rhine, noted in his report that Delmas's two regiments showed bravery and intrepidity every time they faced the enemy. In July, the 9th Cavalry was involved in several well-led cavalry actions and Nansouty acquired an excellent reputation, recognised as a disciplinarian and a commander <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to drill his men effectively.|$|E

25|$|In September 1998 {{the band}} {{recorded}} their third album Grande Rock. Due {{to the absence}} of a second guitarist, Lindström and Hellberg both contributed on guitar. The album's 1970s classic rock sound was a departure from their previous albums, which featured a louder Detroit punk rock and garage rock sound. One reason for this was that the band recorded the album in an older studio from the 1970s in the Swedish woods, where they learned from an older and more experienced engineer <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to create the vintage seventies sound the band desired.|$|E

25|$|Though Jayewardene indeed did {{not take}} {{measures}} to stop the attack on Tamils, he was not opposed to them personally, only politically.

This is but one close Tamil friend of the president's, and it is quite clear that he was not a racist but rather a man <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to exploit racism to win the majority.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} few shrewder captains than Ian Chappell, <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to squeeze the last drop out of any {{situation}} that might help give his team an advantage. He was an absolute master at putting pressure on the opposition {{with just the right}} run rate or with a field that could be almost impossible to pierce... Some of his tactics were quite intimidatory and stank of out-and-out gamesmanship that made old pros like me wince. It was an open secret that he used to encourage his players to give a lot of verbal abuse to rival batsman when they were at the wicket in an attempt to break their concentration.|$|E
25|$|The guqin {{is nearly}} always used a solo instrument, as its {{quietness}} of tone {{means that it}} cannot compete {{with the sounds of}} most other instruments or an ensemble. It can, however, be played together with a xiao (end-blown bamboo flute), with other qin, or played while singing. In old times, the se (a long zither with movable bridges and 25 strings) was frequently used in duets with the qin. Sadly, the se has not survived, though duet tablature scores for the instruments are preserved in a few qinpu, and the master qin player Wu Jinglüe was one of only a few in the twentieth century <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to play it together with qin in duet. Lately there has been a trend to use other instruments to accompany the qin, such as the xun (ceramic ocarina), pipa (four-stringed pear-shaped lute), dizi (transverse bamboo flute), and others for more experimental purposes.|$|E

25|$|The {{market has}} also had famous seller, such as Ignacio Contreras, better known as “El Chacharitas,” who was noted among {{collectors}} as able to obtain all kinds of valuable objects at elevated prices. However, those <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to bargain could obtain significant discounts. El Chacharitas states that the sale of antiques {{was a very good}} business in the past but less so now. Much of the reason is the degradation of the neighborhood, and the invasion of those selling mass-produced, unlicensed and counterfeit merchandise. The antiques market also has been hurt by Mexico City mayor Marcelos Ebrard’s decision to close roads in and around the historic center as well as Paseo de la Reforma to vehicular traffic on Sundays, the day this market operates. For some vendors, business is down by as much as sixty percent, as many upper class residents will not use public transportation to get to this market.|$|E
25|$|The {{club was}} {{purchased}} by Calabrese entrepreneur Aldo Spinelli in 1985 and despite no longer having Simoni as manager, Genoa were finishing in {{the top half of}} Serie B. After a slip in form during 1987–88 (failing to be promoted by a mere point in 1986–87, then having to struggle not to be retroceded the following season, being spared that fate again by a mere point), Genoa refocused their energy and were able to achieve promotion back into Serie A in 1988–89, finishing as champions ahead of Bari. Genoa, with an experienced trainer as Osvaldo Bagnoli <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to make the best out of underdog teams (he managed to win a championship at the helm of Hellas Verona in the eighties) and with a team sporting the talents of Carlos Aguilera and Tomáš Skuhravý among others achieved highs during the 1990–91 season where they finished fourth, remaining undefeated at home for the entire campaign, winning games against all the big sides including Juventus, Inter, Milan, Roma, Lazio, Fiorentina, Napoli, as well as their local rivals Sampdoria who won the title that season.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} {{began to}} shift from the displays as static tableaux that were passed by a procession in festive but normal contemporary dress, to the displays' being incorporated in the procession itself, a feature also of the religious medieval pageant; the tableaux were mounted on carri, the precursors of the float, and were now often accompanied by a costumed throng. The carnival parades of Florence that were refined to a high pitch in the late quattrocento set a high standard; they were not without a propaganda element at times, as in the lavish parades of Carnival 1513, following the not-universally welcomed return of the Medici the previous year; the theme of one pageant, more direct than subtle: The Return of the Golden Age. With the French invasions of Italy from 1494, this form of entry spread north. Cardinal Bibbiena reported in a letter of 1520 that the Duke of Suffolk had sent emissaries to Italy to buy horses and bring back to Henry VIII of England men <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to make festal decorations in the latest Italian manner.|$|E
