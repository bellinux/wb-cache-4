50|$|Certain {{people think}} that despite the {{introduction}} of e-books, the <b>printed</b> book is <b>not</b> a dying medium. The death of the book was predicted {{with the advent of}} radio, then film, then with television, and more recently with the Internet. Because of its history of perseverance, some people have hope that it will survive despite the e-book's various advantages.

50|$|There is {{disagreement}} over <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> a <b>printing</b> press existed in Brazil {{on the occasion}} of the arrival of the royal family. Reportedly, a press with movable type was finally brought to Brazil by the government itself, which had earlier been forbidden so vehemently. António de Araújo e Azevedo, then Foreign Minister and later Count of Barca, brought and had installed the press in Rio de Janeiro, on the ground floor of his own home, 44 Rua do Passeio. Brother José Mariano da Conceição Veloso, a miner religious who had been to Lisbon in 1790, returned to Brazil with the royal family to work in the press of Rio, the Imprensa Régia. The new press was launched on May 13, 1808, with the publication of a 27 page booklet, accompanied by the Royal Charter. In the 14 years of the printing monopoly in Rio over a thousand items were produced.|$|R
5000|$|The {{core of a}} well printed PWB lies in the fill {{and release}} of solder paste into the {{aperture}}. When the stencil is {{in contact with the}} PWB, solder paste is applied over the top surface of the stencil using a squeegee. This causes the aperture to fill with solder paste. The PWB is then lowered from the stencil. The amount of solder paste which is released from the stencil apertures and transferred to the PWB pads, determines <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the <b>print</b> is good. Ideally, all volumes of solder paste should be equal to the volume of the corresponding stencil aperture. In reality however, this is never the case. Hence, a print is considered to be good if a certain fraction of the paste is released. One way of quantifying print performance is to calculate the Transfer Efficiency.

40|$|Product end use {{dictates}} {{the materials}} used to produce a printed piece. If flexographic printers are purchasing ink for a packaging carton job, they don 2 ̆ 7 t choose a scuff prone ink. The same should be true for printers producing letterheads for subsequent use in electrophotographic equipment. Electrophotography is an image transfer process that uses the principles of electrostatics. An Ektaprint 200 copier/duplicator charges {{the surface of a}} sheet exposing an image area, develops that image, affixes toner to that image and then mechanically traps the toner {{to the surface of the}} substrate using heat and/or pressure. When a litho graphically printed letterhead is subject to the heat of a fuser roller, it can cause the ink to resoften and subsequently transfer to the next sheets passing through the copier, an undesirable effect. This experiment tested various ink/paper/drying combinations to determine <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> specific <b>print</b> conditions affect the transfer of lithographic ink during electrophotographic imprinting. A test form was designed to include all the images typically printed on a letterhead. Each test sample was first printed under controlled conditions and then run through an Ektaprint 200 copier/duplicator. Visual assessment was used to evaluate test samples. The presence 2 or absence of image transfer determined <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the null 2 ̆ 7 hypothesis was rejected. A Wilcoxon sign test was used to determine <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> a test sample could be evaluated. A level of. 05 significance was obtained in two cases. These samples were excluded from the results. Densitometric readings were taken to determine the severity of the lithographic image transfer. Various ink and paper characteristics were evaluated using descriptive statistics. Twenty-one print conditions exhibited no visual image transfer when processed in the Ektaprint 200. These ink/ paper/drying conditions could guide printers of letter- heads which are to be subsequently processed in electrophotographic equipment...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} {{is to be able to}} determine <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> a latent <b>print,</b> enhanced with blood reagents, is a print left behind by a potentially innocent person, or by a criminal that has committed a violent act. There are two types of prints that will be examined, faux prints and genuine prints. The faux prints are fingerprints that, when under blood and exposed to fingerprinting reagents, look like a print on the surface of the blood. The genuine prints are prints left on top of the blood. Being able to determine with certainty which print is which could be a deciding factor in a court case. This experiment will be carried out using the Raman spectrophotometer. The Raman should be able to determine the differences in oxygen content in the eccrine oils in the fingerprints. The dyes will be analyzed as well to determine their effects on the oxygen intake of the oils, and to help determine the exact positions of the fingerprints. Two trials will be done for this experiment, a dry run, with undiluted blood, and a dilution run, to determine whether diluted blood will have a significant impact in the oxygen intake or the Raman’s ability to determine the oxygen content...|$|R
40|$|The {{neurodegenerative}} disease glaucoma {{is one of}} the leading causes of blindness and accounts for over ten million visits to physicians for treatment. Unfortunately, there is yet to be a concrete accepted approach to alleviating the effects of glaucoma. This dissertation examines recent studies and reports on the specifics of viral vectors, non-viral vectors, piezoelectric inkjet printing, heat inkjet printing, and glaucoma. A few of the studies involve the progression of an experiment while others combine and discuss the results of multiple experiments. Using these articles I compared the effectiveness of gene therapy to the use of inkjet printing to create retinal cells. By replacing, adding, or deleting a specific sequence in the human body, the gene expression of the eye can be altered. There are two different types of injections for gene therapy, viral vectors and non-viral vectors. Both methods typically target the trabecular meshwork and neuroretina to regulate the aqueous humor outflow and lower the intraocular pressure. In the case of glaucoma, the treatment solely provides neuroprotection instead of curing the disease, thus patients must undergo repeated injections in order to keep the disease from deteriorating. Inkjet printing of retinal cells have shown to produce three dimensional tissue grafts that may replace defective tissues. The printed cells have been tested for survivability and regeneration properties, since it has been suggested that the printing process can cause defects. Both heat inkjet printing and piezoelectric printing have been used to create neural cells. By evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of gene therapy as well as printing, I can evaluate <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> inkjet <b>printing</b> can overtake gene therapy to become a conventional treatment for glaucoma in the near future. There have not been many clinical trials done on either of these methods for glaucoma, thus it is difficult to obtain a certain answer to the question at hand. At this point advancements in the area of three-dimensional printing neural sheets may provide a more promising cure. However, more research must be done on how each of these treatments affect glaucoma in humans. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This disserration {{researches}} for a problem-solving {{attitude in}} the Turkish print media's coverage of 15 - 20 November 2003 Istanbul bombings. For this study, a sample from the Turkish print media is maintained due to the ideological positions of each Turkish newspaper. Ideologies of the selected newspapers vary from leftist to rightist ideologies. The aim {{in the selection of}} the newspapers according to their ideologies derive from the question that whether newspapers coverage of the same event can vary due to their different ideologies. For the research of the Turkish print media's problem-solving attitude, a definition is formed {{on the basis of the}} relation between terrorism and the media. The problem-solving definition is composed of two main categories, which are 'problem recognition* and 'management of affect/emotions constructively'. Under the problem recognition category, the way of the problem framing and its assessment of root causes are scrutinized. Second category is researched for <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the Turkish <b>print</b> media try to manage and transform the negative effects of the terrorist events.

40|$|During {{the first}} two months of 2011, the Arab Spring reached Egypt, and toppled {{president}} Hosni Mubarak. After the dissolution of the authoritarian regime, sectarian clashes between members of the two largest communities in the country, Muslims and Coptic Christians, exploded. Before the revolution, Egyptian media was used both by the Muslim and the Christian community to incite hatred towards the other, and thus helped prolong the conflict between them. Media is an important institution in the civil society, and as can be seen, what stance it takes may have grave consequences for the society as a whole, especially in a transition process, which Egypt currently faces. The purpose of this thesis is to determine <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the Egyptian <b>print</b> media presents a sectarian and polarized view in their discussions of Coptic issues. In order to conclude that the print media does this, it has to meet these three conditions: present Muslims and Christians as inherently conflicting categories, encourage to violence or discuss issues that seem unsolvable or disruptive. A second objective of the thesis is to discuss the contribution the Egyptian media will be able to provide to the Egyptian transition process. The study has analyzed three Egyptian newspapers: Al Ahram Online, Daily News Egypt and Egypt Independent and their articles covering Coptic issues throughout 2011 and 2012, in light of the three conditions presented above, to determine <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> they are sectarian and polarizing, and discuss what contribution they can give to the transition process. The findings of the study are that the discussion of Coptic issues in the three newspapers cannot be considered sectarian and polarizing, because they do not fulfill any of the three conditions. The study also conclude that the Egyptian media will contribute positively to the Egyptian transition process, through their diverse presentation of beliefs, opinions and values, as well as their eagerness to deal with a new set of issues with more freedom than before...|$|R
