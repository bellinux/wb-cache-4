40|$|Recent {{events have}} revived {{questions}} about the circumstances that ought to trigger therapists' duty to <b>warn</b> or <b>protect.</b> There is extensive interstate variation in duty to <b>warn</b> or <b>protect</b> statutes enacted and rulings made {{in the wake of}} the California Tarasoff ruling. These duties may be codified in legislative statutes, established in common law through court rulings, or remain unspecified. Furthermore, the duty to <b>warn</b> or <b>protect</b> is not only variable between states but also has been dynamic across time. In this article, we review the implications of this variability and dynamism, focusing on three sets of questions: first, what legal and ethics-related challenges do therapists in each of the three broad categories of states (states that mandate therapists to <b>warn</b> or <b>protect,</b> states that permit therapists to breach confidentiality for warnings but have no mandate, and states that give no guidance) face in handling threats of violence? Second, what training do therapists and other professionals involved in handling violent threats receive, and is this training adequate for the task that these professionals are charged with? Third, how have recent court cases changed the scope of the duty? We conclude by pointing to gaps in the empirical and conceptual scholarship surrounding the duty to <b>warn</b> or <b>protect...</b>|$|R

40|$|In Domagala v. Rolland, the Minnesota Supreme Court granted {{review in}} a {{personal}} injury case that was dominated by duty and special relationship issues, even though the parties agreed {{that there was no}} special relationship between them. The case, straddling the misfeasance/nonfeasance line, was complicated by the defense theory (that the lack of a special relationship meant that the defendant owed no duty to <b>protect</b> or <b>warn</b> the plaintiff), and the plaintiff’s theory (that the defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to the plaintiff because he acted affirmatively, even if the risk to the plaintiff did not become apparent until later). At trial, the result was a set of conflicting and inconsistent jury instructions that in effect permitted Domagala to prove that Rolland was negligent, except not by either failing to <b>warn</b> or <b>protect</b> Domagala. The result was a defense verdict. Domagala appealed. The court of appeals rejected the defense’s theory, accepted the plaintiff’s, and remanded the case for a new trial. The supreme court rejected both theories, concluding that a duty existed because the defendant affirmatively created a foreseeable risk of injury to the plaintiff, and affirmed the court of appeals’s decision to remand the case for a new trial. This article takes a close look at Domagala.

2500|$|Issues of self-deception {{arise when}} {{altering}} memories as well. Avoiding {{the pain and}} difficulty of dealing with a memory by taking a drug {{may not be an}} honest method of coping. Instead of dealing with the truth of the situation a new altered reality is created where the memory is dissociated from pain, or the memory is forgotten altogether. Another issue that arises is exposing patients to unnecessary risk. Traumatic experiences do not necessarily produce a long term traumatic memory, some individuals learn to cope and integrate their experience and it stops affecting their lives quite quickly. If drug treatments are administered when not needed, as when a person could learn to cope without drugs, they may be exposed to side effects and other risks without cause. [...] Loss of painful memories may actually end up causing more harm in some cases. Painful, frightening or even traumatic memories can serve to teach a person to avoid certain situations or experiences. By erasing those memories their adaptive function, to <b>warn</b> and <b>protect</b> individuals may be lost. Another possible result of this technology is a lack of tolerance. If the suffering induced by traumatic events were removable, people may become less sympathetic to that suffering, and put more social pressure on others to erase the memories.|$|R

In 2002, the American Psychological Association (APA) revised their Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct. At the time of revision, {{only a small portion}} of the APA Ethics Code included guidelines regarding the use of technology. A comprehensive review of the literature indicates the need for greater acknowledgment of the impact of technology on the field of professional psychology, and underscores the necessity of establishing such standards as a means of ensuring beneficence and non-malfeasance. This literature review focuses on two domains of concern. First, synchronous and asynchronous communication should be explored further. Synchronous communication is instantaneous and includes mediums such as instant messaging and videoconferencing. Alternatively, asynchronous mediums such as email and text messaging have an inherent time delay. For this reason there are ethical considerations unique to client-therapist interactions occurring at different points in time. Secondly, more information is needed to better understand the benefits and limitations of computer-mediated psychotherapy. Areas that are typically of concern in psychotherapeutic practice include competence, confidentiality, informed consent, boundaries, record keeping, and the duty to <b>warn</b> and <b>protect.</b> Each of these areas warrant greater attention relevant to computer-mediated delivery and are explored in this literature review.

40|$|Despite an {{impressive}} effort at raising the general populace’s security sensitivity—the awareness of, motivation to use, {{and knowledge of}} how to use security and privacy tools—much security advice is ignored and many security tools remain underutilized. Part of the problem may be that we do not yet understand the social processes underlying people’s decisions to (1) disseminate information about security and privacy and (2) actually modify their security behaviors (e. g., adopt a new security tool or practice). To that end, we report on a retrospective interview study examining the role of social influence—or, our ability to affect the behaviors and perceptions of others with our own words and actions—in people’s decisions to change their security behaviors, as well as the nature of and reasons for their discussions about security. We found that social processes {{played a major role in}} a large number of privacy and security-related behavior changes reported by our sample, probably because these processes were effective at raising security sensitivity. We also found that conversations about security were most often driven by the desire to <b>warn</b> or <b>protect</b> others from immediate novel threats observed or experienced, or to gather information about solving an experienced problem. Furthermore, the observability of security feature usage was a key enabler of socially triggered behavior change—both in encouraging the spread of positive behaviors and in discouraging negative behaviors. 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Warning</b> signals <b>protect</b> {{unpalatable}} prey from predation because predators who {{learn the}} association between the warning signal and prey unprofitability decrease attacks on the prey. Most of the research have focused on visual aposematic signals that are constantly presented and visible to the predators. But a variety of chemically defended insects are rather cryptic when resting, and only in response to predator attacks (post-attack) they perform displays of conspicuous abdomens or hindwings normally hidden under forewings. The function of those displays in unpalatable insects is not well understood. We examined two adaptive hypotheses on this facultative aposematic display using wild-caught oriental tits (Parus minor) as predators. First, we tested whether the display increases {{the rejection of the}} prey by predators upon seeing the display (i. e. at the moment of attack) through learning trials (aposematic signaling hypothesis). Second, we tested whether the display facilitates the memory formation between cryptic visible form of the prey and prey defense so that it prevents the predators initiate an attack upon seeing the cryptic form (facilitation hypothesis). We found that predators learned to avoid attacking the prey which supports the facilitation hypothesis. However, the support for the aposematic signaling hypothesis was equivocal. Our results open new directions of research by highlighting the possibility that similar facilitation effects may contribute to the evolution of various forms of post-attack visual displays in chemically, or otherwise, defended animals...|$|R

40|$|Highway assets, {{including}} traffic signs, traffic signals, light poles, and guardrails, {{are important}} components of transportation networks. They guide, <b>warn</b> and <b>protect</b> drivers, and regulate traffic. To manage {{and maintain the}} regular operation of the highway system, state departments of transportation (DOTs) need reliable and up-to-date information about the location and condition of highway assets. Different methodologies have been employed to collect road inventory data. Currently, ground-based technologies are widely used to help DOTs to continually update their road database, while air-based methods are not commonly used. One possible {{reason is that the}} initial investment for air-based methods is relatively high; another is the lack of a systematic and effective approach to extract road features from raw airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and aerial image data. However, for large-area inventories (e. g., a whole state highway inventory), the total cost of using aerial mapping is actually much lower than other methods considering the time and personnel needed. Moreover, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are easily accessible and inexpensive, which makes it possible to reduce costs for aerial mapping. The focus of this project is to analyze the capability and strengths of airborne data collection system in highway inventory data collection. In this research, a field experiment was conducted by the Remote Sensing Service Laboratory (RSSL), Utah State University (USU), to collect airborne data.

In particular, by estimating the frequency content of the incoming seismic signal recorded at the accelerometric stations using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique, a new approach is proposed to estimate the seismic demand of the structure to be protected in order to eventually modify its mechanical features by means of semiactive devices. The analysis concerns a Base Isolated benchmark system equipped with semiactive devices located at the isolation layer, capable of modifying both the stiffness and damping of the overall structural system. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy has been tested on varying the “anticipation time”, namely {{the range of the}} time interval between the start of the seismic data elaboration by the recorded stations and the arrival of the seismic S-wave to the interested site, the added stiffness and damping resources, as well as by taking into account different seismic input signals.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, a {{remarkable}} {{progress has been}} witnessed {{in the development of}} affinity biosensors and their applications in areas such as medical diagnostics, drug screening, environmental monitoring, biotechnology, food safety, and security. Trace amounts of specific bio molecules may indicate the presence of a disease or may have a life threatening effect to some individuals, hence accurate monitoring, with high frequency and accuracy, has become a necessity in many sectors. Optical affinity biosensors based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) present one of the most advanced label-free optical sensing technologies. Their ability to monitor the interaction between a molecule immobilized {{to the surface of the}} sensor and the interacting molecular partner in a solution have made SPR sensors a very powerful tool for biomolecular interaction analysis. One of the drawbacks of a typical SPR sensing instrument is its cost, its bulky size and the presence of various optical and mechanical (moving) parts, which make it difficult to optimize and commercialize it on a large scale, e. g. for biosensor applications. Miniaturization of SPR components is a key factor which can be achieved by using optical fibers. Recently, the MeBioS-Biosensor research group (www. biosensors. be) of the K. U. Leuven has developed an innovative technology based on fiber optic surface plasmon resonance. The biosensor has a great potential as reusable, cost-effective and label free biosensor for measuring antibody-antigen, DNA hybridization and DNA-protein interactions as has been demonstrated in a recently published paper (Pollet et al., 2009. Biosensors and Bioelectronics). The fiber optic sensor is a versatile platform with many applications for medical diagnostics, food quality and safety and environmental diagnostics. Examples include disease biomarker detection, food toxin and pathogen detection, and analysis of polluted surface waters. The technology might even be implemented in handheld point of care devices. A raising important challenge for the food industry with both societal and economic impact is food allergy detection. Accurate and reliable product information is essential to inform a rising number of food allergic patients. Tracing allergens, however, is not obvious, since they generally occur in very low quantities, hidden in a food matrix. In this research we present the development of a cost-effective surface plasmon resonance probe for peanut allergen detection. In order to further improve the detection limit and to deal with variable matrix effects, superparamagnetic nanobeads are used to purify and concentrate allergens from different extracts of chocolate samples. The use of MNB as carriers for the allergen proteins, also strongly amplifies the SPR response, and opens the door towards subnanomolar detection limits. The low detection limit provide producers and policy makers with a tool to correctly inform, <b>warn</b> and <b>protect</b> the potential allergic consumers. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} {{the theme of the}} {{behavioural}} outcomes of public health policy, including its mediators, through work done at three different large public health organisations. Work undertaken at the Cancer Council Victoria aimed to examine tobacco brand choice and loyalty among smokers in Australia’s uniquely restrictive tobacco market. No clear association was found between tobacco control policies and brand loyalty prior to the introduction of plain packaging. Factors hypothesised to be important, including price, packaging, peer influence and health literacy did mediate brand choice according to age, income and level of addiction. These provide points to intervene with public health policy changes. Tobacco brand family switching does not appear to facilitate later quitting behaviour and therefore cannot be recommended to assist quitting. Since the introduction of the plain packaging policy there has been some downshifting to value brands, but illicit tobacco use remains rare. Plain packaging is likely contributing to the decline in smoking prevalence. At the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (VicHealth), research was undertaken into highly caffeinated sugar-sweetened beverages known as energy drinks and related public policy. The aim was to provide the evidence base for VicHealth’s own policy and for a broader audience. Insights were gained into the physical and behavioural effects of energy drinks, including excessive use, risk-taking and aggression. The present regulatory framework is insufficient to adequately <b>warn</b> or <b>protect</b> both the general public and vulnerable sub-groups against the risks energy drinks pose. Risk mitigation policy suggestions are made, including regulatory changes and creating supportive environments. There has been little change in Australian energy drink policy since the work at VicHealth. At Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control at the Department of Health and Human Services Victoria, a review of the internal protocols for managing hepatitis B and C statutory notifications was undertaken. The aim was to improve notification handling, epidemiological data Abstract 6 collection for public health policy formulation, identification of risk factors that pose a legal risk to the department and to reduce onward transmission of disease. Processes could be enhanced in a range of areas, resulting in improved procedures for staff, interactions with notifying medical practitioners and laboratories and ultimately public health. Influenza surveillance policy and its behavioural outcomes amongst general practitioners (GPs) were also reviewed. The aim was to investigate if the policy of allowing GPs in Victoria’s sentinel surveillance system to choose which patients with a clinical diagnosis of influenza-like illness to test for influenza was a source of bias. Between 2007 to 2014 GPs were consistent in their sampling within each influenza season and between seasons – {{there was no evidence of}} temporal systematic error. This diverse range of projects covered both the internal policies of a range of large public health organisations and the effects of policy on the behaviour of medical practitioners, laboratories, industry, vulnerable groups and the wider community.

An inductive qualitative study using seven focus group interviews and two individual interviews was conducted. Twenty-three participants were drawn from eight wards in three general hospitals. Interviews were conducted using the thinking aloud method, and analysed using the constant comparative method influenced by the grounded theory approach. Findings. On elaborating on how nurses dealt with and perceived transgressive behaviour, they disclosed how interactions with team members took place. Several patterns arose in interacting with colleagues about perceived transgressive behaviour. Nurses seemed to vent emotions to one another, <b>warn</b> one another, <b>protect</b> one another, stand in for one other and guide one another. In these patterns of interactions with colleagues, nurses seemed to have two implicit incentives underlying these patterns. On the one hand, nurses appeared {{to be focused on}} self-preservation in considering how their own conduct towards colleagues would be advantageous for themselves in the long run. While on the other hand, a team oriented and shared focus on task organization and ‘getting the work done’ appeared to influence interactions in nursing teams in dealing with and perceiving transgressive behaviour. Implications for practice, research, education & training, organization/management, policy and guidance. Faced with patients’ transgressive behaviour, nurses are influenced by colleagues in how they perceive, deal with and experience transgressive behaviour. Our findings suggest that intervention strategies aimed at supporting nurses and nursing teams in managing patient aggression and transgressive behaviour, need to consider group dynamics and team members’ interactions. status: accepte...|$|R
