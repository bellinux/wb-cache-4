5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the home team were still leading 1–0. With the scores levelled, the pack switched {{their attention to the}} Scottish bench, which led to Stein remonstrating with at least one photographer {{to move out of the}} way of his view of the game. Both Professor Stewart Hillis, the Scotland team doctor (who was also Stein's consultant), and Welsh manager Mike England stated that there appeared to be nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>at</b> this point.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} {{that something was}} <b>wrong</b> <b>at</b> Vrbanja Bridge was radio silence from the French post. About 05:20 on 27 May, platoon commander Captain François Lecointre had lost radio contact with the posts, {{and drove to the}} bridge {{to find out what was}} happening; he was met by a Serb sentry in French uniform who attempted to take him prisoner. Lecointre quickly turned around and drove to Skenderija stadium, the headquarters of FREBAT4.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and <b>wrong.</b> <b>At</b> this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E

5|$|With Homer having {{convinced}} Lisa {{that nothing}} can go <b>wrong</b> <b>at</b> Krusty's show, Lisa and Ralph go together. On live air, Krusty begins interviewing audience members, and Ralph takes the opportunity to declare that Lisa is {{the love of his}} life and that he intends to marry her in the future. Angry, Lisa snaps, stating that she had never liked him and that the only reason she gave him a Valentine was because nobody else would. Later at home, Bart takes the moment to replay that scene to Lisa in which Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt. Lisa soon feels guilty and regrets her actions in hurting Ralph's feelings.|$|E
5|$|Determined to {{make this}} the king's happiest {{birthday}} ever and save the day, SpongeBob sets out to find Triton and bring him to the party. Once found, Triton initially ignores SpongeBob, but after smelling SpongeBob's terribly smelly breath, he tells him to undo the lock. Unable to figure it out, SpongeBob calls his best friend, Patrick, to help out. Patrick unlocks Triton's cell, and the Prince escapes the island. No one anticipates Triton's wrath, Triton destroys Bikini Bottom. Noticing that something is <b>wrong</b> <b>at</b> the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Patrick enter the building from the back, discovering the guests and staff locked in a cage. When Patrick unlocks the cell, Triton attempts to escape his father, who catches up to him. King Neptune can't tolerate his son's wrongdoings, but on seeing how Triton destroyed Bikini Bottom, is pleased that he's finally using powers, becoming a worthy successor. The family leaves for home, with King Neptune crediting SpongeBob for this development; the townsfolk of Bikini Bottom see differently, chasing him and Patrick in an angry mob.|$|E
5|$|The party {{arrived at}} the vicarage to be greeted by Mrs Blackburne. (Mrs Blackburne had {{originally}} intended to travel on the inaugural journey with her husband, but the previous day had felt a presentiment that something was <b>wrong</b> <b>at</b> home and her presence was required, and had returned alone by boat. She had then heard a rumour that a mob from Oldham were planning to storm the track at Eccles to attack the Duke of Wellington, and decided {{to remain in the}} vicarage.) Huskisson was moved to the sofa, and given laudanum and brandy. At about 2.00pm Hunter and Brandreth cut Huskisson's clothing away from his damaged leg to give it a proper examination. Unfamiliar with industrial injuries, they were baffled {{by the nature of the}} damage to Huskisson's leg, but concluded that despite the apparent severity of his injuries the wounds were treatable.|$|E
50|$|In the abstract, criminalizing all wrongs {{that cause}} harm makes the offense {{principle}} almost {{synonymous with the}} harm principle.

Coburn said that the earmarks would benefit Nelson's son Patrick's employer with millions in federal dollars and that the situation violated terms of the Transparency Act, which {{was passed by the}} Senate but had not yet been voted on in the House. Nelson's spokesperson said the Senator did nothing <b>wrong.</b> <b>At</b> that time, newspapers in Nebraska and Oklahoma noted that Coburn failed to criticize very similar earmarks that benefited Oklahoma.|$|E
25|$|Although the defense's expert {{testimony}} agreed that Yates was psychotic, Texas law requires that, {{in order to}} successfully assert the insanity defense, the defendant must prove {{that he or she}} could not discern right from <b>wrong</b> <b>at</b> the time of the crime. In March 2002, a jury rejected the insanity defense and found her guilty. Although the prosecution had sought the death penalty, the jury refused that option. The trial court sentenced her to life imprisonment in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice with eligibility for parole in 40 years.|$|E
25|$|Jarrett briefly feuded with Al Snow before reuniting with Debra, who {{had left}} WCW for the WWF, and forming a tag team with Owen Hart. Hart and Jarrett were close friends and travel {{partners}} for years, so the team jelled almost immediately. Jarrett and Hart won the WWF Tag Team Championship from Ken Shamrock and The Big Boss Man, successfully defending the titles at WrestleMania XV before losing to Kane and X-Pac on an episode of Raw. Eight days after Hart died in a stunt that went <b>wrong</b> <b>at</b> Over the Edge, Jarrett defeated The Godfather, who Owen was scheduled to face at the pay-per-view, for the Intercontinental Championship. As he was handed the title belt, he yelled Hart's name in tribute to his friend. In mid-1999, Jarrett exchanged the Intercontinental Championship with Edge and D'Lo Brown on two more occasions. His fifth reign broke Razor Ramon's record from 1995. He held the record until Chris Jericho's seventh reign in 2004.|$|E

25|$|Fr. Giovanni Zucca from Murialdo, who {{was then}} the {{chaplain}} at Murialdo when Dominic was five years old, notes in a statement to John Bosco that he came to notice Dominic due to his regular church attendance with his mother, and his habit of kneeling down outside the church to pray (even in the mud or snow) if he happened to come to Church before it had been unlocked in the morning. The chaplain also notes that Savio made good progress at the village school not merely due to his cleverness, but also by working hard. He would not join the other boys in doing something that he believed to be morally wrong and would explain why he thought a particular deed was <b>wrong.</b> <b>At</b> the age of five, he learned to serve Mass, and would try to participate at Mass every day as well as go regularly to Confession. Having been permitted to make his First Communion at an early age, he had much reverence for the Eucharist.|$|E

500|$|Forrest Wickman of Slate {{wrote of}} Northup's book giving a more {{favorable}} account of the author's onetime master, William Ford, than the McQueen film.

[...] The movie, however, according to Wickham, [...] "frequently undermines Ford." [...] McQueen undercuts Christianity itself as well, in an effort to update the ethical lessons from Northup's story for the 21st century, by holding the institutions of Christianity up to the light for their ability to justify slavery at the time. Northup was a Christian of his time, writing of his former master being [...] "blinded" [...] by [...] "circumstances" [...] that in retrospect meant a racist acceptance of slavery despite being a Christian, a position untenable to Christians now and to Christian abolitionists of the 19th century but not contradictory to Northup himself. Valerie Elverton Dixon in The Washington Post characterized the Christianity depicted in the movie as [...] "broken".|$|E
500|$|In 2013, The Islamic Society in Denmark {{stated that}} they regretted their visit to Lebanon and Egypt in 2006 to show the caricatures because the {{consequences}} had been much more serious than they expected.

Westergaard responded by saying [...] "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society.

500|$|Mugford {{said she}} had spent the weekend before the murders with Bamber in his cottage in Goldhanger, where he had dyed his hair black. She had seen his mother's bicycle there, she said; the {{prosecution}} later alleged that he had used this bicycle to cycle between his cottage and the farmhouse {{on the night of}} the murders, to avoid being seen in his car on the road. She told police Bamber had telephoned her at 9:50pm on 6 August to say he had been thinking about the crime all day, was [...] "pissed off", and that it was [...] "tonight or never". A few hours later, at 3:00–3:30am on 7 August, she said he phoned her again to say: [...] "Everything is going well. Something is <b>wrong</b> <b>at</b> the farm. I haven't had any sleep all night... bye honey and I love you lots." [...] Her flatmates' evidence suggested that call had come through closer to 3:00am. He called her later in the morning to tell her that Sheila had gone mad, and that a police car was coming to pick her up. When she arrived with the police at Bamber's cottage, she said he had pulled her to one side and said: [...] "I should have been an actor." ...|$|E
