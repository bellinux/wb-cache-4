2500|$|Many {{problems}} in mathematics {{have been shown}} to be undecidable after these initial examples were established. [...] In 1947, Markov and Post published independent papers showing that the word problem for semigroups cannot be effectively decided. Extending this result, Pyotr Novikov and William Boone showed independently in the 1950s that the word problem for groups is not effectively solvable: there is no effective procedure that, given a word in a finitely presented group, <b>will</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> the element represented by the word is the identity element of the group. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich proved (using results of Julia Robinson) Matiyasevich's theorem, which implies that Hilbert's tenth problem has no effective solution; this problem asked whether there is an effective procedure to decide whether a Diophantine equation over the integers has a solution in the integers. The list of undecidable problems gives additional examples of problems with no computable solution.|$|E

2500|$|The {{role and}} {{certification}} of Emergency Medical Dispatcher has {{its origins in}} the United States but is gradually gaining acceptance in many other countries. [...] The position and credential are in widespread use in Canada and the United Kingdom. The acceptance and use of this position and credential are growing in the European Union, in Australia, and elsewhere. [...] In many respects, {{the development of this}} position is a logical sequel to the incorporation of the Emergency medical dispatch system by EMS. [...] Together, NAED and PDC often present themselves as the de facto standard in EMD systems. [...] However, the continued recognition given to alternative providers suggests that this approach is not universally accepted. [...] And not all EMS dispatch worldwide is conducted by EMDs. [...] In some jurisdictions using the Franco-German model of EMS service delivery (SAMU in France, for example), a call for a medical emergency will not be processed by an EMD, but generally by a physician, who <b>will</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> or not an ambulance will even be sent.|$|E
2500|$|By 1896, Beveridge {{had opened}} his own retail {{business}} in the rural and mining town of Lithgow and involved himself in various community activities, including in cricket. Reporting on his attendance at a Lithgow reception for Premier Reid in May 1896, the Windsor and Richmond Gazette noted: [...] "no doubt, ere long Mr. [...] will take a leading part in matters connected with {{the welfare of the}} town, for he is too good a man to be allowed to stay long in clover. His ability is already recognised in his new home, and {{a matter of a few}} months <b>will</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> he enters the Municipal arena or not. If he does, Lithgow will be the gainer." [...] In early 1896 Beveridge nominated to take up a vacancy on Lithgow Ward on Lithgow Municipal Council, but received only 6 votes. The next year he stood again for Lithgow Ward but lost by one vote. Beveridge became heavily involved in local cricket circles, donating the [...] "Beveridge Cup" [...] for district matches, and becoming President of the Lithgow District Cricket Association in 1899; the patron of the association that year was prominent local politician Joseph Cook.|$|E
2500|$|After a Lodge elects or approves a {{candidate}} {{in accordance with the}} requirements of its Grand Lodge, it <b>will</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> to give the candidate each degree in order. Generally speaking those who have only received the Entered Apprentice degree are considered Freemasons, but hold limited privileges until they attain the Master Mason degree; under UGLE only a Master Mason will receive a Grand Lodge certificate, which may be demanded by any other Lodge he wishes to visit.A Master Mason is considered a full lifetime member of the Lodge where he received his degrees. [...] He can demit (resign) if he so desires but only if he is in good standing and his dues paid. A Mason might demit for personal reasons or to join another Lodge in those jurisdictions where multiple membership is not permitted. [...] After demitting, he continues to be regarded as a Mason in absentia and may rejoin through a new application, but he and his family have no rights, privileges or claims on Freemasonry. [...] Some sources (Mackey) claim that leaving the lodge does not exempt him from his obligations nor the wholesome control of the Order over his moral conduct. A Mason may be expelled from his Lodge and Freemasonry in general if convicted of particularly serious violations of Civil or Masonic law. Expulsion from all of Freemasonry can only occur from a Grand Lodge while lesser chapters can expel members from their specific lodges.|$|E

60|$|To us, {{the great}} mass of common Englishmen, {{who have no}} place in the {{hierarchy}} of our land, who do not attend Courts nor encounter uniforms, whose function is at most spectacular, who stand in the street and watch the dignitaries and the liveries pass by, this sense of critical expectation is perhaps greater than it is for those more immediately concerned in the spectacle. They have had their parts to play, their symbolic acts to perform, they have sat in their privileged places, and we have waited at the barriers until their comfort and dignity was assured. I can conceive many of them, a little fatigued, preparing now for social dispersal, relaxing comfortably into gossip, discussing the detail of these events with an air of things accomplished. They <b>will</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> the Coronation has been a success and whether everything has or has not passed off very well.

60|$|At {{the same}} time, {{do not let}} us suppose that these Trade Boards will, in the first instance, be very strong or {{representative}} bodies. They are to be formed in trades mainly worked by women, where no organisation has ever yet taken root, where there are as yet no means of finding and focusing an effective trade opinion. Where possible, they will be partly elective; {{in many cases they}} will, I expect, have to begin by being almost entirely nominated. In some cases it will be upon the official members alone that the main burden will fall. I could not ask the House to confer upon bodies of this nebulous character, not representative, not elective in any democratic sense, responsible not to constituents, nor to a public department, nor to Parliament itself in any way, the absolute and final power of enforcing by the whole apparatus of the law any decision, whether wise or foolish, upon wage questions to which they may come by the narrowest majority. The work which we entrust to them wholly and finally is sufficiently difficult and important. We direct them by this Bill to prescribe minimum rates of wages. They are to find the minimum rate. For that purpose they are as well qualified as any body that we could devise. In this sphere their jurisdiction will be complete. The Board of Trade will not retry the question of what is the right minimum rate. Another and quite different question will be decided by the Board of Trade. They <b>will</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> the minimum rate which has been prescribed by the Trade Board commands sufficient support in the trade to make its enforcement by inspection and prosecution likely to be effective.|$|E
