25|$|These {{suggestions}} {{were followed}} in 1946–47, by similar calls by the Brotherhood, {{referring to the}} deterioration of the main portal and sacristy. In addition, there were references to deteriorating windows, falling stucco from the vaulted-ceiling and degradation of the skylight in the choir. But, even as the DGEMN interevened in 1947, the church's condition worsened the following year, with rainfall that invaded the church, and a broken pipe in the sacristy, that resulted in the rotting of the <b>wood</b> <b>floors</b> that had to be replaced.|$|E

40|$|Summary This research, {{based on}} the theory of market structure, is {{intended}} to discuss the market structure in Taiwan <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> industry. To decide the market structure, the market concentration ratio method was introduced. Also, the factors of the entry barriers that will affect the market structure on <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> industry was examined. As a result, {{there are two types}} of wood floorings, solid and laminated <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> in Taiwan market. The sales volume of solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> are 2 million 637 thousand square meters and laminated are 1 million 815 thousand square meters in 1997. The solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> is mainly used in the residential area, and the laminated <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> is mainly used in the public area. The characteristics of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> considered by consumer are stability, shallow color and no defective. The solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring,</b> two and three level of distribution channel are normally used. The laminated <b>wood</b> <b>flooring,</b> three level of distribution channel are normally used. As for the market structure analysis, the laminated <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> is identified as an oligopoly market. The market structure of solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> is a competitive market. 摘 要 本研究主要目的在於以市場的背景現況及市場結構理論，來探 討臺灣木質地板的市場結構形態。研究中透過實地調查瞭解市場的 現況，並以市場集中度衡量臺灣木質地板市場結構，同時以市場進 入障礙來檢視國內木質地板市場結構之變化。經由調查得知，臺灣 木質地板市場主要分為實木地板與銘木地板兩類。目前木質地板 1997 年的銷售量，實木地板約為 81 萬坪，銘木地板約為 55 萬坪。以使 用場所而言，實木地板多用於一般家庭，而銘木地板多用於公共場 所。而在材種選擇的偏好上，消費者主要以材質穩定性、材面色淺 均勻無缺點為選擇重點。在配銷通路上，實木地板為二階與三階的 通路，而銘木地板為三階的通路。另外以市場結構分析臺灣木銘木 地板市場為大型製造商所形成之寡占市場，具高規模經濟性，因此 有高的進入障礙，而獲利性高，不過風險比較大；實木地板市場為 小型經銷商組成之競爭性市場，市場進入障礙低，產品差異性亦低， 因此獲利性也較低，但風險則相對較穩定...|$|R

25|$|In the {{southwest}} {{portion of the}} yard was a temple of the god Khaldi. The temple had a large oblong plan with a staircase {{that led to the}} roof of a ziggurat type tower and a side room on the lower floor. Surrounding the hall was a double-rowed twelve-column open portico with benches along the walls. An altar for sacrifices was located at the left wall. The walls were decorated with colorful frescoes depicting representations of human figures, gods, geometric and floral designs. One of the frescoes uncovered depicts the god Khaldi standing on a lion with a warder in his left hand and a horned crown upon his head. It is typical of other representations of Khaldi found at other sites. The floor of the temple contrasted greatly {{from the rest of the}} complex in that it had <b>wood</b> <b>floors</b> composed of small planks, compared to the clay-coated adobe floors that were faced with stone slabs found in the rest of the citadel's rooms.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the B. F. Saul Company, {{undertook}} {{the restoration}} and {{renovation of the}} historic main building, a project that was expected to cost $60 million. Contractors installed new double-hung mahogany windows, built a new roof and roof deck, and carefully cleaned the brick façade and aluminum spandrels following preservation standards. After discussions with the Art Deco Society of Washington, D.C. {{as well as the}} residents, the B. F. Saul Company decided to preserve the original floor plans of most apartments. As the contractors renovated each apartment, they kept the original hardware, including the glass doorknobs and brass hinges, as well as the kitchen cabinets and apartment doors, and they sanded and stained the original <b>wood</b> <b>floors.</b> To bring the building up to current standards, they replaced the wiring and plumbing, and installed a sprinkler system and central air-conditioning in the apartments and public areas. The central air-conditioning replaced the huge basement fans, which had been in use since 1931, as well as window units. The company put new stoves and refrigerators in the apartments and, for the first time, washers and dryers. Shops and businesses on the lobby floor supplied such services for the residents.|$|E

The exterior facade is buff brick with black granite windowsills and thresholds and white-painted steel windows. The building features furniture {{dating back to the}} club's founding as well as Mies van der Rohe designs. [...] Several elements of the new building's design are considered homages to Mies. The fact that the building was so Miesian thirty years after his death while the club focused on avant-gard art {{was a bit of a}} controversy. The building's atrium that allows filtered light into the central galleries and dining areas is its primary feature. [...] Another focal point of the building is the restored Mies van der Rohe steel staircase that provides access to the second floor. The design includes white-painted steel, travertine marble, floor-to-ceiling curtains, dark-stained <b>wood</b> <b>floors,</b> and large areas of glass. The color palette of saffron, black, gray, scarlet, and white is consistent with the former building. Also notable are the veil of north side metal screens. The building also has a [...] outdoor landscaped garden. The building accommodates a 200-person audience seating.|$|E

40|$|High-density wood is {{required}} in <b>wood</b> <b>flooring,</b> especially in engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> (EWF) designed for heavy-duty applications. However, high-density wood resources are limited and their cost is high. A densification treatment {{makes it possible for}} low- or moderate-density woods to replace harder species by modifying them into high-performance and high-value products, such as engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> for heavy-duty applications. The general objective {{of this study was to}} develop a prototype of engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> using sugar maple hygro-thermally densified surface layers. The results showed that thin sugar maple lumber densified at 200 °C under the combined effects of steam, heat, and pressure with a heat-resistant fabric had great potential for the manufacturing of engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> for heavy-duty use. As a result of treatment, it acquired high density, improved mechanical properties, and it had a relatively high dimensional stability and an attractive color. Tests in conditioning rooms showed that the EWF with a densified sugar maple (Acer saccharum March.) surface layer presented the lowest amplitude distortion between the dry and humid conditions compared with the standard EWF (0. 15 mm vs. 0. 17 mm and 0. 25 mm) ...|$|R
