5|$|The {{theories}} and system of interpreting ancient art devised by Johann Joachim Winckelmann influenced European tastes for decades. His major <b>work,</b> <b>History</b> of Ancient Art, {{was published in}} 1764 and translated into French in 1766 (the English translation came later, in 1881). In this major work Winckelmann initiated the tradition of dividing ancient art into periods, classifying the works chronologically and stylistically.|$|E
5|$|Susie Bootja Bootja {{was born}} circa 1935 near Kurtal, or Helena Spring, {{south-west}} of Balgo, Western Australia; {{the country is}} called Kaningarra in her own language, a name that appears {{as the title of}} one of her art works. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. While sources vary as to Susie's skin name (some indicating Napangarti, others Napaltjarri), the similar birth dates, locations, and <b>work</b> <b>history</b> indicate that all are referring to the one individual.|$|E

25|$|The Loire Valley has a {{long history}} of {{winemaking}} dating back to the 1st century. In the High Middle Ages, the wines of the Loire Valley were the most esteemed wines in England and France, even more prized than those from Bordeaux. Archaeological evidence suggest that the Romans planted the first vineyards in the Loire Valley during their settlement of Gaul in the 1st century AD. By the 5th century, the flourishing viticulture of the area was noted in a publication by the poet Sidonius Apollinaris. In his <b>work</b> <b>History</b> of the Franks, Bishop Gregory of Tours wrote of the frequent plundering by the Bretons of the area's wine stocks. By the 11th century the wines of Sancerre had a reputation across Europe for their high quality. Historically the wineries of the Loire Valley have been small, family owned operations that do a lot of estate bottling. The mid-1990s saw an increase in the number of négociant and co-operative to where now about half of Sancerre and almost 80% of Muscadet is bottled by a négociant or co-op.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} impact of <b>work</b> <b>histories</b> on {{voluntary}} association member-ships. Stable <b>work</b> <b>histories</b> are associated with more membership months over a 15 -year period, {{in contrast to a}} “disorderly ” sequence of jobs, which results in fewer membership months. Men’s <b>work</b> <b>histories</b> affect only their job-related memberships; women’s <b>work</b> <b>histories</b> affect a wider range. These results suggest that current trends in the restructuring of work toward more contingent employment will decrease rates of civic participation. KEY WORDS: work; career; voluntary associations; social capital. Declining membership in many voluntary associations and low voter turnout in presidential elections has raised widespread concern about the health of civil society in America. Among the many reasons cited for these trends is changing patterns of employment. For example, more and more women, traditionally the “community housekeepers ” (Daniels, 1988), are working full-time, regardless of whether they have small children. This, in turn, reduces the amount of free time families have to devote to community organizations especially if both spouses are working (Reich, 2000 : 118). Americans are apparently becoming too harried to be joiners. However, the evidence that increasing work time is eroding community life is mixed at best. It is true that the number of hours people spend in community associa-tions is affected by how long they work, but having no job at all discourages social participation rather than making it easier (Brown, 1999; Freeman, 1997; Putnam, 2000 : 194). Perhaps time is not the issue here. What is mor...|$|R

500|$|Circumcision is the world's oldest planned {{surgical}} procedure, {{suggested by}} anatomist and hyperdiffusionist historian Grafton Elliot Smith {{to be over}} 15,000 years old, pre-dating recorded history.

One theory is that it began in one geographic area and spread from there; another is that several different cultural groups began its practice independently. In his 1891 <b>work</b> <b>History</b> of Circumcision, physician Peter Charles Remondino suggested that it began as a less severe form of emasculating a captured enemy: [...] penectomy or castration would likely have been fatal, while some form of circumcision would permanently mark the defeated yet leave him alive to serve as a slave.|$|E
500|$|Shelley's first travel {{narrative}} and first published <b>work,</b> <b>History</b> of a Six Weeks' Tour, was published anonymously and was co-written with her husband. Rambles, {{on the other}} hand, places Mary Shelley at {{the centre of the}} narrative. It tells the story of [...] "the recovery of paradise" [...] and the fears of a mother. Her maternal sorrow is generalised. For example, in discussing the death of her daughter in 1818, she writes: [...] "I was agitated again by emotions—by passions—and those the deepest a woman's heart can harbour—a dread to see her child even at that instant expire—which then occupied me". Connecting these deep feelings to writings by Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Thomas Holcroft, she argues that intense emotion and environment are intertwined, contending that maternal grief is sublime.|$|E
