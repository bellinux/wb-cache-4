5|$|In Puerto Rico, boxing is {{considered}} a major sport, having produced more amateur and professional <b>world</b> <b>champions</b> than any other sport in its history. Puerto Rico ranks 5th worldwide between countries with most boxing <b>world</b> <b>champions,</b> {{and is the only}} place to have champions accredited in all of the current boxing divisions. This number also places the archipelago in the global lead in terms of champions per capita. February 9, 2008 {{was the first time that}} boxers from Puerto Rico had held three of the four major welterweights titles (World Boxing Association, International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Organization) when Carlos Quintana defeated Paul Williams to join Miguel Cotto, and Kermit Cintron as champions in the division.|$|E

5|$|Victor Watson and Ranny Barton began holding {{tournaments in}} the UK and US, respectively. <b>World</b> <b>Champions</b> were {{declared}} in the United States in 1973 and 1974 (and are still considered official <b>World</b> <b>Champions</b> by Hasbro). While the 1973 tournament, the first, matched three United States regional champions against the UK champion and thus {{could be argued}} as the first international tournament, true multinational international tournaments were first held in 1975. Both authors (Orbanes and Brandreth) agree that John Mair was the first true World Champion, as decided in tournament play held in Washington, D.C. days after {{the conclusion of the}} European Championship (which Mair had also won), in November 1975.|$|E

5|$|By 1897, {{the year}} of the launch of Spinks & Company, he had evidently {{overcome}} his seeming reluctance to face <b>World</b> <b>Champions</b> again (perhaps from having several years' experience with his own product prototypes).

5|$|Curling {{events at}} the 2010 Winter Olympics were {{in the form of}} a {{round-robin}} tournament; each nation played all others in a group stage with the top four qualifying for medal playoffs. The men's team, the reigning <b>world</b> <b>champions,</b> won group stage games against France, Denmark, China, United States and Germany. These five wins left them in a tie for the last semifinal place with Sweden, who beat them in their group game. A single tie-breaker match was played between the two sides which was won by the Swedes in the first extra end. The women's team, skippered by 19-year-old Eve Muirhead, entered the tournament ranked seventh in the world and beat <b>world</b> <b>champions</b> China in their opening match, but won just two of their remaining eight games to finish seventh in the group and miss out on the semifinals.|$|E

5|$|Statistical {{rating systems}} give Steinitz a rather low ranking among <b>world</b> <b>champions,</b> mainly because he took several long breaks from {{competitive}} play.

Steinitz was unbeaten in match play for 32 years, from 1862 to 1894.|$|E
5|$|The World Cup final {{match is}} the last of the competition, and the result determines which country is {{declared}} <b>world</b> <b>champions.</b> If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time it is decided by kicks from the penalty shoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions. The tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except 1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2–1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match (and one of the last two matches of the tournament) which put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as <b>world</b> <b>champions.</b> Therefore, this match is regarded by FIFA as the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|After the series, Team Canada {{played an}} {{exhibition}} game against the Czechoslovak national team; at the time, the <b>world</b> <b>champions.</b> The game took place on September 30 at the Sportovní hala in Prague and ended in a 3–3 tie.

Jiri Kochta scored at 2:28 of the third and the lead nearly held up until the end. Canada pulled its goalie and Savard scored his second goal with four seconds left.|$|E
