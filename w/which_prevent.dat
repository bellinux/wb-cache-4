5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies on Your Mind, {{in which the}} transgressions <b>which</b> <b>prevent</b> Rick from returning to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins {{to identify with the}} father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that {{the most important aspect of}} the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
5|$|Many {{indigenous}} communities did not evenly {{share in the}} benefits of the economic boom Taiwan experienced during {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century. They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, <b>which</b> <b>prevent</b> many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines.|$|E

5|$|September 30, 2002: Arturo Martinez Tapia {{assaulted}} a Greyhound driver near Fresno, California, {{resulting in}} two passenger deaths after the bus then rolled off an embankment and crashed. Following this attack, an aisle gate and driver's shield were installed on most Greyhound buses <b>which</b> <b>prevent</b> passengers from having {{direct contact with}} the driver when the bus is in motion, even if the aisle gate is forced open.|$|E
5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} {{is driven by}} a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves <b>which</b> <b>prevent</b> back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.|$|E
5|$|The bronze nails, {{with their}} flat tops and raised edges <b>which</b> <b>prevent</b> coins from {{tumbling}} onto the pavement, were made as convenient tables at which merchants could {{carry out their}} business.

The two remaining nails are dated 1625 and 1631.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, <b>which</b> <b>prevent</b> the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. On the other hand, it is absolutely contraindicated {{in the treatment of}} other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. A person with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their body would consume its own protein stores for fuel, leading to ketoacidosis, and eventually coma and death.|$|E
5|$|In humans, other mammals, and birds, {{the heart}} is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria; and lower left and right {{ventricle}}s. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, <b>which</b> <b>prevent</b> backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains {{a small amount of}} fluid. The wall of {{the heart is}} made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Chancery could grant three {{possible}} remedies– specific performance, injunctions and damages. The remedy of specific performance is, in contractual matters, an order {{by the court}} which requires the party in breach of contract to perform his obligations. The validity of the contract {{as a whole was}} not normally considered, only whether there was adequate consideration and if expecting the party that breached the contract to carry out his obligations was viable. Injunctions, on the other hand, are remedies <b>which</b> <b>prevent</b> a party from doing something (unlike specific performance, which requires them to do something). Until the Common Law Procedure Act 1854, the Court of Chancery was the only body qualified to grant injunctions and specific performance.|$|E

5|$|The two valves of the bivalve shell {{are held}} {{together}} at the hinge by a ligament composed of two keratinised proteins, tensilium and resilium. In different groups of bivalves, the ligament may be internal or external in position. The main function of the ligament (as well as joining the valves together) is to passively cause the shell to open. The shell is actively closed using the adductor muscle or muscles which {{are attached to the}} inner surface of both valves. The position of the muscles is often clearly visible on the inside of empty valves as circular or oval muscle scars. Along the hinge line of the shell are, in most cases, a number of hinge teeth <b>which</b> <b>prevent</b> the valves from moving laterally relative to one another. The arrangement of these teeth is often important in identifying bivalves.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of marine}} mammals by the Navy, even in {{accordance}} with the Navy's policy, continues to meet opposition. The Navy's policy says that only positive reinforcement is to be used while training the military dolphins, and that they be cared for {{in accordance with}} accepted standards in animal care. The inevitable stresses involved in training are topics of controversy, as their treatment is unlike the animals' natural lifestyle, especially towards their confined spaces when not training. There is also controversy over the use of muzzles and other inhibitors, <b>which</b> <b>prevent</b> the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects, but conservation activists say this is done to reinforce the trainers' control over the dolphins, who hand out food rewards. The means of transportation is also an issue for conservation activists, since they are hauled in dry carriers, and switching tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are territorial.|$|E
