5|$|Dunball wharf {{was built}} in 1844 by Bridgwater coal merchants, and <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bristol and Exeter Railway by a rail track which crossed the A38.

5|$|Historically; the {{division}} into ancient parishes <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> manorial system, with parishes and manors often {{sharing the same}} boundaries. However the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866 declared a divergence between the historic ecclesiastical parish and administrative functions within the locality, thus creating civil parishes. These administrative units formed the bottom-tier of local government within England and were established from 1866.|$|E

5|$|The aerial {{game was}} also {{developed}} within the Sheffield game.

5|$|Both the {{external}} walls and those around the keep were fitted with merlons and parapets, with the parapets of the keep positioned 6.5 meters higher {{than their counterparts}} along {{the external}} wall. This was done to establish a secondary defensive line that enabled the building's defenders to shoot arrows at attackers who breached the external walls.

5|$|During the {{preceding}} Tang dynasty, {{the civil service}} examinations did not yet produce {{the high number of}} officials as they would during the Song dynasty; a hereditary aristocracy remained dependent on the court for attaining rank and holding office. Song rulers, particularly Emperor Huizong, encountered a great deal of political opposition despite attempts to attain the ideals of the sage kings of antiquity. The inability of the sovereign to monopolize political authority <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rise of a new class of gentry and scholar-official who filled the bureaucracy.|$|E

NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has stated that NATO membership is still an option for Ukraine, and support for NATO membership has risen to 63.9 percent in government-controlled Ukraine according to a July 2015 poll. Previous polls had shown that the decline in opposition to membership <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ongoing Russian intervention.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, Fox {{announced}} plans to reboot the Fantastic Four film franchise, with Michael Green and Jeremy Slater writing, Seth Grahame-Smith polishing the film's script, and Akiva Goldsman and Matthew Vaughn producing.

Filming started mid September 2013. As it is produced by Fox, the film is independent from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

5|$|In the meantime, Ivan Shishman {{was engaged}} in a war against the voivode of Wallachia, Dan I, between 1384 and 1386. There are few details about that war, only a brief note in the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle that Dan I died 23 September 1386 after being poisoned. The war <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{hostilities}} between Ivan Shishman and Ivan Sratsimir (Dan I's uncle), who {{had the support of}} the Wallachian rulers and was married to Anna of the House of Basarab.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1820s, when Manuel José García was Minister of Finance, the {{government}} borrowed heavily to finance new projects {{and to pay}} off war debts. These loans were tendered at usurious rates: in one notorious loan, {{the government}} received credit for £570,000 from the Baring Brothers {{in exchange for a}} debt of £1,000,000. In the 1820s, the peso papel began to lose value rapidly with respect to the peso fuerte, which <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> price of gold. In 1827 the peso papel was devalued by 33%, and was devalued again by 68% in 1829.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the economy of the city of Split and its {{surrounding}} area started to recover and Split soon became hub of the central Dalmatia, connecting the hinterland and the neighboring islands. This spurred development of the city port and its transport connections, including construction of a new breakwater and the Split–Knin railway. In 1925, the railway <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rijeka–Zagreb railway via Gospić, allowing development of a modern port. Since 1957, cargo terminals of the Port of Split were relocated from the city centre to industrial zones in Solin and Kaštela areas, while passenger traffic still uses the centrally positioned harbor.|$|E

5|$|Szigetvár {{was divided}} into three {{sections}} divided by water: the old town, the new town and the castle—each of which <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next by bridges and to the land by causeways. Although it was not built on particularly high ground the inner castle, which occupied much of the area of today's castle, was not directly accessible to the attackers. This was because two other baileys {{had to be taken}} and secured before a final assault on the inner castle could be launched.|$|E
5|$|The caretaker's cottage is two storeys high, {{built of}} {{limestone}} ashlar with a slate roof. It has sash windows {{to the south}} and north, with false windows on the east and west ends. Access to the pool is through the ground floor lobby of the cottage. Inside, the original panelled ceiling remains intact as well as a hob and fireplace in the bedroom and another early 19th-century fireplace on the ground floor. On either side of the cottage are six changing cubicles with sloping roofs covered with asbestos sheets. At the western end are two further dressing rooms and the perpetual shower which <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ladies' pool.|$|E
5|$|The season had eleven {{tropical}} depressions, {{of which}} nine intensified into tropical storms, three became hurricanes, and two became major hurricanes. The inactivity throughout the basin <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{formation of an}} El Niño, which increased wind shear. The two most significant storms of the season, in terms of loss of life and damage, were Hurricanes Bill and Ida. Hurricane Bill was an unusually large storm and was also the season's strongest, attaining winds of 135mph (215km/h). Tropical Storm Claudette was the only storm during 2009 to make landfall in the United States; Hurricane Ida became extratropical shortly before coming ashore in Alabama.|$|E

The path was frequently decorated with sphinx statues and punctuated by barque stations, where the priests carrying the festival barque could set it down to rest during the procession. The processional path usually ended in a quay on the Nile, which served as the entrance point for river-borne visitors and the exit point for the festival procession when it travelled by water. In Old Kingdom pyramid temples, the quay adjoined an entire temple (the valley temple), which <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pyramid temple by the processional causeway.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} nineteenth century Tunbridge Wells {{experienced}} growth as a place for the well-to-do to visit and make their homes. It became a fashionable resort town again following visits by the Duchess of Kent, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and benefited from a new estate on Mount Pleasant and the building of the Trinity church in 1827, and improvements made to the town and the provision of facilities such as gas lighting and a police service meant that by 1837 the town population had swelled to 9,100. In 1842 an omnibus service was set up that ran from Tonbridge to Tunbridge Wells, enabling visitors to arrive from London within two hours, and in 1845 the town <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> railway network via a branch from South Eastern Railway's London-Hastings Hastings Line at Tonbridge.
