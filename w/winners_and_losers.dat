40|$|Coalition {{formation}} {{has been}} documented in a diverse array of taxa, yet {{there has been little}} formal analysis of polyadic interactions such as coalitions. Here, we develop an optimality model which examines the role of <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects in shaping coalition formation. We demonstrate that the predicted patterns of alliances are strongly dependent on the way in which <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects change with contestant strength. When <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects decrease with the resource-holding power (RHP) of the combatants, coalitions will be favoured between the strongest members of a group, but not between the weakest. If, in contrast, <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects increase with RHP, exactly the opposite predictions emerge. All other things being equal, intervention is more likely to prove worthwhile when the beneficiary of the aid is weaker (and its opponent is stronger), because the beneficiary is then less likely to win without help. Consequently, intervention is more probable when the impact of victory on the subsequent performance of a combatant increases with that individual's strength because this selects for intervention in favour of weaker combatants. The published literature on hierarchy formation does not reveal how <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects actually change with contestant strength and we therefore hope that our model will spur others to collect such data; in this light we suggest an experiment which will help to elucidate the nature of <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects <b>and</b> their impact on coalition formation in animals...|$|R

In a series of models, cost-benefit properties of an emerging hierarchy were assessed in relation to variation in <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects. Coupling high winner effects with low loser effects resulted in an overall increase in aggressiveness in the group, increasing the costs of hierarchy formation for the participants and disrupting its maintenance.

25|$|Bremmer uses 'pivot state' to {{describe}} a nation that is able to build profitable relationships with multiple other major powers without becoming overly reliant on any one of them. This ability to hedge allows a pivot state to avoid capture—in terms of security or economy—at {{the hands of a}} single country. In his book, Every Nation for Itself: <b>Winners</b> <b>and</b> <b>Losers</b> in a G-Zero World (New York: Portfolio, 2012), Bremmer explains how, in a volatile G-Zero world, the ability to pivot will take on increased importance. At {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum are shadow states that are frozen within the influence of a single power. The United States' neighbors illustrate the terms very well. With significant trade ties with both the United States and Asia and formal security ties with NATO, Canada is a good example of a pivot state that is hedged against a slowdown in or conflict with any single major power. Mexico, on the other hand, is a shadow state due to its overwhelming reliance on the US economy.|$|E

40|$|The social {{hierarchies}} {{observed in}} natural systems often show {{a high degree}} of transitivity. Transitive hierarchies do not only require rank differentiation within pairs of individuals but also a higher level ordering of relations within the group. Several authors have suggested that the formation of linear hierarchies at the group level is an emergent property of individual behavioural rules, referred to as <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects. <b>Winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects occur if winners of previous conflicts are more likely to escalate the current conflict, whereas the losers of previous conflicts are less likely to do so. According to this idea, an individual's position in a hierarchy may not necessarily reflect its fighting ability, but may rather result from arbitrary historical asymmetries, in particular the history of victories and defeats. However, if this is the case, it is difficult to explain from an evolutionary perspective why a low ranking individual should accept its subordinate status. Here we present a game theoretical model to investigate whether <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects giving rise to transitive hierarchies can evolve and under which conditions they are evolutionarily stable. The main version of the model focuses on an extreme case in which there are no intrinsic differences in fighting ability between individuals. The only asymmetries that may arise between individuals are generated by the outcome of previous conflicts. We show that, at evolutionary equilibrium, these asymmetries can be utilized for conventional conflict resolution. Several evolutionarily stable strategies are based on <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects <b>and</b> these strategies give rise to transitive hierarchies...|$|R

Non-violent competition is viewed as a novelty or ineffective, like playing chess or publishing opinion essays. The existence of <b>winners</b> <b>and</b> <b>losers</b> and the duality of [...] "haves and the have-nots" [...] are contrasted. By illustrating how the First World exploits the Third World and the corporate executive's use of the ghetto areas, the novel challenges the idea that the have-nots are there by choice or that they competed and lost.|$|E
500|$|Gdańsk {{became the}} focal point of the strike movement. On 21 August 1980, Mieczysław Jagielski {{replaced}} Tadeusz Pyka to lead a Polish government commission which was negotiating with strikers there. The strikers were represented by the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee, which was demanding that the workers it represented be given better rights, including better rights to strike. On 26 August meeting with representatives of the strikers at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, Jagielski promised that the right to strike would be added to a new law on the official trade unions of Poland. After 5 more days of difficult negotiations, a settlement was reached between the strikers and the government, known as the Gdańsk agreement. Norman Davies contends that Jagielski [...] "in the end realised that only two alternatives remained -either agreement on the strikers' terms or an immediate resort to force for which the government was not prepared." [...] The agreement, as well as giving the workers of the Lenin Shipyard the right to strike, also allowed them to form their own independent trade union. Jagielski said of the negotiations that led to the agreement, [...] "We have spoken as Poles to Poles...There are no <b>winners</b> <b>and</b> <b>losers.</b> The important thing here is that we have understood each other and the best guarantee for what we have done is hard work." [...] He was reported to have spoken eloquently.|$|E

500|$|The 1992 Sexual Crime Code {{modifications}} {{resulted in}} <b>winners</b> <b>and</b> <b>losers.</b> Previously, the Penal Code had {{the penalty for}} rape specified as 8 to 12 years in prison (compared to 6 to 14 for simple homicide). However, it also defined some lesser sexual crimes in a way {{designed to protect the}} interests of fathers and husbands more than of the women themselves; for example, the penalty for [...] "kidnapping of a virgin [...] when her guardians were away or without violence" [...] depended on whether marriage was intended. Victoria González-Rivera writes that prior to the 1992 changes, rape had been considered a private affair and the law encouraged women to marry their rapists or accept a monetary settlement. UNO women and FSLN women in the National Assembly joined forces after Chamorro won the election and formed a Commission on Women, Youth, Children and the Family and began to discuss reform of the sexual crimes law. Convincing 18 bipartisan legislators to introduce a reform, they asked for increasing penalties for rape (to 15 to 20 years), decriminalization for abortion if the pregnancy was the result of rape and decriminalization of consensual sodomy. When the final bill passed, the approved version eliminated the exception for abortion for rape victims and not only did not decriminalize sodomy, but increased the scope of the existing law to include [...] "inducing, promoting or propagandizing" [...] homosexual conduct. The new anti-sodomy law was the most repressive law of its type in Latin America, changing the imposed a sentence for [...] "anyone who induces, promotes, propagandizes, or practices sex among persons of the same sex in a scandalous manner" [...] to as much as three years in prison. Chamorro rejected calls to veto the law and sent it for publication in La Gaceta, a legal requirement for a statute to become law. Lawyers immediately challenged the constitutionality of the law, but on 7 March 1994 the Supreme Court rejected their challenge.|$|E

40|$|Animals {{winning an}} agonistic {{encounter}} {{are more likely}} to win their next encounter while losers are less likely, even when controlling for motivation and physical size. Do these <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects exist in human competitions? Drawing on a large database of professional tennis matches, we were able to control for players' ability and thereby test for <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects. We narrowed the database to matches between players who on average did not differ significantly in rank, and further to matches in which the first set was fought to a long tie-break. These closely fought matches present a natural experiment because players are assigned to treatment conditions – winning or losing a set – despite similar ability and performance. We found that among men, the winner of a closely fought tie-break had an approximate 60 % chance of winning the second set, the loser a 40 % chance. These effects did not exist among women, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that androgens mediate <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects. Our results may help in the design of competitions in sport as well as in work environments, where it may prove useful to either encourage winner effects or to attenuate their occasional adverse consequences...|$|R
40|$|Across {{the animal}} kingdom it has been {{observed}} that outcomes of conflicts are influenced by past experiences, whereby previous winners are likely to keep winning <b>and</b> <b>losers</b> are likely to lose again. These so-called “winner <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects” are hypothesized to result from factors such as information acquisition and endocrine responses following the initial bouts. This paper applies the understanding of this phenomenon to a novel domain: patterns of winning and losing in Major League Baseball (MLB) double headers. By accessing archival data available from www. espn. com, we report on the incidence of a single team winning both games (sweeps) versus each team winning one game (splits) in MLB double headers over the last 13 years. Consistent with previous research on <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects, we show that sweeps are significantly more common than splits {{and that there is a}} home field advantage in this context. Results indicate that disparity in opponent quality or skill, as measured by the difference in team records outside the double header match, was not a significant predictor of whether the outcome resulted in a split or a sweep. In contrast to our hypotheses, there was no difference in the margin of victory in games between sweeps and splits. Overall these results add to the existing literature on <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects, provide a framework for pursuing further research in MLB, <b>and</b> suggest that <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects may be present across a variety of other forms of human social interaction...|$|R
40|$|<b>Winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> {{effects are}} defined as an {{increased}} probability of winning an aggressive interaction at time T, based on victories at time T- 1, T- 2, etc., and an increased probability of losing at time T, based on losses at time T- 1, T- 2, etc., respectively. Prior theoretical work on dominance hierarchy formation has demonstrated that when players are not capable of individual recognition, loser effects always produce a clear top-ranked (alpha) individual, but all other ranks in a group remain unclear; whereas winner effects always produce strict linear hierarchies in which the rank of each individual is clear. Paradoxically, however, when individual recognition [...] a phenomenon long thought to stabilize hierarchies [...] is possible, <b>winner</b> <b>and</b> <b>loser</b> effects have {{no impact on the}} probability of forming strict linear hierarchies...|$|R
