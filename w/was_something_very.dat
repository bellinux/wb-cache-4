5|$|The {{preservation}} of these fossils {{is one of}} their great fascinations to science. As soft-bodied organisms, they would normally not fossilize and, unlike later soft-bodied fossil biota such as the Burgess Shale or Solnhofen Limestone, the Ediacaran biota is not found in a restricted environment subject to unusual local conditions: they were a global phenomenon. The processes that were operating must have been systemic and worldwide. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> different about the Ediacaran Period that permitted these delicate creatures to be left behind and it is thought the fossils were preserved by virtue of rapid covering by ash or sand, trapping them against the mud or microbial mats on which they lived. Their preservation was possibly enhanced by the high concentration of silica in the oceans before silica-secreting organisms such as sponges and diatoms became prevalent. Ash beds provide more detail and can readily be dated to the nearest million years or better using radiometric dating.|$|E

Meeting the Beatles <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> special for her, {{although}} she knew that English people would think that she ate sauerkraut, and would comment on her heavy German accent, but they made jokes about it together. Lennon would make sarcastic remarks from the stage, saying [...] "You Krauts, we won the war," [...] knowing that very few Germans in the audience spoke English, but any English sailors present would roar with laughter.|$|E

[...] He decided to replace the toaster with a dead Norwegian Blue parrot. Cleese {{said that he and}} Chapman believed that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> funny there, if we could find the right context for it". The group felt that Chapman had the best acting skills in the group. Cleese complimented Chapman by saying that he was [...] "particularly a wonderful actor".|$|E

500|$|After all, {{the carpet}} {{was only one}} of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the {{financial}} affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891, a year after the end of the [...] "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted [...] "an unintentional overcharge of nearly £1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Spielberg had no {{interest}} in the project because he was establishing DreamWorks, although Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy decided to stay on as producers. Test footage for Who Discovered Roger Rabbit was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; the results were a mix of CGI, traditional animation and live-action that did not please Disney. A second test had the toons completely converted to CGI; but this was dropped as the film's projected budget escalated well past $100 million. Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film. In March 2003, producer Don Hahn was doubtful about a sequel being made, arguing that public tastes had changed since the 1990s with the rise of computer animation. [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> special about that time when animation was not as much in the forefront as it is now." ...|$|E
500|$|As a teenager, Cruz became {{interested}} in acting after seeing the film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected multiple times because the agent {{felt that she was}} too young. Cruz commented on the experience, [...] "I was very extroverted as a kid.... I was studying when I was in high school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and she sent me away three times because I was a little girl but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years." [...] In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls. In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz's agent, commented, [...] "She was absolutely magic [...] It was obvious there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> impressive about this kid.... She was very green, but there was a presence. There was just something coming from within." ...|$|E

500|$|Celia Larkin, {{writing on}} 12 February 2012 in the Irish Sunday Independent, said [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> {{satisfying}} about Heather Mills finally having her voice heard above {{the roar of}} the Red Tops. If you actually take the time to listen to Mills, I mean listen, not just read what's written about her, you'll see she is a strong, sincere, independent woman. She didn't lie down under the weight of McCartney's fame and wealth, she continued to plough her own furrow, campaigning for her charities, maintaining a strong individuality. And that, it seems, is the greatest sin of all. Is it any wonder she was reduced to tears in the October 2007 GMTV interview? Did we feel sympathy for her then? No. 'Heather Mills has Melt Down' screamed the headlines, so now she had lost her marbles to boot. And if that wasn't enough, Carole Malone of the Sunday Mirror, one of the papers that was relentless in its attacks on Mills, accused her of staging an act on live TV in order to further her cause in the upcoming divorce hearing. How cruel can you get?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Dia often {{recorded}} a [...] "song diary," [...] an impromptu recorded song, on her MySpace page. She explained, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> raw, {{and to be}} honest, something that I was slightly embarrassed to put up because of the quality but I did anyways, for any of our listeners who would care to hear something not hot off the production belt, but something more organic and 'home made.' It made me feel better to share my feelings with people who could connect, and I {{think that is what}} happened with many." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} Meitner herself {{wrote in a}} letter, [...] "Surely Hahn fully {{deserved}} the Nobel Prize for chemistry. There is really no doubt about it. But I believe that Otto Robert Frisch and I contributed something not insignificant to the clarification {{of the process of}} uranium fission—how it originates and that it produces so much energy and that <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> remote to Hahn." [...] In a similar vein, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Lise Meitner's former assistant, later added that Hahn [...] "certainly did deserve this Nobel Prize. He would have deserved it even if he had not made this discovery. But everyone recognized that the splitting of the atomic nucleus merited a Nobel Prize." [...] Frisch wrote similarly in a 1955 letter.|$|E

2500|$|Major Ala Wahib {{serves as}} the highest ranking Muslim officer in the Israel Defense Forces, and {{originates}} from the Galillee village of Reineh. [...] He {{serves as the}} operations officer at an IDF ground forces training base, and {{describes himself as a}} [...] "Zionist Israeli Arab". Wahib grew up in a society where Holocaust denial was common, but visited Poland while serving in the IDF and was shocked, saying that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> powerful in the fact that I was standing on Polish soil, holding an Israeli flag and donning the uniform of the Israeli army, but this time from a position of power." [...] According to Wahib, there are quite a lot of Israeli Arabs who want to enlist, but do not do so since they don't know how this will be accepted by their environment. In regards to being a Muslim, Wahib explained that he believes in the Muslim faith, and will never abandon it, but believes that [...] "Zionism... is something that fully represents my sense of belonging to the State of Israel and to Israeli society, and the immense commitment I have to protecting and guarding the country of which I am part." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer Deeley, on {{the other}} hand, was quick to defend Cimino's {{comments}} on the nature and motives of the film: [...] "The Deer Hunter wasn't really 'about' Vietnam. It <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> different. It wasn't about drugs or {{the collapse of the}} morale of the soldiers. It was about how individuals respond to pressure: different men reacting quite differently. The film was about three steel workers in extraordinary circumstances. Apocalypse Now is surreal. The Deer Hunter is a parable... Men who fight and lose an unworthy war face some obvious and unpalatable choices. They can blame their leaders.. or they can blame themselves. Self-blame has been a great burden for many war veterans. So how does a soldier come to terms with his defeat and yet still retain his self-respect? One way is to present the conquering enemy as so inhuman, and the battle between the good guys (us) and the bad guys (them) so uneven, as to render defeat irrelevant. Inhumanity was the theme of The Deer Hunter's portrayal of the North Vietnamese prison guards forcing American POWs to play Russian roulette. The audience's sympathy with prisoners who (quite understandably) cracked thus completes the chain. Accordingly, some veterans who suffered in that war found the Russian roulette a valid allegory." ...|$|E
