This is {{particularly}} important {{in the case of}} the military trucks that have a very high accessory power demand.

The local economy was subsistence, based mainly on the production of grain and beans, and notably in cattle breeding. Other valuable—though geographically restricted—products included fruits, salt, wine, honey, olive oil, horses, iron for the production of weapons and tools, and exotic oriental fabrics introduced from Spania.

This paper uses duality theory to extend the <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> theory under rationing to the case of producer behavior under quotas. These results permit estimation of otherwise unobservable market supply and demand structures The structure of the farm economy operating under a tobacco quota system is estimated, and the theory is utilized to infer that the supply elasticity of tobacco would be about 70 if the quotas were removed. Estimates such as this are not normally attainable without the theory outlined here, even though they are essential for the evaluation of policy changes. There has recently been a revival of interest in the implications of rationing, or more generally of quantity constraints, {{in a number of different}} branches of economic theory. Much of the earlier work on rationing was done during and immediately after World War II. The principal results establishing locally valid relationships between demand curve slopes under rationed and unrationed conditions were derived by Tobin and Houthakker (1950 - 51). Related works were surveyed by Tobin (1952), the results were later restated by Pollak (1969), and were extended by Howard (1977), Latham (1980), Neary and Roberts (1980), and Deaton (1981). In particular, the last two authors illustrate how duality theory can be used to generate empirically estimable demand functions under rationing in the same way that it can do so in the unrationed case. In this paper we extend the <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> theory under rationing to explore the implications of quantity constraints in the context of production theory. Because of the presence of short-run adjustment costs leading to short-run input fixity or because of regulatory or institutional constraints, quantity rationing often influences production decisions. Import licensing and quotas and the rationing of intermediate inputs are widespread in the developing world. In many developing countries, agricultural input, output and credit markets are often targets of government intervention that results in dual markets. In Canada, in the European Community, and in the United States, production quotas have been implemented for dairy products, tobacco, peanuts and poultry. Mandatory sales of agricultural output at below free market prices have been features of India, Indonesia, China, and many African nations. Quantity restrictions became widely used in international trade as substitute tariffs after the Tokyo round of GATT negotiations. All of these cases have a common attribute, kink points in the iso-cost sets of firms. These kink points arise from binding constraints on inputs or outputs or other types of restrictions that result in kink points in the interior (as opposed to the vertices) of iso-cost sets, the extreme case being a quantity constraint...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} dynamic structural analysis of demand and supply in a service market with information asymmetry. Specifically, I examine {{the health care}} market, which accounts for 17 % of U. S. GDP and arguably is the most personal and important service consumers buy. This industry is particularly interesting for several reasons. First, health care service is very expensive and surpassed $ 2. 6 trillion in 2008. The increase of health care costs is particularly relevant {{in the context of}} chronic diseases, which account for 75 % of total health care expenditure. In such a context, consumers have two types of health-care consumption choices: preventive care and curative care. Although the vast majority of cases in chronic diseases could be managed by preventive care according to experts, more than 96 % of the health care expenditure goes to more expensive curative care. Second, health care market often suffers from adverse selection and moral hazard problems. Firms ’ profits depend on both the actions and the identity of consumers. Despite the importance of health care service markets, there is relatively little empirical <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> and firm behavior in such markets. This dissertation focuses on two aspects of health care service markets that have received little attention in the literature: the demand of preventive care an...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: For older {{patients}} with polypharmacy, medication management {{is a process}} of careful deliberation that needs periodic adjustment based on treatment effects and changing conditions. Because of the heterogeneity of the patient group, and limited applicability of current guidelines, it is difficult for GPs to build up a routine. AIM: To gain insight into GPs' medication management strategies for {{patients with}} polypharmacy, and to explore the GPs' perspectives and needs on decision-making support to facilitate this medication management. DESIGN AND SETTING: Two focus group meetings with Dutch GPs, discussing four clinical vignettes of patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. METHOD: Questions about medication management of the vignettes were answered individually; the strategy chosen in each case was discussed in plenary. Analysis followed a Framework approach. RESULTS: In total, 12 GPs described a similar strategy regarding the patients' medication management: defining treatment goals; determining primary goals; and adjusting medications based on the treatment effect, GPs' and patients' preferences, and patient characteristics. There was variation in the execution of this strategy between the GPs. The GPs would like to discuss their choices with other professionals and they valued structured medication reviews with the patient, as well as quick and practical support tools that <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand.</b> CONCLUSION: To facilitate decision making, a more extensive and structured collaboration between healthcare professionals is desired, as well as support to execute structured medication reviews with eligible patients, and some on-demand tools for individual consultations...|$|E
