5|$|Hambleton was due {{for some}} R, {{and his wife}} Gwen was {{planning}} to meet him in Thailand the next week. She received airplane tickets for her trip {{on the same day}} that her husband was shot down.

5|$|Most spiders that hunt actively, {{rather than}} relying on webs, have dense tufts of fine hairs between the paired claws at the tips of their legs. These tufts, known as scopulae, consist of {{bristles}} whose ends are split into as many as 1,000 branches, and enable spiders with scopulae to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> vertical glass and upside down on ceilings. It appears that scopulae get their grip from contact with extremely thin layers of water on surfaces. Spiders, like most other arachnids, keep at least four legs on the surface while walking or running.|$|E
5|$|Scolt Head Island is {{accessed}} by a ferry from Burnham Overy Staithe which runs between April and September. Blakeney Point {{can also be}} reached by boats from Morston quay, either to see the seal colonies or to avoid the long <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> the shingle spit from Cley Beach. The National Trust has an information centre and tea room at the quay, and a visitor centre on the Point, formerly a lifeboat station, is open in the summer months.|$|E

5|$|The {{historic}} student housing residence halls include Broward, Bryan, Cawthon, Gilchrist, Jennie Murphree, Landis and Reynolds, and {{are located}} on {{the eastern half of}} campus. There are three new residence hall complexes, Ragans and Wildwood, located near the athletic quadrant; and DeGraff Hall, located on Tennessee Street. Being a major university campus, the Florida State University campus is also home to Heritage Grove, Florida State's Greek community, located a short <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> the St. Marks Trail.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, the office workers are forced to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> the stairs while the elevator is being serviced. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) kidnaps Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) to assist in an important sales call. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) talk with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) about marital troubles. Meanwhile, Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) supports her husband during a press conference.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guests}} take their seats, Scott starts {{to worry that}} Charlene will not show up, but Paul and Mike assure him {{that she will be}} there. Reverend Sampson (Howard Bell) then invites {{everyone}} to stand as Charlene and Henry begin their <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> the aisle. Scott and Charlene exchange vows and Reverend Sampson pronounces them man and wife. At the reception, Jim tells Scott that he is proud of him and welcomes Charlene to the family. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) finds Madge crying in the kitchen and he comforts her. They are interrupted by Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray) who informs them that the telegrams from Max and Maria, Clive and Rosemary, who all are unable to attend, are being read out. Dan Ramsay (Syd Conabere) spots a mouse and tries to pick it up, but hits Mrs. Mangel's foot. She accuses Dan of groping her and as he protests his innocence, an argument breaks out among the guests. Scott and Charlene go to his bedroom and Gail brings them a gift from her father. Jane comes to tell Charlene {{that it is time to}} get changed for the honeymoon, while Paul takes their bags out to the car. Lucy tells Scott that she will miss him and he gives her his skateboard. Everyone gathers in the street to wave the couple off. Mrs. Mangel catches Charlene's bouquet, as the couple drive out of Ramsay Street.|$|E

25|$|Congestion in schools, {{dilapidated}} and underresourced facilities, {{and a lack}} {{of trained}} teachers.

25|$|While, as {{with any}} sort of folklore, the details may vary, this {{particular}} tale (Bloody Mary) encouraged young women to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> {{a flight of stairs}} backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, {{they were supposed to be}} able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see the skull-face of the Grim Reaper instead; this meant that they were destined to die before they married.|$|E
25|$|A {{route from}} Seathwaite not {{designed}} for the ascent of Great Gable can be found by climbing up Styhead pass and then branching off into Mitchell Cove, following the beck almost to the summit. Aaron Slack can also be used. If starting from Ennerdale a long <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> the valley can culminate in either a climb up Stone Cove to Windy Gap, or a slightly easier ascent of the Tongue to reach Gillercomb Head. Indirect climbs via Brandreth or Base Brown are also possible.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{promising}} approach utilizes passive dynamics where the momentum of swinging limbs is used for greater efficiency. It {{has been shown that}} totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope, using only gravity to propel themselves. Using this technique, a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> a hill. This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers, like ASIMO.|$|E
