5|$|Botanical {{gardens are}} often run by {{universities}} or other scientific research organizations, and often have associated herbaria and research programmes in plant taxonomy {{or some other}} aspect of botanical science. In principle, their role is to maintain documented collections of living plants {{for the purposes of}} scientific research, conservation, display, and education, although this <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the resources available and the special interests pursued at each particular garden.|$|E
5|$|OPCW {{director-general}} Ahmet Uzumcu {{stated in}} early October that completing the destruction process by the mid-2014 deadline <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> whether temporary cease-fires {{can be arranged}} between opposition and government forces. A nine-month ceasefire to allow the OPCW {{to carry out the}} entire chemical weapons destruction process was rejected by the Free Syrian Army (FSA), {{according to a report in}} Asharq Al-Awsat (a Saudi-linked pan-Arab newspaper).|$|E
5|$|The {{breathing}} gas mixtures {{appropriate to}} a dive depend {{to a large}} extent on the maximum depth and the decompression obligations incurred by the planned duration of the dive and the time spent at each depth. The quantity of gases required for scuba <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the time spent at each depth, the breathing rate of the diver, the type of breathing apparatus to be used, and reasonable allowances for contingencies.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} g can {{be chosen}} at <b>will,</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> the context. The &#9746; rule {{has a very}} simple interpretation in evidence space: Due to the disbelief and uncertainty present in x, only a fraction g(x) of the evidence in y survives.|$|R

5|$|The robot {{has several}} {{possible}} responses to any obstacles. These <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> its environment (navigation corridor, tarmac area without many obstacles, cluttered indoor environment etc.) {{at the time}} of the encounter with an obstacle. It can stop and wait for a gap in traffic, or avoid an obstacle by using a technique based on a spiral, or perform path planning trajectories.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} methods of accessing messages on devices: directly or indirectly, or using specialized access devicesâ€”although the specific access method <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> {{the skills and}} abilities of the user. SGD output is typically much slower than speech, although rate enhancement strategies can increase the user's rate of output, resulting in enhanced efficiency of communication.|$|E
5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes two forms, {{coordinate}} compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.|$|E
50|$|Any {{response}} to an emergency medical situation <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> strongly <b>on</b> the situation, the patient involved and availability of resources to help them. It <b>will</b> also vary <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> whether the emergency occurs whilst in hospital under medical care, or outside of medical care (for instance, in the street or alone at home).|$|R

5|$|Leg before wicket (lbw) {{is one of}} {{the ways}} in which a batsman can be {{dismissed}} in the sport of cricket. Following an appeal by the fielding side, the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket, but was instead intercepted by any part of the batsman's body (except the hand holding the bat). The umpire's decision <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball.|$|E
5|$|Out of the 2012 production, General Motors {{expected}} to produce 10,000 Amperas for sale in Europe, 6,000 destined for Opel and 4,000 for Vauxhall in the UK. In addition, 2,000 Volts will be made available for the region. By early 2012 GM abandoned its sales target to deliver 45,000 Volts in the U.S and instead announced that production in 2012 <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> demand. By March 2012 the Volt plant has a global production capacity of 60,000 vehicles per year.|$|E
5|$|Temporary {{brachytherapy}} involves {{placement of}} radiation sources {{for a set}} duration (usually a number of minutes or hours) before being withdrawn. The specific treatment duration <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> many different factors, including the required rate of dose delivery and the type, size and location of the cancer. In LDR and PDR brachytherapy, the source typically stays in place up to 24 hours before being removed, while in HDR brachytherapy this time is typically a few minutes.|$|E

5000|$|Traps (utilities of mid- to high value) - these {{appear to}} be bargains after a big score, but may be moved around at the coach's <b>will,</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> other injuries. This extends further to players in the NRL who can be {{considered}} to be elite but do not score high SuperCoach points.|$|R
5|$|Using this information, {{a plan of}} {{the optimal}} {{distribution}} of the radiation sources can be developed. This includes consideration of how the source carriers (applicators), which are used to deliver the radiation to the treatment site, should be placed and positioned. Applicators are non-radioactive and are typically needles or plastic catheters. The specific type of applicator used <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the type of cancer being treated and {{the characteristics of the}} target tumour.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, a wave of Luftwaffe {{aircraft}} (in the appearance of Balkenkreuz sprites on the map) will cross the English Channel and proceed to bomb various cities, air bases and radar installations. In response, RAF squadrons are automatically scrambled and will await orders to either engage invading Luftwaffe fighters or to defend key cities from bombers. When a RAF squadron has successfully engaged a Luftwaffe unit on the map, the game will shift to a first-person shooter perspective, in which the point of view is portrayed from a cockpit of either a Spitfire or Messerschmitt Bf 109, depending on the side chosen. During the dogfight sequence, the number of Luftwaffe casualties <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> how many aircraft the player was able to shoot down.|$|E
5|$|In a final onslaught, Bellatrix {{is killed}} and Harry reveals to Voldemort {{that he is}} alive. He {{explains}} to Voldemort the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the defeat, not necessarily the killing, of its previous master. Although Voldemort believes by killing Snape he has gained the Wand's loyalty, Snape was in fact never its master. Instead, Draco Malfoy earned the Wand's loyalty when he disarmed Dumbledore just before Snape arrived. Harry believes the Elder Wand recognized Draco as its master, {{up to the point}} where Harry disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor weeks prior, and the duel <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> whether or not the wand recognizes Harry to be its master. Voldemort attempts one final Killing Curse on Harry, but the Elder Wand refuses to act against Harry and the spell rebounds, killing Voldemort at last.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wine}} {{regions of the}} Left Bank, the Cabernet {{influence}} of the wine has shown unique characteristics in the different regions. In Saint-EstÃ¨phe and Pessac-LÃ©ognan, the grape develops more mineral flavors. Aromas of violets are a characteristic of Margaux. Pauillac is noted by a strong lead pencil scent and Saint-Julien by cedar and cigar boxes. The Cabernet wines of the Moulis are characterized by their soft tannins and rich fruit flavors while the southern Graves region is characterized by strong blackcurrant flavors, though in less intense wines over all. The percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon used in the blend <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> terroir and the winemakers styles {{as well as the}} vintage. The First Growth estates of ChÃ¢teau Mouton Rothschild and ChÃ¢teau Latour are noted for regularly producing wines with some of the highest percentage of Cabernetâ€” often around 75%.|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{management}} of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the thyroid, which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the individual and on the country where being treated. Surgery to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and the nerves controlling the vocal cords. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will naturally result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E
