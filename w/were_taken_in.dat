5|$|A {{week after}} the loss in the Rose Bowl, Reggie Bush {{announced}} his plans to skip his senior season and declare for the 2006 NFL Draft. Along with Bush, ten other Trojans were drafted. Bush was the first Trojan selected and the second overall pick by New Orleans, while 2004 Heisman-winner, Matt Leinart, was taken tenth overall by Arizona. Three players <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> the second round, Winston Justice by Philadelphia, Taitusi Lutui by Arizona, and LenDale White by Tennessee, and two more <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> the third round, Frostee Rucker to Cincinnati and Dominique Byrd by St. Louis to end {{the first day of}} the draft. On the second day, Darnell Bing was taken in the fourth round by Oakland, David Kirtman taken in the fifth round by Seattle, LaJuan Ramsey taken in the sixth by Philadelphia, and, finally, Fred Matua was taken in the seventh by Detroit to end the Trojans' draft day.|$|E
5|$|As the Byzantine Empire {{continued}} {{the conquest of}} Latin territory, the Turks under Osman I began their raids into Byzantine Anatolia; Söğüt and Eskişehir <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> 1265 and 1289 respectively.

5|$|In 1967, {{when the}} King Island emu was still {{thought to be}} only known from prehistoric remains, James Greenway {{questioned}} whether {{they could have been}} exterminated by a few natives, and speculated that fires started by prehistoric men or lightning may have been responsible. At this time, the mainland emu was also threatened by overhunting, and Greenway cautioned that it could end up sharing the fate of its island relatives if no measures <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> time.|$|E
50|$|Population censuses have <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> Saudi Arabia in 1962/63 (incomplete), 1974 (complete but not reliable), 1992, 2004 and 2010. An {{agriculture}} census <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> 1999.|$|R

5|$|Michael and Olga {{frequently}} went on {{hikes in}} the forests around Gatchina with their father, who {{took the opportunity to}} teach them woodsmanship. Physical activities such as equestrianism were also taught at an early age, as was religious observance. Though Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and extravagance, Lent was strictly observed—meat, dairy products and any form of entertainment were avoided. Family holidays <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> the summer at Peterhof Palace and with Michael's grandparents in Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Other lesser known claimants were Nadezhda Ivanovna Vasilyeva and Eugenia Smith. Two {{young women}} {{claiming}} to be Anastasia and her sister Maria <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> by a priest in the Ural Mountains in 1919 where they lived as nuns until their deaths in 1964. They were buried under the names Anastasia and Maria Nikolaevna.|$|E
5|$|Stress in Mongolian is nonphonemic (does not {{distinguish}} different meanings) {{and thus is}} considered to depend entirely on syllable structure. But scholarly opinions on stress placement diverge sharply. Most native linguists, regardless of which dialect they speak, claim that stress falls on the first syllable. Between 1941 and 1975, several Western scholars proposed that the leftmost heavy syllable gets the stress. Yet other positions <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> works published between 1835 and 1915.|$|E

50|$|Although {{returning}} 14 starters from 2006, {{the team}} lost four players to the 2007 NFL Draft.

50|$|The first {{population}} census {{after the}} independence <b>in</b> 1946 <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> 1952. It did only {{count the number}} of people in the households and could therefore be considered only to be a housing census. The first real complete census <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> 1961. The following censuses have <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> 1979, 1994 and 2004. The distribution of Palestinians and Jordanians within the population has been a politically sensitive issue since the Six-Day war in 1967.|$|R
5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, {{the power grid}} {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{photo shoot}} with the band's long-time {{photographer}} Anton Corbijn was done near U2's Berlin hotel in late 1990. Most {{of the photos}} were black-and-white, and the group felt they were not indicative {{of the spirit of}} the new album. They re-commissioned Corbijn for an additional two-week photo shoot in Tenerife in February 1991, for which they dressed up and mingled with the crowds of the annual Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, presenting a more playful side of themselves. It was during the group's time in Tenerife and during a four-day shoot in Morocco in July that they were photographed in drag. Additional photos <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> Dublin in June, including a shot of a naked Clayton. The images were intended to confound expectations of U2, and their full colour contrasted with the monochromatic imagery on past sleeves.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the year, the first Senate meeting always took place at the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Other venues could include the Temple of Fides or the Temple of Concord, or, if the meeting was outside of the formal boundary of the city, at the Temple of Apollo or (if a war meeting) at the Temple of Bellona. In addition, the Senate operated while under various religious restrictions. For example, before any meeting could begin, a sacrifice to the gods was made, and a search for divine omens (the auspices) was taken. The auspices <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> order to determine whether that particular Senate meeting held favor with the gods. The Senate was only allowed to meet in a building of religious significance, such as the Curia Hostilia.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{building}} was a crane for ironware handling. When the frames <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in,</b> they were fitted with suspension and axles, and then turned the right way up. The next parts were the engine and transmission components. The final part for lorries was a pre-assembled cabin. Conventional bus chassis were delivered with bonnet and wings, but the forward control types left the factory without any body parts. After being painted, the vehicles left the assembly hall. Finally, every vehicle was tested on a -long test run on different roads and with various loads. The bus chassis were tested in a similar way; because there was no body, the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions. The vehicles were handed over to the customers after final adjustments.|$|E
5|$|Children {{arrived at}} the camp in an {{emaciated}} and weak condition from other camps within the Ustaše camp system, {{with a total of}} 3,336 children passing through the camp. Between 449 and 1500 children died there, mainly from disease and malnutrition. A sub-camp was established in nearby Donja Reka. The Yugoslav Partisans liberated about 350 children from the main camp inAugust 1942. In October 1942, about 500 of the surviving children were dispersed among local families by the Catholic aid group, Caritas; 1,637 boys and girls <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> by families in Zagreb, Jastrebarsko and surrounding villages, and another 113 were relocated to Bosanska Gradiška.|$|E

The 27th built a PT boat base, an LCT floating drydock and slipway, and roads. The 61st constructed housing, ammunition storage facilities, a runway, {{and some of the}} buildings at the PT boat base. It also handled sawmill operations. The 63rd assisted at the sawmill and worked on the roads, camps, harbor facilities, warehouses, magazines and avgas dumps. The 77th built taxiways, hardstands, aviation workshops and the avgas tank farm. The 88th worked on runways, roads, radar stations and a causeway at the eastern end of the island.|$|E

5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, {{the houses were}} built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour. For many of the smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, the doors were aligned {{at right angles to}} the façade of the house, so as not to open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> a moveable bath located in the kitchen.|$|E
