5|$|Some {{residents}} of Glenwood Springs have argued instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids downtown completely, {{as it did}} in Basalt. They contend that a replacement bridge would add even more traffic to Grand and make downtown less attractive to those <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to shop there rather than just pass through on the way to destinations up the valley. The bypass, they claim, is more in keeping with the wishes of residents and would cost less. They have lobbied Glenwood Springs' city council to be more active in pressuring CDOT to reconsider the bypass.|$|E

Vorderman, a Cambridge graduate and member of Mensa, was appointed {{as one of the}} numbers experts after responding to an advertisement in a national newspaper which asked for a young woman <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to become a game show hostess.
