25|$|On December 2, 2008, {{prior to}} the Stars' morning skate in {{preparation}} for a game against the Calgary Flames, Avery approached the assembled reporters in the dressing room and stated, “I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> on how it's become like a common thing in the NHL for guys {{to fall in love with}} my sloppy seconds. I don't know what that's about, but enjoy the game tonight.” At the time, Flames defenseman Dion Phaneuf was dating Avery’s ex-girlfriend, actress Elisha Cuthbert (the pair married in 2012), and Kings center Jarret Stoll was dating model Rachel Hunter (the pair was engaged in 2009, but the wedding was called off), another ex-girlfriend.|$|E
500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Diving Bell and the Butterball", was {{met with}} mixed reactions. Marnell called the parody [...] "wildly unfunny", while Childs was {{critical}} of Homer turning into a paralyzed Spider-Man and stated that it was [...] "simply not very funny." [...] Tim Surette of TV.com was more ambivalent and said: [...] "I found this sketch to be simultaneously awesome and terrible because I have the maturity of a 6-year old and the intelligence of an average man." [...] The reference to the Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark was noticed by the producers of the musical. They [...] reacted by issuing a statement the following day: [...] "Everyone at 'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' was extremely flattered by last night’s tribute on 'The Simpsons.' 'The Simpsons' is an iconic American institution, and being part of last night's episode was an honor and dream come true." [...] Coincidentally, the previous aired episode of South Park, [...] "Broadway Bro Down", also had {{a reference to the}} musical, but the spokesperson for the Broadway show did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> on that episode.|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "What Was Missing" [...] became {{controversial}} {{because of}} an allegedly implied past relationship between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum. The controversy largely began after an accompanying [...] "Mathematical" [...] recap—a studio-endorsed behind the scenes video series implied that there were lesbian relations between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline and that the writing staff actively seeks input from fans. This incident was addressed by the show's producer, Fred Seibert, who said that [...] "in {{trying to get the}} show’s audience involved we got wrapped up by both fan conjecture and spicy fanart and went a little too far." [...] Soon after, the video recap and the entire channel was pulled off of YouTube, although [...] "What Was Missing" [...] still airs during reruns. Seibert's decision to remove the video also proved controversial; Bitch magazine later wrote an article about how the episode [...] "handled female desire—female queer desire at that—in a subtle but complex way", but that the removal of the recap and the studio's perceived treatment of the controversy was detrimental towards the acceptance of queer romance in children's television. Ward later addressed the issue and gave a more neutral view; he said that, because there were [...] "so many extreme positions taken on it all over the Internet", he did not [...] "really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> on it [...] it was a big hullaballoo." [...] In August 2014, Olson commented on the controversy, telling a crowd of fans gathered at a Barnes & Noble book signing from The Adventure Time Encyclopedia, that, according to Ward, Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had dated in the past, but that because the series airs in some areas where homosexual relationships are illegal, the show {{has not been able to}} officially make clear the relationship in the series itself.|$|E

He wasn't even buried yet. I thought, 'Fuck you.' I was really pissed and really angry. I said, 'Fuck Ministry and fuck you for asking.' They <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> on Ministry when my best friend had died. It's been more than two years now, and I got more ideas and I have done albums with Mikey and have done them without him. It's time to get another record out.

[...] Dalene Rovenstine of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "UnREAL has comic moments, but is also twisty and dark in a way you hope isn’t reflected by real-life reality shows." [...] According to Noxon, the series is based on what really happens in the world of reality show production. Shapiro says, [...] "Viewers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> believe in fairy tales, and those reality shows tap into that want. Our show dismantles that want." [...] Adds Noxon, [...] "We thought uncovering the behind-the-scenes machinations would make great stories, and we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> on the kind of bully culture of a lot of reality television." [...] Shapiro says of the genre: Contestants come in and think they can beat the game, but it's truly an unbeatable game ... You're ritually manipulated and charmed and edited beyond your control. Viewers think the contestants knew what they had signed up for. But they couldn't have. There's no way.|$|R

30|$|Since we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> select <b>comments</b> {{from each}} domain {{to act as}} a summary for the series it is {{associated}} with, we need to first find a way to estimate their descriptiveness. In Section 5, we identified the possibility that only few words are easily associated with a single series. In Section 6, we verified that comments which contain at least a small number of relevant words are easier to classify according to series and episodes. Taking these conclusions into consideration, we developed comment selection methods based on the top-K words concept.|$|R

Hall of Fame in March 2014, along with former Rangers players Nacho Novo and Fernando Ricksen.

For a 2010 exhibition at Nicelle Beauchene, her work played off of well-known works by modern artists, Sol LeWitt, Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock, with LeWitt box-sculptures that looked torched, a steel-crumpled splatter painting, and a shredded 3-D foamcore and canvas Rothko. [...] Reviewing this exhibition, critic Claire Barliant wrote: [...] "In targeting Rothko's sanctified reputation, Hegarty brings her hero back to earth, {{reminding us that}} 'genius,' 'purity' and 'heroism' were qualities that came at a price." [...] In Altered States, a 2012 solo exhibition at Marlborough gallery, Hegarty returned to shipwrecks and large scale installations, juxtaposing barnacle-encrusted colonial-era ships and sinking paintings with a charred and torn version of Gilbert Stuart's iconic portrait of George Washington. Her engagement with American history continued in Alternative Histories at the Brooklyn Museum in 2013, where she created site-specific interventions in the museum's period rooms. [...] In an interview about this project, Hegarty stated, [...] "With all the rooms I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> on certain aspects of American history that aren’t highlighted...They’re all European settler rooms, but they’re not really showing the darker side, which I guess is what I always do.” ...|$|R
