50|$|Alexander {{disease is}} a genetic {{disorder}} affecting the midbrain and cerebellum of the central nervous system. It is caused by mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) that maps to chromosome 17q21. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, such that {{the child of a}} parent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> a 50% chance of inheriting the condition, if the parent is heterozygotic. However, most cases arise de novo as the result of sporadic mutations.|$|E

50|$|The {{incidence}} of dominant optic atrophy {{has been estimated}} to be 1:50000 with prevalence as high as 1:10000 in the Danish population (Votruba, 1998).

50|$|From {{analysis}} of fossil pollen in peat samples, {{it is apparent}} that elms, an abundant tree in prehistoric times, all but disappeared from northwestern Europe during the mid-Holocene period about 6000 years ago, {{and to a lesser extent}} 3000 years ago. This roughly synchronous and widespread event has come to be known as the 'Elm Decline'. When first detected in the mid-20th century, the decline was attributed to the impact of forest-clearance by Neolithic farmers, and of elm-coppicing for animal fodder, though the numbers of settlers could not have been large. The devastation caused recently by DED has provided an alternative explanation. Examination of subfossil elm wood showing signs of the changes associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> suggested that a form of DED may have been responsible. Fossil finds from this period of elm bark beetles support this theory. A consensus today is that the Elm Decline was probably driven by both factors.|$|E

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus (TIDM) is an autoimmune disease {{characterized by the}} destruction of pancreatic p cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleotropic cytokine with potent immunomodulatory and inflammatory activity. Association studies of TNF polymorphisms and type 1 diabetes (TIDM) frequently demonstrated TNF involvement with TIDM. Although TNF may {{play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of TIDM, the genetic association of TNF región <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> not been conclusive because of the strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA genes. In this study, we examined two TNF promoter variants (rs 1800629 at position - 308, and rs 361525 at position - 238) for TIDM association in 233 patients and 144 controls from the population of South Croatia. A higher frequency of TNF - 308 A alíele and also, a more frequent specific - 308 A - 238 G haplotype in TIDM patients were observed with a limited significance. However, we did not find strong evidence of association of TNF promoter polymorphisms with TIDM.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) is {{a disease}} that affects {{a large number of}} people, and the number of problems associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> been increasing in the past few decades. These problems include cardiovascular disorders, blindness and the eventual need to amputate limbs. Therefore, {{the quality of life for}} people living with DM is less than it is for healthy people. In several cases, metabolic syndrome (MS), which can be considered a disturbance of the lipid metabolism, is associated with DM. In this work, two drugs used to treat DM, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, were studied using theoretical methods, and their molecular properties were related to the biological activity of these drugs. From the results, it was possible to correlate the properties of each substance-particularly electronic properties-with the biological interactions that are linked to their pharmacological effects. These results suggest that there are future prospects for designing or developing new drugs based on the correlation between theoretical and experimental properties.
