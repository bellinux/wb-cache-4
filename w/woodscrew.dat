5|$|The Screwfix {{company is}} based in Houndstone having started life as the <b>Woodscrew</b> Supply Company in 1979. However the {{warehouse}} was relocated to Stoke-on-Trent following failure to gain planning permission for building expansion.|$|E
50|$|Screwfix is the United Kingdom's largest multi channel {{retailer}} {{of trade}} tools, accessories and hardware products. Founded in 1979 as the <b>Woodscrew</b> Supply Company, {{the company was}} acquired in July 1999, by Kingfisher plc, who also owns B&Q, and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.|$|E
5000|$|Based in Yeovil, Somerset, Screwfix started {{life as the}} <b>Woodscrew</b> Supply Company in 1979. The company’s first {{mail order}} {{catalogue}} consisted of a single page, solely dedicated to screws; in 1987, this was increased to a four-page version named Handimail offering hardware to DIY and trade professionals.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to have holes in the {{benchtop}} that tools or jigs can be bolted to. In applications where repeated removal and reinstallation of the tool or jig is desirable, screwing into the wood of the benchtop with <b>woodscrews</b> or lag bolts is not an ideal solution, because the wooden threads don't lend themselves to repeated disassembly and reassembly. In such cases, {{it is useful to}} create hardpoints, which are metal threads embedded in the wood. These hardpoints make repeated disassembly and reassembly trouble-free. They are essentially nuts that are embedded into the wood in one way or another. T-nuts (aka tee nuts) are an easy way to create a hardpoint. Custom nuts similar to T-nuts but with holes for <b>woodscrews</b> in place of the spikes are sometimes machined for the purpose.|$|R
50|$|For certain {{specialist}} jobs, temporary {{or special}} faceplates can be made, perhaps in wood or light alloy, {{that can be}} machined or adapted for difficult workholding jobs. One example might be attaching thin sheet metal to a wooden faceplate using <b>woodscrews,</b> allowing the trepanning of holes, with the tool cutting into the sacrificial faceplate material.|$|R
50|$|MDF may be glued, doweled or laminated. Typical {{fasteners}} are T-nuts and pan-head machine screws. Smooth-shank nails do {{not hold}} well, and neither do fine-pitch screws, especially in the edge. Special screws are available with a coarse thread pitch, but sheet-metal screws also work well. Like natural wood, MDF may split when <b>woodscrews</b> are installed without pilot holes.|$|R
50|$|In 1854, Nettlefold {{acquired}} {{the opportunity to}} purchase a licence to manufacture to a U.S. patent for a novel <b>woodscrew.</b> The licence, {{and the establishment of}} a new factory, demanded an investment of £ 30,000. Nettlefold sought and obtained the involvement of his brother-in-law as equal partner for an investment of £10,000 and the two established a factory in Smethwick, leaving its management to their sons, Edward John and Joseph Henry Nettlefold, and Joseph Chamberlain.|$|E
5000|$|In 1823, {{he opened}} a {{hardware}} store at 54 High Holborn. This was followed in 1826 by a workshop to make <b>woodscrews</b> based in Sunbury-on-Thames. The Sunbury factory was powered by a waterwheel and Nettlefold saw the importance of motive power when he took advantage of steam power in a new factory in Baskerville Place, off Broad Street, Birmingham. He renamed the business Nettlefold and Sons, Ltd., and it expanded rapidly in London and Birmingham.|$|R
