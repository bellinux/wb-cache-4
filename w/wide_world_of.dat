40|$|As a {{journalist}} my instincts are anti-regulatory. But {{if you look}} at the <b>wider</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> media and communications it is obvious that even open markets need managing.

The Internet, itself, is a fragile and dynamic communications space that also needs protection...|$|R
