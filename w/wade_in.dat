5|$|All the Kimberella fossils {{found so}} far are {{assigned}} to one species, K. quadrata. The first specimens were discovered in Australia in 1959. They were originally classified as jellyfish by Martin Glaessner and Mary <b>Wade</b> <b>in</b> 1966, and then as box jellyfish by <b>Wade</b> <b>in</b> 1972, a view that remained popular until the fossils of the White sea region were discovered; these prompted a reinterpretation. Research on these specimens by Mikhail A. Fedonkin, initially with Benjamin M. Waggoner in 1997, led to Kimberella being recognised as the oldest well-documented triploblastic bilaterian organism — not a jellyfish at all.|$|E
5|$|Scott's {{work in the}} 1870s {{included}} the installation of large gas chandeliers made by the Coventry metalworker Francis Skidmore. They were converted to electricity in 1979. Other new features included a new pulpit and seating. A marble altarpiece from General George <b>Wade</b> <b>in</b> the sanctuary was removed and replaced with a decorative reredos.|$|E
5|$|The genus {{is named}} after Mr. John Kimber, student, teacher, and {{collector}} who lost his life during an expedition to Central Australia in 1964. Originally it was described with the name Kimberia. Dr. N. H. Ludbrook {{drew attention to the}} fact that the name Kimberia is preoccupied by Kimberia Cotton and Woods, a turtle subgenus. Accordingly, the new name Kimberella was proposed by Mary <b>Wade</b> <b>in</b> 1972.|$|E

5|$|On June 28, 2014, Wade and {{teammates}} James and Bosh all opted {{out of their}} contracts in order to cut costs {{with the intention of}} all re-signing. James announced on his website on July 11 that he was returning to Cleveland after four successful seasons with <b>Wade</b> <b>in</b> Miami. Four days later, Wade re-signed with the Heat and was later joined by a returning Bosh, Udonis Haslem, Chris Andersen and Mario Chalmers as well as former rivals Danny Granger and Luol Deng.|$|E
5|$|Tennis {{was created}} in Birmingham, England in the late 19th century, and the Wimbledon Championships is the oldest tennis tournament in the world, and widely {{considered}} the most prestigious. Wimbledon is a tournament that has a major place in the British cultural calendar. Fred Perry was the last Englishman to win Wimbledon in 1936. He was {{the first player to}} win all four Grand Slam singles titles and helped lead the Great Britain team to four Davis Cup wins. English women who have won Wimbledon include: Ann Haydon Jones in 1969 and Virginia <b>Wade</b> <b>in</b> 1977.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Natalya meet <b>Wade</b> <b>in</b> the Florida Keys and borrow {{his plane}} {{for the trip}} to Cuba, where the same night, they make love. The next day, while searching for GoldenEye's {{satellite}} dish, they are shot down. Onatopp rappels down from a helicopter and attacks Bond. After a fight ensues, Bond shoots down the helicopter, which snares Onatopp and crushes her to death against a tree. Bond and Natalya watch water draining out of a lake, uncovering the satellite dish. They infiltrate the control station, and Bond is captured. Trevelyan reveals his plan to rob the Bank of England before erasing all of its financial records with the second GoldenEye (Misha), concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy.|$|E

5|$|Food {{items include}} snails, worms, small crustaceans, flies and beetles. The {{proportions}} of each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae {{are important in}} Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc Assiminea grayana in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger food items, and may <b>wade</b> <b>in</b> deeper water. When food is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Wade singing and playing his guitar {{in a hotel}} room. While singing, Wade is seen packing his clothes into a suit case in {{separate}} camera shots. He then leaves the hotel room and it shows a time-lapse scene of a car going down a highway. Then, the video cuts to a restaurant, where Wade is seen lying on a restaurant booth and singing the lyrics of the song. After this, Wade is seen {{with the rest of}} Lifehouse in a concert setting in a restaurant. It then splits to shots of Wade singing the lyrics of the song to the camera. Toward the end of the video, it switches to Lifehouse playing the song in front of a crowd while showing shots of <b>Wade</b> <b>in</b> a car going down a highway. It ends with the scene of Lifehouse in a restaurant and then switches to a camera shot of all of the band members with the video fading out on Wade.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} for certain who the {{causeway}} is named after, but the figure was at the latest pre-Renaissance, {{and the majority of}} sources agree that it has its origins in the medieval period or earlier. The name Wade appears {{as one of the most}} common surnames in a 1381 poll tax register from Suffolk, and philologist P H Reaney reports multiple instances of it from the 11th and 12th centuries. The names Wade or Wada were common in pre-medieval English history and historian William Searle records around a dozen historic Wades in his Onomasticon of early Anglo-Saxon names. The earliest figure from the region identified as <b>Wade</b> <b>in</b> extant writings is Duke Wada, a historical personage of Saxon descent who is recorded in 1083 as having been a prominent figure living in the Yorkshire area around 798. It is possible that this person was either named after—or has been conflated over time with—one of several earlier, mythological figures known as Wade. Chadwick states that it is most probable that the causeway is named directly after a well-known mythological, rather than historical, Wada.|$|E

5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and <b>Wade</b> <b>in</b> part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{regained his}} number two ranking after {{he won the}} 2016 Internazionali BNL d'Italia for his 1st title {{of the season and}} 36th overall. He {{defeated}} Mikhail Kukushkin, Jérémy Chardy, 12th seed David Goffin, Lucas Pouille, and number 1 seed Djokovic all in straight sets. This was his first win over Djokovic on clay and became the first British player since Virginia <b>Wade</b> <b>in</b> 1971 to win the title and the first British man since George Patrick Hughes in 1931. Murray then moved on to the French Open where he struggled in the opening rounds coming through two five-set matches against Štěpánek and French wildcard Mathias Bourgue. He came through in straight sets against big servers Ivo Karlović and John Isner to reach the quarterfinals where he beat home favourite Richard Gasquet in four sets to set up a semifinal clash against defending champion Stanislas Wawrinka. Murray defeated Wawrinka in four sets to become the first male British player since Bunny Austin in 1937, to reach a French Open final. He was unable to win his maiden French Open final, losing to Djokovic in four sets.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason <b>Wade</b> <b>in</b> the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E
