5|$|For {{several days}} in November, a trough was present across the west-central Atlantic Ocean. On November10, three ships {{reported}} a cyclonic circulation northeast of Bermuda, with peak winds of 70mph (110km/h). It was a large system, and <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been classified a subtropical cyclone in the satellite era. The storm moved northeastward and weakened, degenerating into a trough on November12 before being merging with another system.|$|E

5|$|By the 2000s, the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters needed {{upgrades}} to its building {{systems and}} facilities. The company {{spent two years}} deciding whether to renovate its current building or to move to cheaper, more modern space in Center City. In 2006 Rohm and Haas decided {{to stay in the}} current building and spend up to US$25 million on renovations. The building's architecture and layout were the main reason for the company to stay. The building allows single departments to stay together on the same floor, while in a Center City skyscraper departments <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> to be spread out over several floors.|$|E
5|$|Despite Nelson's {{fondness for}} the ship, she was {{frequently}} {{in need of}} repair and refitting, and <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been hulked or scrapped in 1802 had war with France not recommenced. She fought at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, as part of Nelson's weather column, where she forced the surrender of the Spanish four-decker Santísima Trinidad. Agamemnons later career was served in South American waters off Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the process}} that was {{to lead to the}} 1996 Doctor Who film, Universal Television had Amblin Entertainment produce a writers' bible which {{detailed}} John Leekley's proposed pilot and episodes of a new series. The new series would have established a new continuity rather than following on from the classic series, and the bible reused many elements from the classic series. It is unclear whether clearance could have been obtained for all the episodes detailed, as the costs <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> fallen to the BBC.|$|E

5|$|Grand Duke Vytenis' origins are {{relatively}} well-established; {{he was the}} son of Butvydas, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295. No consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give Traidenis as the ancestor, this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson Boleslaw-Yuri would have violated canon law, since the two would have been related by blood, and this violation <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been noticed by the pope.|$|E

Meanwhile, local dairy farmers began to switch to beef and butter, causing a drop in milk transport. From its peak of 20,994tons carried in 1877, goods traffic fell in each of the next four years, dropping to 9,139tons (9,286t) in 1881.|$|E
5|$|King Edward died in 1553, {{followed}} by the accession of Mary I of England, who opposed the Protestant reformers. Vermigli was placed under house arrest for six months, and his Catholic opponents at Oxford <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> had him executed, as Cranmer eventually was in 1556. Despite this risk, he agreed to a public disputation with Cranmer against the new Catholic establishment, but this never came to fruition because Cranmer was imprisoned. Vermigli was able to receive permission from the Privy Council to leave England, and was advised by Cranmer to do so.|$|E

5|$|The Banu Nadir began rousing the nomads of Najd. The Nadir {{enlisted the}} Banu Ghatafan by paying them {{half of their}} harvest. This contingent, the second largest, added a {{strength}} of about 2,000 men and 300 horsemen led by Unaina bin Hasan Fazari. The Bani Assad also agreed to join, led by Tuleha Asadi. From the Banu Sulaym, the Nadir secured 700 men, though this force <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been much larger had not some of its leaders been sympathetic towards Islam. The Bani Amir, who had a pact with Muhammad, refused to join.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{three years}} after the {{resumption}} of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> gone bankrupt {{had it not been for}} James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested £2,000 and assumed control of the club. In the 1938–39 season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, the US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics {{requested}} industry {{proposals for}} a new seaplane to replace the Kingfisher and Curtiss SO3C Seamew. The new aircraft was required {{to be able to}} use landing gear as well as floats. Curtiss submitted a design on 1 August, and received a contract for two prototypes and five service-test aircraft on 25 August. The first flight of a prototype XSC-1 took place on 16 February 1944 at the Columbus, Ohio Curtiss plant. The first production aircraft were delivered in October 1944, and by the beginning of 1945 the single-seat Curtiss SC Seahawk floatplane began replacing the Kingfisher. Had the Montana class been completed, they would have arrived around the time of this replacement, and <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> been equipped with the Seahawk for use in combat operations and seaborne search and rescue.|$|E

5|$|Junayd {{used the}} {{diversion}} {{to break through}} to Samarkand, but as his army exited the defile, his officers persuaded him to make camp and spend the night there instead of making for the city. The advice proved sound, as the Turgesh caught up with them and <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> annihilated Junayd's army on open ground. As it was, the camp's fortifications could not be completed before the next day, when the Turgesh renewed their attack. At this point, the Arabs were so hard-pressed that Junayd even promised the army's slaves their freedom if they would fight. Many did so, using saddle blankets as armour. The Turgesh attacks were repelled, and despite its heavy casualties the Umayyad army reached Samarkand after almost three days of battle.|$|E
5|$|Krug {{strongly}} opposed {{the notion that}} libraries ought to censor the material that they provide to patrons. She supported laws and policies protecting the confidentiality of library use records. When the United States Department of Justice used {{the authority of the}} USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to conduct searches of once-confidential library databases, Krug raised a public outcry against this government action. When shortly after the September 11 attacks a Florida librarian told police that one of the attackers had been using the Delray Beach public libraryalthough Florida law guarantees confidentiality to library patronsKrug criticized the action. She stated she wished the librarian had adhered to Florida law, but empathized with the situation and said that most individuals <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> done the same thing.|$|E
5|$|Lord Cave {{resigned}} on 28 March 1928 due to ill health, {{and died}} the day after. His replacement was Lord Hailsham, {{who was appointed}} by Stanley Baldwin on 29 March 1928. Hailsham's first tenure as Lord Chancellor lasted barely a year and highlighted the fact that despite his abilities (many politicians considered {{that if he had}} not accepted the offer to become Lord Chancellor he <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> become Prime Minister) he was not a particularly innovative Lord Chancellor. For a short period in August 1928 he acted as Prime Minister (Baldwin was on holiday in Aix-en-Provence) with Schuster as his chief adviser, but he rarely went to 10 Downing Street and nothing eventful happened during his time in charge.|$|E
