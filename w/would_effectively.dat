5|$|Congressional {{delegations}} {{from the}} Southern states, which had lower or no debts, and whose citizens <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> pay {{a portion of}} the debt of other states if the federal government assumed it, were disinclined to accept the proposal. Additionally, many in Congress argued that the plan was beyond the constitutional power of the new government. James Madison led the effort to block the provision and prevent the plan from gaining approval. Jefferson approved payment of the domestic and foreign debt at par, but not the assumption of state debts. After Hamilton and Jefferson reached the Compromise of 1790, Hamilton's assumption plan was adopted as the Funding Act of 1790.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, Goebel was a {{delegate}} to Kentucky's fourth constitutional convention, which produced the current Kentucky Constitution. Despite the high honor of being chosen as {{a delegate}}, Goebel showed {{little interest in}} participating {{in the process of}} creating a new constitution. The convention was in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them. He did, however, successfully secure the inclusion of the Railroad Commission in the new constitution. As a constitutional entity, the Commission could only be abolished by an amendment ratified by popular vote. This <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> protect the Commission from ever being unilaterally dismantled by the General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, Kirchner {{introduced}} a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports, so that rates fluctuated with international prices. This <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> raise levies on soybean exports from 35% to 44% {{at the time of}} the announcement. This new taxation scheme, proposed by Minister Martín Lousteau, led to a nationwide lockout by farming associations, with the aim of forcing the government to back down on new tax system. They were joined on 25 March by thousands of pot-banging demonstrators massed around the Buenos Aires Obelisk and the presidential palace. These demonstrations were followed by others at locations across the country that included road blockades and food shortages.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the weight-reduction phase had {{included}} removing the anchors from the battleship, but Wallin ordered {{one of the}} anchors to be reattached. His reason for doing so was that the anchor <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> shift Missouris center of gravity forward to a narrower part of the battleship, thereby reducing the friction at her widest point. During this time, the Bureau of Ships offered valuable technical and salvage advice to both the civilian and military participants in the salvage effort.|$|E
5|$|Potiorek {{planned to}} launch a {{converging}} attack across northern and western Serbia; the 5th Army was to capture Valjevo and envelope the Kolubara River from the north, and the 6th Army was to secure the Jagodnja plateau and outflank Serbian units on the Kolubara from the south. The capture of the southeastern Serbian city of Niš was Potiorek's main objective; Niš had been Serbia's capital since July and was a crucial transportation hub for its military. It also acted as a clearing house for munitions produced at the arsenal in nearby Kragujevac. The city's capture <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> cut Serbia in two and scatter the Serbian Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitutional}} {{history of}} the Roman Republic {{can be divided into}} five phases. The first phase began with the revolution which overthrew the monarchy in 509 BC. The final phase ended with the transition that transformed the Republic into what <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> be the Roman Empire, in 27 BC. Throughout the {{history of the}} Republic, the constitutional evolution was driven by the Conflict of the Orders between the aristocracy and the ordinary citizens.|$|E

A proposal was made that the U.S. Steel Corporation, a company Morgan had helped form through the merger of the steel companies of Andrew Carnegie and Elbert Gary, would acquire TC This <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> save Moore & Schley and avert the crisis. The executives and board of U.S. Steel studied the situation and offered to either loan Moore & Schley $5 million, or buy TC for $90 a share.

5|$|Despite this triumph, the {{downfall}} of Kourkouas, {{as well as of}} his friend and protector, Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos, was imminent. The two eldest surviving sons of Romanos I, co-emperors Stephen and Constantine, were jealous of Kourkouas and had in the past tried to undermine him, albeit without success. Following the success of Kourkouas in the East, Romanos I considered marrying his trusted general into the imperial family. Kourkouas's daughter Euphrosyne was to be wedded with the emperor's grandson, the future Romanos II (r. 959–963), the son of his son-in-law and junior emperor Constantine VII. Although such a union <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> cement the loyalty of the army, it would also strengthen the position of the legitimate Macedonian line, represented by Constantine VII, over the imperial claims of Romanos's own sons. Predictably, Stephen and Constantine opposed this decision and prevailed upon their father, who was by this time old and ill, to dismiss Kourkouas in the autumn of 944.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{returned}} to Washington in March 1877 {{at the start}} of the 45th Congress and was reelected Speaker. As the session began, many in the Democratic caucus were determined to repeal the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875. That Act, passed when Republicans last controlled the House, was intended to gradually withdraw all greenbacks from circulation, replacing them with dollars backed in specie (i.e., gold or silver). With the elimination of the silver dollar in 1873, this <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> return the United States to the gold standard for the first time since before the Civil War. Randall, who had voted against the act in 1875, agreed to let the House vote on its repeal, which narrowly passed. The Senate, still controlled by Republicans, declined to act on the bill.|$|E

5|$|Stephen and Constantine Lekapenos came to {{the fore}} in 943, when they opposed a dynastic {{marriage}} for their nephew, Romanos II. Their father wanted to have his eldest surviving grandson married to Euphrosyne, a daughter of his successful general John Kourkouas. Although such a union <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> cement the loyalty of the army, it would also strengthen the position of the legitimate Macedonian line, represented by Romanos II and his father Constantine VII, over the imperial claims of Romanos's own sons. Predictably, Stephen and Constantine opposed this decision, and prevailed upon their father, who was by this time ill and old, to dismiss Kourkouas in the autumn of 944. Romanos II instead married Bertha, an illegitimate daughter of Hugh of Arles, King of Italy, who changed her name to Eudokia after her marriage.|$|E
5|$|The Kaga Rebellion or Chōkyō Uprising was a {{large-scale}} revolt in Kaga Province (present-day southern Ishikawa Prefecture), Japan, in late 1487 through 1488. Togashi Masachika, who ruled Kaga Province as shugo, had been restored {{to power in}} 1473 with aid from the Asakura clan {{as well as the}} Ikkō-ikki, a loose collection of lesser nobility, monks, and farmers. By 1474, however, the Ikkō-ikki grew discontent with Masachika, and launched some initial revolts, which were easily quelled. In 1487, when Masachika left on a military campaign, between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand Ikkō-ikki revolted. Masachika returned with his army, but the Ikkō-ikki, backed by several disaffected vassal families, overwhelmed his army and surrounded him in his palace, where he committed seppuku. The former vassals of Masachika granted the position of shugo to Masachika's uncle Yasutaka, but over the next several decades the Ikkō-ikki increased their political hold on the province, which they <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> control for almost a century.|$|E
5|$|There are {{competing}} views over the appropriate {{role of the}} judiciary in matters concerning preventive detention under the ISA. A related concern is whether the judicial process is suitable for such matters. The legislative and constitutional amendments relating to judicial review under the ISA were intended to limit {{the role of the}} courts in national security matters. In 1989, Law Minister S. Jayakumar argued in Parliament that the amendments were needed because the courts <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> be responsible for national security matters if judicial review was permitted. The subjective test was deemed necessary to reserve to the executive the responsibility for national security matters, and to enable the Government to deal effectively with security threats.|$|E

5|$|Avatar—one of {{the main}} {{developers}} of Poinciana—had long planned to connect Kinney Harmon Road with the Cypress Parkway in order to relieve congestion along Poinciana and Pleasant Hill Boulevards. However, the highway would not be built until the company was able to develop the community according to plan. Despite being included in the comprehensive land use plans of both Polk and Osceola Counties, the Polk County Commission voted in 1997 to vacate right-of-way along Kinney Harmon Road to a developer to build a 495-lot mobile home park, a move that <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> block construction of the Poinciana Parkway. The commissioners noted that the road had been discussed for years, but there were still no plans to build it at the time. Avatar sued the county and the 10th Judicial Circuit ruled that the commissioners did not explain why vacating the right-of-way {{would be in the}} public interest when making their decision. Osceola County had objected the commissioners' decision and helped Avatar in the case, but did not join the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|General Eisenhower had {{reviewed}} the airborne role in Operation Husky, and {{had concluded that}} large-scale formations were too difficult to control in combat to be practical. Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, commander of Army Ground Forces, had similar misgivings: once an airborne supporter, he had been greatly disappointed by their performance in North Africa and, more recently, Sicily. However, other high-ranking officers believed otherwise, notably the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, George Marshall. He persuaded Eisenhower {{to set up a}} review board and to withhold judgement on the effectiveness of divisional-sized airborne forces until a large-scale maneuver could be tried in December. When Swing returned to the United States to resume command of the 11th Airborne Division in mid-September 1943, he had an additional role. McNair ordered him to form a committeethe Swing Board–composed of U.S. Army Air Forces, parachute and glider infantry, and artillery officers to arrange a large-scale maneuver that <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> decide the fate of the divisional-sized airborne force. As the 11th Airborne Division was in reserve in the United States, and had not yet been earmarked for overseas shipment, the Swing Board chose it as the test formation; it would be opposed by a composite combat team from the 17th Airborne Division with a battalion from the 541st Parachute Infantry Regiment temporarily attached. The maneuver would also provide both divisions with further airborne training, as had occurred several months previously in a large-scale maneuver undertaken by the 82nd and the 101st Airborne Divisions.|$|E
5|$|Midshipman David Casey was an {{experienced}} junior {{officer who had}} distinguished himself to Captain Pigot during the previous months, but his disrating {{was one of the}} primary triggers to the mutiny. About a week before the mutiny, Casey was at his station on the main top, and the captain noticed that a gasket, one of the ties that held the sail securely, had not been tied by one of the sailors under his supervision. Casey was brought before the captain, and apologised for the oversight and took responsibility for it. The captain demanded that Casey apologise on his knees, a completely unacceptable and debasing demand for a gentleman. Casey refused to be humiliated in such a way. Pigot offered him one more opportunity and when Casey once more refused, the captain ordered that Casey receive 12 lashes (more commonly a sailor's punishment than that of a junior officer), and he was disrated, which <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> end his career as a naval officer. Casey was a popular officer amongst the crew and they felt that he was punished unfairly. The topmen began to plot mutiny.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 feet down would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly cold at only about , there is no light and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms {{would not be able to}} gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> be in a deep freeze. The reality has turned out to be very different, and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes– physical, chemical and biological. She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. Eddies from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull. Salt corrosion eats away at the hull and it is also affected by galvanic corrosion.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair's use {{of local}} {{marketing}} agreements {{would lead to}} legal issues in 1999, when Glencairn, Ltd. (since restructured as Cunningham Broadcasting) {{announced that it would}} acquire Fox affiliate KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma from Sullivan Broadcasting; Glencairn subsequently announced plans to sell five of its 11 existing stations that were operated by Sinclair under LMAs to that company outright. As the family of Sinclair Broadcast Group founder Julian Smith controlled 97% of Glencairn's stock assets (which remains the case under its Cunningham structure) and the company was to be paid with Sinclair stock in turn for the purchases, KOKH and Sinclair-owned WB affiliate KOCB (now a CW affiliate) <b>would</b> <b>effectively</b> constitute a duopoly in violation of FCC rules. The Rainbow/PUSH coalition (headed by Jesse Jackson) filed challenges against the sale with the FCC, citing concerns over a single company holding two broadcast licenses in a single market and argued that Glencairn was masquerading as a separate minority-owned company (Edwards, who served as Glencairn's president, is African American) when it was really an arm of Sinclair that the company used to gain control of the stations through LMAs. After the FCC updated its media ownership rules to allow a single company to own two television stations in the same market in August 1999, Sinclair restructured the deal to acquire KOKH outright. In 2001, the FCC issued a $40,000 fine against Sinclair for illegally controlling Glencairn.|$|E
