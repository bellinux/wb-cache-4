5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E

25|$|Where a tort {{is rooted}} in common law, all {{traditionally}} recognized damages for that tort may be sued for, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> mention of those damages in the current statutory law. For instance, a person who sustains bodily injury through the negligence of another may sue for medical costs, pain, suffering, loss of earnings or earning capacity, mental and/or emotional distress, loss of quality of life, disfigurement and more. These damages need not be set forth in statute as they already exist {{in the tradition of}} common law. However, without a wrongful death statute, most of them are extinguished upon death.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the controversies}} facing bite mark {{analysis}} {{are due to}} the lack of empirical supporting evidence. When searching the entire MedLine database from 1960â€“1999, only 50 papers in English were found that related to bite mark analysis. Of these 50 papers, most of which were published in the 1980s, only 8% came from well designed experimentation providing empirical data. The lack of research has led to the continued use of a few outdated and limited studies to support the validity of bite mark analysis. This brings into question <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> enough scientific support for bite mark analysis to be employed in court.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{aspects of}} using a living trust {{as opposed to a}} will and probate include upfront legal expenses, the expense of trust administration, and a lack of certain safeguards. The cost of the trust may be 1% of the estate per year versus the {{one-time}} probate cost of 1 to 4% for probate, which applies <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a drafted will. Unlike trusts, wills must be signed by two to three witnesses, the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed. Legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the decedent's assets from mismanagement or embezzlement, such as requirements of bonding, insurance, and itemized accountings of probate assets.|$|E

25|$|After Big Brother {{revealed}} to the other housemates that Michael was the Insider, and that the Reuben story was pure fiction, Michael faced a strong backlash from several housemates angry at being duped in this way, especially from Anna who had little contact with her father. It was revealed on Michael's eviction night that Reuben {{is the name of}} one of Michael's real life friends. Despite no longer being the Insider, Michael continued to cause conflict in Week 5, hiding cutlery as well as hiding the housemates' toothbrushes from them, never revealing their locations even after he had been evicted, attempting to create doubts as to <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> another insider inside the house besides Michael. He was the 5th housemate to be evicted from the house on Day 36, with 20% of the merged vote.|$|E
25|$|The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a United States {{copyright}} law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). It criminalizes {{production and dissemination}} of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> actual infringement of copyright itself. In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet. Passed on October 12, 1998, by a unanimous vote in the United States Senate and {{signed into law by}} President Bill Clinton on October 28, 1998, the DMCA amended Title 17 of the United States Code to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of the providers of online services for copyright infringement by their users.|$|E
25|$|By {{looking at}} a {{cylindrical}} rod can one tell whether it is twisted? If the rod is perfectly cylindrical, then the circular symmetry of the cross section {{makes it impossible to}} tell {{whether or not it is}} twisted. However, if there were a straight line drawn along the length of the rod, then one could easily say <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a twist by looking at the state of the line. Drawing a line is gauge fixing. Drawing the line spoils the gauge symmetry, i.e., the circular symmetry U(1) of the cross section at each point of the rod. The line is the equivalent of a gauge function; it need not be straight. Almost any line is a valid gauge fixing, i.e., there is a large gauge freedom. To tell whether the rod is twisted, you need to first know the gauge. Physical quantities, such as the energy of the torsion, do not depend on the gauge, i.e., are gauge invariant.|$|E

500|$|As {{originally}} {{written and}} shot, when Apollo (Jamie Bamber) fires on the Olympic Carrier, {{it was made}} clear that he sees people inside. [...] Moore wrote the scene {{to be strong and}} clear that the characters were making the decision to fire on the passenger liner in full awareness of the consequences to illustrate and emphasize [...] "the uncompromising nature of the show." [...] This was an [...] "enormous fight" [...] between Moore and the network, with the latter feeling this was another scene that was [...] "too dark" [...] and had the potential to turn away audiences; the network further implied that if the scene were left intact, they may have been compelled to air the episodes out of order. [...] To placate the network, Moore and Eick changed the ending of the episode and [...] "cheated"; instead, when Apollo flies by the Olympic Carrier, it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> anybody inside. [...] In a [...] "small act of defiance", visual effects supervisor Gary Hutzel snuck in small, indeterminate movement behind {{one or two of the}} Olympic Carriers windows on behalf of the production and writing teams. [...] The episode also originally ended with Helo's escape from the Cylons on Caprica; again tasked by the network to keep the episode from being [...] "too dark", Moore wrote in an additional scenePresident Roslin (Mary McDonnell) learning of the newbornupon which to end the episode on a hopeful note.|$|E

2500|$|On April 8, 2008, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) {{issued a}} report on the {{complaints}} of adverse health effects that stated {{that they did not have}} enough data to conclude whether or not a link exists between illness complaints and the 2007 pesticide spraying in Santa Cruz and Monterey. Although the press release describing the report explicitly claimed that no link was found, the report actually concluded that [...] "It is not possible to determine <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a link between any of the reported symptoms and the aerial spraying," [...] and later stated that was because, [...] "more than 90 percent of the 463 symptom reports do not contain adequate information for us to determine <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a link between the reported symptoms and the spray applications."
