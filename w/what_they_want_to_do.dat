5|$|As the goalkeeper has {{the choice}} of how many hands they want to use, the {{decision}} should be made of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> A shot should be stopped with two hands either if it is weak or close to the goalkeeper's body, and normally stopped with one in other circumstances. This is because one-handed saves {{can go to the}} ball faster.|$|E
5|$|Max Payne 2 {{allows the}} player to enable bullet time, a mode that slows time, while still {{allowing}} the player to aim in real-time, {{to give the}} player more time to determine <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> In this mode, the screen's color changes to a sepia tone {{to act as a}} visual cue. When in use, the bullet time meter will decrease until it is either empty or the player disables bullet time mode. The meter will eventually increase when not in use, but can be replenished quickly by killing enemies. To simulate the bullet time effect, Max can also execute a shoot-dodge maneuver. When the maneuver is performed, Max jumps in a direction specified by the player, and although Bullet Time is activated while Max is in mid-air, this will not deplete the bullet time meter. The combat system has been improved for Max Payne 2; the player can now arm Max with a secondary weapon such as a grenade or Molotov cocktail, and when near an enemy, Max can pistol whip them. AI companions can occasionally come to Max's aid, although their deaths do not affect the gameplay or story.|$|E

25|$|Patrick Olivelle {{suggests}} that the Hindu ashrama system of life, created probably around the 4th-century BCE, {{was an attempt to}} institutionalize renunciation within the Brahmanical social structure. This system gave complete freedom to adults to choose <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> whether they want to be householders or sannyasins (ascetics), the monastic tradition was a voluntary institution. This voluntary principle, states Olivelle, was the same principle found in Buddhist and Jain monastic orders at that time.|$|E

500|$|Overmars enjoyed further {{success in}} the 1994–95 season. Ajax {{retained}} the league and won the UEFA Champions League, beating Milan in the final. He scored against Bayern Munich at the semi-final stage of the latter competition. In later years, Overmars criticised {{the expansion of the}} Champions League to include non league champions: [...] "When I won it with Ajax it was only the teams who finished first who took part. It's not special any more. I think the Champions' League is just a starter for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the future, create a European League." [...] Overmars' exposure to European football had prompted him to be a sought-after player in England. He knew of Arsenal's interest, but was puzzled as to why a move [...] "didn't work out." [...] In the summer of 1995, he was linked with a move to Manchester United, but said, [...] "No thanks I want to stay with Ajax for two more seasons." ...|$|E

[...] a major problem [...] People at the highest levels of the military are involved in the facilitation [...] In other African countries government officials are part of the problem. In Guinea-Bissau, it is the government itself that is the problem." [...] A sentiment echoed by regional UN staff. The head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for West and Central Africa Pierre Lapaque also said: [...] "There has clearly been an increase in Guinea-Bissau in the last several months. We are seeing more and more drugs regularly arriving in this country;" [...] while the EU's ambassador to the country Joaquin Gonzalez-Ducay added: [...] "As a country it is controlled by those who formed the coup d’état.

500|$|The school's {{philosophy}} {{is that students}} learn best at their own pace. The original curriculum was a cross between [...] "instruction and home life". The Albany Free School has no firm schedule and does not grade students. The day begins at 8:15a.m. and students are asked <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> each day. Students are grouped by age and present their own plan for each day. They pursue various projects including writing, filmmaking, and studying language or history. The school also offers structured math and reading classes {{for those who want}} it. Classes tend to have five to seven students per teacher and the school's teacher–student relationships are close. Teachers report a relative ease in holding students accountable to their stated plans. In 2006, the school had ten teachers, four interns, and a number of parent volunteers for 58 students between the ages of three and fourteen (pre-K to eighth grade). The school has a [...] "Living and Learning" [...] program between 10 a.m. and noon, followed by lunch, which the students make themselves as part of the program. The children play sports until their 3 p.m. class and school ends at 4 p.m.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for its depth. IGN's Doug Perry called GoldenEye 007 an immersive game which [...] "blends smart strategy gameplay with fast-action gunmanship". Similarly, Greg Sewart of Gaming Age {{remarked that}} players have [...] "a bit of freedom as to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{in any given}} situation, and what order the directives are completed in". Reviewers also enjoyed {{the wide variety of}} weapons and the multi-objective-based missions, stating that they make the game stay [...] "fresh by never having you do the same thing twice". The controls were praised for being more intuitive than Acclaim's earlier well-received Nintendo 64 first-person shooter [...] Game Revolution credited the gameplay for being realistic and different from other shooters, but also criticised the campaign for being badly paced. The publication noted that GoldenEye 007 [...] "takes it for granted that you have already seen the movie" [...] and that players may get stuck due to the game's lack of orientation. At the time, the multiplayer mode was considered the best multiplayer game on the system, [...] "edging Mario Kart 64 by a hair" [...] according to IGN. Edge called it addictive and praised the originality of some of the scenarios such as You Only Live Twice.|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] {{introduces}} the Kree alien {{race to the}} MCU, members of which {{play a significant role}} in Guardians of the Galaxy. This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU, with Jed Whedon saying that it was something [...] "in the works" [...] for a long time, as Marvel Studios had plans for an Inhumans film, and this would be [...] "one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film." [...] The third season {{introduces the}} concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name, while also retconning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline. Gregg noted in January 2016 that the [...] "writer and director [...] will have free rein to do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that." [...] When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans. Marvel's Inhumans, a television series centered on Black Bolt and other members of the Inhuman Royal Family, was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017. It is not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

Sam speaks {{in the language of}} psychoanalysis to his wife and friends, usually saying the direct opposite of what he is feeling. His wife and friends are equally pretentious and miserable, and the impression throughout the novella is that they do and say what they think they should rather than <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> making them full of regrets, bitterness, and self-loathing. Finally, Sam is a radical [...] "out of habit, but without enthusiasm and without a cause" [...] for the Communist Party; he and Marvin [...] "are wary of politics today" [...] and only discuss what should be done, rather than participating in the process.|$|E
2500|$|After {{arguing that}} both ASCAP and BMI were showing bias towards {{international}} broadcasters who own terrestrial radio stations, Pandora announced on June 11, 2013 {{that it would}} attempt to acquire KXMZ, a radio station in South Dakota, under the presumption that doing so would allow it to access the same preferential licensing terms offered to services such as iHeartRadio (which is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., itself America's largest radio broadcaster). The move was criticized by David Israelite, CEO of the National Music Publishers Association, who declared that Pandora was now [...] "at war with songwriters," [...] and had lost its credibility because it was resorting to [...] "lawsuits and gimmicks" [...] to make its point. However, a member of Public Knowledge praised the move, by stating that it was [...] "a perfect example of the twisted incentives and strange results we get from a music licensing system {{that is based on}} who wants a license instead of just <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the music they’re using." [...] ASCAP also objected to the deal, filing a petition to deny with the FCC. The organization argued that the acquisition was not in the public interest because of Pandora's intent {{to use it as a}} [...] "bargaining chip" [...] for royalty payments. ASCAP also alleged that Pandora did not provide enough information about its ownership structure, failing to prove that less than 25% of the company was owned by foreign interests. On January 14, 2014, the FCC denied the acquisition until Pandora [...] "demonstrate adequate support for its foreign ownership compliance certification." ...|$|E

No matter <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> the sanction always comes. They are superficial casuists. They are Jesuitical.
