500|$|Dear M. Rousseau, Bordeaux–Paris is {{approaching}} and this great annual event which {{has done so}} much to promote cycling has given us an idea. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of a training race which preceded Bordeaux–Paris by four weeks? The distance between Paris and Roubaix is roughly 280km, {{so it would be}} child's play for the future participants of Bordeaux–Paris. The finish would take place at the Roubaix vélodrome after several laps of the track. Everyone would be assured of an enthusiastic welcome as most of our citizens have never had the privilege of seeing the spectacle of a major road race and we count on enough friends to believe that Roubaix is truly a hospitable town. As prizes we already have subscribed to a first prize of 1,000 francs {{in the name of the}} Roubaix velodrome and we will be busy establishing a generous prize list which will be to the satisfaction of all. But for the moment, can we count on the patronage of Le Vélo and on your support for organising the start? ...|$|E
6000|$|I only envy these people; I envy {{them their}} honest admiration, if it be honest--their delight, {{if they feel}} delight. I harbor no {{animosity}} toward any of them. But {{at the same time}} the thought will intrude itself upon me, How can they see what is not visible? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of a man who looked at some decayed, blind, toothless, pock-marked Cleopatra, and said: [...] "What matchless beauty! What soul! What expression!" [...] <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of a man who gazed upon a dingy, foggy sunset, and said: [...] "What sublimity! What feeling! What richness of coloring!" [...] <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of a man who stared in ecstasy upon a desert of stumps and said: [...] "Oh, my soul, my beating heart, what a noble forest is here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Mr. Wharton, how was {{obedience}} in such {{a matter}} possible? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> yourself <b>think</b> {{of a man who}} {{in such a}} position would be obedient? I did not seek her secretly. I did nothing underhand. Before I had once directly asked her for her love, I came to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|O King Agrican! if {{you could}} return to life, how hard <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it to call to mind all the repulses she gave you--all the pride and aversion and {{contempt}} with which she received your advances! O Ferragus! O thousands of others too numerous to speak of, who performed thousands of exploits for this ungrateful one, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> all <b>think</b> at beholding her {{in the arms of}} the courted boy! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If, as it is," [...] Christina {{continued}} in a moment, [...] "you take a low view of me--no, {{you need n't}} protest--I wonder <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> if <b>you</b> knew certain things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is disagreeable to me--very, to {{have any}} such subject talked about at all. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> if I began to pay you foolish {{personal}} compliments?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{have offered}} to marry her now that I can; but she won't marry me. Now <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of her--I put it to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, Tudor, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> now if he {{not only}} bought for himself, but was {{commissioned}} to buy by the very men who sent him down here?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Eventually {{they came}} to me and said, “Do you want to do a podcast and <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> do?” I <b>think</b> it was just part of {{becoming}} a part of the family slowly over time. - [...] Lauren Lapkus ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you never}} forgive me, then, Nancy--never think well of me, let <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen--would <b>you</b> never <b>think</b> the present made amends for the past? Not if I turned a good fellow, {{and gave up}} {{everything}} you didn't like?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sebald. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> come, <b>think</b> <b>you,</b> {{if we let}} him lie [...] Just as he is? Let him {{lie there}} until [...] The angels take him! He is turned by this [...] Off from his face beside, as you will see. [...] 120 ...|$|R

6000|$|If {{we could}} get Mary Boyle, we would do [...] "Used Up," [...] which is a {{delightful}} piece, as the farce. But maybe you know nothing about the said Mary, {{and in that case}} I should like to know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of doing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jeff, with {{a certain}} dryness. But as her face looked blankly innocent, he must have decided that she meant nothing offensive. He relaxed into a broad smile. [...] "It's a queer {{household}} up there, in the winter. I wonder <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Taking the {{perspectives}} of others is an important theme for Folzenlogen. He writes, [...] "Consider the 'other' person as deeply as you consider yourself, and you will always find {{that he or she}} is thinking and doing exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> or do, if you were him or her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it is as}} bad as that. It is {{much worse}} than that, if you knew it all. You cannot {{conceive}} how low we have fallen. And now {{they tell me that}} my father will be found guilty, and will be sent to prison. Putting ourselves out of the question, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of a girl who could engage herself to any man under such circumstances? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of a girl who would allow herself to be in love in such a position?

6000|$|THE SHE-ANCIENT. Let it be {{a lesson}} to you all to be content with lifeless toys, and not attempt to make living ones. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of us ancients if we made toys of you children? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My son," [...] said Nazinred, [...] "I {{have one}} or two {{questions}} to put to you. You and I agree about many things. Tell me, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the fawn that would forsake its dam?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For shame, Mr. Graham!" [...] was her indignant cry, [...] "put me down!"--and when {{again on}} her feet, [...] "I wonder <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of me if I were {{to treat you}} in that way, lifting you with my hand" [...] (raising that mighty member) [...] "as Warren lifts the little cat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A plague on your whimpering," [...] said Dalgarno, {{somewhat}} harshly,--"Nay, {{never look}} pale for the matter, Nell. I am not angry with you, you simple fool. But <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> have me <b>think,</b> when <b>you</b> are eternally looking back upon your dungeon yonder by the river, which smelt of pitch and old cheese {{worse than a}} Welshman does of onions, and all this when I am taking you down to a castle as fine as is in Fairy Land!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mein friend," [...] {{answered}} the adept, foreed by circumstances to speak something nearer the truth than he generally used to do, [...] "I believed {{it no more}} than you and no man at all, till I did hear them hone and moan and groan myself on de oder night, and till I did this day see de cause, which was an great chest all full of de pure silver from Mexico--and <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> ave nae <b>think</b> den?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Shep'. Pray, Mr. Dechaine, if a person, {{whom you}} {{knew to be}} an honest [...] and clear-sighted man, should solemnly assure you he saw a [...] dead man {{restored}} to life, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of his [...] testimony? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll show my breeding, then, {{by being}} true to you, and true {{to the man}} I love. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of your girl, if she was to give her hand to a--gentleman, when she'd given her heart to a--shoemaker?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{the man for}} me!" [...] {{cried the}} cook admiringly. [...] "That's what I call business. Well, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> Put 'em ashore like maroons? That would have been England's way. Or cut 'em down like that much pork? That would have been Flint's, or Billy Bones's." ...|$|E
5000|$|Six {{months after}} {{becoming}} a widower, Cholo's brother Raul begins {{a relationship with}} a widow. Mary finds out and accuses Raul of desecrating Sofia's memory. Ariel, Claudia's husband and Cholo's brother-in-law, defends Raul's courtship. Mary says to Ariel: [...] "I wonder <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> if <b>you</b> were to die and Claudia were to find someone else." [...] Claudia, who believes that Mary is a prophetess, tells her to shut up. Mary begins to move away from Cholo and asks Cholo to leave the business he has with his brothers.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not for}} me {{to suggest}} {{anything}} of the kind, but I write this note simply to ask <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of a triple wedding? There would certainly be something very touching about it, and it would be very satisfactory and comforting, I am sure, to our nieces and their husbands to know that they were not leaving either of us to a lonely life. Would we not make three happy pairs, dear Robert? Remember, I do not propose this, I only lay it before your kindly and affectionate heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet," [...] returns Mr. Bucket very seriously, [...] "I hope it may at one and {{the same}} time do me credit and prove {{satisfactory}} to all. When I depict it as a beautiful case, you see, miss," [...] Mr. Bucket goes on, glancing gravely at Sir Leicester, [...] "I mean from my point of view. As considered from other points of view, such cases will always involve more or less unpleasantness. Very strange things comes to our knowledge in families, miss; bless your heart, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> to be phenomenons, quite." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} would, but <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{of a man}} who would refuse such a {{proposition}} when he didn't want the place himself? Do you think if I'd been there foxes would have been poisoned in Dillsborough wood? I'd have had that fellow Goarly under my thumb." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Yorke, if a magic mirror {{were now}} held before you, and if therein were shown you your two daughters {{as they will}} be twenty years from this night, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> The magic mirror is here: you shall learn their destinies--and first that of your little life, Jessy.|$|E
6000|$|The doctor chuckled. [...] "Man," [...] he said, [...] "in my time I {{have met}} {{all kinds of}} women except {{ordinary}} ones. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> if I told you that this ordinary girl had been spending {{three or four hours}} daily in that house entirely because there was a man dying in it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Bolton sighed deeply, and {{continued}} in a strain whose diffusiveness at last became perceptible to Miss Kilburn through her own humiliation. [...] "There's some in every community that's bound to complain, I don't {{care what you}} do to accommodate 'em; and what I done, I done as much to stop their clack as anything, and give him the right sort of a start off, an' I guess I did.

6000|$|... "Yes, {{the moment}} I told your friend," [...] said Wallace, [...] "that you had {{sent me to}} him, and that I {{was one of those}} who had good reason to conceal myself from observation, he gave me a hearty shake of the hand and {{accepted}} my offer of service; all the more that, having already some knowledge of his craft, I did not require teaching. So he gave me an apron and set me to work at once. I came straight from the forge just as I left off work to see <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of my disguise." ...|$|R
60|$|At such {{a dinner}} {{it is very}} hard to avoid a surfeit, and I have to guard myself very carefully, lest, in the {{excitement}} of the talk, I gorge myself with everything, in its turn. Even at the best, my overloaded stomach often joins with my conscience in reproaching me for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> a shameful excess at table. Yet, wicked as my riot is, my waste is worse, and I have to think, with contrition, not only of what I have eaten, but of what I have left uneaten, in a city where so many wake and sleep in hunger.|$|R
