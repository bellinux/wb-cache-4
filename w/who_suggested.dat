5|$|A {{theory was}} {{put forward by}} the Russian scholar Ph. Bruun in 1876, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> that Prester John might be found among the kings of Georgia, which, {{at the time of}} Crusades, {{experienced}} military resurgence challenging the Muslim power. However, this theory, though regarded with certain indulgence by Henry Yule and some modern Georgian historians, was summarily dismissed by Friedrich Zarncke.|$|E
5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{was first}} described by Northway in 1967, who outlined {{the conditions that}} would lead to the diagnosis. This was later expanded by Bancalari and in 1988 by Shennan, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> the need for supplemental oxygen at 36weeks could predict long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, Palta et al. in 1998 concluded that radiographic evidence was the most accurate predictor of long-term effects.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Mosley {{said that}} he still {{intended}} to stand down when his term ran out in October 2009, but would take the final decision in June of that year. Mosley's close relationship with Ecclestone, the sport's promoter, was criticised in early 2009 by Sir Jackie Stewart, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> that Mosley should resign in favour of a CEO from outside motorsport.|$|E
3000|$|This cut-off {{criteria}} {{can be seen}} a compromise between Rosenthal (1990) <b>who</b> <b>suggests</b> that even [...]. 10 % explained variance can be meaningful and other (e.g. Rasch et al. 2010) <b>who</b> <b>suggest</b> that 1 % explained variance {{is only a small}} effect.|$|R

5|$|In response, the Athenian navy under Xanthippus {{joined with}} the Allied fleet off Delos. They were then {{approached}} by a delegation from Samos, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> that the Ionian cities would revolt if the Allied fleet successfully engaged the Persian fleet. They furthermore pointed out the poor morale and reduced seaworthiness of the Persian fleet. Leotychides decided to attempt this, and sailed for Samos.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{challenge}} {{that came up}} in production was who Monk's new psychiatrist would be. Several ideas included a woman, someone too strict or too nice, someone driven crazy by Monk's compulsions, and even someone who would give Monk scream therapy. The eventual decision came from writer Jonathan Collier, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> a one-armed psychiatrist. Shalhoub liked the idea, but required that they recruit an actual one-armed actor to play Dr. Sorenson. The Screen Actors Guild actually had several actors waiting to audition, and the part was given to Rick Curry.|$|E
5|$|As bishop, Burnell had a wall {{built around}} the cathedral at Wells, which helped to improve the {{security}} of the cathedral and its outlying buildings. He left the court each year at Lent, when he returned to his diocese and attended to its affairs. Peckham appointed Burnell to be his deputy when the archbishop went to Wales in 1282. It was probably Burnell <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> a compromise in 1285 over the jurisdictions of the royal and ecclesiastical courts, which allowed royal officials to return cases involving only religious matters to the church courts.|$|E

5|$|Because {{his brother}} Orlando {{had become a}} medical doctor, Hugo decided at first to follow in his footsteps. At age seventeen, he left school and {{enrolled}} at Birmingham Medical School. However, it was Orlando <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> that Hugo should enroll at the University of Alabama School of Law. After graduating in June 1906, he moved back to Ashland and established a legal practice. His practice was not successful there, so Black moved to Birmingham in 1907 where he specialized in labor law and personal injury cases.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the school could not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E
5|$|Edwards {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film after seeing fishermen attempt to bring a creature in with a net, and imagining a monster inside. He pitched the idea to Vertigo Films, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> he watch In Search of a Midnight Kiss, a low-budget film starring McNairy. Edwards cast McNairy and Able in the lead roles. Principal photography lasted three weeks and had a production crew of six people. Filming took place in five countries, and many locations were used without permission. Most of the extras were people who were at these locations during filming and were persuaded to act in it; all of their dialogue was improvised, and Edwards provided outlines of the primary plot points.|$|E

5|$|Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after walking down the streets of New York and seeing several stone gargoyles on the corner, staring at him. Gordon developed the concept with series creator Chris Carter, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> the addition of more psychological aspects to the episode. Originally, the teaser was planned to be filmed at a Catholic hospital, but the shot was relocated {{to the site of}} a historic post office after concerns were raised about attaching a fake gargoyle to the building.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, Johannes Theodor Reinhardt {{proposed}} {{they were}} ground doves, based on studies of a dodo skull he had rediscovered {{in the royal}} Danish collection of Copenhagen. This view was met with ridicule, but later supported by Strickland and Melville, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> the common descent of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo in 1848, after dissecting the only known dodo specimen with soft tissue and comparing it with the few solitaire remains then available. Strickland stated that although not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features in the leg bones, features which were otherwise known only in pigeons.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, actress-comedian Olivia Munn began a tryout {{period on}} the show as a correspondent. Her {{credentials}} were questioned by Irin Carmon of the website Jezebel, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> that Munn was better known as a sex symbol than as a comedian. Carmon's column was denounced by Munn and the Daily Show female writers, producers, and correspondents, 32 of whom posted a rebuttal {{on the show}}'s website in which they asserted that {{the description of the}} Daily Show office given by the Jezebel piece was not accurate. Munn appeared as a Daily Show correspondent in a total of 16 episodes, from June 2010 to September 2011.|$|E

5|$|In number theory, Znám's problem asks {{which sets}} of k {{integers}} have the property that each integer {{in the set}} is a proper divisor of {{the product of the}} other integers in the set, plus 1. Znám's problem is named after the Slovak mathematician Štefan Znám, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> it in 1972, although other mathematicians had considered similar problems around the same time. One closely related problem drops the assumption of properness of the divisor, and will be called the improper Znám problem hereafter.|$|E
5|$|Kumar {{requested}} Nagarjuna a year's time {{to complete}} and provide the finishing touches to the script. The latter read the script to director K. Raghavendra Rao, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> Kumar develop a simpler version, as the original was too complicated. The rewritten version was read to Nagarjuna in {{two and a half}} hours and to Nageswara Rao over six hours, as the latter wanted every detail to be clear. Due to the complex nature of the second half, the latter suggested Kumar to add a comedy plotline between grandfather and grandson. After its incorporation into the script, and after considering the titles Hum and Trayam, Manam was chosen as the film's title on Nageswara Rao's suggestion.|$|E
5|$|Nasser died {{unexpectedly}} in November 1970, with Gaddafi {{playing a}} prominent role at his funeral. Nasser was succeeded by Anwar Sadat, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> that rather than creating a unified state, the Arab states should create a political federation, implemented in April 1971; in doing so, Egypt, Syria and Sudan received large grants of Libyan oil money. In February 1972, Gaddafi and Sadat signed an unofficial charter of merger, {{but it was never}} implemented because relations broke down the following year. Sadat became increasingly wary of Libya's radical direction, and the September 1973 deadline for implementing the Federation passed by with no action taken.|$|E

5|$|Producer Alan Douglas {{had helped}} Duke Ellington with errands {{when they were}} both working in Paris in the early 1960s. Later, after Douglas had joined United Artists and moved to New York, he received, {{according}} to his own account, a surprise visit from Ellington, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> recording a piano-based album (Ellington was known as a big band leader). Douglas suggested Charles Mingus as double bassist, who then insisted on having Max Roach as drummer. Mingus had played with Ellington before, deputising for the regular bassist in the leader's orchestra in 1953, but was fired after four days, following a fight with another musician, Juan Tizol.|$|E
5|$|Several anecdotal stories {{supposedly}} {{explain why}} Warhol chose Campbell's Soup cans as {{the focal point}} of his pop art. One reason is that he needed a new subject after he abandoned comic strips, a move taken in part due to his respect for the refined work of Roy Lichtenstein. According to Ted Carey—one of Warhol's commercial art assistants in the late 1950s—it was Muriel Latow <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> the idea for both the soup cans and Warhol's early U.S. dollar paintings.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU, {{which had}} been {{controlled}} by an elite of a few dozen New Yorkers, became more democratic in the 1950s. In 1951, the ACLU amended its bylaws to permit the local affiliates to participate directly in voting on ACLU policy decisions. A bi-annual conference, open to the entire membership, was instituted in the same year, and in later decades it became a pulpit for activist members, <b>who</b> <b>suggested</b> new directions for the ACLU, including abortion rights, death penalty, and rights of the poor.|$|E
