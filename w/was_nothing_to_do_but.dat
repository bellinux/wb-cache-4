25|$|In Week 2, {{the team}} {{traveled}} to St. Louis where they lost 24-22. A major defensive loss was suffered when Brian Orakpo went {{down from a}} tear to his left pectoral muscle. Despite widespread complaints from Redskins fans and players about the Rams playing dirty, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> {{move on to the}} home opener against Cincinnati. The game started on a bad omen when the Bengals threw a 76-yard TD pass on the opening drive. Although the Redskins responded furiously and played another close match, they lost and injuries continued to pile up as CB Josh Wilson and WR Pierre Garçon went down. They would win their next game on a late game field goal at Tampa Bay, 24-22, after the Buccaneers made a 4th quarter comeback to take the lead. The Redskins only won one of their next five games, going into the bye week at 3-6.|$|E
500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, {{to a lot of}} the early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} {{was described as}} [...] "a bit of a floozy", “fiery”, “a bitch" [...] and [...] "feisty". Kat is described by the EastEnders website saying {{that as soon as}} she arrived in Walford with her [...] "fake tan, heavy make-up and hoop earrings", viewers would know that Kat would bring a dose of [...] "Viagra to the men of Albert Square". It continues to read: [...] "Her mum had died, dad was grieving and nan (Mo) was touting stolen meat off the back of lorries (some things never change). Kat wasted very little time in establishing herself as a drama queen by shocking everyone with the revelation that her youngest sister, Zoe was in fact her daughter. Then she stole her dishy doctor boyfriend for good measure." [...] It continues: [...] "With her enemies closing in, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> return home to Walford for help, complete with a huge baby bump" ...|$|E

60|$|MORELL (harshly). And {{where there}} <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but <b>to</b> <b>be</b> idle, selfish and useless.|$|R

60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> {{to retrace}} their steps, and this they did {{as far as}} they were able.|$|E
60|$|As there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> obey, {{the captain}} went ashore {{in one of}} the launches, which towed the skiff in which Maurie had come.|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, Neale reflected, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|KNOX. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in {{the office}} and I thought I'd get in my beauty sleep while I had the chance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess this}} <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. It's about {{something}} else--something I asked {{her that she}} was to let me know about." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{considerable}} trouble {{the message}} was made out and telephoned at once to the wireless station. This accomplished, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> to wait for an answer.|$|E
60|$|After that, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> to {{tell their}} story in detail, to which the {{government}} official listened with close attention. Then he asked them many questions.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> {{to return}} to where the four sailors were encamped. Then the whole party {{proceeded}} to where Billy Dill and Smiley had been left.|$|E
5000|$|Activity: {{measures}} energetic {{behavior and}} persistence. This factor {{is associated with}} need to keep active and feelings of restlessness when there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "So am I. But that <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. Mr. Sprout knew at {{any rate}} what my wishes were, and went {{directly}} against them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As far as I can {{see there}} <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at present, Rujub," [...] he said. [...] "When the white troops come up she will be delivered." ...|$|R
60|$|My heart sank, and I {{could have}} cursed my folly for leaving my cabin. However, since I was {{discovered}} there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> {{to make the}} best of it.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> play the cards {{he could see}} in his hand, and they were BATTLE, REVENGE, AND COCKTAILS. And Luck sat over all and grinned.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{to retreat}} {{would have meant}} destruction. The fire would have been ineffective, and the thirty {{thousand}} fierce foes would have been among them. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> to fight.|$|E
5000|$|When {{reformatting}} output, pretty-printing {{is expected}} to be idempotent. In other words, if the output is already [...] "pretty", there should <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for the pretty-printer.|$|R
50|$|Lieutenant Ospina {{arrived with}} orders {{to try to}} restore {{communications}} with the Command of the Battalion, but in the stark reality of Old Baldy, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} could sleep three-quarters of your time, Dan. However, {{you may as}} well sleep now if you can, for there will <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> till night." ...|$|R
60|$|After this there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> to {{introduce}} the newcomer, and he promptly introduced the two girls, who proved to be residents of Haven Point, and then introduced his friend, Pete Stevens.|$|E
60|$|But {{he did not}} answer. He {{sat still}} nursing his leg, looking at his hurt, while the blood slowly trickled down the wet hairs towards his ankle. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> wait for him.|$|E
60|$|She read it, {{and said}} no more. Could he have seen her write on the wall? She did not know. Fate, it seemed, would have it this way, and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> to acquiesce.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my lady," [...] said Griffiths, [...] "and Mrs. Ellison {{is worse}} again, with rheumatics. There would <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> the whole time, but nurse {{the two of}} them." ...|$|R
60|$|Before dark {{that night}} Pan had {{most of his}} {{preparations}} made, so that next morning there would <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but eat, pack the horses, saddle up and ride.|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at present, sergeant. We {{have only}} to wait quietly until our fellows {{come down to the}} river, and then I will soon get you assistance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be {{discouraged}} lads!" [...] {{came from the}} guide. [...] "It isn't so bad a short distance further on. Follow me." [...] And he started again, and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> to fall in behind him.|$|E
60|$|While at Prahsu, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> to {{speculate}} {{as to what}} would be the next move. Colonel Willcocks kept his plan to himself, for information as to our movements reached the enemy in a most extraordinary manner.|$|E
60|$|Then there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> {{wait until}} morning, when the march {{was to be}} resumed, and Neal and Teddy {{occupied}} their time speculating {{as to what the}} loved ones at home were doing just at that particular moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mind," [...] {{the young}} man asserted, [...] "it was her {{mistress}} who put her up <b>to</b> this! It <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her. It was for her mistress's sake." ...|$|R
