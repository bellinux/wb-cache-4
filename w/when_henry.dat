5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Henry</b> {{was facing}} war with his sons in 1173, William was {{appointed}} as sheriff of Herefordshire at Easter. He maintained the King's interests in Herefordshire until 1175.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{obtained}} {{an exemption}} {{allowing him to}} keep his castle at Northallerton in Yorkshire <b>when</b> <b>Henry</b> was ordering the destruction of most of the illegal castles that had been built during King Stephen's reign. He also built a castle at Norham, designed to help defend the north of England against raids from Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, <b>when</b> <b>Henry</b> Tureman Allen was {{exploring}} the Copper River {{in the new}} U.S. territory of Alaska, he named a discovered peak after Tillman, his academy professor, but the discovery proved to be one major error in the survey, Allen mistaking either Mount Wrangell or Mount Sanford for the non-existent Mount Tillman.|$|E
50|$|Upon Conrad's {{death in}} 1195, the Palatinate {{passed to the}} House of Welf through the—secret—marriage of his {{daughter}} Agnes with <b>Henry</b> of Brunswick. <b>When</b> <b>Henry's</b> son Henry the Younger died without heirs in 1214, the Hohenstaufen king Frederick II enfeoffed the Wittelsbach duke Louis I of Bavaria. The Bavarian House of Wittelsbach eventually held the Palatinate territories until 1918.|$|R
5|$|Circumstances would, however, {{increase}} his fortune even further. Beauchamp's son Henry, who had married the younger Richard's sister Cecily, died in 1446. <b>When</b> <b>Henry's</b> daughter Anne died in 1449, Richard also found himself jure uxoris Earl of Warwick.|$|R
50|$|On 25 November 1120, Louis' {{fortunes}} against Henry I of England {{were raised}} <b>when</b> <b>Henry's</b> heir, William Adelin, drunkenly perished aboard the White Ship {{en route from}} Normandy to England, putting the future of Henry's dynasty and his position in doubt.|$|R
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Henry</b> II died on 10 July 1559 from {{injuries}} {{sustained in}} a joust, fifteen-year-old Francis and sixteen-year-old Mary became {{king and queen}} of France. Two of the Queen's uncles, the Duke of Guise and the Cardinal of Lorraine, were now dominant in French politics, enjoying an ascendancy called by some historians la tyrannie Guisienne.|$|E
5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made it clear that she could not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. <b>When</b> <b>Henry</b> travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E
5|$|Circumstances changed {{suddenly}} <b>when</b> <b>Henry</b> died on 6 June 1217 {{after receiving}} a head wound from a tile which came loose while he was playing with other children at the palace of the Bishop of Palencia. His guardian, Count Álvaro Núñez de Lara, tried to hide the fact, taking the king's body to the castle of Tariego, although {{it was inevitable that}} the news would reach Berengaria.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>Henry's</b> son Otto died in 1366, {{his nephew}} Hermann was named co-regent. This caused {{fighting}} {{to break out}} with Otto of Brunswick. To defray {{the costs of the}} conflict with Brunswick, Henry levied a tax on all imported goods.|$|R
50|$|Leonardo Villalobos left Super Sabado Sensacional in 2016. After over 7 Years of {{hosting the}} show he left because of work commiments and his {{replacements}} were named on August 1 <b>when</b> <b>Henrys</b> Sliva and new co-host Fanny Ottati were hired {{as the new}} hosts of Super Sabado Sensacional. They Debuted on August 6.|$|R
5000|$|Henry's {{army had}} the {{advantage}} of greater numbers, so Owain's tactics were to raid and ambush. [...] He planted skirmishers in the thick woods overlooking the pass Henry would take. [...] <b>When</b> <b>Henry's</b> army advanced into the densely wooded Ceiriog Valley, the Welsh defenders assailed them repeatedly from their positions of cover.|$|R
5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Silsbee, Texas. As a child, {{he was a big}} wrestling fan and André the Giant was his {{favorite}} wrestler. While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch André as he was walking down the aisle, but tripped over the barricade. André picked him up out of the crowd and put him back behind the barricade. <b>When</b> <b>Henry</b> was 12 years old, his father, Ernest, died of complications from diabetes. When he was 14 years old, Henry was diagnosed with dyslexia.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Hugh Fulton {{organized}} 142 {{specific and}} varietal names into eighteen species groups containing {{a total of}} 64 species. <b>When</b> <b>Henry</b> Augustus Pilsbry's 1900 monograph Manual of Conchology appeared, {{the number of species}} in the genus Amphidromus had increased to 81, and these were placed in nineteen groups. Pilsbry's study has remained the only illustrated monograph of the genus, and it is still considered indispensable for any serious study of the genus.|$|E
5|$|On the July 22 {{episode of}} ECW, Hardy became {{the number one}} {{contender}} to Mark Henry's ECW Championship after defeating John Morrison, The Miz and Finlay in a fatal four-way match. He won the title match at SummerSlam by disqualification due to interference from Henry's manager, Tony Atlas, thus he failed to win the title. Due to {{the ending of the}} pay-per-view match, Hardy received a rematch for the title on the next episode of ECW, but again failed to win the title <b>when</b> <b>Henry</b> pinned him after a distraction by Atlas.|$|E
50|$|On Duke Otto II's {{death in}} 1253, his sons divided the Wittelsbach {{possessions}} between them: Henry became Duke of Lower Bavaria, and Louis II Duke of Upper Bavaria and Count Palatine of the Rhine. <b>When</b> <b>Henry's</b> branch died out in 1340 the Emperor Louis IV, {{a son of}} Duke Louis II, reunited the duchy.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the plans}} were put {{aside for the}} time being <b>when</b> <b>Henry's</b> mother, the Empress Matilda, spoke against it. Henry, had his hands full of {{domestic}} troubles with the refractory barons in England, with the Welsh, and with the discordant elements in his French dominions, and could not undertake a military operation like the invasion of Ireland.|$|R
50|$|Apparently, <b>when</b> <b>Henry’s</b> {{father died}} at the Battle of Lenzen, the county of Stade was taken by Wichmann the Elder and his two sons, not {{to return to the}} family of Lothar until 967. Henry's {{grandson}} Thietmar of Merseburg recounts that Henry tried to capture Margrave Hermann Billung because of “arrogance” in ceremonial matters, but failed.|$|R
5|$|The poet John Lydgate (1370–1451), {{who lived}} {{all his life}} in Bury St Edmunds, {{presented}} his twelve-year-old king Henry VI of England with a long poem (now known as Metrical Lives of Saints Edmund and Fremund) <b>when</b> <b>Henry</b> came to the town in 1433 and stayed at the abbey for four months. The book is now kept by the British Library in London.|$|E
5|$|This was {{not enough}} to cause a {{complete}} fallout between the two men, though from this point on Warwick increasingly stayed away from court. The promotion of Warwick's brother George to Archbishop of York shows that the earl was still in favour with the king. In July 1465, <b>when</b> <b>Henry</b> VI was once more captured, it was Warwick who escorted the fallen king to his captivity in the Tower.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Henry</b> I of Cyprus {{reached the}} age of {{majority}} on 3 May 1232, Alice abdicated from her regency of Cyprus, which she had retained despite having left Cyprus. She went to France to personally advance her claim for Champagne and Brie in 1233, but only one local nobleman, Renier II of Nogent, supported her. Theobald IV of Champagne later captured the fortress of Nogent and confiscated Renier's estates.|$|E

50|$|The {{alliance}} broke off, <b>when</b> <b>Henry's</b> successor, Konrad II {{managed to}} subdue Poland, then led by Boleslaw's successor, Mieszko II. Starting in 1129, several imperial campaigns with Danish and Kievian participation {{resulted in the}} Peace of Merseburg, concluded in 1033. With the Polish threat, the primary precondition for the German-Lutician alliance was thus eliminated, and hostilities started the same year.|$|R

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Henry</b> died in 1547, his nine-year-old son, Edward VI, {{inherited}} the throne. Edward was a precocious {{child who had}} been brought up as a Protestant, but was initially of little account politically. Edward Seymour was made Lord Protector. He was commissioned as virtual regent with near sovereign powers. Now made Duke of Somerset, he proceeded at first hesitantly, partly because his powers were not unchallenged. When he acted {{it was because he}} saw the political advantage in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Although fortifications {{could still}} be {{valuable}} in times of war, they had played only a limited role during the Wars of the Roses and, <b>when</b> <b>Henry</b> VII invaded and seized the throne in 1485, he had not needed to besiege any castles or towns during the campaign. Henry rapidly consolidated his rule at home and had few reasons to fear an external invasion from the continent; he invested little in coastal defences {{over the course of}} his reign. Modest fortifications existed along the coasts, based around simple blockhouses and towers, primarily in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but they were very limited in scale.|$|E
5|$|Another Gwenllian (circa 1178 – 1236) married Ednyfed Fychan, seneschal of Gwynedd under Llywelyn the Great, {{and through}} her, Rhys became an {{ancestor}} of the Tudor dynasty. Through the Tudors inter-marrying with the House of Stuart Rhys is an ancestor {{to the current}} ruling house of the United Kingdom and also an ancestor of several ruling houses in Europe. <b>When</b> <b>Henry</b> Tudor landed in Pembrokeshire, Wales in 1485 {{to make a bid}} for the throne, his descent from Rhys was one of the factors which enabled him to attract Welsh support (Henry flew a (Welsh) dragon banner at the battle of Bosworth Field).|$|E

5|$|Archbishop Lucas {{fell out}} of favor with Béla, and was ignored by {{him in the first}} years of his reign. Instead of Lucas, the Archbishop of Kalocsa baptized Béla's first-born son, Emeric, in 1174. However, {{administering}} sacraments to members of the royal family had always been the Archbishops of Esztergom's job. According to a Bohemian chronicle (Continuatio Gerlaci abbatis Milovicensis), Béla imprisoned his younger brother, Géza, but Géza escaped from prison and fled to Austria in 1174 or 1175. Stephen III's judge royal, Lawrence, accompanied Géza. <b>When</b> <b>Henry</b> Jasomirgott, Duke of Austria, refused to extradite Géza, Béla launched plundering raids into Austria, together with Soběslav II, Duke of Bohemia. Meanwhile, Béla sent reinforcements to Emperor Manuel to help him fight against the Seljuks, but their united forces suffered defeat in the Battle of Myriokephalon on 17 September 1176.|$|E
5|$|By 1147, Nigel {{was again}} {{witnessing}} Stephen's charters, and in 1153 or 1154 {{he was named}} in a grant of lands to St Radegund's Priory in Cambridge. He assisted with the consecration of Hilary of Chichester as Bishop of Chichester in August 1147. He took part in shire courts in both Norfolk and Suffolk in 1150, and continued to assist with episcopal consecrations throughout the remainder of Stephen's reign. No records exist of him being involved with treasury affairs during this time. His witnessing of charters is sparse, and almost always in company with other bishops; this suggests {{that he was only}} at court for councils or other similar events. Nigel was a witness to Stephen's charter that left England to Matilda's son, Henry of Anjou. <b>When</b> <b>Henry</b> succeeded Stephen, Nigel was present at the coronation.|$|E
5|$|Conrad {{seems to}} have been {{involved}} <b>when</b> <b>Henry</b> V revolted against his father in 1105. This would explain his election as Archbishop of Salzburg at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106. At that time the anti-Archbishop Berthold von Moosburg was installed in Salzburg. Conrad came to Salzburg accompanied by his brothers, the counts Otto and Wolfram, with an escort of 1,000 soldiers. Some of these soldiers may well have been servitors, servile rather than free vassals. With this display of force, he was able to force Berthold to abdicate. Pope Paschal II consecrated him as bishop on 21 October 1106 and gave him the pallium.|$|E
