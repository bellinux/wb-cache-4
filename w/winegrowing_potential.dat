25|$|One of California’s oldest wine regions, the Livermore Valley American Viticultural Area (AVA) {{played a}} pivotal role in shaping California’s wine industry. In the 1840s, California pioneers looking for {{outstanding}} vineyard sites began planting grapes in the region. Robert Livermore planted the first commercial vines in the 1840s. After California joined the union as the 31st state in 1850, pioneer winemakers C. H. Wente, a first-generation immigrant from Germany, (founder of Wente Vineyards), James Concannon, a first generation Irishman, (founder of Concannon Vineyard), and Charles Wetmore, a Portland Maine born American and pioneer of California, (founder of Cresta Blanca Winery) recognized the area’s <b>winegrowing</b> <b>potential</b> and bought land, planted grapes and founded their wineries in the 1880s. Charles Wetmore went to France in 1878 when he was appointed a delegate for the California Viticultural Association to the Paris Exposition. Charles was able in 1882 to obtain Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, and Muscat de Bordelais cuttings from one of the most prestigious vineyards in France, Chateau Yquem. These superior clones helped revitalize the California wine industry. In 1889 Charles won the grand prize for his first pressing (1884) in the 1889 Paris Exposition. Charles shared these cuttings with other growers including C. H. Wente who used the Chateau Yquem grape cuttings to eventually produce their Chateau Wente wine.|$|E
