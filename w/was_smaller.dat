5|$|Hume {{notes that}} the skull of the Rodrigues {{starling}} {{was about the same}} size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton <b>was</b> <b>smaller.</b> Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum <b>was</b> <b>smaller</b> compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The maxilla of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was sexually dimorphic. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but {{this may be due to}} individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|I. atherfieldensis, {{described}} by R.W. Hooley in 1925, <b>was</b> <b>smaller</b> and less robust than I. bernissartensis, with longer neural spines. It was renamed Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis in 2007.

5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} the National Renewable Energy Laboratory {{concluded}} that the average large photovoltaic plant in the United States occupied 3.1 acres of permanently disturbed area and 3.4 acres of total site area per gigawatt-hour per year. The average concentrated solar power plant in the US occupied 2.7 acres of disturbed area and 3.5 acres of total area per GWh/yr, A 2015 life-cycle analysis of land use for various sources of electricity concluded that concentrating solar power had a land-use footprint of 9.0 m2/MWhr for trough, and 14 m2/MWhr for power tower. The concentrating solar footprint <b>was</b> <b>smaller</b> than that of coal power (18 m2/MWhr), but larger than the other sources studied, including ground photovoltaic (7.9 m2/MWhr), natural gas (0.49 m2/MWhr), and wind power (0.26 m2/MWhr).|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the 1950 Census showed {{growth in}} Teaneck (33.6%) pacing Bergen County overall (31.6%). Starting in 1960, a {{substantial}} {{decline in the}} rate of growth compared to Bergen County occurred as Teaneck reached the limits of developable land, and the township neared its peak population. Population growth in the 1970 Census was small, but positive, with Teaneck reaching its historical maximum of 42,355. Absolute declines in population followed in both the 1980 (−7.9%) and 1990 (−3.0%) data. The 2000 Census showed recovery in Teaneck's population to 39,260, though growth (3.8%) <b>was</b> <b>smaller</b> than in Bergen County overall (7.1%).|$|E

5|$|After {{the floods}} receded, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo ordered the Department of National Defense to utilize all {{resources}} {{to assist the}} people affected by the floods. More than 94,000people stayed at 896shelters after being evacuated due to the floods. The federal government allocated $234million (2.34 billion pesos) in relief, which <b>was</b> <b>smaller</b> than the damage total. Widespread medical teams assisted {{tens of thousands of}} homes, and due to prevention measures, there were no outbreaks of diseases. Roads and electrical systems were gradually restored, and students returned to school after repairs were made. Residents throughout Mexico sent supplies to the Mexican Red Cross, including 500tons of food and water, and international agencies sent money and supplies to the flood victims.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{fracturing}} {{process is}} not yet known, the altitudinal statistical analysis indicates that the caldera had formed just before the eruption. The area of the island <b>was</b> <b>smaller,</b> and the southern and eastern coastlines appeared regressed. During the eruption, the landscape was covered by the pumice sediments. In some places, the coastline vanished under thick tuff depositions. In others, recent coastlines were extended towards the sea. After the eruption, the geomorphology of the island was characterized by an intense erosional phase during which the pumice was progressively removed from the higher altitudes to the lower ones.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{experience}} gained from the Mark 1, the developers concluded that computers would be used more in scientific roles than pure maths. They therefore embarked {{on the design of}} a new machine which would include a floating point unit; work began in 1951. The resulting machine, which ran its first program in May 1954, was known as Meg, or the megacycle machine. It <b>was</b> <b>smaller</b> and simpler than the Mark 1, as well as quicker at solving maths problems. Ferranti produced a commercial version marketed as the Ferranti Mercury, in which the Williams tubes were replaced by the more reliable core memory.|$|E

5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists—Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. The British Maud Committee then unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb. Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, so the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project <b>was</b> <b>smaller</b> than the British, and not as far advanced.|$|E
5|$|By October22, over 72,000people were {{housed in}} 560shelters nationwide. Additional {{evacuations}} occurred after further floods impacted Tabasco {{weeks after the}} initial deluge, and by October25, 94,203people were staying in 896shelters. The Mexican Department of Health declared a sanitary alert in six states, and 354medical teams operated in 894communities to assist 50,000homes. The Secretaría de Gobernación declared Tabasco, Veracruz, Hidalgo and Puebla as disaster areas, which allocated federal funding for relief. The National Fund for Natural Disasters allocated $234million (2.34billion pesos) in emergency relief, including $41.5million (400million pesos) in Oaxaca where the earthquake previously struck; this <b>was</b> <b>smaller</b> than the flood's damage total. The repair cost in Puebla alone was estimated at $200million (1.83billion pesos), which was largely completed within two years and dealt with repairing roads and protecting cities from landslide and flood mitigation.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the salmon}} catch <b>was</b> <b>smaller</b> than usual in the rivers of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, causing concern among {{commercial}} fishermen, government agencies, and tribal leaders. US government intervention, {{to which the}} states of Alaska, Idaho, and Oregon objected, included an 11-day closure of an Alaska fishery. In April 1994 the Pacific Fisheries Management Council unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18years, banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canada–US border. In the winter of 1994, the return of coho salmon far exceeded expectations, which was attributed {{in part to the}} fishing ban.|$|E
