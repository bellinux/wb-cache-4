5|$|Fleming {{considered}} {{a number of}} titles for the story; his first choice had been The Moonraker, until Noël Coward {{reminded him of a}} novel of the same name by F. Tennyson Jesse. Fleming then considered The Moonraker Secret, The Moonraker Plot, The Inhuman Element, <b>Wide</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark,</b> The Infernal Machine, Mondays are Hell and Out of the Clear Sky. George Wren Howard of Jonathan Cape suggested Bond & the Moonraker, The Moonraker Scare and The Moonraker Plan, while his friend, the writer William Plomer, suggested Hell is Here; the final choice of Moonraker was a suggestion by Wren Howard.|$|E
5|$|Key staff {{recruited}} {{to work at}} Fort Halstead included John Challens, who commenced on 1 January 1948. By mid-1948, {{it became clear that}} Penney's initial estimate that he would require 220 staff was <b>wide</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mark,</b> and that he would need nearly 500. This meant not only taking personnel from other projects, but scrapping some entirely. In October 1948, Penney submitted a request for developing a new, separate site for HER on grounds of safety, security and economy. This was approved, but it took another six months to locate a suitable site. An airbase, RAF South Cerney in Gloucestershire was chosen, but the RAF refused to relinquish the site. A former airbase, RAF Aldermaston, was then selected. At the same time, it was decided to separate HER from the Armaments Research Establishment (ARE). This resulted in a painful bureaucratic battle over personnel like Challens, whose expertise was wanted for research on both nuclear weapons and guided missiles. In the end, HER kept 25 of the 30 key personnel that ARE wanted, including Challens. The site was taken over on 1 April 1950. Penney became Chief Superintendent High Explosive Research (CSHER). The first stage of work at Aldermaston was completed in December 1951, but the plutonium processing building was only handed over in April 1952, the month that the first plutonium was due to arrive from Windscale. At the peak of construction in 1953, over 4,000 personnel were working on the site.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is <b>wide</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mark,</b> the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E

500|$|Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn, {{writers of}} Anderson's {{official}} biography, describe Mayne as the film's [...] "saving grace".

500|$|While Slessor {{lost some}} units, his ASW {{capability}} was enhanced {{with the arrival}} of H2S radar, which was used in Coastal Command's operations over the Bay and was undetectable to Metox. On the night of the 2/3 February, a Stirling bomber was shot down over Rotterdam, enabling the Germans to examine the radar and develop counter measures. They were shocked by the advanced nature of its design, which had proven their own research to be <b>wide</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mark.</b> Harris had won the majority of the resources for Bomber Command and used H2S. The radar was, however, used for ASW. No. 172 Squadron RAF and No. 407 Squadron RCAF had the device fitted to supplement their Leigh Lights. No. 172 attacked the first U-boat, [...] on 5 March, but was shot down. The submarine noted the lack of warning, and sent the warning to U-boat command. However, Operation Enclose, 20–28 March 1943 achieved revenge. During this period, 41 U-boats passed through the Bay, with 26 sightings and 15 attacks. Only [...] was sunk, by a No. 172 Squadron Wellington. Operation Enclose II, on 6 to 13 April, sighted 11 and attacked four of the 25 submarines passing through, sinking one U-boat; U-376, sunk by No. 172 Squadron. Operation Derange soon followed, and Bromet was able to deploy 70 ASV III equipped B-24s, Wellingtons, and Halifaxes. Only one U-boat (U-526 [...] ), was sunk, and it was dispatched by a mine. The offensive ended on 30 April 1943. The results had been disappointing. The Command had flown 80,443 hours, lost 170 aircraft, sunk 10 submarines, and damaged 24.|$|E

The second event is associated with a shift of sedimentary deposition from the slope toward the basin.

50|$|The dolmen {{dates from}} {{approximately}} 3,500 B.C. and {{has traditionally been}} identified as a communal burial.

An elaborate entrance facade surrounding the portal, which may have been a later addition, was built with carefully constructed dry stone walling. Individual burials are thought to have been made within the stone chamber, which would be re-used many times. No trace of bones were found in the tomb, raising the possibility that they were subsequently transferred elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether individual students at the eleventh grade level who were graded on a pass-fail basis in United States History would show any difference in academic achievement from those of a similar group <b>marked</b> by <b>the</b> traditional ABCD-F letter-grade method. In addition, the study was to investigate the effect, if any, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pass-fail <b>marking</b> system on <b>the</b> study habits, study attitudes, and the over-all study orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same students as compared with those being evaluated by the letter-grade system. Specific hypotheses to be examined were: 1. There is no difference between the experimental and control groups in <b>the</b> academic achievement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States History students as measured by the Crary American History Test. 2. There is no difference between the experimental and control groups in academic behavior (study habits) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States History students as measured by <b>the</b> Survey <b>of</b> Study Habits and Attitudes. 3. There is no difference between the experimental and control groups in <b>the</b> study attitudes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States History students as measured by <b>the</b> Survey <b>of</b> Study Habits and Attitudes. 4. There is no difference between the experimental and control groups in over-all study orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States History students as measured by <b>the</b> Survey <b>of</b> Study Habits and Attitudes. A review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature reveals considerable dissatisfaction with the traditional ABCD-F letter-grade marking system widely used in <b>the</b> secondary schools <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. The pass-fail concept appears to have merit as a more flexible system, and its use on the secondary level in increasing. <b>The</b> sample consisted <b>of</b> six eleventh grade required United States History classes at Rex Putnam High School, Milwaukie, Oregon. One hundred and two individuals participated in the experimental groups. They received a pass-fail mark on all routine class work as well as grade card reports throughout the academic year. Data were obtained for 96 experimental subjects. One hundred and five individuals participated in the control group. They were exposed to the traditional ABCD-F letter-grade <b>marking</b> system throughout <b>the</b> academic year. Complete data were obtained for 99 control subjects. Statistical treatment was applied to the data for 195 subjects. The Crary American History Test and <b>the</b> Survey <b>of</b> Study Habits and. Attitudes were administered to subjects prior to <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research and at <b>the</b> conclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-test score gains revealed no differences between <b>the</b> means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimental and control groups as tested by t at <b>the.</b> 05 level <b>of</b> significance on all four measures; hence, all four hypotheses were supported in that subjects exposed to the pass-fail system showed no difference in academic achievement, study habits, study attitudes, and study orientation from those treated by the traditional ABCD-F letter-grade marking system. Recommendations for further research in secondary marking systems include: 1. The merits and demerits of innovative grading practices as compared with traditional marking systems. 2. Investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> achievement and study attitudes of students taking all courses under the pass-fail system compared with students taking all courses under the letter-grade system. 3. Investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pass-fail and letter-grade marking system on attendance patterns. 4. Studies concerning the effect, if any, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pass-fail grading system on high achievers as compared with students of low ability. 5. Experimentation in grading systems doing away with <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> designation "F" denoting failure. 6. Development <b>of</b> criteria for <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> student performance using the pass-fail system. 7. Investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between grading practices and cheating. 8. Relationships, if any, between grading practices and drop out patterns. 9.
