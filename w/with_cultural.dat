5|$|As <b>with</b> <b>cultural</b> studies, media {{study is}} a {{distinct}} discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a diverse}} and growing {{cultural}} scene, <b>with</b> <b>cultural</b> life exhibited {{in a number}} of fields, including the visual arts, performing arts and nightlife. The city's cultural scene spans its history, dating back to Roman times: the city started to be built in that period, which has left its mark on the urban layout (centered on today's Piața Muzeului) as well as surviving ruins. However, the medieval town saw a shift in its centre towards new civil and religious structures, notably St. Michael's Church.|$|E
5|$|Exhibits include cannons {{at the gun}} ports with shot, {{ropes and}} firing equipment, and old muskets and matchlocks. There are maps and other {{illustrations}} of historical times, including a plaque that depicts the winds and the currents in Muscat bay. One room, with a ceiling made from palm-logs, is filled <b>with</b> <b>cultural</b> relics of Oman. The square central tower holds the main museum exhibits including rugs, pottery, jewelry, weapons, household utensils and incense holders. A dining hall overlooks the courtyard {{for use by the}} distinguished visitors. An old breeze-maker has been preserved in this room, once manually operated but now mechanized.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Subspecies {{became the}} first American film to be filmed in Bucharest, Romania. Director Ted Nicolaou was {{initially}} apprehensive about shooting on location in Romania, but during a four-day location scout he came to love the location thanks to the free rein he had over the ancient ruins and woodland area. Other Transylvanian areas {{would be used for}} all Subspecies films, with specific location shootings at Hunedoara, Brașov, and Sinaia. Although, the remnants of communism left in the country, along <b>with</b> <b>cultural</b> differences and the general problems that accompany film productions lent to a difficult experience for the crew while shooting the first Subspecies film.|$|E
5|$|New {{industry}} {{came from}} iron ore, {{discovered in the}} north, mined relatively easily from open pits, and shipped to Great Lakes steel mills from the ports at Duluth and Two Harbors. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift from rural areas to cities. The Great Depression brought layoffs in mining and tension in labor relations but New Deal programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early computer companies Sperry Rand, Control Data and Cray. The Twin Cities also became a regional center for the arts <b>with</b> <b>cultural</b> {{institutions such as the}} Guthrie Theater, Minnesota Orchestra, and the Walker Art Center.|$|E

5|$|Sonically, Impossible Princess is a {{departure}} from Minogue's previous music, having taken influence by the techno and Britpop revolution in the mid-to-late 1990s. Conceived as an experimental record, the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from the dance genre, including trip hop, electronica, rock, drum and bass and house. Additionally, selected recordings experiments <b>with</b> <b>cultural</b> elements like Middle Eastern music and Celtic origins. Lyrically, the album's central focus is about Minogue's self-discovery, which she found during a series of trips in Asia, America and Australasia, and further delves into the freedom of expression, relationships and emotions.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} {{confusion}} appears through the transplantation of characters from one world to another, for example from the characters' childhood culture {{to the one}} imposed upon them as occurs in The Kingdom of This World. Often, the characters find that reality does not lie entirely in either world. It is possible that this theme is well-developed in Alejo Carpentier's work because of the author's own personal experience <b>with</b> <b>cultural</b> transplantation (Carpentier grew up in Havana but later moved to France for six years and travelled extensively).|$|E
5|$|Between 1887 and 1889 the French {{archaeologist}} Jacques de Morgan discovered 576 rectangular stone sepulchers, along <b>with</b> <b>cultural</b> items made of clay, {{bronze and}} iron near Akhtala {{dating back to}} the 8th century BC. The settlement of modern Akhtala was known as Agarak in the 5th century. The fortress was almost certainly built on top of Bronze and Iron Age foundations. It was built in the late tenth century by the Kyurikids, this branch of the Bagratunis originated from Gurgen (the name was pronounced Kyurikeh in the local dialect of Gugark). He was the son of the patrons of Sanahin and Haghpat monasteries located not far from Akhtala, King Ashot III the Merciful and Queen Khosrovanush. Gurgen's brothers were King Smbat II the Conqueror and Gagik I Bagratuni, under whom the Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia reached the peak of its prosperity.|$|E
