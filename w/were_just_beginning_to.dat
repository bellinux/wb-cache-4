5|$|When Megh passed near Socotra, {{residents}} <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> {{return after}} the previous cyclone, and many had to evacuate again. Additional heavy rainfall and high winds lashed the island, which destroyed 500homes and damaged another 3,000. The consecutive storms damaged 785fishing boats, left 80% {{of the roads}} impassible, and caused an island-wide power outage. Megh killed 18people on Socotra and injured another 60. The heavy damage on the island prompted nearby countries and international organizations to deliver relief goods and medical teams. Later, Megh brought torrential rainfall and high waves to northern Somalia, killing livestock and damaging schools. The storm's final landfall in Yemen marked little rainfall or effects.|$|E
5|$|About 30 {{houses in}} San Pablo, Laguna were either {{demolished}} by strong winds or by falling coconut trees. Elsewhere, in Zambales, {{a woman was}} killed after she was struck by lighting. In Lucena City, a farmer was swept away via floods and two boys died due to fallen trees. The resort city of Legaspi suffered severe damage because hundreds of dwellings were destroyed, forcing many residents to seek shelter in schools or churches. Along {{the east coast of}} Luzon, seven people perished when hit by falling coconut trees in Quezon. Meanwhile, three casualties occurred in a fire in the province of Sorsogon. A total of 15 people drowned in the town of Sexmoan. The nearby towns of Macabebe and Masantol saw two drownings each. In the city of Manila or the provinces of Batangas, Quezon, Laguna, and Cavite, 34,000 people were displaced. Overall, damage totaled $42 million (1983 USD). Infrastructure damage totaled $31 million. However, damage to crops totaled to only $9.4 million since residents <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> replant fields.|$|E

5|$|By the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, {{speculation}} as {{to whether}} or not the Timberwolves would remain in Minneapolis following the 1994–95 season became an issue. On February 11, 1994, NBA commissioner David Stern announced that he and his representatives would serve as mediators in an effort to resolve issues related to the debt owed on the Target Center, the Timberwolves home arena. The Timberwolves ownership was seeking a public or private entity to purchase the $73 million remaining on the arena's mortgage, otherwise the team would be sold and in all likelihood moved from Minnesota. Although mediation talks <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> keep the team in place, by the following week it was revealed that ownership had met with representatives from San Diego, Nashville and New Orleans to discuss the potential relocation of the franchise. By late February, New Orleans emerged as the likely city for the team to relocate to if a deal could not be reached to keep the team in Minneapolis. This became the case after the potential ownership group Top Rank signed a letter of intent to purchase the team and move it to New Orleans if debt issues at the Target Center were not resolved.|$|E

25|$|Although railroads <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> see the {{advantages}} that autoracks {{delivered in the}} 1960s, most North American railroads were reluctant to invest in such specially built equipment. The Trailer Train Company, organized by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1955, stepped in to ease the railroads' financial burden a bit. Trailer Train purchased the flat cars from the rail car manufacturers, and the railroads that wanted to operate autoracks, purchased the racks that were installed on those flat cars. Such cars were easily spotted at trackside due to the reporting marks identifying Trailer Train on the flat car portion {{of the car and}} the railroad's logo (usually much larger) in the upper portion of the rack.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} days of the modern {{evolutionary}} synthesis, scientists <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> blend the new science of population genetics with Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. Working within this new framework, Wright focused on the effects of inbreeding on small relatively isolated populations. He introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape in which phenomena such as cross breeding and genetic drift in small populations could push them away from adaptive peaks, which in turn allow natural selection to push them towards new adaptive peaks. Wright thought smaller populations were more suited for natural selection because [...] "inbreeding was sufficiently intense to create new interaction systems through random drift but not intense enough to cause random nonadaptive fixation of genes." ...|$|E

500|$|Thayer's close {{observation}} led him {{to notice}} what scientists such as Edward Bagnall Poulton <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> describe. This was that many animals were [...] "painted" [...] the opposite way to how painters create the appearance of solidity in figures. A canvas is flat, and areas of uniform color painted on a canvas also appear flat. To make a body appear to have depth and solidity, the artist paints in shadows on the body itself. The top of an animal's back, facing the sky, remains bright, while it must become darker towards its underside. Thayer was excited to realize that by reversing such shading, nature could and did make animals appear flat. He was so passionate about this [...] "concealing coloration" [...] theory that he called it his [...] "second child". Poulton had noticed countershading in certain caterpillars, {{but he had not}} realized that the phenomenon was widespread, and he championed Thayer's theory in a 1902 article in Nature.|$|E

2500|$|The Seventh Seal {{significantly}} helped Bergman {{in gaining}} {{his position as}} a world-class director. When the film won the Special Jury Prize at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, the attention generated by it (along with the previous year's Smiles of a Summer Night) made Bergman and his stars Max von Sydow and Bibi Andersson well-known to the European film community, and the critics and readers of Cahiers du Cinéma, among others, discovered him with this movie. [...] Within five years of this, he had established himself as the first real auteur of Swedish cinema. With its images and reflections upon death {{and the meaning of}} life, The Seventh Seal had a symbolism that was [...] "immediately apprehensible to people trained in literary culture who <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> discover the 'art' of film, and it quickly became a staple of high school and college literature courses...

2500|$|Ayers and Oughton were {{involved}} with Students for a Democratic Society while working at CCS, {{but it was not}} until after the closure of the school that they became involved as full-time organizers. [...] Their lives became consumed by meetings, organizing, and planning actions. It was during this time that Ayers and Oughton met Terry Robbins. In March 1968, Oughton helped create a women’s liberation group at a time when such issues <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> emerge among radicals. [...] The group met every week or so, wherever the women could find room. [...] Most of the talk seemed to center on the subordinate role of women in the radical movement and on the sexual oppression of women by the “macho” tendency of males to regard sex as conquest. During these meetings Oughton often discussed the role that women played in the SDS, which was a combination of being a sexual object, an office clerk, and a housekeeper. Later in 1968 Oughton told a friend that while she was away for five days, Ayers had slept with other women. She told the friend she tried to convince herself that it didn't matter, but it did.|$|E

According to the Midrash, {{from the beginning of the}} one, to {{the end of the}} other, were three months; though it may be, they were gathered in sooner: indeed from the passover to Pentecost were seven weeks, which was the difference between the beginning of one harvest, and the beginning of the other.|$|E
2500|$|As Ingres {{waited to}} depart to Rome, his friend Lorenzo Bartolini {{introduced}} him to Italian Renaissance paintings, particularly the works Bronzino and Pontormo, which Napoleon had brought back from his campaign in Italy {{and placed in the}} Louvre. Ingres assimilated their clarity and monumentality into his own portrait style. In the Louvre were also masterpieces of Flemish art, including the Altarpiece of Ghent by Jan Van Eyck, which the French army had seized during its conquest of Flanders. The precision of Renaissance Flemish art became part of Ingres's style. Ingres's stylistic eclecticism represented a new tendency in art. The Louvre, newly filled with booty seized by Napoleon in his campaigns in Italy and the Low Countries, provided French artists of the early 19th century with an unprecedented opportunity to study, compare, and copy masterworks from antiquity and from the entire history of European painting. [...] As art historian Marjorie Cohn has written: [...] "At the time, art history as a scholarly enquiry was brand-new. Artists and critics outdid each other in their attempts to identify, interpret, and exploit what they <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> perceive as historical stylistic developments." [...] From the beginning of his career, Ingres freely borrowed from earlier art, adopting the historical style appropriate to his subject, and was consequently accused by critics of plundering the past.|$|E
