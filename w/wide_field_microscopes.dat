40|$|Abstract Background The {{dynamics}} of nuclear organization, nuclear bodies and RNPs {{in particular has}} been the focus of many studies. To understand their function, knowledge of their spatial nuclear position and temporal translocation is essential. Typically, such studies generate a wealth of data that require novel methods in image analysis and computational tools to quantitatively track particle movement on the background of moving cells and shape changing nuclei. Results We developed a novel 4 -D image processing platform (TIKAL) for the work with laser scanning and <b>wide</b> <b>field</b> <b>microscopes.</b> TIKAL provides a registration software for correcting global movements and local deformations of cells as well as 2 -D and 3 -D tracking software. With this new tool, we studied the {{dynamics of}} two different types of nuclear particles, namely nuclear bodies made from GFP-NLS-vimentin and microinjected 0. 1 μm – wide polystyrene beads, by live cell time-lapse microscopy combined with single particle tracking and mobility analysis. We now provide a tool for the automatic 3 -D analysis of particle movement in parallel with the acquisition of chromatin density data. Conclusions Kinetic analysis revealed 4 modes of movement: confined obstructed, normal diffusion and directed motion. Particle tracking on the background of stained chromatin revealed that particle movement is directly related to local reorganization of chromatin. Further a direct comparison of particle movement in the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm exhibited an entirely different kinetic behaviour of vimentin particles in both compartments. The kinetics of nuclear particles were slightly affected by depletion of ATP and significantly disturbed by disruption of actin and microtubule networks. Moreover, the hydration state of the nucleus had a strong impact on the mobility of nuclear bodies since both normal diffusion and directed motion were entirely abolished when cells were challenged with 0. 6 M sorbitol. This effect correlated with the compaction of chromatin. We conclude that alteration in chromatin density directly influences the mobility of protein assemblies within the nucleus. </p...|$|E

40|$|Catalytic {{processes}} on surfaces {{have long}} been studied by probing model reactions on single-crystal metal surfaces under high vacuum conditions. Yet {{the vast majority of}} industrial heterogeneous catalysis occurs at ambient or elevated pressures using complex materials with crystal faces, edges and defects differing in their catalytic activity. Clearly, if new or improved catalysts are to be rationally designed, we require quantitative correlations between surface features and catalytic activity [...] ideally obtained under realistic reaction conditions. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy have allowed in situ characterization of catalyst surfaces with atomic resolution, but are limited by the need for low-pressure conditions and conductive surfaces, respectively. Sum frequency generation spectroscopy can identify vibrations of adsorbed reactants and products in both gaseous and condensed phases, but so far lacks sensitivity down to the single molecule level. Here we adapt real-time monitoring of the chemical transformation of individual organic molecules by fluorescence microscopy to monitor reactions catalysed by crystals of a layered double hydroxide immersed in reagent solution. By using a <b>wide</b> <b>field</b> <b>microscope,</b> we are able to map the spatial distribution of catalytic activity over the entire crystal by counting single turnover events. We find that ester hydrolysis proceeds on the lateral { 1010 } crystal faces, while transesterification occurs on the entire outer crystal surface. Because the method operates at ambient temperature and pressure and in a condensed phase, it {{can be applied to the}} growing number of liquid-phase industrial organic transformations to localize catalytic activity on and in inorganic solids. An exciting opportunity is the use of probe molecules with different size and functionality, which should provide insight into shape-selective or structure-sensitive catalysis and thus help with the rational design of new or more productive heterogeneous catalysts. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{investigation}} of magnetic domains in ultrasmall permalloy (Ni 80 Fe 20) structures down to nanometre size. Magnetic domains and domain walls in nano objects are often observed using a very high resolution and high power microscope such as magnetic soft x-ray microscope, magnetic force microscopy imaging and photoemission electron microscopy. A {{reason for this is}} because the Kerr signal in nanostructures is very weak. However the results from this thesis demonstrate that magnetic domains in permalloy magnetic nanostructures can still be observed with very good contrast using a Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscope. The constructed Kerr microscope is a home-build <b>wide</b> <b>field</b> <b>microscope</b> and is able to produce magnetic domains image of permalloy nanowire as small as 245 nm, although the resolution limit of the microscope is 505 nm. For the first time, a magnetic domain in nanowire with width of 245 nm is observed using a wide-field microscope. The combination of hysteresis loops and magnetic domains observations for studying a magnetic sample provides a three-dimensional understanding of the magnetic characteristic of the sample. This is crucial in investigating nano samples as the theoretical arguments with the experimental results are always constrained by the experimental part. Three kinds of nanostructure sample were observed using the Kerr microscope; a cross nanowire, zigzag nanowire and a nanowire with notch and a nucleation pad at one end. It was found that a cross nanowire can form magnetic domains upon reversal and the junction forms a magnetisation vortex. Findings from zigzag nanowire demonstrate a complex, multiple magnetic domains formation upon magnetisation reversal. A weak domain wall pinning effect was observed in the nanowire, causing a multiple domains formation in the nanowire upon reversal. It can be confirmed that this effect was caused by the high coercivity of the nucleation pad. For the nanowire with notch, it was demonstrated that the coercivities were different at negative and positive field. But for such case, there is a relationship observed between the percentage notch depth and the coercivity at the junction...|$|R

The indications for penetrating keratoplasty in these cases included keratoconus, herpetic keratitis, and macula cornea. 18  cataract patients with normal corneas were also studied as controls.

Also, there was no clinical evidence, especially, of corneal epithelial and/or endothelial rejections and corneal decompensation in all corneas.  CONCLUSION—Even though the transplanted corneas have a lower endothelial cell density and marked polymegethism, it is believed that cataract surgery does not induce corneal decompensation in cases where the peripheral recipient endothelium can be considered to have normal morphology. ...|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{software}} {{is a prerequisite}} for successful operation of a modern <b>wide</b> <b>field</b> fluorescence <b>microscope.</b> When used for live cell imaging, acquisition speed is of particular interest. This is both because biological processes can be highly-dynamic, and to avoid unnecessary photobleaching and phototoxicity of living samples. This article shows that besides the hardware (microscope) components themselves, the acquisition control {{software is}} an important influencing factor of speed performance. We tested and compared the speed performance of five different generic applications (Image-Pro Plus, MetaMorph, Micro-Manager, SlideBook, and Volocity) using typical experimental setups involving a single specific state-of-the-art fluorescence microscope configuration. The test measurements included multichannel experiments, z-stacking, burst acquisition, as well as combinations of these measurements with time-lapse acquisitions. The measured data provided values for guiding the testing and analysis of other microscope systems with similar configurations. Despite the identical hardware settings, significant and surprisingly large speed differences were evident among the various software applications. Additionally, no application was identifiable as the fastest in all tests. Our work pinpoints the importance of the control software in determining a system`s ``real`` maximal imaging speed. The study could serve as basis for further tests, eventually influencing the system selection criteria for speed-sensitive applications. Microsc. Res. Tech., 2010. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

Therefore, a detailed map of the spatial surroundings of the nanostructure is made during the fabrication of the structure. These maps are made using a series of micrographs with successively decreasing magnifications.

40|$|Modern optical imaging systems make {{extensive}} use of computational power for analog pre-processing, analog to digital conversion and digital post-processing. The joint design of these elements {{can be used to}} optimize the information throughput of optical imaging systems. This paradigm, termed computational optical imaging, aims at optimizing the output of optical systems in the form of imaging metrics, multidimensional imaging, feature detection, compressive sensing, etc. However, most optical imaging systems rely on the scalar wave theory of light to analyze these modern systems. Light, being an electromagnetic wave is vectorial in nature leading to significant errors in the scalar model when the propagation medium is anisotropic, inhomogeneous or non-linear. Electromagnetic optics, on the other hand, is an all-encompassing theory of light in the classical limit that takes into account the coupled nature of electric and magnetic fields. In this respect, the effects of anisotropic emission from a fixed dipole emitter on high numerical aperture super-resolution microscopy are investigated. <b>Wide</b> <b>field</b> <b>microscope</b> configurations that allow simultaneous acquisition and measurement of the 3 D position and orientation parameters of multiple fixed dipole emitters are proposed. The performance limits of these systems for the 5 D imaging of fixed dipole emitters are quantified through comparison of the Cramer-Rao lower bounds in a photon limited environment. Further, experimental validation is provided for simultaneously estimating the 5 D dipole parameters using the double-helix phase mask. Binary multi-level fabrication of efficient phase modulation elements to engineer the Green 2 ̆ 7 s tensor response of the system to a dipole input is demonstrated. High numerical aperture objectives give rise to steep incident angles on lens surfaces, leading to resolution losses in imaging systems due to aberrations caused by the incorrect assumption of linearity between the incident and refracted angles at material interfaces. A new paradigm, termed infinitely refraction-linear artificial material (IRAM), is proposed to tackle this problem. IRAM maintain the linear relationship between incident and refracted angles beyond the paraxial limit. The inherent anisotropic material parameter requirements for IRAM are summarized. The performance of IRAM lenses is compared to that of conventional isotropic lenses by simulating the diffraction limited spot size of these lenses in Zemax. It is shown that with proper design IRAMs have the potential to improve the resolution of optical imaging systems. Further, another class of artificial metamaterials that use magnetic resonance to realize exotic optical properties is discussed as candidates for super-resolution using the super-lensing effect...|$|R

At FRET energy is transferred non-radiatively from donor to acceptor. FRET can be detected in two ways: the change in emission-ratio between donor and acceptor can be measured, or the decrease in lifetime of the fluorescence emitted by the donor molecule is measured. This change in lifetime is detected by fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) [2].

40|$|Background: Imaging {{large volumes}} such as entire cells or small model organisms at {{nanoscale}} resolution seemed an unrealistic, rather tedious task so far. Now, technical advances have lead to several electron microscopy (EM) large volume imaging techniques. One is array tomography, where ribbons of ultrathin serial sections are deposited on solid substrates like silicon wafers or glass coverslips. Results: To ensure reliable retrieval of multiple ribbons {{from the boat}} of a diamond knife we introduce a substrate holder with 7 axes of translation or rotation specifically designed for that purpose. With this device {{we are able to}} deposit hundreds of sections in an ordered way in an area of 22 [*]×[*] 22  mm, the size of a coverslip. Imaging such arrays in a standard <b>wide</b> <b>field</b> fluorescence <b>microscope</b> produces reconstructions with 200  nm lateral resolution and 100  nm (the section thickness) resolution in z. By hierarchical imaging cascades in the scanning electron microscope (SEM), using a new software platform, we can address volumes from single cells to complete organs. In our first example, a cell population isolated from zebrafish spleen, we characterize different cell types according to their organelle inventory by segmenting 3 D reconstructions of complete cells imaged with nanoscale resolution. In addition, by screening large numbers of cells at decreased resolution we can define the percentage at which different cell types are present in our preparation. With the second example, the root tip of cress, we illustrate how combining information from intermediate resolution data with high resolution data from selected regions of interest can drastically reduce the amount of data that has to be recorded. By imaging only the interesting parts of a sample considerably less data need to be stored, handled and eventually analysed. Conclusions: Our custom-designed substrate holder allows reproducible generation of section libraries, which can then be imaged in a hierarchical way. We demonstrate, that EM volume data at different levels of resolution can yield comprehensive information, including statistics, morphology and organization of cells and tissue. We predict, that hierarchical imaging will be a first step in tackling the big data issue inevitably connected with volume EM...|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} {{and treatment of}} brain disorders {{as well as the}} development of intelligent machines is hampered by the lack of knowledge of how the brain fundamentally functions. Over the past century, we have learned much about how individual neurons and neural networks behave, however new tools are critically needed to interrogate how neural networks give rise to complex brain processes and disease conditions. Recent innovations in molecular techniques, such as optogenetics, have enabled neuroscientists unprecedented precision to excite, inhibit and record defined neurons. The impressive sensitivity of currently available optogenetic sensors and actuators has now enabled the possibility of analyzing a large number of individual neurons in the brains of behaving animals. To promote the use of these optogenetic tools, this thesis integrates cutting edge optogenetic molecular sensors which is ultrasensitive for imaging neuronal activity with custom <b>wide</b> <b>field</b> optical <b>microscope</b> to analyze a large number of individual neurons in living brains. Wide-field microscopy provides a large field of view and better spatial resolution approaching the Abbe diffraction limit of fluorescent microscope. To demonstrate the advantages of this optical platform, we imaged a deep brain structure, the Hippocampus, and tracked hundreds of neurons over time while mouse was performing a memory task to investigate how those individual neurons related to behavior. In addition, we tested our optical platform in investigating transient neural network changes upon mechanical perturbation related to blast injuries. In this experiment, all blasted mice show a consistent change in neural network. A small portion of neurons showed a sustained calcium increase {{for an extended period of}} time, whereas the majority lost their activities. Finally, using optogenetic silencer to control selective motor cortex neurons, we examined their contributions to the network pathology of basal ganglia related to Parkinson’s disease. We found that inhibition of motor cortex does not alter exaggerated beta oscillations in the striatum that are associated with parkinsonianism.
