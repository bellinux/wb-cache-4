The sensor was used to obtain full depth oxygen profiles while mounted on a wire-operated CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) instrument. A stable performance was achieved by carefully designed electrochemical cleaning conditions of the sensing platinum microdisk cathode. The flow issues inherent to moving probes were resolved by a novel stop-flow cell fitted with a pumping system for sample exchange and flow control. The details of the sensor operation, calibration, and construction, including the flow control system, are described.

40|$|Vast {{expanses of}} oxygen-deficient and nitrite-rich water define the major oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) {{of the global}} ocean. They support diverse {{microbial}} communities that influence the nitrogen economy of the oceans, contributing to major losses of fixed nitrogen as dinitrogen (N 2) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) gases. Anaerobic microbial processes, including the two pathways of N 2 production, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation, are oxygen-sensitive, with some occurring only under strictly anoxic conditions. The detection limit of the usual method (<b>Winkler</b> <b>titrations)</b> for measuring dissolved oxygen in seawater, however, is much too high to distinguish low oxygen conditions from true anoxia. However, new analytical technologies are revealing vanishingly low oxygen concentrations in nitrite-rich OMZs, indicating that these OMZs are essentially anoxic marine zones (AMZs). Autonomous monitoring platforms also reveal previously unrecognized episodic intrusions of oxygen into the AMZ core, which could periodically support aerobic metabolisms in a typically anoxic environment. Although nitrogen cycling is considered to dominate the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of AMZs, recent environmental genomics and geochemical studies show {{the presence of other}} relevant processes, particularly those associated with the sulfur and carbon cycles. AMZs correspond to an intermediate state between two “end points” represented by fully oxic systems and fully sulfidic systems. Modern and ancient AMZs and sulfidic basins are chemically and functionally related.

Throughout 2005 and 2006 the performance of commercially available oxygen optodes was examined, one in each year. The optode was part of an autonomous measurement system (FerryBox) on a ferry operating between Portsmouth (UK) and Bilbao (Spain). On crossings during which water samples were collected manually, the optode outputs were compared to measurements of dissolved oxygen made by <b>Winkler</b> <b>titrations.</b> The optodes maintained good stability with no evidence of instrumental drift {{during the course of a}} year. Over the observed concentration range (230 - 330 mM m- 3) the optode data were approximately 2 % low in both years. By fitting the optode data to the Winkler data the median difference between the optode and Winkler measurements is reduced to less than 1 mM m- 3 (0. 3 %) in both years. The most appropriate calibration factor for 2005 was corrected O 2 = Optode O 2 × 1. 018 and for 2006 the corresponding equation is corrected O 2 = Optode O 2 × 0. 884 + 36. 8. The standard deviation (95 %) of the difference between the individual Winkler measurements was 5 mM m- 3 and 3 mM m- 3 in 2005 and 2006 respectively. Calculation of the oxygen saturation anomaly is required for calculation of the air sea exchange of oxygen and net biological production. This calculation requires the use of both salinity and temperature data. Salinity is measured to better than 0. 1 so the corresponding error in anomaly is less than 0. 2 mM m- 3. Distortion of the temperature data is present due to warming of the water pumped to the optode. In winter this warming at the optode may be as great as 0. 4 °C. The difference in the pumped water temperature can be corrected for by reference to other measurements of sea surface temperature reducing the error to less than 1 mM m- 3...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to advance our {{knowledge}} on the dynamics of bacterial production and bacterial respiration in the open ocean and linking microbial activity to the physico-chemical environment. Although the currency in carbon cycling measurements is logically carbon, respiration in water is most often calculated from the decline in oxygen concentrations in enclosed samples over time. The method of choice is the <b>Winkler</b> <b>titration</b> technique because it provides sufﬁcient precision to allow measurements in productive {{as well as in}} oligotrophic oceanic systems where respiration rates are usually extremely low. Thus far, the <b>Winkler</b> <b>titration</b> was a tedious task and time consuming. The use of a spectrophotometric determination of the concentration of total iodine and later reﬁnements of the method made it possible to analyze samples more rapidly, however, for respiration measurements in oligotrophic regions this approach was found not to be sufﬁciently sensitive. We describe a method using the spectrophotometric Winkler approach in conjunction with an automated continuous-ﬂow analyzing system. On board measurements along a gradient from high to low productivity proved, that the method allowed for precise and accurate measurements of oxygen concentrations even in oligotrophic environments. The sea-surface microlayer (SML) represents the boundary layer between the ocean and the atmosphere. It has been shown that dissolved organic matter in the SML is often enriched compared to the underlying water for reasons that are not entirely clear. Heterotrophic activity of the prokaryotic community in the SML could give important insight into exchange processes between the ocean and the atmosphere. We measured bacterial production and respiration and linked these parameters to patterns of potential substrate sources for bacteria. Seasonal studies in the open ocean are generally scarce because of constraints due to the weather conditions and availability of shiptime. In the southern North Sea, we conducted a seasonal survey studying the dynamics in bacterial respiration and production in relation to DOC and primary production. In total, we occupied 150 stations and compiled 102 BGE estimates. The dark ocean {{is one of the most}} under-sampled environments in our biosphere. Reported biological activity in the deep sea is low, however, until now methods were generally not sensitive enough to allow rate measurements at depths below 500 m. Model estimates on carbon ﬂuxes suggest that respiration in the dark ocean represents up to half of the total respiration in the upper layers. However, even the highest current estimates on carbon input into the deep ocean do not match mineralization rates measured in the deep. In this chapter, bacterial production and respiration was measured in the meso-and bathypelagic of the North Atlantic supporting the current notion, that the carbon ﬂux in the dark ocean mediated by the prokaryotic community might be either higher than previously assumed or that decompression of the prokaryotes leads to a stimulation of their activity. Currently, there is considerable scientiﬁc debate on the relation between diversity and ecosystem functioning. We investigated the relation between changes in the phylogenetic composition of the bacterioplankton community and the main function of bacteria in the carbon cycling, i. e., the remineralization of organic carbon, over seasonal cycles in the southern North Sea. The remineralization activity was found to be largely independent of the phylogenetic composition of the bacterioplankton community. ...|$|E

One major point is the formulation and the evaluation of best practises of sensor calibration. This is an issue of great interest for institutions dealing with different (automated) observation systems. So, this report is providing information about the best practises for sensor calibration of different types of sensors. Each sensor type has typical characteristics, which have to be addressed when calibration routine has to be applied to the sensor. This is outlined in the next sections for the different sensor types. However, there are also several general advices for sensor calibration which are valid for any sensor when reliable sensor data are needed. Temperature and conductivity sensors cannot be calibrated in the field, so thoroughly lab calibration is necessary, i. e. the preparing and maintaining of temperature baths. For Chlorophyll sensors it is generally agreed that FChla measurements do not necessarily reflect true analytically measured [Chla], so this has {{to be taken into account}} when calibrating chlorophyll fluorescence sensors. No generally accepted method for fluorometer calibration exists, so also manufacturers have different conventions. Various solutions for primary fluorometer calibration include factory calibration, use of algae cultures, chemical standards dissolved in water or in various solvents, or solid standards. Calibration of chemical sensors relies strongly on proper handling of water samples and reagents and the preparing of standard solutions. Monitoring of more than one nutrient parameter with one device has to be carried out carefully. For oxygen sensors the according calibration routine relies on comparing lab analyses via <b>Winkler</b> <b>titration</b> which needs some experience to carry out including proper sampling.

40|$|Abstract only. The {{effect of}} {{salinity}} and temperature on oxygen consumption at different developmental ages of Penaeus monodon postlarvae (P 5 to P 60) was studied. The design was a 2 Ã— 5 factorial, using {{two levels of}} temperature (15 and 30 Â°C) and 4 levels of salinity (10, 15, 20 and 30 ppt). One-day old postlarvae (P 1) were acclimated to various salinities {{prior to the start}} of the experiments. Oxygen consumption was determined after three hours using a YSI dissolved oxygen meter vis-a-vis <b>Winkler</b> <b>titration</b> method. Respiratory activity as affected by temperature and salinity varies, dependent on the postlarval stage tested. Statistical analyses showed that temperature did not significantly influence oxygen uptake at early stages (P 5 -P 8) until P 25 -P 28. Its effect started to become apparent when the postlarvae were P 35 -P 38 and was most pronounced at P 49 -P 52. general, the postlarvae consumed more oxygen at higher temperature and the variation in the oxygen consumption of the postlarvae under the two temperatures become less obvious as the postlarvae were older. Salinity seemed to affect the oxygen consumption of the young postlarvae, P 5 -P 8 and P 25 -P 28, more than temperature. Differences in rate of oxygen consumption at various salinities were greater in younger postlarvae (P 5 -P 38) than in older postlarvae (P 42 _P 60). The relationship between rate of oxygen consumption and body weight is nearly linear in the various salinity-temperature treatments. In all cases, the regression was significant at 1 % level. P. monodon postlarvae behaved as respiratory con-formers in all the salinities tested at ambient temperatures. The least oxygen consumption rate was noted at salinities of 20 and 30 ppt at low temperature (15 Â°C) and 20 ppt at high temperature (30 Â°C). The importance of these findings is discussed and related to improvement of postlarvae transport methodology...|$|E

The comparison of the Winkler data with the output from the Optode suggests that the accuracy of the Optode in both years was close to 98 % of the true value when compared to the Winkler measurements. The data suggest that the precision based on the comparison of the two data sets was equivalent to a standard deviation of 5 ?M or 2 % of the average value in 2005 and 2. 9 or 1 % of the average value in 2006. The resolution of the recorded a data is better than 1 ?M. Two sources of error in measurement of temperature which are significant for the calculation of the oxygen anomaly have been identified. Temperatures measured using sensors in board the ship are higher than “true” temperatures. The error changes through the year as the difference in temperature between inside the ship and the external water temperature changes. This error may be as large as 0. 5 °C. The anomaly has to be calculated using temperature measurement in the water flowing past the Optode. This is because of delays and mixing in the water being pumped into the ship have smoothing effect on the data, and can enhance the difference between the internal and external temperature to being as high as 1. 0 °C. Consequently to avoid this large error due to the timing of the measurements the oxygen anomaly should be calculated from the temperature measured in the pumped water stream adjusted by an offset to the “true” outside temperature...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the conservation of biological diversity, a comprehensive knowledge of the microbial ecology of an ecosystem is required. As {{the vast majority of}} microbes are not readily culturable, it is necessary to use molecular tools to investigate their diversity and function in the marine ecosystem. Although it provides a vast quantity of data, the information obtained by molecular tools alone is not sufficient to understand the drivers behind the changes in bacterial communities. This study aims to characterize changes in the diversity and activity of the heterotrophic bacterial community in relation to a changing environment, in time and space. Two different sampling strategies were used in order to achieve this goal; an annual time series study at a coastal station (station L 4, Western English Channel Observatory (WECO)) and a Lagrangian study following an upwelling plume on its track to off shore (2 nd filament, Surface Ocean-Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) - Impact of coastal upwelling on the air-sea exchange of climatically important gases (ICON) cruise). Surface water samples were collected from the time series station L 4 of the Western Channel Observatory (50 º 15 'N, 04 º 13 'W; www. westernchannelobservatory. org) every week between 6 th April 2009 and 26 th April 2010. The respiration rate of the heterotrophic community was determined using <b>Winkler</b> <b>titration</b> to measure the dissolved oxygen content of the < 0. 8 μm size-fraction of the seawater. This dataset sits within the larger framework of the Western English Channel bacterial diversity ABSTRACT 2 time series (2003 - 2009) and the seasonal metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies associated with this site. The second approach was to investigate the bacterial diversity and activity in a dynamic environment, such as an upwelling region. The upwelling region off the coast of Mauritania {{is one of the most}} productive areas of the world ocean, yet little is known of the temporal and spatial variability in prokaryotic community structure and metabolic activity there, and crucially how this contributes to global elemental cycles. During a Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) SOLAS-funded Lagrangian study, we determined bacterial community structure and production together with total community respiration and production. This part of the study describes the temporal changes in bacterial community structure and its activity, in relation to the complex upwelling environmental conditions (mixing, chlorophyll, dissolved organic and inorganic nutrients). Turbulence and dissolved organic carbon appear to play an important role...|$|E
