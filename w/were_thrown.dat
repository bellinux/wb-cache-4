5|$|On 29November, {{the crew}} {{assembled}} {{to consider the}} proposal {{that some of the}} slaves should be thrown overboard. James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed. On 29November, 54women and children <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> through cabin windows into the sea. On 1December, 42male slaves <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> overboard, and 36more followed in the next few days. Another ten, in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers, jumped into the sea. Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> into the water, one slave requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than be thrown into the sea. The crew ignored this request. In total, 132 Africans were killed by the time the ship reached the Caribbean. The account of the King's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship.|$|E

5000|$|Doubled pieces {{may move}} {{half the number}} if an even number <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> (e.g. move two spaces if a 4 <b>is</b> <b>thrown).</b>|$|R
5|$|Neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS Panzer Corps {{accomplished}} their objectives. Though the Soviet counterattack failed {{with heavy}} losses, and <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> {{back onto the}} defensive, yet they did enough to stop a German breakthrough.|$|E
5|$|The march ended early {{after the}} DA {{was confronted by}} ANC {{supporters}} 40 minutes into the march. Stones and petrol bombs <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> by ANC supporters at police trying to calm the situation.|$|E
5|$|While gaunching as de Tournefort {{describes}} {{involves the}} erection of a scaffold, {{it seems that}} {{in the city of}} Algiers, hooks were embedded in the city walls, and on occasion, people <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> upon them from the battlements.|$|E
5000|$|Many tricks or {{patterns}} are generated from mixing cascade and reverse cascade throws. For example, tennis (siteswap: 3) one ball <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> over (reverse) {{while the other}} two <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> under (inside). One juggles, [...] "a cascade with two balls while the 'tennis' ball <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> {{and forth over the}} top." ...|$|R
5000|$|Return boomerangs have a flat {{convex surface}} that must <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> upright {{with a sharp}} flick of the wrist, but <b>throwing</b> sticks <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> horizontally.|$|R

5|$|According to the behind-the-scenes {{documentary}} {{portions of}} the film's DVD, there were slight continuity problems during the filming of the fight. This {{was said to have}} been {{due to the fact that}} real punches <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> by both Stallone and Tarver, resulting in some swelling and nosebleeds earlier than scripted. The DVD release features an alternate ending in which Rocky wins the fight.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{qualified}} for the Europa League group stages in 2011–12 in bizarre circumstances. Swiss side Sion defeated Celtic 3–1 on aggregate in the qualifying tie. Sion, however, <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> out of the tournament by UEFA due to them fielding ineligible players in the two games against Celtic. Celtic were thus reinstated, eventually finishing third in Group I, behind Atlético Madrid and Udinese and ahead of Rennes.|$|E
5|$|Cook then {{ordered that}} the ship be {{lightened}} to help her float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> overboard, and the ship's drinking water pumped out. The crew attached buoys to the discarded guns {{with the intention of}} retrieving them later, but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.|$|E

50|$|A simple {{example of}} the {{discrete}} uniform distribution <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> a fair die. The possible values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and each time the die <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> {{the probability of a}} given score is 1/6. If two dice <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> and their values added, the resulting distribution is no longer uniform since not all sums have equal probability.|$|R
5|$|In Cairo, a {{standoff}} {{took place in}} front of the Egyptian Museum {{in the early morning hours}} with rocks and petrol bombs reportedly flying. Large-caliber shots were reportedly fired in the air by the army to keep opposing factions at bay. There was a heavy police presence at the museum following the standoff. Anti-government protesters banged on metal railings while rocks <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> at them.|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic microbes, and toxins {{that they}} produce, have been {{developed}} as possible agents of warfare. Crude forms of biological warfare have been practiced since antiquity. In the 6th century BC, the Assyrians poisoned enemy wells with a fungus said to render the enemy delirious. In 1346, the bodies of Mongol warriors of the Golden Horde who had died of plague <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> over {{the walls of the}} besieged Crimean city of Kaffa, possibly assisting the spread of the Black Death into Europe.|$|E
5|$|The museum houses {{artifacts}} from the Roman period including objects that <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> into the Sacred Spring, presumably as offerings to the goddess.

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the 540 crescent, a crescent 540 is where a crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> out with one leg before the 540 kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> with the other, essentially executing two separate kicks during the same motion. A slight variation of this is where the crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> as a sideways snap kick, followed by a round house kick. The hips must be rotated more before the kicks <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> and the body tilts in the direction of the kicks, which can cause a person to lose their balance on the landing.|$|R
50|$|In , {{the balls}} <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> underhand (palm up) and rarely they <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> {{overhand}} (palm under), and are metal. In standard , the wooden or plastic balls are tossed underhand (palm up) and rolled.|$|R
5|$|The {{stock market}} in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929. The impact in Germany was dire: {{millions}} <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> {{out of work and}} several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the NSDAP prepared {{to take advantage of the}} emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to repudiate the Versailles Treaty, strengthen the economy and provide jobs.|$|E
5|$|The years 904–906 saw {{the use of}} {{incendiary}} projectiles called 'flying fires' (fei-huo). Needham (1986) {{argues that}} gunpowder was first used in warfare in China in 919 as a fuse for the ignition of another incendiary, Greek fire. Initially, gunpowder mixtures were utilised through traditional engines and throwing mechanisms; containers and grenades <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> by mangonels and trebuchets, and explosive rockets and arrows were developed, along with gunpowder flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|White Sox {{officials}} {{had hoped for}} a crowd of 20,000,about 5,000more than usual. Instead, at least 50,000—including {{tens of thousands of}} Dahl's adherents—packed the stadium, and thousands more continued to sneak in even after gates were closed. Many of the records were not collected by staff and <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> like flying discs from the stands. After Dahl blew up the collected records, thousands of fans stormed the field and remained there until dispersed by riot police.|$|E
5000|$|A given juggling {{pattern is}} {{represented}} by a sequence of digits, like [...] "333", [...] "97531", or [...] "744". Each digit represents the number of throws that occur {{by the time that}} same prop will be caught. For example, [...] "333" [...] represents a common three-ball cascade, where three props <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> before the same prop will <b>be</b> caught and <b>thrown</b> again. Within the [...] "531531" [...] pattern, the prop thrown first, the '5' <b>throw,</b> will not <b>be</b> caught until five <b>throws</b> have <b>been</b> made, including itself, where it will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> again as a '1'. The prop thrown next, the '3', will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> again on the third throw afterwards, the next '3'. And the next prop <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> with a '1' <b>throw,</b> which <b>is</b> a direct pass to the other hand and will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> on the very next throw as a '5'.|$|R

50|$|Back in the office, the {{reporter}} is desperate {{to know who}} <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> the cream pies. Dunkfeather confesses that he <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> the pies; however, this claim is compromised when, out of nowhere, a pie flies into his face.|$|R
5|$|According to the Barcoor Manuscript, {{written in}} Kannada by a Mangalorean Catholic from Barcoor {{after his return}} from Seringapatam, 20,000 of them (one-third) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill {{treatment}} by the soldiers. At the camp at Jamalabad fort, Mangalorean Catholic leaders <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> down from the fort. All Christian churches in South Canara, except the Hospet Church at Hospet and the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet, were razed {{to the ground and}} all land owned by the captured Christians was taken over by Tipu and distributed among his favourites. After they were freed, all their belongings had disappeared and their deserted lands were cultivated by the Bunts.|$|E
5|$|Before Animaniacs was {{put into}} {{production}} in 1991, various collaboration and brainstorming efforts were thought up to create both the characters and premise of the series. For instance, ideas that <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> out were Rita and Runt being the hosts of the show and the Warners being duck characters that senior producer Tom Ruegger drew in his college years. After the characters from the series were created, they were all shown to executive producer Steven Spielberg, who would decide which characters would make it into Animaniacs (the characters Buttons and Mindy were chosen by Spielberg's daughter). The characters' designs came from various sources, including caricatures of other writers, designs based on early cartoon characters, and characters that simply had a more modern design.|$|E
5|$|British General Sir Henry Clinton {{moved up}} from New York City and {{attempted}} to divert American attention by capturing two forts in the Hudson River highlands on October 6, but his efforts were too late to help Burgoyne. Burgoyne attacked Bemis Heights again on October 7 after {{it became apparent that}} he would not receive relieving aid in time. This battle culminated in heavy fighting marked by Arnold's spirited rallying of the American troops. Burgoyne's forces <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> back to the positions that they held before the September 19 battle and the Americans captured a portion of the entrenched British defenses.|$|E

50|$|The name of {{the game}} is derived from the Hindi word pachis, meaning twenty-five, the largest score that can <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> with the cowrie shells.
