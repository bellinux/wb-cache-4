25|$|Projection {{construction}} is also affected by how {{the shape of}} the Earth or planetary body is approximated. In the following section on projection categories, the earth is taken as a sphere in order to simplify the discussion. However, the Earth's actual shape is closer to an oblate ellipsoid. Whether spherical or ellipsoidal, the principles discussed hold <b>without</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>generality.</b>|$|E
25|$|The observables of Chern–Simons theory are the n-point {{correlation}} {{functions of}} gauge-invariant operators. The most often studied class of gauge invariant operators are Wilson loops. A Wilson loop is the holonomy around a loop in M, traced {{in a given}} representation R of G. As we will be interested in products of Wilson loops, <b>without</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>generality</b> we may restrict our attention to irreducible representations R.|$|E
25|$|Kempe's {{argument}} goes as follows. First, if planar regions separated by the graph are not triangulated, i.e. {{do not have}} exactly three edges in their boundaries, we can add edges without introducing new vertices {{in order to make}} every region triangular, including the unbounded outer region. If this triangulated graph is colorable using four colors or fewer, so is the original graph since the same coloring is valid if edges are removed. So it suffices to prove the four color theorem for triangulated graphs to prove it for all planar graphs, and <b>without</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>generality</b> we assume the graph is triangulated.|$|E

25|$|Suppose {{the edges}} of a {{complete}} graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue. Pick a vertex, v. There are 5 edges incident to v and so (by the pigeonhole principle) at least 3 of them must be the same colour. <b>Without</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>generality</b> we can assume at least 3 of these edges, connecting the vertex, v, to vertices, r, s and t, are blue. (If not, exchange red and blue in what follows.) If any of the edges, (r, s), (r, t), (s, t), are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle. If not, then those three edges are all red {{and we have an}} entirely red triangle. Since this argument works for any colouring, any K6 contains a monochromatic K3, and therefore R(3, 3) ≤ 6. The popular version of this is called the theorem on friends and strangers.|$|E
25|$|Chaos {{theory has}} been used for many years in cryptography. In the past few decades, chaos and {{nonlinear}} dynamics have been used in the design of hundreds of cryptographic primitives. These algorithms include image encryption algorithms, hash functions, secure pseudo-random number generators, stream ciphers, watermarking and steganography. The majority of these algorithms are based on uni-modal chaotic maps and a big portion of these algorithms use the control parameters and the initial condition of the chaotic maps as their keys. From a wider perspective, <b>without</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>generality,</b> the similarities between the chaotic maps and the cryptographic systems is the main motivation for the design of chaos based cryptographic algorithms. One type of encryption, secret key or symmetric key, relies on diffusion and confusion, which is modeled well by chaos theory. Another type of computing, DNA computing, when paired with chaos theory, offers a way to encrypt images and other information. Many of the DNA-Chaos cryptographic algorithms are proven to be either not secure, or the technique applied is suggested to be not efficient.|$|E

[...] Since the motion is planar, and p and L are perpendicular, pz = η'z = 0 and attention may be restricted to the three-dimensional vector [...] [...] The family of Apollonian circles of momentum hodographs (Figure 7) correspond to a family of great circles on the three-dimensional [...] sphere, all of which intersect the η'x-axis at the two foci , corresponding to the momentum hodograph foci at px = ±p0. [...] These great circles are related by a simple rotation about the η'x-axis (Figure 8). [...] This rotational symmetry transforms all the orbits of the same energy into one another; however, such a rotation is orthogonal to the usual three-dimensional rotations, since it transforms the fourth dimension η'w. [...] This higher symmetry is characteristic of the Kepler problem and corresponds to the conservation of the LRL vector.|$|E
