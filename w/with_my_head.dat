500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told me that I was in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E

"The {{first night}} I saw dailies," [...] replied art {{director}} Wallace, [...] "projected on a bedsheet in the producer's ratty apartment… My jaw dropped and I sat up so straight I {{cast a shadow}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> This looked like a zillion dollars. This looked like a real movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ah, by Bacchus, {{with this}} aria / I'll have {{universal}} applause. / They'll say to me, [...] "Bravo, Maestro! / I, with a sufficiently modest air, / Will go around <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> bent... / [...] I’ll have eulogies {{in the newspaper}} / I {{know how to make}} myself immortal.|$|E
60|$|I marched {{along in}} front of 'im <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>'ead</b> in the air, and {{when he spoke to}} me I didn't answer him. He went aboard the ship {{when we got to the}} wharf, and a minute or two arterwards 'e came to the side and said the skipper wanted to see me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] I answered. [...] "You don't feel inclined," [...] I added, [...] "to be {{a little}} more candid <b>with</b> me? <b>My</b> <b>head</b> has ached for a good many days over this business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} a day <b>with</b> us. <b>My</b> <b>head</b> keeper is coming up this afternoon, and I will try and arrange something. The {{election}} is next week, of course. We must plan a day after then." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{second section}} opens with another nostalgic soliloquy, which famously {{begins with the}} words: [...] "I wouldn't know what other people are like, but for myself, when I start {{thinking}} about my birthplace, Humulești, about the post holding the flue of the stove, round which mother used to tie a piece of string with tassels {{at the end of}} it, with which the cats played till they plopped, the earthen ledge of the stove that I used to cling to when I was learning to walk <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> held high, the place on top of the stove where I used to hide when we children played at hide-and-seek, as well as other games and delights full of childlike fun and charm, I seem to feel my heart pound with joy even to this moment!" [...] The text goes on to recount his mother's superstitious beliefs, which he himself had come to share. Following Smaranda's indication, Nică believed that blond-haired boys such as himself could invoke sunny weather by playing outside on a rainy day, that various dangers could be cursed away, and that marking the human body with soot or mud meant protection against the evil eye. The narrator also mentions his regret at not having shown his mother his full appreciation, and refers to childhood as [...] "the merry age".|$|E
60|$|I {{turned back}} to the house, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> feeling very old on my young shoulders.|$|E
60|$|I {{was ashamed}} to say no, though I liked it not over well, and I nodded <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went down}} to the cabin agin, and, {{standing}} on the locker, pushed the skylight up <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>’ead</b> and tried to lookout. I couldn’t see the gate, but I ’eard voices and footsteps, and a little while arterwards I see that gal coming along the wharf arm in arm with the young man she ’ad told me she didn’t like, and dancing for joy. They climbed on to the schooner, and then they both stooped down with their hands on their knees and looked at me.|$|R
60|$|HARRY. I don't know. You've just {{knocked me}} off my feet. Like it? You're wonderful. In my wildest dreams I never saw you like that. You've brought all the East {{into the room}} <b>with</b> you. <b>My</b> <b>head</b> reels as though I were drunk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I not {{walked the}} streets," [...] she moaned, [...] "till my feet have been sore <b>with</b> {{blisters}} and <b>my</b> <b>head</b> dizzy! Yet I {{have never met}} him." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went forward}} and seated {{myself in a}} tar-bucket, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> against the mast, to get what sleep I could.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Oh! don’t be afraid,’ said Mr. Evans, {{with a very}} self-satisfied air; ‘I shall fall <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> “off,” {{and then}} I can’t do any harm.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{arrived here}} this evening. I left the cars <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{full of the}} cathedral. The first thing I saw, on lifting my eyes, was a brown spire. Said I,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} care. I like my cup, occasionally; and can drink <b>with</b> others, without <b>my</b> <b>head</b> getting addled, {{but as a}} rule I care not overmuch for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That confounded Little Bonsa," [...] he thought. [...] "Am I {{expected}} {{to spend the rest}} of <b>my</b> life <b>with</b> it on <b>my</b> <b>head</b> like the man in the iron mask?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A nice lot!" [...] he ejaculated. [...] "I owe you my thanks, Mr. Ducie, all the same. It was {{touch and}} go <b>with</b> us, and <b>my</b> <b>head's</b> none the better for it." ...|$|R
60|$|I obeyed her {{instructions}} and presently found myself <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> over the basin, {{staring into the}} water in the exact attitude of a person who is about to be shampooed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{will answer}} it <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> if necessary,' said Waverley impetuously. 'I {{have been the}} unhappy cause {{of the loss of}} your child, make me not the murderer of your wife.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As if, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in {{its present}} {{throbbing}} state, you couldn't go {{and look at the}} shells and minerals and things provided for you, instead of circuses!' said Mrs. Gradgrind. 'You know, as well as I do, no young people have circus masters, or keep circuses in cabinets, or attend lectures about circuses. What can you possibly want to know of circuses then? I am sure you have enough to do, if that's what you want. <b>With</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{in its present}} state, I couldn't remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now before I begin, men," [...] said Bathsheba, [...] "I {{have two}} matters to speak of. The {{first is that}} the bailiff is {{dismissed}} for thieving, and that I have formed a resolution to have no bailiff at all, but to manage everything <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own <b>head</b> and hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sufficient {{unto the}} day--or night, perhaps I should say. He told our Mr. Morshed he'd follow him more sang frays, which is French for dead, drunk, or damned. Barrin' 'is paucity o' language, there wasn't a blemish on Jules. But what I wished to imply was, when we {{climbed into the}} back parts of the car, our Lootenant Morshed says to me, [...] "I doubt if I'd flick my cigar-ends about too lavish, Mr. Pyecroft. We ought to be sitting on five pounds' worth of {{selected}} fireworks, and I think the rockets are your end." [...] Not being able to smoke <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>'ead</b> over the side I threw it away; and then your Mr. Leggatt, 'aving been as nearly mutinous as it pays to be <b>with</b> <b>my</b> Mr. Morshed, arched his back and drove.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "ONE!" [...] I clenched {{my teeth}} and my body went rigid as the strap sliced through the air, 'CRACK!' Like a pistol shot, it made solid contact <b>with</b> <b>my</b> buttocks, <b>my</b> <b>head</b> snapped backwards, while violently driving my {{shackled}} body forward. White searing pain exploded throughout my being and blood gushed from my lips as I struggled to stifle a scream. It was brutal and it was horrible. My whole body vibrated like a band of tempered steel and <b>my</b> mind filled <b>with</b> nightmares as I awaited the next blow.|$|R
6000|$|When my {{consciousness}} returned, I found myself {{lying on my}} back beside our camp-fire, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> resting on Peterkin's knee; and the first sound I heard was his pleasant voice, as he said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Break her of it!" [...] {{cried the}} little man. [...] "You {{might as well}} advise me to break a brick wall <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I {{had no idea what}} they were like. I never dreamt it." ...|$|E
60|$|I am in bed <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> bound up, and beefsteaks upon my eyes, {{but still}} {{confident}} and buoyant. I have not {{lost faith in}} Macchiavelli. Tra-la-la! as they sing in the opera. I kiss everybody's hands.|$|E
5000|$|... “If {{only could}} I bear over <b>my</b> <b>head</b> like <b>my</b> turban forever thee, If only I could carry {{it all the}} time <b>with</b> me, on <b>my</b> <b>head</b> like a crown, the Footprint of the Prophet Muhammad, which has a {{beautiful}} complexion, Ahmed, go on, rub your face on the feet of that rose.“ ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{was riding}} {{around in the}} car <b>with</b> <b>my</b> cousins <b>headed</b> to a party and they ask me to {{freestyle}} {{out of the blue}} - so I gave it a shot.

60|$|<b>With</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> cocked {{and feeling}} as if I was doing {{something}} very fine, instead of being the most egregious fool south of Edinburgh, I marched on down the path with my new acquaintance at my elbow.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right, Hector,--l believe I shall {{do as much}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> as my hand too. But {{here comes}} Sir Arthur Wardour, who, between ourselves, is not fit to {{accomplish}} much either {{one way or the}} other." ...|$|E
60|$|I am in bed <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> bound up, and beef-steaks upon my eyes, {{but still}} {{confident}} and buoyant. I have not {{lost faith in}} Macchiavelli. Tra la la! as they sing in the opera. I kiss everybody's hands.|$|E
60|$|What <b>with</b> <b>my</b> ringing <b>head,</b> {{and fingers}} all thumbs, and Hiram roaring at me, I {{made a mess}} of tying the knot. Then Hiram let go his rope, and when the cub {{dropped to the ground}} the rope flew up over the branch. Cubby leaped so quickly that he jerked the rope away before Hiram could pick it up, and one hard pull {{loosened}} my hitch on the sapling.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was a kind}} {{of silence}} and more jabbering, and in he came, Bible in hand, after the manner of them--a little sandy chap in specks and a pith helmet. I flatter myself that me sitting there in the shadows, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> copper <b>head</b> and <b>my</b> big goggles, struck him a bit of a heap at first. 'Well,' I says, 'how's the trade in scissors?' for I don't hold with missionaries.|$|R
60|$|January 6.--Worked till dusk, but not <b>with</b> much effect; <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and mind}} not clear somehow. W. Laidlaw at dinner. In the evening read Foote's farce of the Commissary, {{said to have}} been {{levelled}} at Sir Lawrence Dundas; but Sir Lawrence was a man of family. Walter and Jane dined at Mertoun.|$|R
