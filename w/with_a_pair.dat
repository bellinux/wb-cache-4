5|$|As in all insects, {{the body}} {{is divided into three}} sections: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The thorax is {{composed}} of three segments, each <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of legs. In most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed, unlike those of moths which may be threadlike or feathery. The long proboscis can be coiled when not in use for sipping nectar from flowers.|$|E
5|$|Carnotaurus is {{the only}} known {{carnivorous}} bipedal animal <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of horns on the frontal bone. The use of these horns is not entirely clear; several interpretations have revolved around use in fighting conspecifics, in display, or in killing prey.|$|E
5|$|Northampton's is a {{comparatively}} elaborate war memorial, {{especially for a}} town rather than a city. It consists of a Stone of Remembrance flanked by tall twin obelisks, each adorned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of painted stone flags. Its use of obelisks, a Stone of Remembrance, and painted flags—all features characteristic of Lutyens' war memorials—make it particularly significant among his works.|$|E

50|$|One {{motivation}} of cyclic homology {{was the need}} for an approximation of K-theory that is defined, unlike K-theory, as the homology of a chain complex. Cyclic cohomology is in fact endowed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>with</b> K-theory, and one hopes this pairing to be non-degenerate.|$|R

Segment ten bears {{a pair of}} cerci, a pair of anal styles, the anus and the {{external}} genitalia. Males have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and females have spermathecae for storing sperm and an ovipositor through which the ootheca is laid.|$|E

We also show that if one extends the Schonhage model <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pairing</b> function and removes the unary restric-tion, then equivalence between the two machine models survives. ...|$|R

5|$|After {{their victory}} over Marion, the Informals {{defeated}} the Cadets {{for the second}} consecutive week at Denny Stadium 19–13. After they took a 7–0 lead on an 85-yard drive, the Cadets extended it to 13–0 {{by the end of the}} first quarter when Jimmy Scruggs scored on a touchdown reception. The Informals responded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of second-quarter touchdowns to make the halftime score 13–12. Touchdowns were scored on a Frank MacAlpine run and on a 21-yard Whitey Blanchiak reception from Barton Greer. Alabama then scored the go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter on a 55-yard interception return for a touchdown.|$|E

Its primary mission was to scout around using its advanced sensors, attempting to find and designate targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike. The Comanche was furnished with a digital fly-by-wire flight control system. Each of the two crew members were to be provided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of LCD multi-functional displays which would have functioned {{in addition to the}} Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS) worn by the crew.|$|E

5|$|First {{appearing}} in Dead 'Ard and Warrior, The Black Currant returned {{in a series}} of White Dwarf Thrud strips titled Thrud the Destroyer. In this story, The Black Currant is the leader of a horde of warriors who attack a small village, looting the homes, burning the women, raping the livestock and eating the babies. The Black Currant returned again in issue 3 of Critchlow's self-published Thrud the Barbarian comic as the leader of a group of bandits laying siege to a small town. The Black Currant is depicted in heavy black armour, wearing a helmet provided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of exceedingly long, horizontally extending horns.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for {{piercing and sucking}} (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E

He had a penchant for drumming on various objects around the house <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of chopsticks, so for his thirteenth birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum and some lessons, with the promise that if he stuck with it for a year they would buy him a kit.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Henderson {{graduated}} from Oakland Technical High School, {{where he played}} baseball, basketball and football, and was an All-American running back <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He also ran track, but did not stay with the team as the schedule conflicted with baseball. Henderson received over a dozen scholarship offers to play football. Despite a childhood dream {{to play for the}} Oakland Raiders, he turned down the scholarships on the advice of his mother, who argued that football players had shorter careers. In 1983, Henderson married his high-school sweetheart, Pamela. They have three children: Angela, Alexis, and Adrianna.|$|E
