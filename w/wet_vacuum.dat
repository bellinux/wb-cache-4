Controversial elution performances have been reported so far and a clear comprehension of these phenomena is still missing {{as a consequence of}} a lack of molecular investigation methods. Here we propose a way to discern drug elution {{properties of}} nanotubes through the evaluation of drug localization by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) analysis. We verified this method upon doxorubicin elution from differently loaded TiO 2 nanotubes. Diverse elution profiles were obtained from nanotubes filled by soaking and <b>wet</b> <b>vacuum</b> impregnation methods. Impregnated nanotubes controlled drug diffusion up to thirty days, while soaked samples completed elution in seven days. FCS analysis of doxorubicin motion in loaded nanotubes clarified that more than 90 % of drugs dwell preferentially in inter-nanotube spaces in soaked samples due to decorrelation in a 2 D fashion, while a 97 % fraction of molecules showed 1 D mobility ascribable to displacements along the nanotube vertical axis of <b>wet</b> <b>vacuum</b> impregnated nanotubes. The diverse drug localizations inferred from FCS measurements, together with distinct drug-surface interaction strengths resulting from diverse drug filling techniques, could explain the variability in elution kinetics...|$|E

40|$|International audienceUrban surface contamination, by {{atmospheric}} deposits as well {{as human}} activities, {{is a major concern}} for urban pollution management. Besides coarse street deposits which are clearly perceived and easily removed, suspended solid (SS) surface loads and contamination by heavy metals and hydrocarbons are rarely assessed although theycould be of major importance with regards to combined or separate server overflow (CSO and SSO) impacts. Both dry and <b>wet</b> <b>vacuum</b> sampling procedures have been first compared, in the laboratory, using dry and sieved clay or street deposits. Then the <b>wet</b> <b>vacuum</b> sampling procedure has been refined, coupling the injection of water and the hand-brushing of the surface prior to its vacuum cleaning, and evaluated on a car parking area close to the University. Finally this procedure has been assessed in Bearn Street within the 'Le Marais' district in Paris centre, and 34 samples have been analysed for metal and eight for aromatic hydrocarbon contamination. Heavy metal concentrations (0. 1 - 1. 7 g. kg- 1 dry wt. Cu, 0. 9 - 6. 1 g. kg- 1 dry wt. Pb and 1. 5 - 4. 6 g. kg- 1 dry wt. Zn) within street deposit samples collected in Paris centre, indicate a high contamination, especially for copper and zinc, as compared to reported data. Total polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are in the 3 - 11 mg. kg- 1 dry wt. range, thus approxiamtely 10 times less contaminated than dry atmospheric deposits. This paper presents data obtained ans discusses the difficulties encountered when sampling street deposits in busy areas of a city like Paris. The water jet street cleaning procedure used in Paris city workers was tested for its efficiency., by comparison of surface loads before and after the cleaning procedure. Although solids cleaning efficiency is highly variable (20 - 65 %) and somewhat higher for particles larger than 100 µm, particulate metal cleaning efficiency is even more variable (0 - 75 %) and particulate PAHs appear not to be significantly revoved...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{of spatial}} and {{temporal}} changes in the grain-size distribution of the bed surface and substrate are crucial to improving the modelling of sediment transport and associated grain-size selective processes. We present three complementary techniques to determine such variations in the grain-size distribution of the bed surface in sand–gravel laboratory experiments, {{as well as the}} resulting size stratification: (1) particle colouring, (2) removal of sediment layers, and (3) image analysis. The resulting stratification measurement method was evaluated in two sets of experiments. In both sets three grain-size fractions within the range of coarse sand to fine gravel were painted in different colours. Sediment layers are removed using a <b>wet</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner. Subsequently areal images are taken of the surface of each layer. The areal fraction content, that is, the relative presence of each size fraction over the bed surface, is determined using a colour segmentation algorithm which provides the areal fraction content of a specific colour (i. e. grain size) covering the bed surface. Particle colouring is not only beneficial to this type of image analysis but also to the observation and understanding of grain-size selective processes. The size stratification based on areal fractions is measured with sufficient accuracy. Other advantages of the proposed size stratification measurement method are (a) rapid collection and processing of a large amount of data, (b) a very high spatial density of information on the grain-size distribution, (c) the lack of disturbances to the bed surface, (d) only minor disturbances to the substrate due to the removal of sediment layers, and (e) the possibility to return a sediment layer to its original elevation and continue the flume experiment. The areal fractions are converted into volumetric fractions using an existing conversion model. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

Generally, biological samples are collected from crime scenes using swabbing, cutting, or taping techniques. However, these methods are limited in their abilities to recover diluted, masked, or otherwise invisible stains. Additionally, their targeted nature allows {{only a small portion of}} a larger stain to be collected at one time. In this study, a sterile wet-vacuum collection system was evaluated in its ability to collect small volume bloodstains from various substrates. Vacuuming was compared to swabbing and taping methods currently used in forensic analysis. Samples were collected from porous and nonporous surfaces; the efficacy of each collection method was evaluated with a colorimetric presumptive blood test. To evaluate each collection method, dilutions containing from 0. 25 nl to 25 μl human blood were spotted on common substrate materials, allowed to dry, and recovered. For comparison to the novel method, single-swabbing and tape-lifting techniques were performed in this study to collect samples for presumptive testing. During <b>wet</b> <b>vacuum</b> collection, stains were saturated with sterile buffer and suction was applied to the surrounding area, accumulating buffer in a collection bottle. Collected buffer was then filtered through membranes to capture cellular material, which were then presumptively tested for the presence of blood. Testing was performed with Kastle-Meyer (phenolphthalein) reagents. Each sample was photographed under consistent conditions in order to determine signal intensity. It was shown that the wet-vacuuming technique is able to recover sufficient amounts of blood for presumptive testing from multiple substrates. This method was able to detect similar dilutions of blood as traditional techniques in samples collected from porous surfaces, but was less effective on a nonporous substrate. Presumptive test image analysis shows increased relative intensity in collections from textiles, such as denim, when using the wet-vacuum system. Considering the results of a contemporaneous DNA quantification study, it was shown that in instances where a very weak presumptive result is found, the wet-vacuum technique may be better able to collect genetic material for downstream processing than the traditional methods evaluated. This study demonstrates the potential of wet-vacuuming as a suitable alternative technique to collect adhered cellular material from substrates in forensic investigations. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|E

This included factors such as suitable materials systems, and optimum process parameters. The RFI process is a new composite moulding method designed to allow fibre reinforced products to be manufactured with the ease of pre-preg materials while still allowing any dry reinforcement material to be used. The high pressures required for traditional manufacturing methods such as autoclaves, matched dies and R TM can be avoided while still having very accurate control over the fibre / resin ratio.

This chapter presents detailed methodologies developed for sample collection and testing for heavy metals and total petroleum hydrocarbons, {{as part of a}} research study to investigate {{the impacts of}} climate change and changes to urban traffic characteristics on pollutant build-up and wash-off from urban road surfaces. Cadmium, chromium, nickel, copper, lead, iron, aluminium, manganese and zinc were the target heavy metals, and selected gasoline and diesel range organics were the target total petroleum hydrocarbons for this study.

40|$|In the past, {{numerous}} {{studies have been conducted}} on the topics of moisture damage and permeability, but very few studies have correlated permeability with moisture damage in Asphalt Concrete (AC). This study evaluates whether such a relation exists or not. In addition, correlations of permeability with AC mix volumetrics and pores are evaluated. Also, correlation of laboratory permeability with field permeability is examined. In this study, a field survey is conducted to identify a set of eight pavements (bad) that are known to suffer from moisture damage and a set of eight pavements (good) that do not exhibit moisture damage. Field permeability testing is conducted on those 16 pavements. Results show that good performing pavements have very low (field) permeability compared to the bad performing pavements, which was expected. Field coring is conducted and cores are collected from all 16 pavement sections. Next, laboratory permeability testing is conducted on the field cores using a falling head permeameter. Based on laboratory permeability values, the good pavement sections exhibit smaller permeability than the bad performing sections. To this end, moisture damage potential of field cores is determined in the laboratory using Moisture Induced Sensitivity Test (MIST) device and the AASHTO T 283 method. In MIST method, a sample is wet conditioned using repeated increase and decrease of pore pressure inside the saturated pores of AC sample. In the AASHTO T 283 method, a sample is <b>wet</b> conditioned using <b>vacuum</b> saturation and then subjected to one cycle of freeze-thaw. A set of three wet and three dry conditioned samples are tested for indirect tensile strength and Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) of wet to dry sample sets is determined. It is shown that both MIST and the AASHTO T 283 yield TSR values of less than 1. 0, which means moisture damage occurred by both conditioning methods. Based on the AASHTO T 283 data, when moisture damage is correlated with laboratory permeability, the AASHTO T 283 shows a good correlation but MIST shows a poor correlation. Correlations of field permeability with the AASHTO T 283 and MIST are found to be poor. Mix volumetrics (e. g., gradation, porosity, binder content) tests are performed on field cores. Gradation data is plotted on a 0. 45 power curve. Based on the power curve plot, it is shown that a mix gradation that passes near to the maximum density line have low permeabilities and moisture damage potentials. It is known that an AC sample contains 3 types of pore: permeable, dead-end, and isolated pores. In this study, permeable pore is determined using a tracer test method, a concept borrowed from soil permeability testing. Dead-end and isolated pores are also determined using a CoreLok device. It is shown that permeable pores have a better correlation with permeability than the effective pore, which is defined as the sum of permeable and dead-end pores. In this study, an attempt is made to correlate laboratory permeability with field permeability. Laboratory permeability does not have any correlation with the field permeability. This {{may be due to the}} fact that field permeability is affected by several factors such as 3 D flow in the field, Open Graded Friction Coarse (OGFC), tack coats. To this end, an analytical model is developed to predict field permeability from laboratory permeability. Model permeability is found to be higher than the laboratory permeability. Because the model considers lateral and vertical direction flows whereas laboratory permeability test considers only vertical flow. It is shown that the model permeability is less than the field permeability for pavements with OGFC and more than the field permeability for pavements without OGFC. Therefore, a shift factor is developed to match the model permeability with the field permeability. New Mexico Department of TransportationCivil EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Partition {{of heavy}} metals between {{particulate}} and dissolve fraction of stormwater primarily {{depends on the}} adsorption characteristics of solids particles. Moreover, the bioavailability of heavy metals is also influenced by the adsorption behaviour of solids. However, {{due to the lack}} of fundamental knowledge in relation to the heavy metals adsorption processes of road deposited solids, the effectiveness of stormwater management strategies can be limited. The research study focused on the investigation of the physical and chemical parameters of solids on urban road surfaces and, more specifically, on heavy metal adsorption to solids. Due to the complex nature of heavy metal interaction with solids, a substantial database was generated through a series of field investigations and laboratory experiments. The study sites for the build-up pollutant sample collection were selected from four urbanised suburbs located in a major river catchment. Sixteen road sites were selected from these suburbs and represented typical industrial, commercial and residential land uses. Build-up pollutants were collected using a <b>wet</b> and dry <b>vacuum</b> collection technique which was specially designed to improve fine particle collection. Roadside soil samples were also collected from each suburb for comparison with the road surface solids. The collected build-up solids samples were separated into four particle size ranges and tested for a range of physical and chemical parameters. The solids build-up on road surfaces contained a high fraction (70 %) of particles smaller than 150 ìm, which are favourable for heavy metal adsorption. These solids particles predominantly consist of soil derived minerals which included quartz, albite, microcline, muscovite and chlorite. Additionally, a high percentage of amorphous content was also identified in road deposited solids. In comparing the mineralogical data of surrounding soil and road deposited solids, it was found that about 30 % of the solids consisted of particles generated from traffic related activities on road surfaces. Significant difference in mineralogical composition was noted in different particle sizes of build-up solids. Fine solids particles (150 ìm) consisted of a sandy matrix at all study sites, with about 60 % quartz content. Due to these differences in mineralogical components, particles larger than and smaller than 150 ìm had significant differences in their specific surface area (SSA) and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC). These parameters, in turn, exert a significant influence on heavy metal adsorption. Consequently, heavy metal content in > 150 ìm particles was lower than in the case of fine particles. The particle size range < 75 ìm had the highest heavy metal content, corresponding with its high clay forming minerals, high organic matter and low quartz content which increased the SSA, ECEC and the presence of Fe, Al and Mn oxides. The clay forming minerals, high organic matter and Fe, Al and Mn oxides create distinct groups of charge sites on solids surfaces and exhibit different adsorption mechanisms and bond strength, between heavy metal elements and charge sites. Therefore, the predominance of these factors in different particle sizes leads to different heavy metal adsorption characteristics. Heavy metals show preference for association with clay forming minerals in fine solids particles, whilst in coarse particles heavy metals preferentially associate with organic matter. Although heavy metal adsorption to amorphous material is very low, the heavy metals embedded in traffic related materials have a potential impact on stormwater quality. Adsorption of heavy metals is not confined to an individual type of charge site in solids, whereas specific heavy metal elements show preference for adsorption to several different types of charge sites in solids. This is attributed to the dearth of preferred binding sites and the inability to reach the preferred binding sites due to competition between different heavy metal species. This confirms that heavy metal adsorption is significantly influenced by the physical and chemical parameters of solids that lead to a heterogeneity of surface charge sites. The research study highlighted the importance of removal of solids particles from stormwater runoff before they enter into receiving waters to reduce the potential risk posed by the bioavailability of heavy metals. The bioavailability of heavy metals not only results from the easily mobile fraction bound to the solids particles, but can also occur as a result of the dissolution of other forms of bonds by chemical changes in stormwater or microbial activity. Due to the diversity in the composition of the different particle sizes of solids and the characteristics and amount of charge sites on the particle surfaces, investigations using bulk solids are not adequate to gain an understanding of the heavy metal adsorption processes of solids particles. Therefore, the investigation of different particle size ranges is recommended for enhancing stormwater quality management practices...|$|R
