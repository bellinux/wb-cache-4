5|$|A {{water mill}} and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water power was in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills. The {{one at the}} hall was once used to churn butter. The foundations of <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> mill opposite Mill Hill Cottages on Rivington Lane, mill ponds, and a smithy were shown on the 1848 first edition Ordnance Survey map. Names such as Mill Hill and Mill Dam Wood also provide evidence of the former mill.|$|E
5|$|Despite injury troubles, Totti {{recovered}} {{in time to}} join the national team for their victorious 2006 World Cup campaign, {{despite a lack of}} match practice during his three months on the sidelines. Italy manager Marcello Lippi showed enormous faith in Totti, assuring him during his rehabilitation that his spot in Italy's World Cup squad was secure and to focus on recuperating. This encouragement and show of faith fueled Totti's desire to work even harder to overcome <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> career-ending injury and make it to the World Cup against all odds (and much of the Italian media's opinion).|$|E
5|$|The Falcons {{controlled}} {{the ball for}} 41 of 60 minutes. An inability to complete long passes, combined with fumbles, prevented the Buccaneers from taking <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> large early lead. Isaac Hagins' fumble to Atlanta's Tom Pridemore set up a 31-yard field goal. The Buccaneers maintained a halftime lead, despite having held the ball for only six minutes and 18 seconds in the first half. Falcon blitzing disrupted Doug Williams' passing, and Ricky Bell and Jerry Eckwood were held to 72 yards rushing. Eckwood's fumble led to Atlanta's go-ahead touchdown with 11:10 remaining. Bubba Bean's 60-yard run with 1:22 remaining clinched the game for the Falcons. A 69-yard Williams-led drive brought the Buccaneers to within three points with 28 seconds left, but the Buccaneers failed to recover the ensuing onside kick.|$|E

5|$|Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did {{not manage}} {{to deal with}} this mounted force and use the sizable {{advantage}} of their army effectively. Their own Byzantine cavalry never {{played a significant role in}} the battle and were held in static reserve for most of the six days. They never pushed their attacks and even when they obtained <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> decisive breakthrough on the fourth day, they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, though this may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict. Moreover, many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies, while the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops.|$|E
5|$|Back at Paramount, Cooper {{returned}} to a more comfortable genre in Ernst Lubitsch's romantic comedy Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938) with Claudette Colbert. In the film, Cooper plays a wealthy American businessman in France {{who falls in love}} with an impoverished aristocrat's daughter and persuades her to become his eighth wife. Despite the clever screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, and solid performances by Cooper and Colbert, American audiences had trouble accepting Cooper in the role of a shallow philanderer. After all, it succeeded only in the European market. In the fall of 1938, Cooper appeared in H. C. Potter's romantic comedy The Cowboy and the Lady with Merle Oberon, about a sweet-natured rodeo cowboy who falls in love with the wealthy daughter of a presidential hopeful, believing her to be a poor, hard-working lady's maid. The efforts of three directors and several eminent screenwriters could not salvage <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> fine vehicle for Cooper. While more successful than its predecessor, the film was Cooper's fourth consecutive box-office failure in the American market.|$|E
5|$|Then, after flying past McCudden in a head-on firing pass, Voss's Fokker was {{hit with}} bullets on the {{starboard}} side by Hoidge. Meantime, Rhys Davids had pulled aside to change an ammunition drum; he rejoined combat with a 150meter (500foot) height advantage over Voss's altitude of 450meters (1,500feet), and began a long flat dive onto the tail of Voss' triplane. At point-blank range, he holed the German aircraft end to end with his machine guns before turning. It wandered into his line of flight again, in a gentle westward glide; Rhys Davids again ripped the German plane as its engine quit. The aircraft missed a mid-air collision by inches. The British ace fired again. As the triplane's glide steepened, Rhys Davids overran him at about 300meters (1,000feet) altitude and lost sight of his opponent. From above, Bowman saw the Fokker in <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> landing glide, right up until it stalled. It then flipped inverted and nose down, dropping directly to earth. The resulting smash left only the rudder intact.|$|E

No. 854 suffered a firebox failure due to lack of water 23 April 1945, killing the fireman and injuring the driver. No. 851 Sir Walter Raleigh was involved in a serious derailment at Byfleet in December 1946, due to the poor condition of the permanent way.

25|$|While King Henry III of England had {{accepted}} Dafydd's claim to rule Gwynedd, {{he was not}} disposed {{to allow him to}} retain his father's conquests outside Gwynedd. In 1241 the King invaded Gwynedd, and Dafydd was forced to submit in late August. Under the terms of the Treaty of Gwerneigron, he had to give up all his lands outside Gwynedd, and also to hand over to the King his half brother Gruffudd whom he had been keeping a prisoner. Henry thereby gained <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> useful weapon against Dafydd, with the possibility of setting Gruffudd up as a rival to Dafydd in Gwynedd, but Gruffudd died trying to escape from the Tower of London by climbing down a knotted sheet, and fell to his death in March 1244.|$|E

While the main antenna was out of service, NBC found a solution with some history to it to get WMAQ back broadcasting at full power. RCA had a tower in storage in one of its New Jersey facilities that was used as part of its 1939 New York World's Fair exhibit. The tower, which originally came from NBC's WTAM in Cleveland, was shipped to Chicago and became the acting main antenna; it stands today at Bloomingdale.

25|$|Seventh-seeded West Virginia {{began the}} second round of the tournament by {{defeating}} Duke, the second seed, 73-67. The Mountaineers trailed until about eight minutes into the second half, when they took a 43-40 lead. They outrebounded the Blue Devils 47-27, which, combined with several three-point shots, aided in the win. This loss marked Duke's second consecutive loss before the Sweet Sixteen round. West Virginia's Sweet Sixteen opposition in Phoenix, Arizona was #3 Xavier, who defeated Purdue, 85–78. Xavier trailed as late as the 5:30 mark of the second half, but a widespread showing of talent from the Musketeers proved too difficult to stop, as four Xavier players scored in double figures, with two more tied at eight points each. Later that day, the top-seeded UCLA Bruins defeated ninth-seeded Texas A, 51–49. The Bruins trailed by as much as ten early in the first half, but slowly chipped away at the lead as the half progressed. The winning basket was scored with 9.5 seconds left on a lay-up by Darren Collison. Texas A had one final chance to tie it, but Donald Sloan's drive to the basket was stopped by two UCLA players (pictures show that they both appear to be grabbing Sloan, in <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> foul called on UCLA). The ensuing dunk by UCLA's Russell Westbrook was later waved off by officials as occurring after time had expired, making the final score 51–49. The Bruins then played WKU, a #12 seed who beat #13 seed San Diego by a 73–62 score. San Diego trailed by as much as 15 in the second half, but an 18–2 run gave them a one-point lead with 6-and-a-half minutes remaining. WKU, however, managed to pull ahead once again for the win, making this tournament only the third in history to feature at least two 12-or-lower seeds in the Sweet 16.|$|E
