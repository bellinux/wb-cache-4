25|$|It {{has been}} said (by the present-day {{explorer}} Ranulph Fiennes amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and <b>wind-proof</b> clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.|$|E
25|$|On 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union {{attacked}} Finland, starting {{what came}} to be known as the Winter War. The Finns perfected the design and tactical use of the petrol bomb. The fuel for the Molotov cocktail was refined to a slightly sticky mixture of gasoline, kerosene, tar, and potassium chlorate. Further refinements included the attachment of <b>wind-proof</b> matches or a phial of chemicals that would ignite on breakage, thereby removing the need to pre-ignite the bottle, and leaving the bottle about one-third empty was found to make breaking more likely.|$|E
60|$|Husband {{and wife}} walked till {{they had reached}} the house they were in search of, which stood in a terrace facing the sea, and was fronted by a small garden of <b>wind-proof</b> and salt-proof evergreens, stone steps {{leading up to the}} porch. It had its number in the row, but, being rather larger than the rest, was in {{addition}} sedulously distinguished as Coburg House by its landlady, though everybody else called it 'Thirteen, New Parade.' The spot was bright and lively now; but in winter it became necessary to place sandbags against the door, and to stuff up the keyhole against the wind and rain, which had worn the paint so thin that the priming and knotting showed through.|$|E

40|$|Because of low {{temperatures}} and oxygen in cold water, fish will die when cold currents arrive. This will cause tremendous loss of money. In order reduce the cooling of the pond, an automatic thermal detecting and cold-roofing system using a <b>wind-proofing</b> device, heaters, and thermal detectors is proposed. To reduce heat loss due to thermal convection above the pond surface, a motor-driven <b>wind-proofing</b> device automatically {{controlled by a}} PLC controller is adopted. Here, the <b>wind-proofing</b> device, thermal detectors, and heating system {{are connected to the}} PLC controller. The PLC will also be connected to the PC interface. The temperature thresholds used to trigger the heater and the wind proofing device can be set at the PC interface. Two options for manipulating the heating and the automatic heating can be selected. The related <b>wind-proofing</b> area and the number of heaters will be determined according to the current temperature. Moreover, the PLC can be wirelessly connected to the server PC in the control room. The pond keeper can monitor everything online and control the pond water's temperature. With this, the problem of fish dying in a cold wave can be solved. Consequently, to reduce the electrical exhaust when heating up the pond water, green energy, solar energy and wind energy, is used...|$|R
5000|$|Older {{construction}} {{sometimes used}} a lighter-weight tar paper, stapled {{up with some}} overlap, as a water- and <b>wind-proofing</b> material on walls, but modern carpenters more often uses 8 or 10 ft widths of [...] "housewrap".|$|R
6000|$|Coverlets.--General Remarks.--For {{an upper}} cover, {{it is of}} {{importance}} to an otherwise unsheltered person, that its texture should be such as to prevent the wind blowing through. If it does so, no thickness is of any avail in keeping out the cold; hence the advantage of skin carosses, buffalo robes, leather sheets, and macintosh rugs. All clothes lose much of their closeness of texture in a hot, dry climate; the fibres shrink extremely, and the wind blows through the tissue as through network. It is {{in order to make}} their coverings <b>wind-proof,</b> that shepherd-lads on the hills in Scotland, when the nights are cold, dip their plaids in water, before sitting or lying down in them. The wet swells up the fibres of the plaid, and makes the texture of it perfectly dense and close. It is also of importance that the outer covering should have a certain weight, {{so as not to be}} too easily displaced, either by the person fidgeting in his sleep or by the blowing of the wind. In dry weather there is nothing like furs; but in a rainy country I prefer a thick blanket bag (see [...] "Sleeping Bags"), a large spare blanket, and a macintosh sheet and counterpane. It may be objected that the bag and macintosh would be close and stuffy, but be assured that the difficulty when sleeping on mother earth, on a bitter night, is to keep the fresh air out, not to let it in. On fine nights I should sleep on the bag and under the spare blanket.|$|E
60|$|Still, I will frankly {{admit that}} the banana itself, with its {{practically}} almost identical relation, the plantain, is a real bit of tropical foliage. I confess to a settled prejudice against the tropics generally, but I allow the sunsets, the coco-nuts, and the bananas. The true stem creeps underground, and sends up each year an upright branch, thickly covered with majestic broad green leaves, somewhat {{like those of the}} canna cultivated in our gardens as 'Indian shot,' but far larger, nobler, and handsomer. They sometimes measure from six to ten feet in length, and their thick midrib and strongly marked diverging veins give them a very lordly and graceful appearance. But they are apt in practice to suffer much from the fury of the tropical storms. The wind rips the leaves up between the veins as far as the midrib in tangled tatters; so that after a good hurricane they look more like coco-nut palm leaves than like single broad masses of foliage as they ought properly to do. This, of course, is the effect of a gentle and balmy hurricane--a mere capful of wind that tears and tatters them. After a really bad storm (one of the sort when you tie ropes round your wooden house to prevent its falling bodily to pieces, I mean) the bananas are all actually blown down, and the crop for that season utterly destroyed. The apparent stem, being merely composed of the overlapping and sheathing leaf-stalks, has naturally very little stability; and the soft succulent trunk accordingly gives way forthwith at the slightest onslaught. This liability to be blown down in high winds forms the weak point of the plantain, viewed as a food-stuff crop. In the South Sea Islands, where there is little shelter, the poor Fijian, in cannibal days, often lost his one means of subsistence from this cause, and was compelled to satisfy the pangs of hunger on the plump persons of his immediate relatives. But since the introduction of Christianity, and of a dwarf stout <b>wind-proof</b> variety of banana, his condition in this respect, I am glad to say, has been greatly ameliorated.|$|E
5000|$|University of Florida's {{team led}} by Forrest Masters {{developed}} [...] "the world's most powerful portable hurricane simulator, a giant machine capable of reproducing winds in excess of 120 mph and recreating rain." [...] It consists of eight large fans driven by four diesel engines, with a 5,000-gallon (19,000 litre) water tank to keep the engines cooled. The university is currently designing water-resistant windows, <b>wind-proof</b> tiles and altogether stronger structures.|$|E
5000|$|The name {{fishtail}} {{comes from}} the fish tail extension at the back that could be folded up between the legs, much like a Knochensack, and fixed using snap connectors to add <b>wind-proofing.</b> The fishtail was fixed at the front for warmth or folded away at the back to improve freedom of movement when needed.|$|R
5000|$|Mount Horne (...) is, at 1,165 m, {{the highest}} and most {{prominent}} mountain in the Quilty Nunataks, standing 12 nmi km east-northeast of Mount Hassage in Palmer Land, Antarctica. It was discovered by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition, 1947-48, under Finn Ronne, who named it for Bernard Horne of Pittsburgh, who furnished <b>wind-proofs</b> and other clothing for the expedition.|$|R
50|$|It is {{also used}} as a solvent for some {{varnishes}} and nitrocellulose lacquers. As a solvent and carrier for materials such as nitrocellulose, it was extensively used in the aircraft industry for stiffening and <b>wind-proofing</b> fabric flying surfaces, where it and its derivatives were generally known as 'aircraft dope'. Now that most aircraft are all-metal, such use is now mostly limited to historically accurate reproductions and scale models.|$|R
5000|$|By mid-1944, the OQMG {{finalized}} {{the several}} layering components of its multi-environment combat uniform, anointing the M-1943 Field Jacket its basic, universal building block. A completely new design, the M-1943 touted a <b>wind-proof,</b> olive drab colored cotton poplin outer shell with internal layers {{that could be}} added or eliminated depending on local battle conditions. In cold environs, its notched lapels converted to a stand-up, storm-flap for added neck protections. A pile jacket [...] and fur-edged hood could also be added.|$|E

50|$|For the Royal Marines, {{which had}} a {{responsibility}} for NATO's northern flank, a Smock, Windproof, Arctic and Trousers, Windproof, Arctic were introduced circa 1972. These were made in a lightweight, but <b>wind-proof,</b> DPM fabric and could be worn over quilted jacket and trousers in extreme cold conditions. The design of both smock and trousers differ radically from both the standard and para designs. The smock is long and loose-fitting, and incorporates a voluminous wired-rim hood, while the trousers have zips in the lower leg {{to allow them to}} be put on over boots.|$|E
50|$|Gore-Tex Paclite is {{the second}} of three levels in the Shell Layer and is {{completely}} waterproof. The Gore-Tex Paclite membrane contains the same materials and specifications as the Gore-Tex membrane, except that it features the lighter and more packable fabrics. This membrane is ideal when space and weight are critical, without sacrificing breathability, durability, freedom of movement, or water- and <b>wind-proofing.</b> Each jacket weighs less than the equivalent weight of four golf balls.|$|R

50|$|He donated also 55 {{fluorescent}} <b>wind-proof</b> jackets to the Road Traffic Police of the Attica Tollway (Attiki Odos), to help {{upgrade their}} equipment, and the facilitation {{of the work}} of the police officers, {{in the presence of the}} Colonel of the Road Traffic Police, Brigadier General D. Papanagiotou and the Commander of the Road Traffic Police Unit of the Attica Tollway, Police Second Lieutenant E. Kountouromichalis. The Colonel of the Road Traffic Police thanked Mr. Giannakopoulos, offering him an honorary badge. In the context of the VIANEX contribution, Dimitris Giannakopoulos donated to the Hellenic Police 10 high-performance motorcycles.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, {{they were}} once again removed from {{military}} use. Allegedly this was by request of the wearers, who found the hat inefficient. (As the papakha is a relatively short hat that does not protect the ears well, it might be well suited to the mild climate of the Caucasus, but not to lower temperatures. Also is not very <b>wind-proof.)</b> The act of removing the papakhas was seen in some quarters as an attempt of the Boris Yeltsin regime to abandon earlier Soviet traditions and symbolically demonstrate the country's commitment to a new political course. In 2005, papakhas were reinstated.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} years of {{aviation}} pilots started wearing leather flying helmets as a form of protection from the cold and the noise of aircraft engines. Leather was becoming a popular choice for protective gear with the rise of motor sport and aviation {{at the start of the}} 1900s. It has many advantages that made it the ideal material for flying helmets. It is warm, durable, impermeable to liquids therefore waterproof, flexible and can be cut to curve around the head. It is <b>wind-proof</b> and has the great advantage of not accumulating dust. It was also found that leather helmets offered a level of protection against fire.|$|E
50|$|Stockade fortifications {{were simple}} forms of defence of {{military}} camps or settlements, used since ancient Roman times and earlier. The troops or settlers {{would build a}} stockade by clearing a space of woodland and using the trees whole or chopped in half, with one end sharpened on each. They would dig a narrow trench around the area, and stand the sharpened logs side-by-side inside it, encircling the perimeter. Sometimes they would add additional defence by placing sharpened sticks in a shallow secondary trench outside the stockade. In colder climates sometimes the stockade received a coating of clay or mud {{that would make the}} crude wall <b>wind-proof.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 1st Pattern smock {{design was}} {{replaced}} in 1944 {{by a second}} pattern which had buttoning tabs at the cuffs and brass snap fasteners to stow the tail flap {{on the back of}} the jacket when not needed. Other detail differences included reduced length and tube shaped rather than tapered sleeves. In order to make it more <b>wind-proof,</b> the tops of woollen socks were often sewn to the cuffs. The half-length zip fastener on this smock was made of brass. The colours of the 2nd pattern also differed from those of the earlier smocks, the base colour varying from a light to a medium olive combination, with overlying brushstrokes of reddish brown and dark olive green. These colours were thought better suited to the North Western European theatre.|$|E
5000|$|Firstly, {{the cold}} is {{protected}} against with clothing of {{three types of}} layers as follows: a liner layer against the camper's skin (longjohns), an insulation layer (fleece), and a water- and <b>wind-proof</b> outer shell. Although cotton {{is one of the}} best quality fabrics there is, it is not recommended to be worn on winter camping because if it gets wet it dries out very slowly and the wearer could freeze. Rather than cotton, winter campers should wear wool or synthetic materials. The boots must be waterproof and the head must be protected against the cold. Although it seems a good choice, campers are advised not to wear too many pairs of socks as they might restrict blood flow to the feet, resulting in cold feet. Gaiters should also be worn to avoid snow and rain wetting the boots.|$|E
5000|$|On 13 April 1996 {{hours after}} a concert, {{a large piece of}} plaster fell 130 feet from the roof into the auditorium. Only three chairs were damaged, but this event was just one example of the state of {{disrepair}} into which the Hall was falling. Vital repairs were necessary to make the building <b>wind-proof,</b> watertight and safe. Relying heavily on Lottery and Arts Council funding, the City of Edinburgh embarked on a £25 million scheme to both make the hall safe and improve its function - including making the auditorium suitable for Promenade-type events and building new catering and ticketing facilities [...] Unfortunately, late into the design phase, the Lottery Fund application failed and the Arts Council withdrew its support. Mired in controversy the project collapsed. In 1998 the City of Edinburgh announced it had put aside £9 million to start the refurbishment again.|$|E
30|$|Three major DRR {{measures}} were considered in our CBA: <b>wind-proof</b> retrofitting, premium subsidy to typhoon insurance, and post-disaster relief. Emergency response was not {{taken into account}} {{due to the lack}} of capability in modeling indirect impacts of delayed response. The government is assumed to be the funder of these DRR measures. Therefore, the CBA was from the viewpoint of the government.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} finding the length and the {{duration}} of a peak gust seems to be importantfor the <b>wind-proof</b> design of structures. It is assumed here that the scale of peak gust isequal to its wind run, and {{the relation between the}} scale of peak gust and the maximumwind speed is derived from the experimental relation between the gust factor and the gustduration time, which was obtained by one of the authors before.

40|$|Recently, {{building}} envelopes with efficient insulation of low thermal conductivity, including {{light building}} envelope, which allow to increase thermal protection of buildings, are widely used. This new building envelope require a comprehensive study, because previously considered unimportant features often {{start to make}} {{significant effect on the}} performance characteristics of structures. To reduce the air permeability in the constructions <b>wind-proof</b> membranes are used. However, the influence of air filtering in such structures has not been researched yet. When the air-permeable building envelopes are used, the heat flow is moved away also due to the air filtering. It is proposed {{to take into account the}} convective heat transfer mechanism commensurate with the conductive heat transfer mechanism. In the formula for determining the heat flow due to the air filtering the filtration coefficient of air through the building envelope is used. This coefficient is found experimentally for light building envelopes. Furthermore, the empirical expression for the filtration coefficient, which relates it and the coefficient of heat loss is found...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{materials}} are hierarchically organized complex composites, which embrace multiple practical functionalities. As an example, the wild silkworm cocoon provides multiple protective functions against environmental and physical hazards, promoting the survival chance of moth pupae that resides inside. In the present investigation, the microstructure and thermal {{property of the}} Chinese tussah silkworm (Antheraea pernyi) cocoon in both warm and cold environments under windy conditions have been studied by experimental and numerical methods. A new computational fluid dynamics model has been developed according to the original fibrous structure of the Antheraea pernyi cocoon to simulate the unique heat transfer process through the cocoon wall. The structure of the Antheraea pernyi cocoon wall can promote the disorderness of the interior air, which increases the wind resistance by stopping most of the air flowing into the cocoon. The Antheraea pernyi cocoon is <b>wind-proof</b> due to the mineral crystals deposited on the outer layer surface and its hierarchical structure with low porosity and high tortuosity. The research findings have important implications to enhancing the thermal function of biomimetic protective textiles and clothing...|$|E
40|$|The {{quicksand}} {{phenomenon is}} one of the big factors of desertification. This report introduced straw net method which {{is one of}} the effective methods for stabilizing quick-sands. This method is to cover the sand dune with straw nets with square circumference of about 1 m. Height of straw fence is about 10 - 20 cm from soil surface and the depth is about 10 - 30 cm. Grass seeds are sprayed after construction of the nets. In some cases, young trees such as pine and yellow willow are planted. At first this method was adopted as the way of protecting a road, a railway from the flow dune in Horquin arid land. Nowadays this method has become popular and widely used for the fixation of the flow sand and for recovering the vegatation, in arid area China. The merits of straw nets on protecting desertification can be pointed as follows. First, the flow sand can be stabilized by the <b>wind-proof</b> effects. Second, the natural material of straw which are an agricultural by-product can be produced in the farm village in the spot. Third, the technique to construct nets is easy. Fourth, the prompt effect afterestablishment can be expected. Fifth, grass and trees are fixed at the short time by harvesting the snow and rainfall as natural water to the root zone. The new evaluation of straw nets is effects on the microclimate modification such as lowering air temperature, increasing the air humidity and lowering soil temperature. These environmental modifications are effective for the prompt germination of the seed and nursing vegatation growing. As mention above, this straw net method is effective for the sand dune fixation and the vegatation recovering...|$|E
