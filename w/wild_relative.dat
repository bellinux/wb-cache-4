5|$|Crop {{diversity}} is {{an aspect of}} biodiversity important for food security. The loss of bio{{diversity is}} considered one of today’s most serious environmental concerns by the Food and Agriculture Organization. If current trends persist, as many as half of all plant species could face extinction. Among the many threatened species are wild relatives of our crops – the wild and weedy cousins of domesticated plants that possess valuable traits for crop breeding, such as pest and disease resistance. Some 6% of wild relatives of cereal crops such as wheat, maize, rice, and sorghum are under threat, as are 18% of legumes (Fabaceae), the wild relatives of beans, peas and lentils, and 13% of species within the botanical family (Solanaceae) that includes potato, tomato, eggplant (aubergine), and peppers (Capsicum). In 2016, 29% of <b>wild</b> <b>relative</b> plant species were completely missing from the world’s genebanks, with a further 24% represented by fewer than 10 samples. Over 70% of all crop <b>wild</b> <b>relative</b> species worldwide were in urgent need of further collecting to improve their representation in genebanks, and over 95% were insufficiently represented with regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. While the most critical priorities for further collecting were found in the Mediterranean and Near East, Western and Southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America, crop wild relatives insufficiently represented in genebanks are distributed across almost all countries worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Most alfalfa cultivars contain genetic {{material}} from sickle medick (M. falcata), a crop <b>wild</b> <b>relative</b> of alfalfa that naturally hybridizes with M. sativa to produce sand lucerne (M. sativa ssp. varia). This species may bear either the purple flowers of alfalfa or the yellow of sickle medick, {{and is so}} called for its ready growth in sandy soil. Traits for insect resistance have also been introduced from M. glomerata and M. prostrata, members of alfalfa's secondary gene pool.|$|E
25|$|Strong {{similarities}} in morphology and genetics show that wild emmer (Triticum dicoccoides Koern.) is the wild ancestor and a crop <b>wild</b> <b>relative</b> of domesticated emmer. Because wild and domesticated emmer are interfertile with other tetraploid wheats, some taxonomists consider all tetraploid wheats {{to belong to}} one species, T. turgidum. Under this scheme, the two forms are recognized at subspecies level, thus T. turgidum subsp. dicoccoides and T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum. Either naming system is equally valid; the latter lays more emphasis on genetic similarities.|$|E

25|$|MtDNA studies {{indicate}} that the wild boar originated from islands in Southeast Asia such as Indonesia and the Philippines, and subsequently spread onto mainland Eurasia and North Africa. The earliest fossil finds of the species come from both Europe and Asia, and {{date back to the}} Early Pleistocene. By the late Villafranchian, S. scrofa largely displaced the related S. strozzii, a large, possibly swamp-adapted suid ancestral to the modern S. verrucosus throughout the Eurasian mainland, restricting it to insular Asia. Its closest <b>wild</b> <b>relative</b> is the bearded pig of Malacca and surrounding islands.|$|E
25|$|Genetic studies led by John Doebley {{identified}} Zea mays ssp. parviglumis, {{native to}} the Balsas River valley in Mexico's southwestern highlands, and also known as Balsas teosinte, as being the crop <b>wild</b> <b>relative</b> teosinte genetically most similar to modern maize. This has been confirmed by further more recent studies, which refined this hypothesis somewhat. Archaeobotanical studies published in 2009 now point to the middle part of the Balsas River valley as the more likely location of early domestication; this river is not very long, so these locations are not very distant. Stone milling tools with maize residue {{have been found in}} an 8,700-years old layer of deposits in a cave not far from Iguala, Guerrero.|$|E
2500|$|Patellifolia {{is related}} to the {{economically}} important cultivated beets (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris, with sugar beet, beetroot, chard and fodder beet). Therefore, Patellifolia is of great interest as Crop <b>wild</b> <b>relative</b> and potential gene donor. They seem to be resistant {{to some of the most}} serious diseases of sugar beets, to leaf spot disease caused by Cercospora beticola, curly top virus, rhizomania, and powdery mildew (Erysiphe polygoni). All three species proved to be highly resistant to the Beet cyst eelworm (Heterodera schachtii). The three species differ in their resistance level, whereas Patellifolia patellaris is not completely immune, but eelworms never develop to maturity in the other two species.|$|E

2500|$|Prussian carp {{remain the}} closest <b>wild</b> <b>relative</b> of the goldfish. Previously, some sources claimed the [...] Crucian carp [...] (Carassius carassius) as the wild {{version of the}} goldfish. However, they are {{differentiated}} by several characteristics. C. auratus have a more pointed snout while the snout of a C. carassius is well rounded. C. a. gibelio often has a grey/greenish colour, while crucian carp are always golden bronze. Juvenile crucian carp have a black spot {{on the base of}} the tail which disappears with age. In C. auratus this tail spot is never present. C. auratus have fewer than 31 scales along the lateral line while crucian carp have 33 scales or more.|$|E
2500|$|The common {{commercial}} {{variety is}} called the California Blackeye; it is pale-colored with a prominent black spot. In the American South there are countless varieties, many of them heirloom, that vary in size from the small lady peas to very large ones, as {{may be seen in}} the state and municipal farmers' markets. [...] The color of the eye may be black, brown, red, pink or green. [...] All the peas are green when freshly shelled and brown or buff when dried. [...] A popular variation of the black-eyed pea is the purple hull pea; it is usually green with a prominent purple or pink spot. The currently accepted botanical name for the black-eyed pea is Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata, although previously it was classified in the genus Phaseolus. [...] Vigna unguiculata subsp. dekindtiana is the <b>wild</b> <b>relative</b> and [...] Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis is the related asparagus bean. Other beans of somewhat similar appearance, such as the frijol ojo de cabra (goat's eye bean) of northern Mexico, are sometimes incorrectly called black-eyed peas, and vice versa.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>relatives</b> {{of crops}} are an {{important}} source of resistance genes against insect pests. However, it is important to identify the accessions of <b>wild</b> <b>relatives</b> of crops with different mechanisms of resistance to broaden the basis and increase the levels of resistance to insect pests. Therefore, we studied the feeding behavior of pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera, which is the most damaging pest of pigeonpea, in relation to biochemical characteristics of the pod surface exudates in a diverse array of germplasm accessions belonging to 12 species of pigeonpea <b>wild</b> <b>relatives.</b> Feeding by H. armigera larvae was significantly lower on the unwashed or water-, methanol-, or hexane-washed pods of Canajus sericeus, C. scarabaeoides, Flemingia bracteata, F. stricta, and Rhynchosia aurea than those of C. acutifolius, C. albicans, C. cajanifolius, C. lineatus, D. ferruginea, P. scariosa, R. bracteata, and the cultivated pigeonpea, C. cajan genotypes, ICPL 87, and ICPL 332, although there were a few exceptions. The methanol-washed pods of <b>wild</b> <b>relatives</b> were less preferred for feeding by the H. armigera larvae than the unwashed pods, but the hexane-washed pods were preferred more than the unwashed pods. The results suggested that methanol extracted the phagostimulants from the pod surface, while hexane removed the antifeedants. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) finger printing of methanol and hexane pod surface extracts showed qualitative and quantitative differences in compounds present on the pod surface of different <b>wild</b> <b>relatives</b> of pigeonpea. Some of the peaks in HPLC profiles were associated with feeding preference of the third-instar larvae of H. armigera. There was considerable diversity in <b>wild</b> <b>relatives</b> of pigeonpea as revealed by principal component analysis based on HPLC fingerprints of pod surface extracts in methanol and hexane, and H. armigera feeding on the pods. Wild pigeonpea accessions with low amounts of phagostimulants and high amounts of antifeedants may be used for introgression of resistance genes into the cultivated pigeonpea to develop varieties with broad-based resistance to H. armigera. There is considerable diversity among the <b>wild</b> <b>relatives</b> of pigeonpea, and the accessions with resistance to pod borer. These can be used to broaden the basis and increase the levels of resistance to H. armigera...|$|R
