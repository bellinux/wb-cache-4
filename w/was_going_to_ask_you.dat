6000|$|... "Oh, yes; Dad's splendid; only, you see, I AM a {{good deal}} younger than he. There was just one thing I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> Are these very Bigwigs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh—I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> Brill—Confound it! I’ve {{forgotten}} what I {{was going to}} say now. I daresay I shall soon think of it. You’re not in a hurry?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'It {{would be}} strange and hard indeed if I did not,' said Clennam, 'when {{you are all}} so forgiving. What I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> was, have you thought of that Miss Wade?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gale, I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you {{a rather}} curious thing. Will you do it, without asking why?" [...] Colonel Shepherd said, quietly.|$|R
