Russo specifically found a Synthi AKS synthesizer for the show, as that instrument was used during the making of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, one of Hawley's favorite albums and what Russo described as [...] "the sound of schizophrenia, the sound of mental illness in the ’70s.

Taylor, an obscure great orator. The other day in Dublin I overheard a man murmuring to another one of his speeches as I might some Elizabethan lyric that is in my very bones. It was delivered at some Dublin debate, some College society perhaps. The Lord Chancellor had spoken with balanced unemotional sentences now self-complacent, now in derision. Taylor began hesitating and stopping for words, but after speaking very badly for a little, straightened his figure and spoke as out of a dream: [...] "I am carried to another age, a nobler court, and another Lord Chancellor is speaking. I am at the court of the first Pharaoh." [...] Thereupon he put into the mouth of that Egyptian all his audience had listened to, but now it was spoken to the children of Israel. [...] "If you have any spirituality as you boast, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> our great empire to spread it through the world, why still cling to that beggarly nationality of yours? what are its history and its works weighed with those of Egypt." [...] Then his voice changed and sank: [...] "I see a man {{at the edge of the}} crowd; he is standing listening there, but he will not obey;" [...] and then with his voice rising to a cry, [...] "had he obeyed he would never have come down the mountain carrying in his arms the tables of the Law in the language of the outlaw." ...|$|E
