25|$|The {{surface tension}} of a watery surface (the <b>water-air</b> interface) {{tends to make}} that surface shrink. When that surface is curved {{as it is in}} the alveoli of the lungs, the {{shrinkage}} of the surface decreases the diameter of the alveoli. The more acute the curvature of the <b>water-air</b> interface the greater the tendency for the alveolus to collapse. This has three effects. Firstly the surface tension inside the alveoli resists expansion of the alveoli during inhalation (i.e. it makes the lung stiff, or non-compliant). Surfactant reduces the surface tension and therefore makes the lungs more compliant, or less stiff, than if it were not there. Secondly, the diameters of the alveoli increase and decrease during the breathing cycle. This means that the alveoli have a greater tendency to collapse (i.e. cause atelectasis) at the end of exhalation that at the end of inhalation. Since surfactant floats on the watery surface, its molecules are more tightly packed together when the alveoli shrink during exhalation. This causes them to have a greater surface tension-lowering effect when the alveoli are small than when they are large (as at the end of inhalation, when the surfactant molecules are more widely spaced). The tendency for the alveoli to collapse is therefore almost the same at the end of exhalation as at the end of inhalation. Thirdly, the surface tension of the curved watery layer lining the alveoli tends to draw water from the lung tissues into the alveoli. Surfactant reduces this danger to negligible levels, and keeps the alveoli dry.|$|E

The corresponding thermodynamic variables for the surfactant system are, surface pressure (...) , surface area (A) and number of surfactant molecules (N). This system behaves similar to a gas in a container. The density of surfactant molecules as well as the surface pressure increases upon reducing the surface area A ('compression' of the 'gas'). Further compression of the surfactant molecules on the surface shows behavior similar to phase transitions. The ‘gas’ gets compressed into ‘liquid’ and ultimately into a perfectly closed packed array of the surfactant molecules on the surface corresponding to a ‘solid’ state.|$|E

The overall refraction is then equivalent to the refraction through an upright hexagonal plate crystal when the rotational averaging is taken into account. A colorful artificial circumhorizontal arc will then appear projected on the wall. Using a spherical projection screen instead will result in a closer analogy to the natural halo counterpart. Other artificial halos can be created by similar means.|$|E

50|$|Bullfrogs are voracious, opportunistic, ambush predators that prey on {{any small}} animal they can {{overpower}} and stuff down their throats.

These studies revealed the bullfrog's diet to be unique among North American ranids in the inclusion of a large percentage of aquatic animals, such as fish, tadpoles, ram's horn snails, and dytiscid beetles. Bullfrogs can capture large, strong prey because of the powerful grip of their jaws after the initial ranid tongue strike. The bullfrog is able to make allowance for light refraction at the <b>water-air</b> interface by striking at a position posterior to the target's perceived location. The comparative ability of bullfrogs to capture submerged prey, compared to that of the green frog, leopard frog, and wood frog (L. clamitans, L. pipiens, and L. sylvaticus, respectively) was also demonstrated in laboratory experiments.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparing}} {{wireless technologies}} subsea radio waves prefer shallow water and can cross the air/water/seabed boundaries easily. Subsea radio communication is generally limited to under 50m through seawater. Subsea radio waves are unaffected by turbidity, salinity and pressure gradients {{and also has}} a notable difference between acoustic and optical technologies in that radio waves can pass through the <b>water-air</b> and water-seabed boundaries easily. Subsea acoustics are efficient at long-range of up to 20 km and have relatively low power consumption for their range. Acoustic communication systems generally perform poorly in shallow water and complex environments and has a limited bandwidth. Subsea optical has an ultra-high bandwidth and a very short range. Subsea optical communication does not cross the water/air boundary and is susceptible to turbidity. Most under water sensor networks choose acoustics as the medium for wireless transmission. Electromagnetic waves offer great merits for transmission in special under water environments. Applications for subsea wireless sensor technologies can include subsea wireless sensor networks (WSN) for production monitoring.

50|$|M. Nosonovsky and B. Bhushan {{studied the}} effect of unitary (non-hierarchical) {{structures}} of micro and nano roughness, and hierarchical structures (micro roughness covered with nano roughness). They found that hierarchical structure was not only necessary for a high contact angle but essential for {{the stability of the}} water-solid and <b>water-air</b> interfaces (the composite interface). Due to an external perturbation, a standing capillary wave can form at the liquid-air interface. If the amplitude of the capillary wave is greater than the height of the asperity, the liquid can touch the valley between the asperities; and if the angle under which the liquid comes in contact with the solid is greater than h0, it is energetically profitable for the liquid to fill the valley. The effect of capillary waves is more pronounced for small asperities with heights comparable to the wave amplitude. For example, in the case of unitary roughness, where the amplitude of asperity is very low. This is why the likelihood of instability of a unitary interface will be very high.|$|E
