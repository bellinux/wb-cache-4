It was conjectured that the bubble type of breakdown {{can be viewed as}} an axisymmetric wave traveling upstream in a primarily columnar vortex flow.

The stability of some axisymmetric <b>wavy</b> <b>flows</b> to three dimensional disturbances, viewing the amplitude of the wave as a bifurcation parameter is examined. The stability of a set of related columnar vortex flows, constructed by taking the two dimensional flow at a single axial location and extending it throughout the domain without variation, is investigated.

40|$|The {{development}} of the wavy mode of Taylor vortices in the flow between a rotating inner cylinder and a stationary outer cylinder has been investigated by visual observations using a stroboscopic technique and by inner cylinder torque measurements. Radius ratios of 0. 874, 0. 911, 0. 950 and 0. 975 have been tested for the concentric and eccentric cylinder cases. The stability of <b>wavy</b> mode <b>flow</b> {{has been found to}} decrease with increasing radius ratio and/or increasing eccentricity. Observations of the flow suggested that the wavy mode can be classified into three regimes called, respectively, the primary, transitional and secondary modes. The three regimes were most easily identified using a radius ratio of 0. 911 and concentric cylinders. In this case, the onset of the transitional state (so called because of the tendency for the circumferential wave number to change continually even at particular constant speeds) was found to be particularly violent, completely destroying the well defined nature of the primary wavy mode. Rather surprisingly, this quasi-turbulent regime of <b>wavy</b> mode <b>flow</b> was found to give way to the more regular secondary wavy mode as the speed of the inner cylinder was increased. Non-uniqueness is shown to be an important feature of <b>wavy</b> mode <b>flow.</b> Results are presented showing that circumferential wave number changes can often be detected by torque measurements. In particular, the onset of the transitional state results in a sudden reduction in the required driving torque, the magnitude of which is considerably influenced by the stability of the primary <b>wavy</b> mode <b>flow.</b> Friction coefficient characteristics derived from the torque measurement results are used to deduce a general relationship incorporating the effects of the eccentricity and radius ratios...|$|R

40|$|The {{one-dimensional}} two-fluid {{model is}} the basis for the description of the transport of mass, momentum and energy in the thermal-hydraulic codes used for nuclear reactor safety analysis. Unlike other physical transport models, the one-dimensional two-fluid model suffers from the possibility of being ill-posed as an initial-boundary value problem depending on the flow conditions and the relevant physical closure laws. Typically, the ill-posedness is dealt with through either excessive numerical damping or the addition of unphysical closure laws designed {{for the sole purpose of}} hyperbolization. Unfortunately both methods eliminate the instability along with the problem of ill-posedness causing the model to undoubtedly lose some of its inherent dynamic capability. ^ In this work, a one-dimensional two-fluid model for horizontal or slightly inclined stratified flow is developed. Higher order physical models that are often neglected, such as surface tension and axial viscous stress, are retained for their short-wavelength stability properties. Characteristic, dispersion and nonlinear analyses are performed to demonstrate that the resulting model is linearly well-posed and nonlinearly well-behaved. While it has been known that higher-order differential terms are able to regularize the short-wavelength problem of ill-posedness without removing the long-wavelength instability, the literature is relatively silent on the consequences of using a model under linearly unstable conditions. Using carefully selected conditions in an idealized infinite domain, it is demonstrated for the first time that the one-dimensional two-fluid model exhibits chaotic behavior in addition to limit cycles and asymptotic stability. The chaotic behavior is a consequence of the long-wavelength linear instability (energy source) the nonlinearity (energy transfer) and the short-wavelength dissipation (energy sink). ^ Since the model is chaotic, solutions exhibit a sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This appears to result in non-convergence when particular solutions at a specific time are compared using different numerical discretizations. However, it is shown that the chaotic solutions exhibit an invariant spectrum in wavenumber space that can be used to assess the convergence of solutions. This concept is applied to a Kelvin-Helmholtz experiment of kerosene and liquid water in a tilted channel whereby many slightly different simulations are run and averaged to determine the mean behavior. Comparisons to experimental data are favorable; especially considering the limitations of applying a one-dimensional model to a dynamic simulation of wavy channel flow. ^ When the analysis is extended to consider air-water flows, several additional challenges are encountered related to the long-wavelength inviscid Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, which is the instability inherent to the one-dimensional two-fluid model. The transition from stratified to <b>wavy</b> <b>flow</b> is significantly over-predicted, i. e., requires a larger velocity to become unstable than observed experimentally. The wave sheltering model of Brauner and Maron (1993) is included in the interfacial shear model and calibrated for flow in a rectangular channel. However, when the unstable flow regime is simulated a <b>wavy</b> <b>flow</b> pattern does not develop as in the liquid-liquid case. Due to the near absence of inertia in the lighter gas phase, viscosity and surface tension are unable to bound the growth of disturbances within the physical limitations of the channel geometry. Transitions to regions of single phase flow result, indicating a slug flow pattern where <b>wavy</b> <b>flow</b> should exist. A novel approach is taken where the instability mechanism, here the sheltering force, is adjusted based on local geometric conditions, namely the void fraction gradient. Comparison to data shows promising results, although a large degree of uncertainty in such an approach remains due to a lack of local experimental data. ...|$|E
