40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{association}} of maternal physical activity before and during pregnancy with academic performance in youth. Methods: This study included 1868 youth (6 – 18 years) and their mothers. Mothers recalled their physical activity before and during pregnancy. Mothers were categorized into four groups: “remained active”, “became inactive”, “became active” and “remained inactive”. Academic performance was assessed through school records. Results: Boys <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> practiced physical activity before or during pregnancy had significantly higher scores in academic performance indicators independently of physical activity, fitness, current body mass index (BMI) and birthweight than those <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> did not practice physical activity before or during pregnancy (all p[*] 3 ̆c [*] 0. 05). In addition, boys <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> remained active had higher scores in all academic indicators (ranging from + 0. 358 to + 0. 543) than boys <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> remained inactive.

40|$|This paper investigates whether mothers {{participation}} in post-compulsory education impacts on childrens relative inequalities across four developmental outcomes. The empirical analysis uses information from children born in 1958 in Britain. Mothers of the 1958 British cohort {{were affected by}} the 1947 school leaving age reform, which increased the age of compulsory schooling from 14 to 15 years. We selected the first-born cohort members <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> were born in 1933 and 1934 and <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> completed compulsory schooling only. We found that the additional year of maternal schooling {{was significantly associated with}} relative improvements in mathematics attainment for their children, but no significant differences for reading or behavioural outcomes. The impact on mathematics was mainly for boys. These results suggest wider dispersion in mathematics attainment between sons <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> benefited from the additional year of schooling in 1947 and those <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> did not...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article {{examines}} the influence of maternal status, socioeconomic status of the household, and household composition on the mobility of children aged 0 – 14 in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, from 1999 to 2008. Using data from the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System, we found that children <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> were temporary migrants, living elsewhere, or dead had higher odds of moving than children <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> were coresident. Older children and children living in richer households faced lower odds of mobility. For children <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> were coresident, there was no effect of maternal substitutes on child mobility. However, among children <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> were temporary migrants or living else-where, the presence of prime-aged and elderly females lowered the odds of mobility. For maternal orphans, the presence of elderly women in the household lowered their odds of mobility. The results underscore the importance of examining {{the conditions under which}} children move in order to strengthen service delivery targeted at safeguarding children’s well-being...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) among infants <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> were exposed to antidepressants in the third trimester of pregnancy compared to the prevalence among infants <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> were not exposed to antidepressants in the third trimester. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using the automated databases of four health plans participating in the HMO Research Network Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics. Women who delivered an infant in a hospital from 1 January 1996 through 31 December 2000 were identified. The administrative databases were used to identify full-term infants <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> received an antidepressant during the third trimester of pregnancy and unexposed infants <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> did not receive an antidepressant during the third trimester. Hospitalization data were used to identify diagnoses or procedure codes potentially indicative of PPHN. RESULTS: Among 1104 infants exposed to antidepressants in the third trimester and a matched sample of 1104 unexposed infants, five infants were classified by the expert reviewers as having PPHN. Among those infants <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> were exposed to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the third trimester, the prevalence of PPHN was 2. 14 per 1000 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 26, 7. 74), while the prevalence among infants <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> were not exposed was 2. 72 per 1000 (95 %CI 0. 56, 7. 93). CONCLUSIONS: We did not find an association between SSRI use in late pregnancy and PPHN. Limitations of the present study, including {{the small number of}} confirmed cases, suggest further research in this area may be warranted...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} rate of epilepsy {{is between}} 4 - 10 / 1000 {{people in general}} population. It is a well-known fact that antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used during pregnancy increase the rate of congenital malformations. However, {{there is not enough}} information about the electrophysiological effects of AEDs. In this study, 127 children <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> have epilepsy and 33 children <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> are healthy, were included. Twenty nine mothers did not use AEDs whereas 98 patients used AEDs during their pregnancy. Demographic features of both mothers and children, as well as epilepsy characteristics of mothers are recorded. The EEG examinations were done awake and/or during sleep. The children <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> have epilepsy had higher rate of EEG abnormalities and the ratio was statistically significant. EEG abnormalities were higher in the children <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> had polytherapy (% 50) than in the group with monotherapy (% 31, 7). EEG abnormalities were mostly seen (% 47) in children <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> used VPA. Children born of patients with epilepsy who did not use folic acid with AEDs had a higher rate of EEG abnormalities and this ratio was statistically significant. It was also observed that children, <b>whose</b> <b>mothers</b> have generalized EEG abnormalities, have generalized EEG abnormalities more frequently. It is necessary to examine patients who used AEDs during pregnancy {{not only in terms of}} congenital malformations but also electrophysiological effects and to advise taking folic acid. Examining children who are born under the effect of AEDs electrophysiologically in the years following their birth may provide predictions about whether the effects of AEDs...|$|R
