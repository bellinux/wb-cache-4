500|$|In the semifinal, the Gliders had to {{beat the}} reigning champions, Team USA, {{in front of a}} small crowd of 4,428 at the North Greenwich Arena. Team USA had first {{possession}} and earned the first points of the game, but both teams' shooting was poor, and the score was only 10–12 at quarter time. The second quarter started with Merritt scoring twice to give Australia the lead 14–12. Team USA turned the ball over the Gliders several times, but they were unable to capitalise on their strong defence, leaving the score tied at 26–26 at half time. In the third quarter, an early goal by Gauci from outside the paint gave the Gliders the lead. A series of steals gave the Gliders additional shots, most of which they missed, but Team USA gave up a series of turnovers, and their shooting was worse than their rivals', resulting in a 10–0 run by the Gliders. Team USA were unable to score at all until the last minute of the quarter. A hurried goal with seconds to go by Hill saw the Gliders leading 38–28. Team USA would ultimately post 28 turnovers to Australia's 17, and the Gliders would score 12 points from turnovers to Team USA's three. Triscari warned his players, [...] "They will come back! <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> them!" ...|$|E

One or two men are in each forward sap keeping a look out; the rest sleep, a motionless sleep, in the earthy shelter pits that have been scooped out.

6000|$|On we tramped {{silently as}} shades {{through the night}} and in the heavy sand. The karoo bushes caught our feet and retarded us, and the sand worked into our veldtschoons and Good's shooting-boots, so that every few miles <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> and empty them; but still the night kept fairly cool, though the {{atmosphere}} was thick and heavy, giving a sort of creamy feel to the air, and we made fair progress.

But {{not so much as a}} whimper escaped from Polly Ann. I have often told her since that the sorest trial she had was the guard she kept on her tongue,--a hardship indeed for one of Irish inheritance.

Also he arranged with them to come down into Natal, so as to be ready to people it as soon as he received the formal cession of the country from Dingaan.
