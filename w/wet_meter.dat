40|$|Several {{definitions}} of wet gas {{have been proposed}} within the Oil and Gas industry. However, in order to choose the best strategy to <b>meter</b> one’s <b>wet</b> gas production, one must have {{a clear understanding of}} what wet gas is. So far, efforts appear to have gone awry, with companies deciding how to <b>meter</b> <b>wet</b> gas before defining what it is. This has led to companies employing existing metering solutions and strategies and characterising wet gas as a stream that can be measured with available techniques. The concept of “wet gas metering” can apply to gas condensate fields, high gas-oil ratio (GOR) fields and wet gases. Produced streams of <b>wet</b> gas are <b>metered</b> for a variety of reasons: field economics, reservoir management, allocation issues and metering the produced gas only or metering the liquid and the gas, depending on whether one is selling one phase or both. Depending on the specific requirements, different metering accuracies may be required and different <b>wet</b> gas <b>metering</b> solutions sought. At present, a single definition of wet gas for Oil and Gas applications does not exist (and it may never exist), so a unique metering solution for all types of wet gas may be impossible to achieve. Therefore, a critical approach must be taken to select a <b>wet</b> gas <b>meter</b> for each specific application...|$|R

The effect of velocity and pressure distributions in <b>wet</b> gas <b>metering</b> using slotted orifice flow meter was clearly understand by fully developed a turbulent condition in the 1. 6 in long horizontal pipe line equipped with slotted orifices having a 3 ratio of 0. 40. Air mass flow rate and volume fraction were varied in the range from 0. 33 kg/s to 0. 80 kg/s and 0. 90 to 1. 00, respectively. Pressure was also varied in the range of 240000 - 360000 Pa. The slotted orifice results were also compared with the standard orifice with the same 3 ratio. Gambit 2. 4. 6 mesh generator was employed to perform all geometry generation and meshing. The relatively higher over-reading values obtained in this work was consistent with the results of that for a slotted orifice, a low P ratio was more sensitive to the liquid presence in the stream and hence was preferable for <b>wet</b> gas <b>metering.</b> Total mass flows for the wet gas get from the simulations were varied from the 0. 3376 kg/s to 0. 8000 kg/s. In conclusion, the numerical results indicate that pressure drop and static pressure recovery was better with the slotted orifice, and hence was preferable for <b>wet</b> gas <b>metering.</b> Moreover, with the rectangular slots, the static pressure recovery improves marginally as the aspect ratio increases. It was also found that the slotted orifice was more sensitive to wet gas flow compared to the standard orifice...|$|R
40|$|Most {{two-phase}} {{applications for}} Coriolis mass flow metering are for low Gas Void Fraction (GVF) conditions, i. e. where the process fluid is essentially liquid with relatively {{low levels of}} entrained air or gas. There are particular challenges associated with <b>metering</b> <b>wet</b> gas, where the GVF exceeds 95 %. Established <b>wet</b> gas <b>metering</b> techniques are typically based on a differential pressure-type device (for example an orifice plate or V-cone). It is well-known that such devices over-read compared to a dry gas calibration; equations to correct the reading are available if the degree of gas "wetness" is known. For Coriolis mass flow <b>metering</b> of <b>wet</b> gas, two approaches are described. The natural extension of the low GVF techniques is to map the observed mass flow and density readings onto estimates of the flow rates of the gas and liquid components. The alternative {{is to use the}} Coriolis meter to estimate the degree of gas "wetness" (e. g. the Lockhart-Martinelli number) and to apply a conventional correlation (e. g.

40|$|Understanding how swirl flows can {{be applied}} to {{processes}} in {{the oil and gas industry}} and how problems might hinder them, are the focus of this thesis. Three application areas were identified: <b>wet</b> gas <b>metering,</b> liquid loading in gas wells and erosion at pipe bends due to sand transport. For all three areas, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed. Where available, experimental data were used to validate the CFD results. As a part of this project, a new test loop was conceived for the investigation of sand erosion in pipes. The results obtained from CFD simulations of two-phase (air-water) flow through a pipe with a swirl-inducing device show that generating swirl flow leads to separation of the phases and creates distinct flow patterns within the pipe. This effect can be used in each of the three application areas of interest. For the <b>wet</b> gas <b>metering</b> application, a chart was generated, which suggests the location of maximum liquid deposition downstream of the swirling device used in the ANUMET meter. This will allow taking pressure and phase fraction measurements (from which the liquid flow rate can be determined) where they are most representative of the flow pattern assumed for the ANUMET calculation algorithms. For the liquid loading application, which was taken as an upscaling of the dimensions investigated for the <b>wet</b> gas <b>metering</b> application, the main focus was on the liquid hold-up. This parameter is defined as the ratio of the flowing area occupied by liquid to the total area. Results obtained with CFD simulations showed that as the water rate increases, the liquid hold-up increases, implying a more effective liquid removal. Thus, it was concluded that the introduction of a swirler can help unload liquid from a gas well, although no investigation was carried out on the persistance of the swirl motion downstream of the device. For the third and final application, the erosion at pipe bends due to sand transport, the main focus was to check the erosion rate on the pipe wall with and without the introduction of a swirler. The erosion rate was predicted by CFD simulations. The flow that was investigated consisted of a liquid phase with solid particles suspended in it. The CFD results showed a significant reduction in erosion rate at the pipe walls when the swirler was introduced, which could translate into an extended working life for the pipe. An extensive literature review performed on this topic, complemented by the CFD simulations, showed the need for a dedicated multiphase test loop for the investigation of sand erosion in horizontal pipes and at bends. The design of a facility of this type is included in this thesis. The results obtained with this work are very encouraging and provide a broad perspective of applications of swirl flows and CFD for the oil and gas industry...|$|R

The Venturi meter is a favoured device for the metering of the unprocessed wet natural gas production flows. Various combinations of techniques have been employed in annular gas-liquid two phase flows to measure the flow parameters (e. g. liquid film thickness, gas volume fraction and the phase flow rates).

When Ca was varied in the range 0. 2 → 5, λA, trans and λA, min were in the range 1. 40 → 1. 29 and 1. 20 → 1. 18 respectively. These values compare very well with theoretical predictions. The air entrainment speeds V*M {{were found to be}} similar to the corresponding speeds V*plunging, measured in plunging tape flow but the cascade speeds V**M can be smaller or larger depending on λA. This led to exploring hydrodynamic assistance and drawing an analogy with curtain coating, which was supported by the data. It was also observed that cascade occurred in the pre-metered regime because the dynamic wetting line XD, moves near the minimum gap position just as in reverse roll coating. Indeed the cascade speeds conform to correlations developed for reverse roll coating. Finally the study gives data on XD, and compares them with theoretical predictions. The agreement in this case is only qualitative and this points to deficiencies in current modeling of the dynamic wetting region...|$|R

In this thesis, research has been done on designing a novel <b>wet</b> gas flow <b>metering</b> technique, which combines a Venturi with conductance sensors at the inlet and throat to measure the gas and the water flow rates and gas mass flow rate in vertical annular (wet gas) flows. Two ring conductance sensors at the inlet of the Venturi were used to measure the film velocity by cross correlation, one of the inlet ring conductance sensors was used to measure the film thickness and the inlet gas volume fraction. A ring conductance sensor at the throat was used to measure the gas volume fraction at the Venturi throat. A digital level sensor was also used to measure the film thickness (and the gas volume fraction) at the inlet of the Venturi. The reason for measuring the film thickness, the film velocity, the gas volume fraction at the inlet and the throat of the Venturi was to determine the gas and water flow rate and the gas mass flow rate in annular wet gas two phase flow using a variety of mathematical models of Venturis. This work included both static ‘bench’ and flow loop experiments. In the flow loop experiments, which were limited to air-water two-phase flow, the test section included a Venturi meter with a 50 mm inlet diameter with conductance sensors at inlet and the throat. Reference measurements of the water and air were made with a turbine flow meter and a variable area flow meter respectively.

The total figure for MFM installations worldwide is now over 1, 800. Field applications include production optimisation, <b>wet</b> gas <b>metering,</b> mobile well testing and production allocation. However, MFM has not yet achieved its full potential. Despite an impressive improvement in the reliability of sensors and mechanical parts (particularly for subsea installations) over the past few years, there remain unresolved questions regarding the accuracy and range of applicability of today's MFM technology. There is also a tendency to forget the complexity of multiphase flow and to evaluate the overall performance of a MFM as a "black box", often neglecting all the possible uncertainties that are inherent in each individual measurement solutions. This paper reviews the inherent limitations of some classical MFM techniques. It highlights the impact of instruments rangeability, empirical correlations for pressure drop devices and fluids characterisation on the error propagation analysis in the "black box". It also provides a comprehensive review of wet gas definitions for the oil and gas industry. Several {{attempts have been made to}} define "wet gas" for the purpose of metering streams at high gas-volume-fractions, but a single definition of wet gas still does not exist. The measurement of multiphase flows presents unique challenges that have not yet been fully resolved. However, the challenges are exciting and the authors have no doubts that new milestones will soon be set in this area. Today's MFM technology has already become one piece of the optimised production system jigsaw. MFM has succeeded in fitting with other technologies toward global field-wide solutions. The ideal MFM of the future is one that provides unambiguous measurements of key parameters from which the flow rates can be deduced independently from flow regimes and fluid properties.

This {{means that there}} are currently no technologies capable of monitoring separation performance. It is in Statoil s interest to measure and monitor the separation performance, since too high LVFs can damage downstream process equipment and {{increase the risk of}} hydrate formation. This thesis performs an early study of a new technology for separation performance monitoring. It is based on sound measurements and the influence of liquid on sound wave propagation, i. e. acoustic damping. Other studies have showed that introducing liquid in a gas increase the attenuation of the sound amplitude. Two different design concepts were investigated: a corrugated pipe and a smooth pipe with a loud speaker. The corrugated pipe is capable of generating sound without external sources. When gas flows through a corrugated pipe, it induces vortex shedding in the cavities. At high enough flow velocities, the frequency of the vortex shedding couples with the pipe s natural frequency. This results in a high tonal sound, or whistling. A phenomenon usually dubbed "singing riser" in {{the oil and gas industry}} as it occurs in the flexible risers transporting hydrocarbons from the seabed to the sea surface. The smooth pipe, however, has no self-generating sound source and hence a loud speaker is needed to create sound. The design concepts are approached theoretically, by modelling and by experiment. A one-dimensional flow-acoustics model was simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics. The model failed to return realistic sound pressure levels but captured the physical phenom- ena occurring in a corrugated pipe well. For instance, it predicted the first mode of the pipe s natural frequency accurately. The two designs concepts were tested experimentally for different flow rates and different liquid rates. The experiments strongly indicated an added acoustic damping due to liquid, even for LVFs much lower than 1 · 10 − 4, and thus the main principle of the technology was supported. However, the experiment could not reveal any significant advantages in measurement accuracy for either a smooth or a corrugated design...|$|R

They convert primary production directly into fish tissue. Grazing of algae by herbivores can also alter marine communities by impacting the growth, recruitment, and mortality of algae. By grazing algae, herbivorous fishes therefore serve as a vital link between primary producers and secondary consumers in aquatic communities. The halfmoon (Medialuna californiensis: Kyphosidae), is one of the few herbivorous fishes in the temperate waters of Southern California. Specimens were taken from various coastal locations around southern California including three of the southern Channel Islands (Santa Catalina, San Clemente and Anacapa) from 2005 - 2007 to examine age and growth, gut contents, and secondary productivity of this abundant species. The von Bertalanffy parameters for all the aged halfmoons based on lengths were L??? = 290. 5, K = 0. 5581 and to = - 0. 0091. Most adults examined were two to four years-old, indicative of a fast growing, short-lived species. Stomachs contained all three macroalgal phyla and also animals like shrimp, amphipods, bryozoans, barnacles and mollusks, which may also be important to their diet. Monthly visual transect data indicated an estimate in productivity to be 5. 3 grams of <b>wet</b> weight per <b>meter</b> squared per year of halfmoons using size classes at three specific reef sites on Catalina Island. The life history and productivity of this common herbivore contributes to the understanding of kelp forest communities and the management of species...|$|R

Utilizou-se o Ãon potÃssio, como traÃador, para se determinar a uniformidade de distribuiÃÃo da Ãgua e fertilizante na rede de irrigaÃÃo e no solo (formaÃÃo do bulbo Ãmido) e a conseqÃente capacidade do equipamento em satisfazer Ãs necessidades hÃdricas e nutricionais da cultura de coqueiro explorada na Ãrea. As amostras da soluÃÃo foram coletadas na saÃda do tanque de fertilizante e em 64 pontos das linhas laterais com ramificaÃÃes, nas duas unidades operacionais selecionadas. A unidade operacional I situava-se prÃxima ao cabeÃal de controle (condiÃÃo hidrÃulica mais favorÃvel) enquanto a unidade operacional II ficava na posiÃÃo mais distante da Ãrea (condiÃÃo hidrÃulica menos favorÃvel). As amostras de solo para determinaÃÃo do bulbo Ãmido foram coletadas atÃ a distÃncia de 1, 0 m para ambos os lados do emissor e atÃ 1, 40 m de profundidade, com incrementos de 20 cm, tanto no sentido {{vertical}} como horizontal. O projeto de irrigaÃÃo original apresenta falhas de concepÃÃo (como vazÃo, tempo de aplicaÃÃo e posicionamento inadequado dos emissores), com reflexos negativos na distribuiÃÃo da Ãgua no solo e no desempenho da cultura. O manejo do sistema tambÃm nÃo tem sido efetuado de maneira adequada (com emissores deslocados de posiÃÃo e nÃo uso do equipamento injetor do fertilizantes), agravando ainda mais as falhas iniciais do projeto e prejudicando a cultura. Os bons Ãndices de distribuiÃÃo da Ãgua obtidos para o sistema (Coeficiente de Uniformidade de Christiansen â CUC mÃdio de 94, 07 % na unidade I e 92, 74 % na unidade II e Pattern Efficience - P. E mÃdio de 89, 81 % na unidade I e 88, 62 % na unidade II) nÃo refletem, necessariamente, boa distribuiÃÃo de Ãgua no solo da Ãrea como ficou patente no caso em estudo. A distribuiÃÃo de fertilizante no sistema e no solo,acompanha, aproximadamente, a distribuiÃÃo de Ãgua, sendo, portanto, vÃlido afirmar que a mÃ distribuiÃÃo da Ãgua no solo seria tambÃm acompanhada por uma mÃ distribuiÃÃo de fertilizantes, se o sistema estivesse sendo rotineiramente usado para fertirrigaÃÃo. A pluviosidade relativamente elevada (1. 107, 88 mm/ ano) na Ãrea em que foi realizado o trabalho tende a amenizar os efeitos negativos mencionados nos itens anteriores. A {{field study}} was conducted at the seacoast of Itarema, CearÃ, Brazil, to evaluate water and fertilizer distribution in the soil of a coconut plantation. The potassium ion {{was used as a}} tracer to determine uniformity of distribution of water and fertilizer by the irrigation system and predict water and fertilizer distribution within the soil profile. Analysis of the efectiveness of the system in satisfying the water and fertilizer needs of the crop was also done. Samples of the solution water plus fertilizer were collected at the exit of the fertilizer tank and at 64 different places (emitters) on the lateral lines, representing the most and the least favorable hydraulic conditions within the system. Soil samples, to trace the limits of the wet bulbs, were collected at points covering a section of the <b>wet</b> volume, one <b>meter</b> on both sides and 1. 40 m of depth {{from the surface of the}} soil, at 0. 20 m increments. In conclusion, it was found that there were misconceptions in the original project concerning discharge, time of application and positioning of the emitters in relation to each coconut plant. The management of the system was also found to be inadequate, with a great number of emitters displaced from the ideal location and in lack of use of the fertilizer injection equipment. Although good water distribution indexes were found (above 85 % for CUC and PE) for the system, the water distribution in the soil was found to be poor, as indicated by the wet bulb graphs. As the fertilizer distribution follows, approximately, the same patterns for the water distribution, it is valid to predict that fertilizer distribution within the soil of the area would have also been poor, if the fertilizer injection device had been used. A relatively high average annual rainfall on the area tends to reduce the adverse effects of the misconceptions and bad management of the irrigation system, although the actual productivity of the plantation is far from predicted...|$|R
40|$|The power {{industry}} in the U. S. is faced with meeting regulations to reduce the emissions of mercury compounds from coal-fired plants. Injecting a sorbent such as powdered activated carbon (PAC) into the flue gas {{represents one of the}} simplest and most mature approaches to controlling mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers. The purpose of this test program was to evaluate the long-term mercury removal capability, long-term mercury emissions variability, and operating and maintenance (O&M) costs associated with sorbent injection on a configuration being considered for many new plants. Testing was conducted by ADA Environmental Solutions (ADA) at Rocky Mountain Power’s (RMP) Hardin Station through funding provided by DOE/NETL, RMP, and other industry partners. The Hardin Station is a new plant rated at 121 MW gross that was first brought online in April of 2006. Hardin fires a Powder River Basin (PRB) coal and is configured with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for NOx control, a spray dryer absorber (SDA) for SO 2 control, and a fabric filter (FF) for particulate control. Based upon previous testing at PRB sites with SCRs, very little additional mercury oxidation from the SCR was expected at Hardin. In addition, based upon results from DOE/NETL Phase II Round I testing at Holcomb Station and results from similarly configured sites, low native mercury removal was expected across the SDA and FF. The main goal of this project was met—sorbent injection was used to economically and effectively achieve 90 % mercury control as measured from the air heater (AH) outlet to the stack for a period of ten months. This goal was achieved with DARCO® Hg-LH, Calgon FLUEPAC®-MC PLUS and ADA Power PAC PREMIUM brominated activated carbons at nominal loadings of 1. 5 – 2. 5 lb/MMacf. An economic analysis determined the twenty-year levelized cost to be 0. 87 mills/kW-hr, or $ 15, 000 /lb Hg removed. No detrimental effects on other equipment or plant operations were observed. The results of this project also filled a data gap for plants firing PRB coal and configured with an SCR, SDA, and FF, as many new plants are being designed today. Another goal of the project was to evaluate, on a short-term basis, the mercury removal associated with coal additives and coal blending with western bituminous coal. The additive test showed that, at this site, the coal additive known as KNX was affective at increasing mercury removal while decreasing sorbent usage. Coal blending was conducted with two different western bituminous coals, and West Elk coal increased native capture from nominally 10 % to 50 %. Two additional co-benefits were discovered at this site. First, it was found that native capture increased from nominally 10 % at full load to 50 % at low load. The effect is believed to be due to an increase in mercury oxidation across the SCR caused by a corresponding decrease in ammonia injection when the plant reduces load. Less ammonia means more active oxidation sites in the SCR for the mercury. The second co-benefit was the finding that high ammonia concentrations can {{have a negative impact on}} mercury removal by powdered activated carbon. For a period of time, the plant operated with a high excess of ammonia injection necessitated by the plugging of one-third of the SCR. Under these conditions and at high load, the mercury control system could not maintain 90 % removal even at the maximum feed rate of 3. 5 lb/MMacf (pounds of mercury per million actual cubic feet). The plant was able to demonstrate that mercury removal was directly related to the ammonia injection rate in a series of tests where the ammonia rate was decreased, causing a corresponding increase in mercury removal. Also, after the SCR was refurbished and ammonia injection levels returned to normal, the mercury removal performance also returned to normal. Another goal of the project was to install a commercial-grade activated carbon injection (ACI) system and integrate it with new-generation continuous emissions monitors for mercury (Hg-CEMs) to allow automatic feedback control on outlet mercury emissions. This was accomplished and the plant can now be operated to control carbon injection based on either the overall mercury removal or an outlet mercury emission rate. By integrating these systems, it was determined that the plant could reduce powdered activated carbon consumption, especially at low load, because, at Hardin, native mercury capture increases from less than 20 % to about 50 % at low load and the carbon injection rate can be decreased accordingly. Currently, the plant is operating to automatically control emissions to below 0. 9 lb/TBtu (pounds of mercury per million British thermal units) at carbon loadings of 0. 5 to 1. 5 lb/MMacf. During the final phase of the Long-Term test, the ACI system was operated by plant personnel. The estimated O&M cost for a single Hg-CEM system is $ 15, 500 /yr. The Hg-CEMs performed well throughout the project. This project began shortly after Thermo Fisher first offered the Mercury Freedom System™ on a commercial basis and progressed though several iterations, improvements, and upgrades to the hardware and software. Indeed, there was a ten-fold increase in the precision and accuracy of the units during the course of the project due to several successful upgrades. In their present condition, the Hg-CEMs measure mercury to a precision of about ± 0. 05 μg/wscm (micrograms of mercury per <b>wet</b> standard cubic <b>meter</b> of gas), and only require occasional fine-tuning of the calibration coefficients. The quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) protocol required to keep the units operating at their optimal performance was also developed and perfected during the course of the project. ADA Environmental Solutions (ADA) developed a daily calibration procedure that surpasses the requirements specified in the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), and a weekly diagnostic program that ensures that the systems are operating properly and receive the necessary maintenance. For the most part, the systems passed the daily, weekly, and quarterly QA/QC requirements as well as four performance verification tests using the Ontario Hydro (O-H) and Sorbent Trap Methods (STM) for the first test and the EPA Method 30 A (M 30 A) procedure for the remaining three. However, some improvements are still necessary before the system can meet all of the requirements. These involve tests that challenge the system with oxidized mercury (Hg+ 2). These tests could not be passed at Hardin in spite of trying several improvements suggested by ADA or Thermo Fisher...|$|R
