5|$|The {{attachment}} theory {{focused on}} {{the attention of the}} child <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> is there and the responses that the child shows <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> leaves, which indicated the attachment and bonding of the mother and the child. The attention therapy is the done while the child is being restrained by the therapists and the responses displayed were noted. The tests were done to show the responses of the child.|$|E

The following day Kevin Lynch died, followed by Kieran Doherty on 2 August, Thomas McElwee on 8 August and Michael Devine on 20 August. On the day Devine died, Sands' election agent Owen Carron won the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election with an increased number of votes.|$|E
5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E

5|$|Many {{associations}} between adult oviraptorosaur skeletons or embryos with elongatoolithid eggs (including Macroolithus) demonstrate that Macroolithus and other elongatoolithids were laid by oviraptorosaurs. One oviraptorosaur skeleton from the Upper Cretaceous of China {{was described in}} 2005; two shelled elongatoolithid eggs were preserved inside of its pelvis. This suggests that oviraptorosaurs had two functional oviducts where both would produce eggs simultaneously. While Sato et al. did not refer the eggs specifically to Macroolithus, they noted that the eggs closely resemble M. yaotunensis, though with a thinner eggshell. The thin eggshell, however, could simply be because the shell had not finished forming <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> died, or because of biochemical dissolution of the shell before fossilization.|$|E
5|$|As the {{expansion}} of the Schwarzwelt is threatening to destroy Earth, the United Nations send in multiple teams, led by Gore, to investigate and eradicate the phenomenon. During their attempt to enter the Schwarzwelt, all ships but the Red Sprite are destroyed. During their missions, the crew is helped by Arthur, who gradually accumulates knowledge of the Schwarzwelt and develops a personality. During an early mission within the Schwarzwelt, Gore is killed. As the protagonist and members of the Red Sprite's crew explore the regions of the Schwarzwelt, they slowly uncover the truth behind its existence. In ancient times, humans were controlled by the forces of God. His rule over them was broken <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mother</b> Goddess Mem Aleph destroyed him, breaking his hold on Earth. Residing within the Schwarzwelt, Mem Aleph saw humans abusing Earth's environment and consequently corrupting her dimension. Determined to remove those humans responsible for the corruption and return the world to its ancient state, Mem Aleph unleashed the Schwarzwelt. The remaining forces of God, mainly represented by Mastema, intend to use the Schwarzwelt to spread their influence across the world, removing free will to create a united utopia. Key items are the Cosmic Eggs, objects created by Mem Aleph that can reshape the world when combined by the core of the Schwarzwelt.|$|E

50|$|Comstock {{supports}} {{a ban on}} abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> life is in danger. However, {{in an interview with}} Chris Matthews, Comstock stated that the health exception in Roe v. Wade, which allows late-term abortion <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> life is in danger, should be overturned. In 2011, Comstock voted in favor of HB 462, which required women to have ultrasounds before receiving an abortion. When opponents pointed out that this would necessitate an internal ultrasound for early-term pregnancies, an amendment was passed to limit the requirement to external ultrasounds only. She also voted in favor of the amendment. She supports making birth control available to women over the counter.|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is based on}} a study of indicators of liver weight and weight of fetuses and newborns from mothers with iron deficiency anemia, preeclampsia and diabetes. When maternal iron deficiency anemia and preeclampsia becomes mild to moderate severity these lead to compensatory increase in liver weight and body weight of <b>the</b> fetuses. <b>When</b> maternal iron deficiency anemia and preeclampsia becomes severe, on the contrary, there is intrauterine growth retardation, which is manifested by progressive reduction in body weight and liver weight (malnutrition) as a measure of depletion of compensatory-adaptive reactions of <b>the</b> fetus. Moreover, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> maternal preeclampsia occurs this process is more difficult than in maternal iron deficiency anemia. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> diabetes mild, similar to, but more intense than in maternal iron deficiency anemia and preeclampsia, there is both increase in body weight and liver weight of <b>the</b> fetus. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> diabetes moderate to severe there is or fetal macrosomia with hepatomegaly or microsomia with liver hypotrophy. <b>The</b> <b>mother's</b> severe diabetes is expressed more intensely than <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> moderate diabetes...|$|R

25|$|Kangaroo care {{seeks to}} provide {{restored}} {{closeness of the}} newborn with family members by placing the infant in direct skin-to-skin contact with one of them. This ensures physiological and psychological warmth and bonding.

40|$|This {{paper will}} examine how child— care {{practices}} {{are influenced by}} the economic role of women.

If it is true that mothers are more nurturant, it is expected that where individuals other than <b>mothers</b> are <b>the</b> child care— takers, the early child—care practices will be 1) harsher, 2) earlier at onset, and 3) more abrupt than if <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> has primary responsibility for child care. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> responsibilities are reduced, care of the child could be given over to men, children, or other women...|$|R
25|$|Active {{management}} of the third stage is a method of shortening the stage between when the baby is born and when the placenta is delivered. This stage is <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> is {{at risk of having}} a PPH. Active management involves giving a drug which helps the uterus contract before delivering the placenta by a gentle but sustained pull on the umbilical cord whilst exerting upward pressure on the lower abdomen to support the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotic {{prophylaxis}} is {{used before}} an incision. The uterus is incised, and this incision is extended with blunt pressure along a cephalad-caudad axis. The infant is delivered, and the placenta is then removed. The surgeon then {{makes a decision}} about uterine exteriorization. Single-layer uterine closure is used <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> does not want a future pregnancy. When subcutaneous tissue is 2cm thick or more, surgical suture is used. Discouraged practices include manual cervical dilation, any subcutaneous drain, or supplemental oxygen therapy with intent to prevent infection.|$|E
25|$|NASA's {{interest}} in psychological stress caused by space travel, initially studied when their manned missions began, was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the Russian space station Mir.

25|$|A {{more recent}} {{application}} of PGD is to diagnose late-onset diseases and (cancer) predisposition syndromes. Since affected individuals remain healthy until {{the onset of}} the disease, frequently in the fourth decade of life, there is debate on whether or not PGD is appropriate in these cases. Considerations include the high probability of developing the disorders and the potential for cures. For example, in predisposition syndromes, such as BRCA mutations which predispose the individual to breast cancer, the outcomes are unclear. Although PGD is often regarded as an early form of prenatal diagnosis, the nature of the requests for PGD often differs from those of prenatal diagnosis requests made <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> is already pregnant. Some of the widely accepted indications for PGD would not be acceptable for prenatal diagnosis.|$|E
