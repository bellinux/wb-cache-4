5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after the}} Persian navy began its maneuvers, Aristides {{arrived at the}} Allied camp from Aegina. Aristides had been {{recalled}} from exile {{along with the other}} ostracised Athenians on the order of Themistocles, so that Athens might be united against the Persians. Aristides told Themistocles that the Persian fleet had encircled the Allies, which greatly pleased Themistocles, as he now knew that the Persians had <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> trap. The Allied commanders seem to have taken this news rather uncomplainingly, and Holland therefore suggests that they were party to Themistocles's ruse all along. Either way, the Allies prepared for battle, and Themistocles delivered a speech to the marines before they embarked on the ships. In the ensuing battle, the cramped conditions in the Straits hindered the much larger Persian navy, which became disarrayed, and the Allies took advantage to win a famous victory.|$|E

When Weng <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> office at 4:19PM, {{security}} video showed Liao followed Weng {{into the office}} approximately 30 seconds later, where Liao fired sixteen shots, striking Weng seven times. After the shooting, Lin drove Liao away, abandoning the car near Sun Moon Lake, where it was found by police on 29 May.

Nobody ventured to stop the king; thus, he approached Andrew and seized him without resistance. Duke Andrew was held in captivity for months, but his supporters released him in early 1204.|$|E
500|$|Former Major League Baseball player Wes Parker almost {{literally}} <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> role. He {{was doing}} play-by-play reporting for a Los Angeles television station owned by Lear's partner, Jerry Perenchio. [...] "Lear casually asked if I'd {{be interested in}} the part. I said yes, but knew it was out of the question, because in real life things don't happen that way. Nobody walks in and gets on a Norman Lear show. I read for the part, got it and didn't sleep at all that night." [...] Linda Gray was somewhat non-plussed upon being offered the role of transgender Linda Murkland. [...] "I remember meeting Norman and him saying, 'You'll be perfect for the role.' I didn't know whether to take that as a compliment or what." [...] To prepare for her role, Linda Gray asked Lear to arrange for her to meet with a transgender woman. Gray met with her for several hours prior to the beginning of filming and on a couple of occasions during production. Lois Nettleton reportedly based her characterization of Christina Stockwood on Clark Gable. Production started in early March 1977 with director Herbert Kenwith.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, {{a lawyer}} named Robert Tarbox (who, in August 1975, was disbarred by the California Supreme Court {{for failure to}} pay some clients) {{said that in the}} early 1970s a {{merchant}} mariner <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> office and confessed to him that he was the Zodiac Killer. The seemingly lucid seaman (whose name Tarbox would not reveal due to confidentiality) described his crimes briefly but persuasively enough to convince Tarbox. The man said he was trying to stop himself from his [...] "opportunistic" [...] murder spree but never returned to see Tarbox again. Tarbox took out a full-page ad in the Vallejo Times-Herald that he claimed would clear the name of Arthur Leigh Allen as a killer, his only reason for revealing the story thirty years after the fact. Robert Graysmith, {{the author of several books}} on Zodiac, said Tarbox's story was [...] "entirely plausible".|$|E
