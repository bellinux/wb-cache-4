The structural test program also included fuselage drop testing, stabilizer load testing, and control system load testing. A certificate was issued by the LBA showing conformance with the requirements. Successful flutter tests have been performed by an academic flight group in Italy.|$|E

En este trabajo se ha estudiado el crecimiento, desarrollo y productividad de los cultivares Sunset, Sunrise, y de los genotipos BH- 65 y 'Baixinho de Santa Amalia' y las características morfológicas y organolépticas de sus frutos, con el fin de continuar con la selección de aquellos cultivares que mejor se adapten y cumplan con las exigencias mínimas de mercado, que mantengan una buena productividad en aquellas zonas marginales para la platanera y que sirvan de base para futuros programas de mejora. Los resultados ponen de manifiesto que los mayores porcentajes de floración se obtienen en el mes de Mayo (6 meses después de la plantación) en las plantas hermafroditas de todos los cultivares, correspondiendo los mayores porcentajes a 'Sunset' y 'Sunrise' (80 y 90, 4 %, respectivamente). El número de hojas emitidas mensualmente es semejante en todos los cultivares, entre 7, 5 y 7, 8. Las plantas femeninas de 'Sunrise' así como las hermafroditas de 'Sunset' tienen mayor diámetro, y además, este último cultivar es más precoz en florecer y sus frutos son de mayor peso y tamaño. Hay que destacar también que en el punto de consumo los frutos del cultivar Sunrise son los que poseen mayor contenido en sólidos solubles totales (10, 33 ºBrix). Además, los frutos hermafroditas de 'Sunrise' son los primeros en ser recolectados (422 días desde la plantación). Finalmente, señalar que el cultivar Sunset destaca por ser el más productivo (59, 5 kg/pl) y por tener mayores rendimientos por hectárea (158, 627 kg/ha). No obstante, los genotipos BH- 65 y BSA poseen un comportamiento muy semejante, si bien tienen menor porte en el primer año de cultivo (142, 9 y 138, 8 cm) menor altura a la primera flor (40, 6 y 42, 2 cm) y menor longitud de entrenudos (1, 4 y 1, 3 cm). Las características descriptivas de los frutos son muy parecidas sin existir diferencias significativas entre ellas. Los frutos tienen buen tamaño (13, 74 x 7, 81 cm y (12, 68 x 7, 98 cm) y peso (392, 92 y 418, 8 g.) y una producción excelente, cualidades de gran interés para el cultivo de la papaya bajo invernadero. The history of the papaya (Carica papaya, L.) in the Canary Islands came to show the viability of this crop under greenhouse {{and the possibility of}} further expansion in short term due to the introduction, over the last years, of high-quality of commercial cultivars from Hawaii ('Sunrise') and Brazil 'Baixinho de Santa Amalia'(BSA). In this work it was studied the growth, development and productivity of the cultivars Sunset, Sunrise and the genotype BH- 65, and 'Baixinho de Santa Amalia', and the morphological and organoleptic characteristics of the fruits, in order to continue with the selection of those cultivars that best adapted and agree with the market requirements, maintain a good productivity in marginal areas for banana production and serve as a basis for future breeding programs. The results show that the highest flowering percentages took place in May (6 months after being planted) in hermaphrodite plants for all cultivars, corresponding to 'Sunset' and 'Sunrise' the maximum percentages (80 and 90. 4 %, respectively). The number of leaves emitted monthly is similar in all cultivars, between 7. 5 and 7. 8. The female plants of 'Sunrise'and the hermaphrodites of 'Sunset' have greater diameter, and in addition, the last cultivar is precocious in blooming and the fruits are bigger in size and <b>weight.</b> <b>Note</b> also that at the consumption point of the fruit, the cultivar Sunrise showed the highest total soluble solids content (10. 33 ° Brix). Moreover, hermaphrodite fruits of 'Sunrise' are the first to be collected (422 days from planting). Finally, the cultivar Sunset has become the most productive (59. 5 kg / pl) and has the highest yields per hectare (158. 627 kg / ha).

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Birth Registration dataset for England and Wales contains administrative records about birth events occurred in England and Wales since 1837, while electronic individual records are available from 1963 onwards. In general the dataset provides a variety of information including the date and place of birth, sex, Mother and Father’s place of birth, occupation and residence (including postcode) and marital status. Information on the birth weight of the child is also supplied by the NHS but approximately 1 % of all live births {{in any given year}} do not contain the birth <b>weight.</b> <b>Note</b> that over time various Acts of Parliament have added to the schedule of information required and therefore the records cannot be perfectly comparable across years. The information about a birth event is originally collected by the General Register Office (GRO), {{which is part of the}} Identify and Passport Service. In most cases, a birth must be registered by the parents to a local registrar within 42 days of the birth date. The residence of the baby born is allocated to the Mother’s usual area of residence and not the place where the birth occurred (although in many cases this will be the same). Once complete, the birth registration details are then passed to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) as daily extracts of data from the registration on-line system. The ONS compiles birth statistics from the information recorded at birth registration and, under the Statistics and Registration Service Act, since April 2008 ONS has also been the Data Controller responsible for the governance and disclosure of individual level data. This implies that the dissemination of birth records for research and statistical purposes is currently responsibility of ONS. Aggregate statistics regarding birth registrations are published to a pre-announced timetable available at www. statistics. gov. uk. Some data are available on a quarterly basis. Annual figures based on calendar year of occurrence are usually published in the July of the following year. Birth statistics data are governed by the UK Statistics Authority and so is of a high standard. Once on the ONS database, the data are passed through a series of validation processes and any inconsistencies are highlighted and dealt with appropriately. Validation checks are also made at various times by registrars, superintendent registrars, and inspectors of registration. The Birth Registration dataset held by the Office for National Statistics covers births in England and Wales. Information on births in Scotland is recorded by National Records of Scotland. In Northern Ireland it is recorded by the Department for Finance and Personnel. The Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836 required all parents to register a birth. However, it omitted to impose any penalty for failure by the parent to do this. The Births and Deaths Registration Act 1874 rectified this. Whilst the majority of births will still have been registered between 1836 and 1874, it must be regarded as incomplete for research and statistical purposes. As specified previously, various Acts of Parliament have added to the schedule of information required at registration. The Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1953, defined a stillbirth as ‘a child which has issued forth from its mother after the twenty- eighth week of pregnancy and which did not at any time after being completely expelled from its mother breathe or show other signs of life’. This definition was used up to the 30 th of September 1992. On the 1 st of October 1992 the Stillbirth (Definition) Act 1992 came into force, altering the above definition of a stillbirth to 24 or more weeks completed gestation. Figures for the stillbirths from 1993 are thus not fully comparable with those for previous years. Because this change of definition occurred three-quarters of the way into 1992, most of the tables on stillbirth data in 1992, are on the basis of the old definition. Research Usage and Linkage The Birth Registration records for England and Wales have been used for a wide range of research purposes including population estimates and analysing geographical and historical trends in birth and health patterns. The dataset has also been employed in vital events studies to help understand population demographics. For these aims the data have been linked to a number of different datasets about health and vital events. As an example, the birth records have been linked with the Hospital Episode Statistics Inpatient (including maternity dataset) to analyse patterns in health and the causes of premature birth, defects and infant mortality. The dataset has also been used as part of other studies for example the ONS Longitudinal Study and the Millennium Cohort Study. The former is a 1 % sample of census records and vital events data to help examine important social health and demographic issues. The latter is a longitudinal observational study of nearly 19, 000 babies born in the UK between September 2000 and January 2002 to help understand the social conditions surrounding birth and early childhood. </div...|$|E

RESULTS: Excellent correlation between estimated and real weights (r = 0. 997 for MRI, r = 0. 997 for CT) was found. Putrefaction gas and venous air embolism led to an overestimation.
