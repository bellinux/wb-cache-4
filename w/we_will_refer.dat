As Cooke J noted, They claimed that the decision failed to comply with the object of promoting, fostering and developing amateur rugby union football throughout New Zealand, and that for various specified reasons it gives the game a tarnished and sullied image and will reflect adversely on the game. These contentions <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>refer</b> to as the against-the-objects ground. They also claimed that the decision was outside the powers of the Council and could only have been made by the Union in general meeting.

[...] This also ensures that both images will have the same absolute luminance, as can be measured in its SI units of candelas per square meter, in any given area of the image, given equal whitepoints. In addition, matching luminance provides matching perceptual lightness measures, such as [...] (as in the 1976 CIE Lab color space) which is determined by the linear luminance [...] (as in the CIE 1931 XYZ color space) which <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>refer</b> to here as [...] to avoid any ambiguity.|$|E
50|$|Enterprise systems {{based on}} {{multiple}} domain-specific languages are abundant. Languages with a metamodel {{defined in the}} Extensible Markup Language (XML) enjoy particularly widespread adoption. To illustrate development with multiple languages, we will draw an example from a case study: The Apache Open For Business (OFBiz) system. Briefly stated, OFBiz is an enterprise resource planning system that includes standard components such as inventory, accounting, e-commerce etc. These components are implemented by a mixture of XML-based languages and regular Java code. As an example, let us focus on the content management component, particularly a use {{case in which the}} administrative user creates an online web survey as shown in the screenshot below. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>refer</b> to this example as the create survey example.|$|E
