The NVA 130mm and 152mm artillery pieces, and 122mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105mm and 155mm howitzers. This range overmatch was used by the North Vietnamese to avoid counter-battery fire.

5|$|From October to December each year, a {{very large}} area of south India, {{including}} Tamil Nadu, the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh and the union territory of Puducherry, receives up to 60 percent of its annual rainfall from the northeast monsoon (or <b>winter</b> <b>monsoon).</b> The northeast monsoon {{is the result of}} the annual gradual retreat of monsoonal rains from northeastern India. Unlike during the regular monsoon, rainfall during the northeast monsoon is sporadic, but typically far exceeds the amount produced by the regular monsoon by up to 90 percent. This excessive rainfall can be exacerbated by an El Nino year, which 2015 was.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{interaction}} with the high terrain of northern Luzon, Bess temporarily weakened to a tropical storm before regaining typhoon strength over the South China Sea during the afternoon of October11. As the storm emerged back over water, satellite images revealed a relatively large system with clouds spanning an area 485km (300mi) in diameter. Upon reintensifying, Bess turned due west {{in response to a}} dominating high-pressure area over Southern China. With a large difference in pressures between the two systems, a strong northeasterly flow developed between them. This resulted in gale-force winds occurring up to 400km (250mi) from Bess's center. During the evening of October12, the combined effects of a <b>winter</b> <b>monsoon</b> and entrainment of cool, dry air from mainland China began to weaken the system. By the following morning, Bess had weakened to tropical storm as it passed 305km (190mi) south of Hong Kong. The system later struck Hainan Island with winds of 85km/h (50mph) before lessening to a tropical depression. The dissipating system emerged over the Gulf of Tonkin on October14 and ultimately dissipated as it began moving ashore in northern Vietnam later that day.|$|E

40|$|The mid-Pleistocene {{transition}} (MPT) of {{the global}} climate system, marked by a shift of previously dominant 41 -ka cycles to lately dominant 100 -ka cycles roughly in the mid-Pleistocene, {{is one of the}} fundamental enigma in the Quaternary climate evolution. The process and origin of the MPT remain of persistent interest and conjecture. Here we present high-resolution astronomically tuned magnetic susceptibility (MS) and grain-size records from a complete loess-paleosol sequence at Chaona on the central Chinese Loess Plateau. These two proxies are well-known sensitive indicators to the East Asian summer and <b>winter</b> <b>monsoons,</b> respectively. The records reveal a remarkable two-step simultaneous enhancement of the East Asian summer and <b>winter</b> <b>monsoons</b> at 0. 9 Ma and 0. 64 Ma, respectively, accompanied with an onset of a clear 100 -ka cycle at 0. 9 Ma and of a final, predominant 100 -ka cycle starting at 0. 64 Ma. The mid-Pleistocene stepwise rapid uplift of the Tibetan Plateau could be the mechanism driving the simultaneous enhancement of East Asian summer and <b>winter</b> <b>monsoons</b> and the shift of the periodicities during the MPT by complex positive feedbacks. © 2012 University of Washington...|$|R

5|$|The Indian {{climate is}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and <b>winter</b> <b>monsoons.</b> The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping {{the bulk of the}} Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.|$|R
500|$|During November1988, weather {{patterns}} over the Bay of Bengal {{were dominated by}} the <b>winter</b> <b>monsoon,</b> leading to lower atmospheric pressures over {{the region and the}} conglomeration of moisture across the area. The genesis of the 1988Bangladesh cyclone was preceded by floods that occurred over the Malay Peninsula {{as a result of a}} monsoon trough redeveloping over the region. By 18:00UTC on November21, a low-pressure area within the Strait of Malacca was sufficiently organized such that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) issued a Significant Tropical Weather Advisory; thus, the JTWC began closely monitoring the newly developing storm. Over the next few days, the tropical depression tracked west-northwestward into the Andaman Sea. The inchoate storm quickly organized during this period, and convection about the storm's center intensified. These developments caused satellite intensity estimates to increasingly indicate a stronger storm, which in turn prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 18:30UTC on November23. At 06:00UTC the following day, the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm status (or modern-day Cyclonic Storm-equivalent) and thus designate the storm as Tropical Cyclone 04B; however, the storm's [...] "best track" [...] listing, which details refined cyclone positions and is subject to revision, indicates that the storm reached tropical storm intensity six hours earlier.|$|E
500|$|With around 120–140 {{rainy days}} per year, Kerala has a wet and {{maritime}} tropical climate {{influenced by the}} seasonal heavy rains of the southwest summer monsoon and northeast <b>winter</b> <b>monsoon.</b> Around 65% of the rainfall occurs from June to August corresponding to the Southwest monsoon, and the rest from September to December corresponding to Northeast monsoon. The moisture-laden winds of the Southwest monsoon, on reaching the southernmost point of the Indian Peninsula, because of its topography, divides into two branches; the [...] "Arabian Sea Branch" [...] and the [...] "Bay of Bengal Branch". The [...] "Arabian Sea Branch" [...] of the Southwest monsoon first hits the Western Ghats, making Kerala the first state in India to receive rain from the Southwest monsoon. The distribution of pressure patterns is reversed in the Northeast monsoon, during this season the cold winds from North India pick up moisture from the Bay of Bengal and precipitate it {{on the east coast}} of peninsular India. In Kerala, the influence of the Northeast monsoon is seen in southern districts only. Kerala's rainfall averages 2,923mm (115in) annually. Some of Kerala's drier lowland regions average only 1,250mm (49in); the mountains of the eastern Idukki district receive more than 5,000mm (197in) of orographic precipitation: the highest in the state. In eastern Kerala, a drier tropical wet and dry climate prevails. During the summer, the state is prone to gale-force winds, storm surges, cyclone-related torrential downpours, occasional droughts, and rises in sea level. The mean daily temperature ranges from 19.8°C to 36.7°C. Mean annual temperatures range from 25.0–27.5°C in the coastal lowlands to 20.0–22.5°C in the eastern highlands.|$|E

2500|$|The {{offshore}} Somali {{coastal area}} {{is one of}} the most productive marine ecosystems in the world. Especially during the southwest Indian monsoon, strong upwelling pumps cold (17-22°C) and highly nutrient rich (about 5 to 20 μm of nitrate [...] ) subsurface water to the coastal region. During this season, mean phytoplankton density and productivity is further boosted by the activities of the offshore eddy, the Great Whirl. Total zooplankton biomass consists of about 25% Euphausids, the rest being Copepods (dominant zooplankton species in the region ~ Calanoides carinatus and Eucalanus elongates). However, the fast-moving Somali Current reduces the residence time of the upwelled nutrient-rich water, thus limiting biological productivity in this region somewhat. A major part of this unutilized nutrient is transported to the southern Arabian Sea, supporting biological production there. Furthermore, the high wind speeds (approximately 15m/s) of the Southwest monsoon affecting the Somali Current induce intense vertical mixing, increasing the thickness of the mixed layer as well as overall surface nutrient enrichment leading to high productivity. [...] After this season, with the onset of the Northeast (<b>Winter)</b> <b>Monsoon,</b> primary productivity decreases, though zooplankton density does so only slightly.|$|E

2500|$|While Japan {{is not a}} water-stressed country per se, water {{availability}} varies substantially between years, seasons and regions leading to regular and serious water shortages. On average over the period 1971-2000, water resources in Japan stood at 420 km3 per year. At 3,300m3 per capita this is below the global average. On the Pacific coast where most Japanese live, 70-80% of rainfall occurs during only four months, i.e. the summer monsoon from June to July and the typhoon season from August to September. On {{the coast of the}} Sea of Japan the <b>winter</b> <b>monsoon</b> brings heavy snowfall from December to February. National droughts occur about every 10 years in Japan, in addition to more frequent regional droughts. During the drought in 1994 the piped water supply of 16 million people had to be restricted. It is expected that the severity of droughts will increase because of climate change which will reduce the amount of water stored in the form of snow, increase evaporation from reservoirs and reduce rainfall. Most of the water for domestic use comes from surface water. About 45% of the total comes from reservoirs regulated by dams, while 27% comes directly from rivers, 1% from lakes and 4% from river beds, totaling 77% from surface water. 23% of domestic water supply comes from groundwater, which is over-exploited in parts of the country.|$|E

Similar to the Alaskan loess (Begét et al. 1990; Lagroix and Banerjee 2004), χ is positively correlated to the grain size of PSD/MD magnetite during glacials (e.g., L 2), and, thus, higher χ corresponds to relatively colder periods. In contrast, for paleosols that formed during interglacial periods, χ is controlled by pedogenic maghemite nanoparticles and is thus enhanced in paleosols. This contrast will be minimized by stronger summer monsoons in the central and northern CLP.|$|R
