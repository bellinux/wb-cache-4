25|$|Examples {{of popular}} Irish cuisine include boxty, colcannon, coddle, stew, and bacon and cabbage. Ireland {{is famous for}} the full Irish breakfast, which {{involves}} a fried or grilled meal generally consisting of bacon, egg, sausage, pudding, and fried tomato. Apart from the significant influence by European and international dishes, {{there has been a}} recent emergence of a new Irish cuisine based on traditional ingredients handled in new ways. This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish, oysters, mussels and other shellfish, and the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being produced across the country. Shellfish have increased in popularity, especially due to the high quality shellfish available from the country's coastline. The most popular fish include salmon and cod. Traditional breads include soda bread and <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread.</b> Barmbrack is a yeasted bread with added sultanas and raisins.|$|E
500|$|A {{striking}} {{characteristic of}} the diet in New England was the seasonal availability of food. While farming in the southern colonies took place {{for most of the}} year, northern growing seasons were more restricted, limiting the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables. [...] However, the coastal colonists' close proximity to the ocean gave them a bounty of fresh fish to supplement their diet year-round, especially in the north. Wheat, the grain primarily used in English bread, was almost impossible to grow in the North, and imports of wheat were expensive. Substitutes included corn (maize) in the form of cornmeal. [...] The johnnycake was generally considered a poor substitute for <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread,</b> but was accepted by residents in both the northern and southern colonies.|$|E
2500|$|The gluten in {{wheat bread}} is {{dangerous}} to people with celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders, such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy. For the Catholic Church, this issue was addressed in the 24 July 2003 [...] of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which summarized and clarified earlier declarations. The Catholic Church believes that the matter for the Eucharist must be <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread</b> and fermented wine from grapes: it holds that, if the gluten has been entirely removed, the result is not true <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread.</b> For celiacs, but not generally, it allows low-gluten bread. It also permits Holy Communion to be received under the form of either bread or wine alone, except by a priest who is celebrating Mass without other priests or as principal celebrant. Many Protestant churches offer communicants gluten-free alternatives to <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread,</b> usually {{in the form of}} a rice-based cracker or gluten-free bread.|$|E
50|$|Manchet, manchette or michette (French), is a <b>wheaten</b> yeast <b>bread</b> of {{very good}} quality, or a small flat {{circular}} loaf of same. It was a bread that was small enough {{to be held in}} the hand or glove (see also manchette).|$|R
5000|$|The {{style of}} New England cookery {{originated}} from its colonial roots, {{that is to}} say practical, frugal and willing to eat anything other than what they were used to from their British roots [...] Most of the initial colonists came from East Anglia in England, with other groups following them over the ages like francophone regions of Canada (this was especially true of Northern New England, where there are still many speakers of a dialect of French), from Ireland, from Southern Italy, and most recently from Haiti, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Portugal. The oldest forms of the cuisine date to the early 17th century {{and in the case of}} Massachusetts, out of the entire country only the state of Virginia can claim recipes that are older. East Anglian cookery would have included recipes for dishes like suet puddings, <b>wheaten</b> <b>breads,</b> and a few shellfish delicacies, like winkles and would have been at the time of settlement simple Puritan fare quite in contrast to the fineries and excesses expected in London cavalier circles. Most of the cuisine started with one-pot cookery, which resulted in such dishes as succotash, chowder, baked beans, and others. Starches are fairly simple, and typically encompass just a handful of classics like potatoes and cornmeal, and a few native breads like Anadama bread, johnnycakes, bulkie rolls, Parker house rolls, popovers, and New England brown bread. This region is fairly conservative with its spices, but typical spices include nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice, especially in desserts, and for savory foods, thyme, black pepper, sea salt, and sage. Typical condiments include maple syrup, grown from the native sugar maple, molasses, and the famous cranberry sauce.|$|R
40|$|Bacteriological and physico-chemical quality {{changes in}} <b>wheaten</b> white <b>bread</b> flour made for Nigerian market were {{investigated}} during storage {{at room temperature}} for four months. During storage, bacterial count decreased; between day 15 and day 105, count decreases from 45. 0 X 10 3 cfu/g to 1. 0 X 10 3 cfu/g for flour brand 1 and between day 60 and day 105, count decreases 12. 5 X 10 3 cfu/g to 3. 5 X 10 3 cfu/g for flour brand 3. Statistically, bacterial counts in the different brands of flour during storage show a significant difference. Total coliform count in flour brand 1 decreases d from 4. 60 MPN/g (day 15) to zero (day 105) in storage. Significant count in coliform count was obtained for flour brand 1 and flour brand 2 but no significant difference was observed for flour brand 3 and 4 during storage. Staphylococcus albus, Klebseilla pneumoneae and Bacillus subtilis were detected and isolated. Lower pH of below pH 6. 0 were recorded at day 105 for flour brands 1, 2 and 4 and the ash content of the various brands of flour was above 0. 65 % recommended for Nigerian flour with effect from day 90 of storage. Protein, gluten, fat, moisture, and carbohydrate contents were within the acceptable limit values for Nigerian flour...|$|R

60|$|Xenophon {{did not go}} back to Athens, but {{settled on}} a farm near Elis, where he built a little temple to Diana, in {{imitation}} of the one at Ephesus, and spent his time in husbandry, in hunting, and in writing his histories, and also treatises on dogs and horses. Once a-year he held a great festival in honour of Diana, offering her the tithe of all his produce, and feasting all the villagers around on barley meal, <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread,</b> meat, and venison, the last of which was obtained at a great hunting match conducted by Xenophon himself and his sons.|$|E
6000|$|About 8 A.M. the Somal sent us {{gifts of}} citrons, plantains, sugar-cane, limes, <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread,</b> and stewed fowls. At {{the same time}} the house became full of visitors, Harari and others, most of them pretexting {{inquiries}} after old Sultan's health. Noon was generally followed by a little solitude, the people retiring to dinner and siesta: we were then again provided with bread and beef from the Amir's kitchen. In the afternoon the house again filled, and the visitors dispersed only for supper. Before sunset we were careful to visit the mules tethered in the court-yard; being half starved they often attempted to desert. [41] ...|$|E

6000|$|Every {{one can be}} {{got over}} by flattery. The belted earl--"belted earl" [...] is the correct phrase, I believe. I don't know what it means, unless it be an earl that wears a belt instead of braces. Some men do. I don't like it myself. You {{have to keep the}} thing so tight for it to be of any use, and that is uncomfortable. Anyhow, {{whatever}} particular kind of an earl a belted earl may be, he is, I assert, get-overable by flattery; just as every other human being is, from a duchess to a cat's-meat man, from a plow boy to a poet--and the poet far easier than the plowboy, for butter sinks better into <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread</b> than into oaten cakes.|$|E

60|$|At 4 P.M., after {{accomplishing}} {{fifteen miles}} on rough ground, we sighted Sagharrah, a snug high-fenced village of {{eight or nine}} huts nestling against a hill side with trees above, and below a fertile grain-valley. Presently Mad Said pointed out to us the Gerad Adan, who, attended by a little party, was returning homewards: we fired our guns as a salute, he however hurried on to receive us with due ceremony in his cottage. Dismounting at the door we shook hands with him, were led through the idle mob into a smoky closet contrived against the inside wall, and were regaled with <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread</b> steeped in honey and rancid butter. The host left us to eat, and soon afterwards returned:--I looked with attention at a man upon whom so much then depended.|$|E
60|$|But Antinor {{would not}} sit down. In his {{habitual}} way {{he leaned against}} the wall, watching with those earnest eyes of his every movement of his host, as the latter first passed a loving hand over the white cloth on the table and then smoothed out every crease on its satiny surface. Anon he disappeared for a moment in the dark angle of the room, where a rough wooden chest stood propped against the wall. From this he now took out a loaf of fine <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread,</b> also a jar containing wine and some plain earthenware goblets. These things he set upon the table, his big leonine head bent to his simple task, his small grey eyes wandering across {{from time to time in}} kindliness on his friend.|$|E

60|$|When Telemachus {{stepped into}} the swineherd's house Ulysses arose from his seat, but Telemachus bade the old beggar man sit down again, {{and a pile of}} {{brushwood}} with a fleece thrown over it was brought for himself. They breakfasted on what was ready, cold pork, <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread,</b> and wine in cups of ivy wood, and Eumaeus told Telemachus that the old beggar gave himself out as a wanderer from Crete. Telemachus answered that he could not take strangers into his mother's house, for he was unable to protect them against the violence of the wooers, but he would give the wanderer clothes and shoes and a sword, and he might stay at the farm. He sent the swineherd to tell his mother, Penelope, that he had returned in safety, and Eumaeus started on his journey to the town.|$|E
6000|$|From this out, the madam {{piled up}} the surprises with a rush that fired the general astonishment up {{to a hundred}} and fifty in the shade, {{and at the same time}} paralyzed {{expression}} of it down to gasped [...] "Oh's" [...] and [...] "Ah's," [...] and mute upliftings of hands and eyes. She fetched crockery--new, and plenty of it; new wooden goblets and other table furniture; and beer, fish, chicken, a goose, eggs, roast beef, roast mutton, a ham, a small roast pig, and a wealth of genuine white <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread.</b> Take it by and large, that spread laid everything far and away in the shade that ever that crowd had seen before.

Then, I like <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread,</b> and butter, and potatoes, and many other such articles, that I was used to all my life, until I came out here, close to sunset.

60|$|The pulp of the bread-fruit {{between the}} rind and the core is all eatable. The core itself, {{which is about}} {{the size and shape of}} the handle of a knife, is uneatable. The bread-fruit is never eaten raw. The usual mode of {{dressing}} it is to remove the rind and the core, divide the pulp into three or four pieces, and bake it in an oven similar to the one just described. When taken out, in somewhat less than an hour, the outside of the fruit is nicely browned, and the inner part so strongly resembles the crumb of <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread</b> as to have suggested the name of the tree. It is not, however, quite so pleasant to the taste, being rather insipid and slightly sweet. Nevertheless it is extremely good for food, and is much prized by the natives, to whom it may almost be said to be the staff of life.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} is the daily routine of the school: The scholars assemble {{every morning at}} seven in summer, and eight in winter. The school is opened by reading the Scriptures, praise, and prayer, and religious instruction suited to their years; after {{which there is a}} lesson in geography, or the more ordinary facts of natural history, taught by means of maps and prints distributed along the walls of the school room; two days in the week they have a singing lesson; at nine they breakfast on porridge and milk, and have half an hour of play; at ten they again assemble in school, and are employed at work till two. At two o'clock they dine; usually on broth, with coarse <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread,</b> but occasionally on potatoes and ox-head soup, &c. The diet is very plain, but nutritious and abundant, and appears to suit the tastes of the pupils completely. It is a pleasing sight to see them assembled, with their youthful appetites sharpened by four hours' work, joining, at least with outward decorum, in asking God's blessing on the food he has provided for them, and most promptly availing themselves of the signal given to commence their dinner.|$|E
60|$|Returning home, {{we found}} the good Shaykh Jami, to whom we communicated the news with many thanks for his {{friendly}} aid. I {{did my best to}} smooth his temper about Turkish history, and succeeded. Becoming communicative, he informed me that the original object, of his visit was the offer of good offices, he having been informed that, in the town was a man who brought down the birds from heaven, and the citizens having been thrown into great excitement by the probable intentions of such a personage. Whilst he sat with us, Kabir Khalil, one of the principal Ulema, and one Haji Abdullah, a Shaykh of distinguished fame who had been dreaming dreams in our favour, sent their salams. This {{is one of the many}} occasions in which, during a long residence in the East, I have had reason to be grateful to the learned, whose influence over the people when unbiassed by bigotry is decidedly for good. That evening there was great joy amongst the Somal, who had been alarmed for the safety of my companions: they brought them presents of Harari Tobes, and a feast of fowls, limes, and <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread</b> for the stranger.|$|E
60|$|Covered {{by white}} cloths it {{was placed on}} a sort of sledge. This was drawn by six of the attendants of the temple; Ameres and Chebron {{followed}} behind, and after them came a procession of priests. When it arrived at the house, Amense and Mysa, with their hair unbound and falling around them, received the body--uttering loud cries of lamentation, {{in which they were}} joined by all the women of the house. It was carried into an inner apartment, and there until evening a loud wailing was kept up, many female relatives and friends coming in and joining in the outcry. Late in the evening the body was taken out, placed upon another sledge, and, followed by the male relatives and friends and by all the attendants and slaves of the house, was carried to the establishment of Chigron the embalmer. During the forty days occupied by the process the strictest mourning was observed in the house. No meat or <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread</b> was eaten, nor wine served at the table--even the luxury of the bath was abandoned. All the males shaved their eyebrows, and sounds of loud lamentation {{on the part of the}} women echoed through the house.|$|E

Everybody said, 'Shoot them:' so we took out all the men the same day and shot them at once. The women and children the Nana spared, because he was a humane man; and he sent them to the others in the Bibi's house. There they were well treated; and though they had not punkahs, and tattis, and cow's flesh, as formerly, yet they got better rations than any of the Nana's own soldiers: for the Feringhees, like all you Europeans, Sahib, are very luxurious, and will not live off rice or dal and a little ghee like other people.

6000|$|In fact, Lambert Groot, {{which was}} his real name, though English lips {{had made it}} Groats, belonged {{to one of the}} prosperous guilds of the great {{merchant}} city of Bruges, but he had offended his family by his determination to marry the deaf, and almost dumb, portionless orphan daughter of an old friend and contemporary, and to save her from the scorn and slights of his relatives--though she was quite as well-born as themselves--he had migrated to England, where Wearmouth and Sunderland had a brisk trade with the Low Countries. These cities enjoyed the cultivation of the period, and this room, daintily clean and fresh, seemed to Grisell more luxurious than any she had seen since the Countess of Warwick's. A silver bowl of warm soup, extracted from the pot au feu, was served to her by the Hausfrau, on a little table, spread with a fine white cloth edged with embroidery, with an earnest gesture begging her to partake, and a slender Venice glass of wine was brought to her with a cake of <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread.</b> Much did Grisell wish she could have transferred such refreshing fare to Bernard.

Alleyne, glancing round for shelter, saw a thick and lofty holly-bush, so hollowed out beneath that no house could have been drier. Under this canopy of green two men were already squatted, who waved their hands to Alleyne that he should join them. As he approached he saw that they had five dried herrings laid out in front of them, with a great hunch of <b>wheaten</b> <b>bread</b> and a leathern flask full of milk, but instead of setting to at their food they appeared to have forgot all about it, and were disputing together with flushed faces and angry gestures. It was easy to see by their dress and manner that they were two of those wandering students who formed about this time so enormous a multitude in every country in Europe. The one was long and thin, with melancholy features, while the other was fat and sleek, with a loud voice and the air of a man who is not to be gainsaid.|$|E
