After difficulties testing the cars, PRR successor Penn Central began their eponymous Metroliner service on January 16, 1969. Amtrak took over the service in 1971.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he moved}} back to Abingdon. During Reconstruction, Robertson {{was a member of}} the Committee of Nine, led by Alexander H. H.

The committee successfully negotiated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> to have that clause voted on separately, so that Virginians would accept and ratify the new constitution and so rejoin the Union. He died on February 11, 1888, and was buried at Cobbs, Chesterfield County.|$|E

After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction {{treaties}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch, the Dalton Gang, and Little Britches.|$|E
5|$|As the {{political}} climate in New South Wales became more volatile after Lang's attempts to abolish the Legislative Council and conflict <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> over debts, Bruxner emphasised the need that the Country Party remain independent of the United Australia Party (which had succeeded the Nationalist Party) amidst calls for the opposition to unite. On 26 April 1932, Country Party Leader Buttenshaw notified the party of his intention to resign. Bruxner was then elected as the new party Leader.|$|E

Trigg County's Henry Burnett was elected chairman of the proceedings. Scott County farmer George W. Johnson chaired the committee that wrote the convention's final report and introduced some of its key resolutions.

5|$|The {{facility}} grew {{considerably in}} {{size in the}} post-independence period after successive renovation projects. With {{the outbreak of the}} civil war in the early 1990s, Mogadishu International Airport's flight services experienced routine disruptions and its grounds and equipment were largely destroyed. In the late 2000s, the K50 Airport, situated 50 kilometers to the south, served as the capital's main airport while Mogadishu International Airport, now renamed Aden Adde International Airport, briefly shut down. However, in late 2010, the security situation in Mogadishu had significantly improved, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> eventually managing to assume full control of the city by August 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} in Regina struggled to deliver {{services to the}} vast territory. The influx of settlers and responsibility for the Klondike, as well as constant fighting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> over limited legislative powers and minimal revenue collection, hampered the effectiveness of government. The government during this period slowly released powers to the elected members. In 1897, after control of the executive council was ceded to elected members from the Lieutenant-Governors, a short-lived period of party politics evolved that challenged the consensus model of government {{that had been used}} since 1870.|$|E

5|$|The {{territorial}} government {{under the leadership}} of Premier Frederick Haultain struck a deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>Government</b> of Canada in early 1905 to bring provincial powers to the territories. This {{led to the creation of}} the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta from the southernmost and most populous areas of the territory. The Northwest Territories, reduced to its northern, lightly populated hinterland, continued to exist under the 1870s constitutional status under control of the federal government. A new council was convened in Ottawa, Ontario to deal with the region.|$|E
5|$|UFA members held widely {{disparate}} political views, and Brownlee {{quickly became}} {{identified with the}} government's conservative faction. He opposed radical changes {{to the structure of}} government and urged thrift in public spending. As part of the government's attempts to balance its budget, Brownlee favoured selling its money-losing railways and concluding an agreement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> to give Alberta control over its natural resources; he was unsuccessful at both while Attorney-General. As a member of a farmers' government, he was also involved in attempts to alleviate drought-induced poverty in southern Alberta and in investigations into the establishment of a provincial wheat pool.|$|E
5|$|Desha's major {{accomplishment}} {{as governor}} {{was in the}} area of internal improvements. In 1825, he convinced the legislature to fund the creation of the Louisville and Portland Canal on the Falls of the Ohio. The canal opened in 1830, and proved very profitable, so much so that Desha lamented the fact that the state had split the cost of the project – and consequently, its profits – <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> and private investors. He also urged state investment in a turnpike joining Maysville to Louisville via Lexington. He advocated using excess money earmarked for education to construct hard-surfaced roads in the state, but the General Assembly was less responsive to this suggestion.|$|E

5|$|In {{order for}} these {{developments}} to occur, Playford personally had {{to attend to}} the bureaucracy that stood in the way. He confronted public service workers, and successfully negotiated with the heads of private companies. But it was negotiations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> that were to prove the hardest. In his time as Premier, Playford was to confront seven different Prime Ministers: Lyons, Page, Menzies, Fadden, Curtin, Forde and Chifley. Strangely, he enjoyed best relations with the Laborite Chifley, and had a poor rapport with his fellow conservative, Menzies. During the wartime years, Menzies' reluctance to meet with Playford initially hampered industrial efforts, but Playford's other federal colleagues made sure that deals could be made.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{original}} shield {{was implemented}} in 1996 {{consisting of the}} team's name, D.C. United, above a black bald eagle facing right on a red field, clawing three soccer balls overlaid on three white stars. The three stars and balls were intended to represent the region's three jurisdictions. The bird, associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> based in Washington, D.C., symbolizes many of the attributes of the team, including speed and power. The logo was redesigned before the 1998 season. This second logo design reoriented the eagle facing left, and removed the three stars below it, whose metaphor was retained by three raised wing feathers. At {{the center of the}} eagle is a single gold-colored star and soccer ball, which represents the team's victory in Major League Soccer's inaugural cup in 1996. The logo can also be adorned with four silver stars above it, representing the MLS Cups the team has won.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} historically pioneered {{research and}} training collaborations between academia, industry and government. In 1946, President Compton, Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation, the first American venture-capital firm. In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses. On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940. MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy.|$|E

2500|$|Domestically, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> {{sovereignty}} {{means that}} it may perform acts such as entering into contracts or accepting bonds, which are typical of governmental entities but not expressly provided for in the Constitution or laws. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> as an attribute of sovereignty, {{has the power to}} enforce those powers that are granted to it (e.g., the power to [...] "establish Post Offices and Post Roads" [...] includes the power to punish those who interfere <b>with</b> <b>the</b> postal system so established). The Court has recognized <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> supreme power over those limited matters entrusted to it. Thus, no state may interfere <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> operations as though its sovereignty is superior to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> (discussed more below); for example, states may not interfere <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> near absolute discretion to sell its own real property, even when that real property is located in one or another state. <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> exercises its supreme power not as a unitary entity, but instead via the three coordinate branches of the government (legislative, executive, and judicial), each of which has its own prescribed powers and limitations under the Constitution. In addition, the doctrine of separation of powers functions as a limitation on each branch of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> exercise of sovereign power.|$|R
