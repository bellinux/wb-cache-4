25|$|The Bhagavad Gita is a Bhagavata {{explanation}} of the Purusha Sukta and the Purushamedha Srauta yajna described in the Satapatha Brahmana. Chapters 7 and 8 of the Bhagavad Gita describe the relationship between teacher and disciple, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> is viewed as the absolute person, Purusa Narayana. In Chapters 10 and 11 of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna begins to instruct Arjuna about the directions of space-time within himself reflecting what is written in the Satapatha Brahmana and Purusa Sukta. The vision of Krishna in his universal form shows the self-devouring nature of the absolute person, {{as described in the}} Satapatha Brahmana and Purusa Sukta. Chapters 12 describes the two paths one chooses after one completes the Purushamedha yajna i.e. become a renunciate or remain as a householder. Chapter 14 is the highest teaching within the Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge to achieve the same state as Purusa Narayana, which is the goal of the Purushamedha.|$|E

Curtis' group continues forward, followed by Franco, leading to a violent fight in a sauna car during which Franco kills Grey and mortally wounds Tanya before Curtis and Namgoong seemingly kill him.|$|E
2500|$|The book {{begins in}} the spring of 1942 as Takei and his family are on a train {{traveling}} towards the Rohwer War Relocation Center in Arkansas. Takei recounts the four years his family spent in Japanese American internment, his experiences there, and the aftermath of those experiences. The book also provides background and research into the 120,000 Japanese Americans who were interned in similar camps. Takei's parents were identified as [...] "disloyals", and sent to the maximum security Tule Lake War Relocation Center in northern California. Takei's family left Tule Lake in 1946 and he describes their tough time readjusting to life after being in the internment camps. He excelled in his early studies and skipped the third grade. He recounts an incident from fourth grade <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> referred to him as [...] "that little Jap boy", and the emotions he still carries looking back on that event.|$|E

60|$|By such means, {{these sources}} of {{interruption}} and difficulty may, like the others, be almost entirely removed. Perhaps not altogether, for many cases may occur, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> {{may choose to}} give a particular class permission to come to him for help.

60|$|Thus {{it will be}} {{seen that}} there may be cases <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> may make {{arrangements}} for separating his scholars, on an open and distinct understanding with them in respect to the cause of it. We have given these cases not that exactly such ones will be very likely to occur, or that when they do, the teacher is to manage them in exactly the way here described, but to exhibit more clearly to the reader than could be done by any general description, the spirit and tone which a teacher ought to assume towards his pupils. We wished to exhibit this in contrast with the harsh and impatient manner, which teachers too often assume in such a case;--as follows.|$|E

50|$|St Trinian's was a British gag cartoon {{comic strip}} series, created and drawn by Ronald Searle from 1946 until 1952. The {{cartoons}} all centre on {{a boarding school}} for girls, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> are sadists and the girls are juvenile delinquents. The series was Searle's most famous work and inspired a popular series of comedy films that has outlived the short-running cartoon series.|$|R
60|$|<b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> has not {{sufficient}} {{confidence that the}} general sense of propriety among his pupils will preserve good order and decorum during the exercise, it may be better for him to read a prayer, selected from books of devotion, or prepared by himself expressly for the occasion. By this plan his school will be, during the exercise, under his own observation as at other times. It may, in some schools, where the number is small, or the prevailing habits of seriousness and order are good, be well to allow the older scholars to read the prayer in rotation, taking especial care {{that it does not}} degenerate into a mere reading exercise; but that it is understood, both by readers and hearers, to be a solemn act of religious worship. In a word, if the teacher is really honest and sincere in his wish to lead his pupils to the worship of God, he will find no serious difficulty in preventing the abuses and avoiding the dangers which some might fear, and in accomplishing vast good, both in promoting the prosperity of the school, and {{in the formation of the}} highest and best traits a individual character.|$|E

50|$|Another {{well-known}} {{event is}} the 1880 Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf in Milan, Italy, where hearing educators voted to embrace oral education and remove sign language from the classroom. This effort resulted in strong opposition within Deaf cultures {{today to the}} oralist method of teaching deaf children to speak and lip read with limited or no use of sign language in the classroom. The method is intended {{to make it easier}} for deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but there have been many arguments about whether <b>the</b> manual method (<b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> teach Sign Language as the main way to communicate) or <b>the</b> Oral method (<b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Teachers</b> make <b>the</b> student learn to speak) are better. Most people now agree that the Manual Method is the preferred method of Deaf communication. The use of sign language is central to the Deaf peoples as a cultural identity and attempts to limit its use are viewed as an attack.|$|R
