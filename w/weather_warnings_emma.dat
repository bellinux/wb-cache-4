40|$|This {{northern}} Queensland study {{aimed to}} gain feedback on: <b>weather</b> <b>warning</b> courses {{run by the}} weather bureau, upgrades to operator desks in remote Indigenous radio studios in northern Queensland and on the terminology of <b>weather</b> <b>warnings.</b> This indicative study found that Bureau training courses in <b>weather</b> <b>warnings</b> for remote broadcaster radio announcers were appreciated, with suggestions they be expanded. The recent upgrades to remote radio transceiver operator desk equipment were greatly appreciated, while the terminology used in warnings targeted to remote Indigenous communities was generally seen as useful and clear, but lots of translating was usually needed...|$|R
50|$|The Met Office, the NWS's {{counterpart}} in the United Kingdom, does not issue separate <b>weather</b> <b>warnings</b> and watches, but has an analogous system of flash warnings and advance warnings that serve {{the same general}} role of <b>weather</b> <b>warnings</b> and <b>weather</b> watches, respectively. Other official meteorological departments may use similar systems but use different terms.|$|R

Severe <b>weather</b> <b>warnings</b> are issued for heavy continuous rain, hurricane gale force winds, heavy snowfall, heat, black ice, thaw periods, and thunderstorms. During severe weather situations, updates {{on the development of the}} situation are compulsory. No probabilistic information is communicated in terms of numbers.

5000|$|In the United States, {{governmental}} <b>weather</b> <b>warnings</b> {{and watches}} are {{issued by the}} National Weather Service, which is itself {{a branch of the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The NWS defines a watch as [...] "the risk of a hazardous weather or hydrologic event increasing significantly, but its occurrence, location, and/or timing is still uncertain" [...] and a warning as [...] "hazardous weather or hydrologic event that is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability of occurring" [...] http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=w. Additionally, the NWS breaks down <b>weather</b> <b>warnings</b> and watches based upon the specific type of hazardous <b>weather.</b> These <b>warnings</b> and watches include, but are not limited to, flooding, severe local storms, tropical cyclones, and winter storms. The Severe Weather Terminology article has much greater detail on NWS warnings.|$|R
50|$|For instance, {{improvements}} in forecast and warning {{services provided by}} the National Weather Service are {{a direct result of}} NOAA research.
