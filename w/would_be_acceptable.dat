5|$|Charles VI had {{instructed}} his {{representative to the}} papal court Maximilian Ulrich von Kaunitz {{to work closely with}} Álvaro Cienfuegos to elect a candidate that he favoured. Cuenfuego's instructions were that cardinals Pamfili, Vallemani, Spada, Piazza, Corradini, Caracciolo, Tanara, Orsini, Ruffo, Colonna, Davia, Boncompagni, Pico, and Pignatelli <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> to the emperor, and that cardinals Paolucci, Olivieri, Bussi, Sagripanti, and Origo were to be excluded.|$|E
5|$|The first {{station was}} a {{temporary}} terminus for the GWR {{on the west}} side of Bishop's Bridge Road, opened on 4 June 1838. The first GWR service from London to Taplow, near Maidenhead, ran from Paddington in 1838. After the main station opened, this became the site of the goods depot. Brunel did not consider that anything less than a grand terminus dedicated to the GWR <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable,</b> and consequently this was approved in February 1853.|$|E
5|$|A {{siege of}} the castle was started, but through papal {{intervention}} King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path. A commission was appointed to draw up an arrangement that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> to both sides. The resulting Dictum of Kenilworth offered the rebels {{the right to buy}} back forfeited estates, at prices depending on their level of involvement in the rebellion. After initial resistance, the terms were eventually accepted. By the summer of 1267, the country was pacified, and this spirit of reconciliation would last until the 1290s. The Dictum of Kenilworth was later incorporated into the Statute of Marlborough.|$|E

5|$|The papal {{conclave}} of 1724 {{was called}} upon {{the death of}} Pope Innocent XIII. It began on 20 March 1724 and ended on 28 May that year {{with the election of}} Vincenzo Maria Orsini, a Dominican friar, as Pope Benedict XIII. The conclave was made of largely the same electors that had elected Innocent in 1721 and the same factions dominated it. Multiple attempts were made to elect candidates that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> to the various Catholic monarchies at the time, but none were successful until May. Benedict resisted his own election for two days before being convinced to accept it.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} {{houses were}} dissolved in the Reformation, and their lands broken up. The Priory Church of St John remains, as does St John's Gate, traditionally {{regarded as the}} boundary between Smithfield and Clerkenwell. John Houghton (later canonized by Pope Paul VI as St John Houghton), Prior of Charterhouse, went to Thomas Cromwell accompanied by two other local priors seeking an oath of supremacy that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> to their communities. This resulted in their being flung into the Tower of London, and on 4 May 1535, they were taken to Tyburn and hanged — becoming the first Catholic martyrs of the Reformation. On 29 May, the remaining twenty monks and eighteen lay brothers were forced to swear the oath of allegiance; the ten who refused were taken to Newgate Prison and left to starve.|$|E
5|$|A Cape Coloured of Indian and Portuguese ancestry, D'Oliveira left South Africa {{primarily}} because the era's apartheid legislation seriously restricted his career prospects on racial grounds and barred {{him from the}} all-white Test team. He qualified for Worcestershire County Cricket Club through residency in 1964 and first played for England two years later. The consequences of D'Oliveira's possible inclusion in the 1968–69 MCC tour of South Africa were discussed by English and South African cricketing bodies as early as 1966. Manoeuvring by cricketing and political figures in both countries did little to bring the matter to a head. The MCC's priority was to maintain traditional links with South Africa and have the series go ahead without incident. South Africa's Prime Minister B.J. Vorster sought to appease international opinion by publicly indicating that D'Oliveira's inclusion <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable,</b> but secretly did all he could to prevent it.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, the MCC was {{involved}} in controversy over the non-selection of the mixed-race cricketer Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa, which was then under apartheid. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira, himself South African-born, in the England team because of his colour. The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but wanted the tour to go ahead. The Shadow Foreign Secretary and former MCC President Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, who privately did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances. Vorster suggested to Douglas-Home that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D'Oliveira's selection <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable,</b> {{but that it was}} likely no protest would be made. Douglas-Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them not to push for an answer. They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish whether they had a free hand in choosing a team, but their change of strategy meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it. In his biography of D'Oliveira, Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster's intentions.|$|E
