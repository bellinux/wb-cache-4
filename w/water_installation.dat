5000|$|The {{combination}} of these two orders 158 and 92 gives the Israeli authorities complete control over the entire water supplies in the West Bank and Gaza. Only the Head, appointed by the Area Commander, has influence in any issue regarding “transportation, extraction, export, consumption, sale, distribution, inspection of its use, purification, allotment of shares, the establishment of water projects, measurement, prevention of contamination, carrying out of studies and measurements in anything that deals with water matters, drilling wells, hearing of objections and all proceedings dealing {{with any of the}} above laws, etc., fixing and collecting fees, taxes and any payments for any of the above and any other matter which has not been mentioned specifically above which deals in any way whatsoever with water subjects.” For example, Article 4(A) of Order 158 specifically states that “it shall not be permissible for any person to set up or to assemble or to possess or to operate a <b>water</b> <b>installation</b> unless he has obtained a license from the Area Commander.” [...] And although the exact number of granted licenses is disputed, the percentage is relatively small.|$|E
50|$|This {{structure}} also {{enables a}} 'natural ventilation' through the selective opening of windows. The 50 cm {{gap between the}} 17 cm thick floors and the glass encasing also allows for vertical ventilation, if needs be helped by opening glass hatches in the roof. And the glass allows for maximum entry of sunlight. Peutz reported after one year of use of the building, that experience had shown that the 50 cm gap was more than enough. In the early years, the gap has even been reduced in size in some places. In winter only the window flaps in the glass encasing need to be opened and the roof hatches can remain closed. During summer, on the sunny side the curtains should be closed and the hatches opened (note, though, that the south side is the one without glass). The result is a 'double wall' of glass on the outer side and curtains on the inner side, with an upward draft caused by the Sun's heat. This suffices for ventilation and the two surface ducts (as shown on the drawings) were partly intended for mechanical ventilation (with an exhauster fan), but this {{has turned out to}} be unnecessary. During winter, heating is done with a hot <b>water</b> <b>installation</b> (of course fuelled with coal) with natural circulation. The radiators along the windows now provide the heat for the circulation. The installed pumps have turned out to be unnecessary. The airtight glass walls have turned out to be better insulators than thought. Also, the mass of the concrete is such a good heat accumulator that extra time heating up the building in the morning has turned out unnecessary and there have never been any major temperature changes. This technology is being rediscovered and used, for example, by Canadian architect Chris Holmes in his energy-saving designs.|$|E

40|$|Artisanal gold mining {{activities}} in Talawaan Watershed of Indonesia use {{a large amount}} of mercury to form an amalgam with the gold particles. Those activities are obviously playing an important role in emitting mercury to aquatic and terrestrial environment around gold mining areas. The mine activities effectively start in 1998, but information on mercury impact to the community drink water sources is very limited. In the present study, all water sources of public drink <b>water</b> <b>installations</b> around Manado City were examined in November 2000 and in May 2001. As a result, total mercury content in all water samples of year 2000 were in the range 0. 05 - 0. 13 μg/l. In fact, those level were quite low compare to the health standard level for water (1 μg/l) established by the World Health Organization and adopted by Indonesian Government. In year 2001 or about six months after the first survey, a very different picture was observed at two drink <b>water</b> <b>installations.</b> While the total mercury contents at the other installations fluctuate around the background level, the two installations which located closer to the mining area shown a considerably increment (5 and 18 times). In spite of their values that still lower than the health standard level, those increasing trends should be considered as a glance of future potential mercury impact to the health of Manado City community. This results delight the urgently needs of better and regular quality control test on mercury level of the drink <b>water</b> <b>installations</b> especially to the sites in Talawaan Watershed...|$|R
