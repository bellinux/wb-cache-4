5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked me how I liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to watch as an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them to do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b>|$|E

50|$|Momentary forgetting, such as forgetting <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{get from}} the kitchen after getting up from your desk, is {{frequently}} experienced in day-to-day life. Usually what was forgotten can be remembered again by returning to the context where the event began. For example, imagine sitting at your desk and deciding <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to get a drink from the kitchen. Once you get to the kitchen, <b>you</b> completely forget <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> there. If <b>you</b> return to your desk, you will most likely remember <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> from the kitchen.|$|R

25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel Just Tell Me <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want!</b> in 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. In her opinion, Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in Just Tell Me <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> when Sidney gave the voice-over to Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 Scott held a Fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford, {{where he}} contributed {{regularly}} to Alan Montefiore's politics seminar for postgraduates.

25|$|Pay <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> – In 2013 comedian Bob Slayer {{introduced}} a new model to the Fringe, at his Heroes of Fringe venues, where punters could 'Buy a ticket in advance to guarantee a seat or Pay <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> on exit'. The model {{is a mixture of}} Paid and Free and enables performers to find a paying audience without risking large marketing spend. Phil Kay, Tom Binns and Miss Behave were amongst the first established acts to embrace this model along with Adrienne Truscott who won the Edinburgh Comedy Awards Panel Prize with a PWYW. Adam Hess was nominated for best newcomer in 2015. Other promoters such as Just the Tonic, Pleasance and C-Venues have since introduced the model to their venues. In 2016, Gilded Balloon adopted PWYW for the Counting House venue, which was previously a Free Festival venue.|$|E

25|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Is This <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want?</b> began in London in June 1968. The {{majority of the}} songs were recorded in Los Angeles in October–November that year, after Harrison had completed work on the Beatles' White Album. Among the other guest musicians on the album {{were members of the}} Wrecking Crew, Eric Clapton, Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann and John Barham. Although the album received favourable reviews, it failed to achieve commercial success. The 2010 reissue includes bonus tracks covering the rest of Lomax's output while on Apple Records.|$|E

25|$|Justice Scalia says that, {{generally}} speaking, {{the legislature}} {{has the power}} to make laws and the judiciary should only interpret the laws that are made or are explicitly in the Constitution. That is not Justice Brown's philosophy. It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the Constitution recognizes an unlimited right to do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> with your private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom. Yet {{that seems to be the}} manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our most cherished document.|$|E

The film also starred Gloria Swanson. In 1978, she appeared in the film The End {{as the mother of}} the main character played by Burt Reynolds. Her last motion picture performance was in 1980 in Sidney Lumet's Just Tell Me <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want.</b> She also returned to the stage, making her Broadway debut in a short-lived 1973 revival of Clare Boothe Luce's The Women. She toured in a 1978 production of Alan Ayckbourn's Relatively Speaking, directed by David Clayton.|$|E

25|$|In May 2015, an {{announcement}} said that C.K. would write, direct, and {{star in a}} film titled I'm a Cop to be produced by Scott Rudin, Dave Becky, and long-time associate, Blair Breard, with a budget of $8 million. He scrapped the project. C.K. became the first comedian to sell out Madison Square Garden {{three times in a}} single tour in 2015. Audio from the tour was released by C.K. on his website as Louis C.K.: Live at Madison Square Garden through the pay <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> model.

500|$|... "Do What U Want" [...] is a mid-tempo synthpop and R track, drawing {{influence}} from 1980s-inspired throbbing synths and an electronic beat. Eric R. Danton of Rolling Stone {{described it as}} a [...] "muscular club beat". James Montgomery from MTV News said that a [...] "lurching, lascivious beat" [...] was the main backbone of the song, interspersed with Gaga's loud-voiced vocals, a [...] "corky" [...] chorus and Kelly's [...] "cool, coital" [...] singing. The song's chorus is built around arpeggios. Complex described its [...] "Do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> with my body" [...] hook as [...] "catchy and somewhat raunchy". The song's lyrics represent themes of sexual submissiveness, with Gaga telling off detractors that her thoughts, dreams, and feelings are her own, no matter what one does with her body. Jim Farber of New York Daily News suggested [...] "Do What U Want" [...] to be a response to [...] "everyone who ever made a tart comment about her — which, by now, involves half the planet". Gaga and Kelly alternate singing the lines [...] "Do what u want/ What u want with my body/ Do what u want/ What u want with my body/ Write <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> say <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> about me/ If you want you know that I'm not sorry".|$|E
