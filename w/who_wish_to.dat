5|$|As {{with many}} post-Soviet states, {{the change in}} writing system and the debates {{surrounding}} it is closely intertwined with political themes. Although not having been used since the adoption of Cyrillic, the Latin script is supported by those <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> bring the country closer to Uzbekistan, which has adopted the Latin-based Uzbek alphabet. The Persian alphabet {{is supported by the}} devoutly religious, Islamists, and by those <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> bring the country closer to Iran and their Persian heritage. As the de facto standard, the Cyrillic alphabet is generally supported by those <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> maintain the status quo, and not distance the country from Russia.|$|E

Lengthy negotiations between the two patriarchates failed to produce any agreement.|$|R

In her last year, she worked on a book, Radioactivity, which was published posthumously in 1935.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} Ronaldinho in 2003, and Barcelona's {{subsequent}} success in La Liga and Champions League, {{has been seen}} as crucial to an increase in the national, and worldwide, fan-base of the club.

5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed {{explanation for this}} is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E

5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> delay or {{speed up the}} eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if {{the roots of the}} permanent tooth are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{stresses}} that SCI places on people and relationships, {{studies have shown}} that people with SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them, but studies have shown no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents. Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives.|$|E
