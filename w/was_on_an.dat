Although he made some improvements to the zoo, Forte's interests lay in developing the gardens' dining and exhibition facilities. The Kings Hall was then the largest exhibition space outside London, but competition from the G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to its closure in 1987.|$|E

Ernouf returned to Marseille, where he learned that André Masséna also had chosen the imperial cause, after which he left for Paris. Napoleon rescinded Ernouf's honors and titles, and dismissed him from his post in the military on 15April 1815.

It was the first in a string of four straight seasons and nine seasons total that Hutson led the league in touchdown receptions. The next season the Packers won their fourth league title, with a 21–6 win over the Boston Redskins in the 1936 NFL Championship Game. Hutson scored the first touchdown of the game, on a 48-yard pass from Herber in the first quarter. Hutson completed the season with 34 receptions for 536 yards and eight touchdowns, which were all league records, and helped Herber set the NFL season passing yards record.

40|$|Avian erythroblastosis {{virus has}} transduced two {{cellular}} genes, c-erb-A and c-erb-B.

The locations of two other cellular oncogenes (c-fps and c-myb) were also determined: c-fps <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> microchromosome, and c-myb <b>is</b> <b>on</b> chromosome of <b>an</b> intermediate size.
