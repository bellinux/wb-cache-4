25|$|Radcliffe has {{advocated}} {{a system where}} first time offenders are banned {{for four years and}} any future offense for life. However, she felt that in cases like that of Christine Ohuruogu, who missed three out-of-competition drugs tests, that she should be allowed to compete in the Olympics, as the BOA does not allow anyone who has served a doping ban to compete. However, when Ohuruogu admitted to not {{trying to get to the}} tests, Radcliffe expressed her disappointment and hoped that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> learned. When Marion Jones admitted to steroid use, Radcliffe stated that it was good for the sport that Jones was caught and that they had to keep testing and that people being caught is a big deterrent to would-be cheats.|$|E
25|$|To be sure, Estimé had hastened his own demise {{in several}} ways. His {{nationalization}} of the Standard Fruit banana concession sharply reduced the firm's revenues. He alienated workers by {{requiring them to}} invest between 10 percent and 15 percent of their salaries in national-defense bonds. The president sealed his fate by attempting to manipulate the constitution in order to extend his term in office. Seizing on this action and the popular unrest it engendered, the army forced the president to resign on 10 May 1950. The same junta that had assumed power {{after the fall of}} Lescot reinstalled itself. An army escort conducted Estimé from the National Palace and into exile in Jamaica. The events of May 1946 made an impression upon the deposed minister of labor, François Duvalier. The lesson that Duvalier drew from Estimé's ouster was that the military could not be trusted. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> that he would act upon when he gained power.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} on systems including dual-processor Pentium Pro 200s and Athlon 800s with eight and nine gigabyte hard drives, some using SCSI. The team used [...] "more than 100 video cards" [...] throughout development. Deus Ex was built using Visual Studio, Lightwave, and Lotus Notes. They also built a custom dialogue editor, ConEdit. The team used UnrealEd atop the Unreal game engine for map design, which Spector wrote was [...] "superior {{to anything else}} available". Their trust in UnrealScript led them to code [...] "special-cases" [...] for their immediate mission needs instead of more generalized multi-case code. Even as concerned team members expressed misgivings, the team only addressed this later in the project. To Spector, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> to always prefer [...] "general solutions" [...] over [...] "special casing", such that the tool set works predictably.|$|E
500|$|This {{time on the}} {{frontier}} ended in July 1889 when {{the family moved to}} Washington, D.C., where Douglas attended the Force Public School. His father was posted to San Antonio, Texas, in September 1893. While there MacArthur attended the West Texas Military Academy, where he was awarded the gold medal for [...] "scholarship and deportment". He also participated on the school tennis team, and played quarterback on the school football team and shortstop on its baseball team. He was named valedictorian, with a final year average of 97.33 out of 100. MacArthur's father and grandfather unsuccessfully sought to secure Douglas a presidential appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, first from President Grover Cleveland and then from President William McKinley. After these two rejections, he was given coaching and private tutoring by Milwaukee high school teacher Gertrude Hull. He then passed the examination for an appointment from Congressman Theobald Otjen, scoring 93.3 on the test. He later wrote: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> I never forgot. Preparedness is the key to success and victory." ...|$|E
500|$|Even before {{viewing the}} script, Reznor and Ross opted {{to use a}} redolent {{approach}} to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively. He was filming at {{this time last year}} and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Rowling {{stated that}} she had Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince [...] "planned for years", but she spent two months going over her plan before she began writing seriously. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> learned after she did not check the plan for Goblet of Fire and had to rewrite {{a third of the}} book. She started writing the book before her second child, David, was born, but she took a break to care for him. The first chapter, [...] "The Other Minister", which {{features}} the meeting between the Muggle Prime Minister, the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, and his successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, was a concept Rowling tried to start in Philosopher's Stone, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Order of the Phoenix, but she found [...] "it finally works" [...] in Half-Blood Prince. She stated that she was [...] "seriously upset" [...] writing the end of the book, although Goblet of Fire was the hardest to write. When asked if she liked the book, she responded, [...] "I like it better than I liked 'Goblet', 'Phoenix' or 'Chamber' when I finished them. Book six does what I wanted it to do and even if nobody else likes it (and some won't), I know it will remain one of my favourites of the series. Ultimately you have to please yourself before you please anyone else!" ...|$|E
500|$|Within {{three weeks}} of his first game as a starter, at least seven e-books were being {{published}} on Lin, and the Global Language Monitor declared that Linsanity had met its criteria to be considered an English-language word. He appeared on a second consecutive Sports Illustrated cover, the first New York-based team athlete and the third NBA player in the magazine's history, after Jordan and Dirk Nowitzki. New York City restaurants introduced new food and bar items in honor of Lin, and sales of Yanjing Beer rose. The city has about 450,000 residents of Chinese or Taiwanese descent—larger than the entire populations of NBA cities like Miami, Atlanta or Cleveland—and viewing parties to watch Lin play flourished in Manhattan's Chinatown. An airline advertised [...] "Linsanely low prices", bids for his rookie card exceeded $21,000 on eBay, and the press circulated rumors—denied by Lin—that he was dating Kim Kardashian. Foreign Policy speculated on his potential impact on Sino-American relations, and Jack and Suzy Welch wrote that Lin's rise <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> to business leaders to not let bureaucracy stifle unproven talent. Despite Lin's sudden fame, Sacramento Kings coach Keith Smart stated, [...] "I knew [...] before he was Linmania. He's still the same humble guy. The guy has not changed a bit, which is real special for a young man." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Timbuktu {{historian}} al Sadi {{cast the}} Moroccan incursion in negative terms: [...] "The Sudan {{was one of}} God's most favored countries in prosperity and fertility {{at the time the}} expeditionary force entered the country. Now, all that has changed. Security has given place to danger, prosperity to misery and calamity. Disorder spreading and intensifying has become universal." [...] The invasion shows the transformational power of firearms in Africa where wielded by disciplined troops, often to dire effect on local peoples and polities.

2500|$|In 1983, {{she signed}} on to star in a comedy about four women sharing a flat together, Girls on Top (provisionally titled Four-Play, Bitches on Heat, and Four Fs to Share). She was cast as the {{promiscuous}} golddigger Candice Valentine. The show didn't go into production until early 1985 due to an electricians' strike at the studio where the series was set to film. The show, co-starring comedians Dawn French, Ruby Wax and Jennifer Saunders (who also wrote the scripts), continued after Ullman bowed out after the first series. In her book, Bonkers: My Life in Laughs, Saunders writes, “If Ruby taught us how to write funny, then Tracey <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> in how to act funny.

The sensei did a 'technique' and then everyone got up and tried to replicate what had been done. If they came to 'help' you it was merely a straightforward re-enactment of what they had done initially. The only one who 'taught' in our western understanding was Koichi Tohei who had been to Hawaii and parts of the United States. Koichi Tohei was the only sensei who gave lessons or spoke to foreigners in English. His style was very free.... Now he is known for Ki Aikido. I attended all of the lessons he gave in a small dojo in Iidabashi." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, {{concerned}} about his friend's well-being, Allen Ginsberg gained for Burroughs a contract to teach creative writing at the City College of New York. Burroughs successfully withdrew from heroin use and moved to New York. He eventually found an apartment, affectionately dubbed [...] "The Bunker", on the Lower East Side of Manhattan at 222 Bowery. The dwelling was a partially converted YMCA gym, complete with lockers and communal showers. The building fell within New York City rent control policies that made it extremely cheap; it was only about four hundred dollars a month until 1981 when the rent control rules changed, doubling the rent overnight. Burroughs added [...] "teacher" [...] {{to the list of}} jobs he did not like, as he lasted only a semester as a professor; he found the students uninteresting and without much creative talent. Although he needed income desperately, he turned down a teaching position at the University at Buffalo for $15,000 a semester. [...] "The teaching gig <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> in never again. You were giving out all this energy and nothing was coming back." [...] His savior was the newly arrived, twenty-one-year-old bookseller and Beat Generation devotee James Grauerholz, who worked for Burroughs part-time as a secretary as well as in a bookstore. Grauerholz suggested the idea of reading tours. Grauerholz had managed several rock bands in Kansas and took the lead in booking for Burroughs reading tours that would help support him throughout the next two decades. It raised his public profile, eventually aiding in his obtaining new publishing contracts. Through Grauerholz, Burroughs became a monthly columnist for the noted popular culture magazine Crawdaddy, for which he interviewed Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page in 1975. Burroughs decided to relocate back to the United States permanently in 1976. He then began to associate with New York cultural players such as Andy Warhol, John Giorno, Lou Reed, Patti Smith, and Susan Sontag, frequently entertaining them at the Bunker; he also visited venues like CBGB to watch the likes of Patti Smith perform. Throughout early 1977, Burroughs collaborated with Southern and Dennis Hopper on a screen adaptation of Junky. Financed by a reclusive acquaintance of Burroughs, the project lost traction after financial problems and creative disagreements between Hopper and Burroughs.|$|E
