5|$|Before {{its release}} on 10 June 2005, one preview <b>wondered</b> how the film would fare {{at the box}} office. Citing {{comparisons}} with the 1953 version, the preview suggested that debutant director, Sarkar's inexperience in film-making, the probable inability of debutant actress, Balan to portray Lalita's character appropriately, suitable 1960s depiction by contemporary actors and musician, Shantanu Moitra's until then unimpressive soundtracks, could be impediments to a successful adaptation.|$|E

Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{described}} the normally intelligent, humorous and optimistic Lindemann now as pessimistic and withdrawn. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg tried to talk to him and was ignored, and later <b>wondered</b> whether this was due to combat fatigue or whether the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.|$|E

5|$|After {{resuming}} production, Navarro {{questioned the}} methods of the Chili Peppers' recording procedures.

Months went by, and only small amounts of material were written. Kiedis made a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan in December, where his family realized he'd resumed an active addiction once again. He returned to Hollywood in late January 1995, when he finally finished recording his vocals. The rest of the recording was completed within the next month.|$|E

Rowley told Wallace that the Union army had retreated, Sherman was no longer fighting at Shiloh Church, and the battle line had moved northeast toward Pittsburg Landing.

5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat <b>wondered</b> {{what to do}} next and worried about his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's father had been a headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Harding's biographers, writing while Britton's {{allegations}} remained uncertain, differed {{on their}} truth; Russell believed them unquestioningly while Dean, having reviewed Britton's papers at UCLA, regarded them as unproven.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the use of}} <b>wonder</b> in the TV-series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage (1980). Popular {{science has}} been studied extensively (e. g. Broks 2006; Leane 2007; Perrault 2013), and <b>wonder</b> has been studied moderately (e. g. Daston & Park 1998; Fuller 2006; Vasalou 2015). However, {{there are very few}} studies of <b>wonder</b> in popular science. This paper explores how and why <b>wonder</b> is used in Cosmos, with the wider aim of understanding uses of <b>wonder</b> in popular science. The studies that discuss <b>wonder</b> in popular science (Fahnestock 1986; Perrault 2013) argue that <b>wonder</b> is used to enthuse the audience about science, but they do not discuss why <b>wonder</b> has this ability, nor whether <b>wonder</b> has other functions. This paper argues that Fuller's (2006) psychological and evolutionary account of <b>wonder</b> can elucidate why <b>wonder</b> has the ability to enthuse; it discerns three senses of ‘wonder’ (related to objects, emotions and attitudes); and it discusses other functions of <b>wonder</b> (existential, aesthetic and ethical). Due to the centrality of astrobiological questions in Cosmos, this paper also highlights the relation of these questions to the senses and functions of <b>wonder</b> in Cosmos...|$|R

5|$|In {{her early}} to mid-thirties, {{she became a}} lady-in-waiting (nyōbō) at court, most likely because of her {{reputation}} as an author. Chieko Mulhern writes in Japanese Women Writers, a Biocritical Sourcebook that scholars have <b>wondered</b> why Murasaki made such a move at a comparatively late period in her life. Her diary evidences that she exchanged poetry with Michinaga after her husband's death, leading to speculation that the two may have been lovers. Bowring sees no evidence that she was brought to court as Michinaga's concubine, although he did bring her to court without following official channels. Mulhern thinks Michinaga wanted to have Murasaki at court to educate his daughter Shōshi.|$|E

40|$|To <b>wonder</b> {{is a gift}} of the romanticist in particular. <b>Wonder</b> seeks explanation. If reason doesn’t provide that, {{imagination}} {{provides a}} way out. One imagines a transcendental world of which the God-idea may become the central point and the explanatory model of that that invoked <b>wonder.</b> The God-idea implies <b>wonder,</b> <b>wonder</b> that live exists, that things exist at all. <b>Wonder</b> promotes religiosity—i. c., {{the need to provide}} life with a vertical dimension—and religiosity facilitates, in its turn, <b>wonder.</b> Thus the circle is closed: romanticism, <b>wonder,</b> imagination, religiosity, <b>wonder.</b> A circle providing life with an important bonus, i. e., sense, meaning with a supernatural signature. This augments the chance that hope will be preserved, even as dark clouds begin to hover above one’s life...|$|R
