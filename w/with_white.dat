5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is {{brownish}} {{with a dark}} {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded <b>with</b> <b>white,</b> and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted <b>with</b> <b>white,</b> which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.|$|E

The Naval Academy wore maroon socks, caps, and belts, <b>with</b> <b>white</b> pants and jerseys.

5|$|For much of Arsenal's history, {{their home}} colours have been bright red shirts <b>with</b> <b>white</b> sleeves and white shorts, though {{this has not}} always been the case. The choice of red is in {{recognition}} of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn <b>with</b> <b>white</b> shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.|$|E

5|$|Mugabe {{initially}} emphasised racial {{reconciliation and}} he was keen to build a good relationship <b>with</b> <b>white</b> Zimbabweans. He hoped to avoid a white exodus and tried to allay fears that he would nationalise white-owned property. He appointed two white ministers—David Smith and Denis Norman—to his government, met <b>with</b> <b>white</b> leaders in agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, and impressed senior figures in the outgoing administration like Smith and Ken Flower with his apparent sincerity. With {{the end of the}} war, petrol rationing, and economic sanctions, life for white Zimbabweans improved {{during the early years of}} Mugabe's regime. In the economic boom that followed, the white minority—which controlled considerable property and dominated commerce, industry, and banking—were the country's main beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|Portia fimbriata, {{sometimes}} called the fringed jumping spider, is a jumping spider (family Salticidae) found in Australia and Southeast Asia. Adult females have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. Both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("fangs"), a brown underside, dark brown palps <b>with</b> <b>white</b> hairs, and dark brown abdomens <b>with</b> <b>white</b> spots on the upper side. Both sexes have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair, and the legs are spindly and fringed. However, specimens from New Guinea and Indonesia have orange-brown carapaces and yellowish abdomens. In all species of the genus Portia, the abdomen distends when the spider is well fed or producing eggs.|$|E
