25|$|The choir is roofed by a fine <b>wooden</b> <b>barrel</b> vault {{dating from}} the 14th century. In 1856 this was {{restored}} and repainted to a new design by Owen Jones. It is thought the eastern bays of the cathedral never received a stone vault because {{at some point the}} central spire blew down, and funds were required to rebuild the damaged tower and north transept, completed in about 1420.|$|E
25|$|The new {{interior}} of 1959 under a <b>wooden</b> <b>barrel</b> vault is very plain. Behrmann {{created a new}} altar and a new pulpit. Eva Limberg (Bielefeld) designed the new christening bowl, the candlestick, carried by Apostle figures, and the lectern, depicting {{the scene of the}} Roman Centurion and Jesus. In 1958 August Wagner created new coloured windows above the altar, after the design of the Hermann Kirchberger. The windows depict the Benedictive Jesus, the Nativity of Jesus, and the Descent of the Holy Spirit (Pentecost). A surviving element of the original furnishing is a larger than life-sized copied statue of the benedictive Jesus after the famous statue by Bertel Thorvaldsen.|$|E
25|$|In Roman Catholic iconography, Saint Nicholas is {{depicted}} as a bishop, wearing the insignia of this dignity: a bishop's vestments, a mitre and a crozier.

Depending on whether he {{is depicted}} as patron saint of children or sailors, his images will be completed by a background showing ships, children or three figures climbing out of a <b>wooden</b> <b>barrel</b> (the three slaughtered children he resurrected).

2500|$|Traditionally, {{most people}} {{continued}} to make tepa in the summer. Heads (pakegvissaaq is head of fish including pectoral fins) of chinook (king), sokeye (red), chum (dog), and occasionally, coho (silver) salmon were prepared by burying them {{in the ground and}} allowed them to ferment before eating. The traditional way to prepare tepa was to bury the heads in the ground along with most of the fish guts in a <b>wooden</b> <b>barrel</b> covered with burlap material. Earthern pits lined with grass were used for this process. Salmon milt and eggs were added to the heads which were then covered with another layer of grass before being covered over with earth. The fermenting process took from one to two weeks depending on temperature of the ground. One salmon production unit prepared four pits of tepa. The pits measured approximately 18 inches deep and 2 feet square and contained approximately 75 salmon heads each. The heads of 1,000 chinook, 726 sockeye, 1,246 chum, and 41 coho salmon were prepared as tepa by Kwethluk households during 1986. One resident told the researchers, [...] "to the Native it's like candy or bubblegum, sweet and sour, in between the two." [...] However, with the introduction of plastic buckets, the danger of botulism has surfaced and informants stressed the importance of avoiding these types of modern containers since the [...] "oldfashioned" [...] methods allowed oxygen to circulate and prevented the growth of bacteria which causes botulism. Heads stored underground in plastic bags are more likely to develop botulism than fish stored in grasses. It was soon discovered that the traditional method of preparing the tepas was safer than the modern way.|$|E

50|$|During the 20th century, sake-brewing {{technology}} grew by {{leaps and}} bounds. The government opened the sake-brewing research institute in 1904, and in 1907 the very first government-run sake-tasting competition was held. Yeast strains specifically selected for their brewing properties were isolated and enamel-coated steel tanks arrived. The government started hailing the use of enamel tanks as easy to clean, lasting forever, and being devoid of bacterial problems. (The government considered <b>wooden</b> <b>barrels</b> to be unhygienic {{because of the potential}} bacteria living in the wood.) Although these things are true, the government also wanted more tax money from breweries, as using <b>wooden</b> <b>barrels</b> means that a significant amount of sake is lost to evaporation (somewhere around 3%), which could have otherwise been taxed. This {{was the end of the}} wooden-barrel age of sake and the use of <b>wooden</b> <b>barrels</b> in brewing was completely eliminated.|$|R

40|$|DOI: 10. 1016 /j. aca. 2009. 10. 059 <b>Wooden</b> <b>barrels</b> {{are used}} in the ageing or {{maturation}} of many alcoholic beverages, namely brandies and wines. However, the high costs related to ageing in <b>wooden</b> <b>barrels</b> have led to a search for alternative technologies. In this study we examined the application of wood fragments to the beverage in order to promote an accelerated ageing. We evaluated the sensory and chemical modifications in brandy aged in presence of two types of wood fragments, from two different woods (Limousin oak wood and Portuguese chestnut wood), and compared those with a brandy aged in <b>wooden</b> <b>barrels.</b> The results of the analysis of variance revealed more significant effects of wood botanical species than the ageing system on the sensory attributes. Concerning the ageing system, significant differences in brandy colour attributes were found, namely golden, topaz and greenish; olfactory attributes such as alcoholic, toasted and coffee; and the gustatory attribute, bitter. The brandies aged in the presence of wood tablets presented the highest intensities of topaz and greenish colour, toasted and coffee odours, while the brandies aged in <b>wooden</b> <b>barrels</b> presented the highest intensities of golden colour, alcohol odour and bitter taste. However, the overall quality of the brandies was similar. The analysis of odourant compounds showed a great discrimination of the brandies based on the ageing system. The brandies aged in <b>wooden</b> <b>barrels</b> presented the highest levels of several ethyl esters, acids, furanic aldehydes and the lowest levels of volatile phenols. Thus, considering the overall quality of the brandies, these results suggest the use of wood fragments to be an interesting alternative technology. On the other hand, the chemical analysis of the brandies showed the possibility of discriminating the ageing technologies based on odourant compound levels...|$|R
