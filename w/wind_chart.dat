40|$|The design charts {{for basic}} wind speeds {{currently}} {{in use in}} Brazil [1] were created in 1977, based on wind speed records from 1950 to 1974. The database covered up to 25 years of wind records obtained in 49 weather stations, totaling 919 station×years of data. Since 1974, additional 37 years of wind records became available, but have not been incorporated in the design code. Hence, the updated wind charts proposed in this paper are long overdue. In this paper, 62 years of wind records in Brazil are gathered in order to construct updated and more reliable wind charts. The original data by Padaratz [2] are complemented by data from 104 airport weather stations, made available through the Wolfram Research Database [3]. In total, 4142 station×years of data {{are used in the}} present study, hence providing much better cover in terms of space and time span. Maximum annual wind speeds for the individual stations are fitted to Gumbel distribu-tions, from which basic wind speeds are evaluated (mean return peri-od of 50 years). Basic wind speeds are used to build a non-linear regression model, using the p-value of the Anderson-Darling good-ness-of-fit test as regression weight. This ensures that extreme value wind distributions for which a good fit is obtained are given more importance in the regression model, reducing the influence of spurious data. The regression model developed herein is used to plot a new design chart for basic wind speeds in Brazil. It is proposed that this new <b>wind</b> <b>chart</b> be incorporated in the Brazilian code for design of structures subject to wind [1]. In this regard, it is observed that basic wind speeds obtained herein are higher than the wind speeds of the current chart for significant parts of Brazil (notably the center, northeast and north), and are the same or smaller {{in some parts of the}} south and southeast. It is shown herein that the main differences between the current and the proposed charts are not due to different modeling assumptions, but are mainly due to the new data. The proposed chart is updated, and is more reliable than the chart cur-rently in use, as it reflects 4142 station×years of data, and covers up to 62 years of wind records...|$|E

Synoptic type analyses of these data are now being accomplished and compared with appropriate constant-pressure analyses of stratospheric circulation. Ozone changes during a stratospheric warming of early 1971 are investigated by comparison with circulation changes in the layer between 30 mb (24 km) and 2 mb (42 km). A general increase in ozone concentrations, more pronounced in the higher latitudes, is noted during the warming period.

40|$|Automation of {{the manual}} {{system for the}} {{meteorological}} navigation of ships in the North Atlantic Ocean requires that the following tasks be computerized: (1) the construction of <b>wind</b> <b>charts</b> from pressure charts of {{the northern part of}} the Atlantic Ocean; (2) the composition of wave charts with the aid of this wind information; (3) the determination of the least-time track with the assistance of these wave charts. In this paper the third point is dealt with. The problem of computing the least-time track is a special case of the control problem of Bolza. The problem of Bolza is treated in Section 3. In Section 4 it is shown that, under certain conditions, the solu-tions of the Euler-Lagrange equations depend continuously on the initial values of the Lagrange multipliers. This property, which holds both in the case of restricted and unrestricted manoeuvrability, forms the basis of a method for the computation of the least-time track. This method is considered in Section 6. An example is shown in Section 7. In Section 5 attention is paid to the problem of minimizing fuel consump-tion, and in Section 2 we give a description of the coordinate system used in practical computations. Finally an example of a computer program, written in ALGOL- 60, is presented in Section 8...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to produce a guide for the application of photovoltaic, wind, and micro-hydro power to remote areas. The applications considered are those of generating electricity, and pumping water. An extensive literature review introduces and covers the main design considerations for each energy form. The primary decision-making areas are then examined, beginning with a look at the theory of electricity, and going on to discuss generators, inverters, energy storage, and mechanical transmission. Next, the assessment of the demand over a given time interval is considered. The key questions of, "How big a system is required?", and, "How much energy will be produced?", are addressed for each energy form, along with various design considerations. For each of the energy forms the issue of quantifying the resource is examined in detail. The factors influencing the amount of power available are presented for each. This process of quantifying the power available is essential in order to be able to choose the optimum type of renewable energy to use for a given application in a specified location. Dealing with them together in one document allows the different energy forms to be assessed side. by side, and a preliminary decision on the most promising type made. For both wind and photovoltaic energy a computer model was created. drawing on available theory, in order to generate charts to assist in the design process. The photovoltaic design charts enable sunshine hour data to be converted to radiation in Kwh/m 2, and radiation on a horizontal plane to be converted to that received on a plane inclined at a specified angle. Other charts were produced which enable the most cost effective combination of array and battery to be selected for a given situation. The <b>wind</b> <b>charts</b> specify the amount of power which can be produced from a wind turbine with given characteristics operating in a specified wind regime. The photovoltaic and <b>wind</b> design <b>charts</b> produced by the models enable the size of the relevant system required to be determined for a given situation. This information then allows a costing to be done to determine the cost of generating energy with a particular method. The procedure for evaluating and determining the true cost of the energy produced. based on life cycle costing, is then examined. This can then be used to assess the most economical means of meeting any particular demand...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{mesoscale}} sea-surface circulation pattern within 400 km off Chile {{and between}} 18 °S and 40 °S latitude is described using chlorophyll and temperature {{images from the}} Coastal Zone Color Scanner NIMBUS- 7 satellite. The data base {{is a set of}} four mosaics developed from band- 3 (550 nm) images taken on June 4 and September 16, 1979 and January 14 and April 7, 1980, supplemented with one mosaic of sea-surface temperature distribution for the September mosaic, orbit 4526. Coastal eddies, upwelling zones and zones of onshore-offshore transport are clearly distinguished because a zone of low-pigment concentration water generally separates the highly pigmented near-shore upwelling zones from oceanic waters with pigment concentration in mid-range. The cause of the low-pigment water adjacent to upwelling zones is not known, but the absence of temperature differences between up-welled and low-pigmented water suggest a biological cause. Onshore jets of oceanic waters are traced from distances up to 300 km offshore to within, in places, a few tens of kilometers of the shoreline; width of the jets is of the order of 60 km. In general, these onshore jets are separated by plumes of near-shore surface water moving seaward, with plumes width on the order of 40 km also extending as far as 400 km offshore. Large eddies form off the leading edges of both onshore and offshore plumes, giving rise to a formation called a "hammerhead" structure. Onshore jets are consistent with the result of Inostroza (1972) which documents intrusions of warm oceanic surface waters as semi-stationary features off Coquimbo (30 °S) and off Talcahuano (37 °S). Lack of wind data for 1979 - 80 prevents a direct correlation of onshore-offshore plumes with regional wind stress data. Low level <b>wind</b> <b>charts</b> for the 1979 - 80 period are too coarse in resolution to yield correlations. However, stick diagrams were prepared from coastal wind station data for 1977. Both time and space variations in surface winds could be responsible for the patterns revealed in chlorophyll images. The existence of persistent but probably episodic onshore-offshore transport of surface waters to such large distances offshore have not been reported previously for Chilean waters. These must certainly impact directly the patterns of migrations of populations of major fishery resources such as the Jack Mackerel (Trachurus murphyi, common name Jurel, species...|$|R
