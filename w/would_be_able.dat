5|$|Even without {{managerial}} manipulation, quotas {{were very}} often low {{and easy to}} overfulfill. Quotas had been lowered during the Second World War so that new workers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to fulfill their output expectations; in industries such as engineering, it was common for workers to double their basic pay through bonuses.|$|E

50|$|Any single discipline’s {{account of}} {{behavioural}} development across {{the life span}} <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to express all aspects of this theoretical framework. That {{is why it is}} suggested explicitly by life span researchers that the combination of disciplines is necessary to define the origins and directionality of this theory. This combination of disciplines <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to delineate the source and mechanisms associated with age-graded, history-graded, and nonnormative influences that one discipline, such as psychology, would find quite difficult to approach. The field of psychology <b>would</b> only <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to provide a partial representation of human development from conception to death.|$|R
5|$|G. minor {{is unusual}} because it {{frequently}} is found with embryonic skeletons of the enantiornithine bird Gobipipus. These embryos have well-developed wings, which suggest they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to fly very soon after hatching, unlike most modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{longed to}} return to his {{economic}} studies, as he had left these studies in 1844 and had been preoccupied with other projects over the last thirteen years. By returning to his study of economics, Marx felt he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to understand more thoroughly what was occurring in the world.|$|E

Game {{would have}} included mastodon, tapir, ground sloth, deer, giant beaver, and horse (Chandler 2001a).

25|$|During the series, NHL President John Ziegler {{stated that}} Soviet players <b>would</b> never <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to join the}} NHL {{because of the way}} the Soviet hockey {{programme}} worked, and that NHLers <b>would</b> never <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to play in the Winter Olympics. Soviet players <b>would</b> <b>be</b> allowed to play in the NHL within three years, and an arrangement that would allow NHL players to play in the Olympics was announced within nine.|$|R

5|$|A {{southern}} O-Bahn proposal {{attracted the}} most attention and {{has been the subject}} of various studies and Parliamentary Committees as to its viability since 1996. The rail route through Adelaide's far south is off-centre, without the large catchment area of a more central transport route. An O-Bahn running direct through the region <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to take advantage of an already large population and the continuing growth in the area.|$|E
5|$|After its founding, {{the party}} {{promoted}} {{itself as the}} legitimate heir of the Socialist Party of America. Former Mayor of Milwaukee, Frank Zeidler, was elected the first national chairperson of the party. Zeidler also helped re-organizing the party structure during its early years.

5|$|After the 2014 race {{had been}} held at a resurfaced circuit, causing the teams to fight with the soft tyre choice by Pirelli, speculations arose if drivers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to {{challenge}} the eleven-year old track record set by Rubens Barrichello in 2004. However, practice showed that lap times actually slowed due to changes to the kerbs, forcing the drivers {{to stay away from}} the insides of the corners. Pirelli chose the soft and medium compounds for the event.|$|E

5|$|As of October2014, Caltrans had {{considered}} relinquishing {{the eastern part}} of SR54 from the SR94 junction up to the El Cajon city limits to the County of San Diego. Two years later, the CTC approved a Caltrans proposal to revoke the proposed freeway status of the unconstructed portion of SR54 since the existing roads including Jamacha Boulevard <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to handle the projected traffic load; this would allow the unused land to be sold.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the show was good to average, with a general appreciation for the realistic portrayal of Middle America. Generally speaking, however, there were serious doubts about whether the show <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to stay on the}} air very long, though it has since gone on to complete five seasons. The episode's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing, though it did relatively well among men aged 18 to 34.|$|E

5|$|Fowler {{signed with}} the North Queensland Fury on 4 February 2009 and became their inaugural marquee player; with his family {{relocating}} to Townsville for the 2009–10 season of the Australian A-League.

50|$|A similar {{force was}} raised in North Carolina, however, even after a small victory over some colonists this force was not seen as a great benefit to the British Military.
