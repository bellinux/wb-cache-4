2500|$|The {{band members}} grew their hair long and allied {{themselves}} to the glam rock movement of the early 1970s. Hill's stage costumes also became notable during this period. Many of Holder's costumes during this period, including the trademark mirror top hat, were made by Dorothy [...] "Dolly" [...] Annakin—a sister of Holder's friend Ron Annakin. Chandler now demanded the band write a follow-up single themselves which led to Lea and Holder writing [...] "Coz I Luv You". The song was written {{in half an hour}} and started a writing partnership which would continue throughout Slade's career. Upon hearing the track played to him acoustically, a pleased Chandler predicted the song would make number one. While recording, the band felt the song's sound to be too soft, and so clapping was added. The song's misspelled title also became a trademark for Slade while causing a furor among British school teachers. The attendant appearance on BBC Television's Top of the Pops brought Slade to a wider audience as well as pushing [...] "Coz I Luv You" [...] to number one in the UK charts. In November 1971, NME reported that Slade had turned down a multimillion-dollar campaign, including a television series and a heavily promoted tour of the US. [...] "But", commented Holder, [...] "acceptance would have meant the cancellation of many commitments here – and the last thing we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> mess around the people who have put us where we are".|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} the album, and its title track, is a {{reference}} to Robert Louis Stevenson novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
