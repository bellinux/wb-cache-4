25|$|Many historians {{consider}} these {{to be merely}} the immediate causes of the war. They <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> underlying cause was the growing resentment {{on the part of}} Sparta and its allies at the dominance of Athens over Greek affairs. The war lasted 27 years, partly because Athens (a naval power) and Sparta (a land-based military power) found it difficult {{to come to grips with}} each other.|$|E
50|$|In Keynesian terms, {{followers}} of Say's law <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> on <b>the</b> aggregate level, {{there is only}} a transactions demand for money. That is, there is no precautionary, finance, or speculative demand for money. Money is held for spending, and increases in money supplies lead to increased spending.|$|R

25|$|The figures do {{not include}} the cost of {{operating}} military resources deployed to provide aid, and it is unclear how this should be quantified. While some would argue that military resources are already paid for and that the relief effort can be regarded as a logistics training exercise, the increased operational costs are an unbudgeted expenditure. Others <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> military resources provide the only infrastructure that will deliver aid in a timely manner to save lives to the hardest hit and neediest areas, and without this quickly deployable infrastructure the other contributions, no matter how large would be useless or arrive too late.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between icastic and phantastic imitation, concepts borrowed from Plato, {{is also important}} in Mazzoni’s work. Icastic imitation refers to the recreation of something based in reality – a simulation of a real person or {{the creation of a}} character based on a real person is icastic imitation. Phantastic imitation is the imitation of something completely the artist’s imagination. This distinction would {{play an important role in}} Mazzoni’s On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante, in which he <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> work, being allegorical and based in a divine vision, was icastic mimesis because it imitates something “real.” This was meant to counter arguments by writers such as Castravilla who dismissed Dante’s work as lacking in verisimilitude and even claimed that the comedy was not poetry at all, as it was simply the recounting of a vision. Under Mazzoni’s definitions, these were not valid criticisms, as poetry was essentially mimesis made “persuasive” by the use of craft or art.|$|E
2500|$|This idea {{of nature}} is also {{reflected}} in Philip C. Kolin's analysis of {{the last part of}} the poem as well. [...] Kolin's observation of Shakespeare's discussion of the man being for [...] "women's pleasure" [...] does not lend itself to this idea of bisexuality or gender-bending at all. Kolin is saying that nature made him for [...] "women's pleasure" [...] and that is what is [...] "natural". [...] Kolin goes on to say that the phrase [...] "to my purpose nothing" [...] also reflects this natural aspect of being created for women's pleasure. In this, however, he takes no account of Shakespeare's common pun of [...] "nothing" [...] ("O") to mean vagina. [...] Whereas Stackhouse would argue the poem is almost gender neutral, Kolin <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poem is [...] "playful" [...] and [...] "sexually (dualistic)".|$|E

50|$|The general {{applicability}} of the approach has led to some criticisms that it is functionalist, non-emancipatory or supports {{the status quo and}} existing power structures; this is a claim <b>that</b> users <b>would</b> deny, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> methodology itself can be none of these, it is the user of <b>the</b> methodology <b>that</b> may choose to employ it in such a way.|$|R

2500|$|The historicity of the Trojan War {{is still}} subject to debate. Most {{classical}} Greeks {{thought that the}} war was a historical event, but many believed that the Homeric poems had exaggerated the events to suit the demands of poetry. For instance, the historian Thucydides, who is known for being critical, considers it a true event but doubts that 1,186 ships were sent to Troy. Euripides started changing Greek myths at will, including those of the Trojan War. Near year 100, Dio Chrysostom argued that while the war was historical, it ended with the Trojans winning, and the Greeks attempted to hide that fact. [...] Around 1870 it was generally agreed in Western Europe that the Trojan War had never happened and Troy never existed. Then Heinrich Schliemann popularized his excavations at Hisarlik, which he and others believed to be Troy, and of the Mycenaean cities of Greece. Today many scholars agree that the Trojan War is based on a historical core of a Greek expedition against the city of Troy, but few <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Homeric poems faithfully represent the actual events of the war.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Somers, {{president}} of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia in 2007 article has emphasized the influence of American private investments for Russian democracy, {{as well as the}} amount of local support for them: [...] "In a nutshell, the booming Russian economy is transforming that nation's outlook, standard of living and opportunities for its people in ways that were unimaginable only five years ago. More than 10 million Russian citizens have traveled abroad. Private enterprise is thriving. Russians are happier, healthier and more optimistic than ever in their lives. And, contrary to what you might hear, surveys show that the Russian people are as pro-American, if not more so, than the populations of many a European country, and most hope for closer relations with the United States." [...] He also said: [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> American business community has played a not insignificant role in fostering these developments. By their willingness to invest in Russia's future, American companies have become effective ambassadors for the United States and its values, while creating new jobs and benefiting the economies of both our countries. And the Putin government has been supportive of these efforts in ways that some might find surprising. Russian officials go to considerable lengths to be cooperative and accommodate the needs of American business, {{while at the same time}} revising their regulations to align them more closely with international standards." ...|$|E

60|$|On {{the other}} hand there were some whose names had been {{obviously}} {{the result of a}} sense of propriety in some one. Among the men who were rabidly set on distinguishing themselves {{in one way or another}} was a Major Beak. Now, why was it that this Major's nose was an aquiline of the most outrageous dimensions? Surely no one <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nose grew to accommodate the name. Is it not more probable--nay, certain-- that the name grew to accommodate the nose? Of course when Major Beak was born he was a minor, and his nose must have been no better than a badly-shaped button or piece of putty; but the Major's father had owned a tremendous aquiline nose, which at birth had also been a button, and so on we can proceed backwards until we drive the Beaks into that remote antiquity where historical fact begins and mythological theory terminates--that period when men were wont, it is supposed, to name each other intelligently with reference to personal characteristic or occupation.|$|E

50|$|One {{question}} that splits critics {{is whether the}} Merchant's tale is a fabliau.

Derek Pearsall, for example, is in favour of this view. Some critics, such as Maurice Hussey, feel that Chaucer offers a great deal more sophistication and philosophical insight to put this on a level above fabliau.|$|R

40|$|This article {{questions}} {{whether we can}} posit a more radical desuturing of the law from the event: Can radical shifts in law produce events?

60|$|But {{though no}} {{accusation}} of unfairness has, {{as far as}} I am aware, ever {{been made by the}} government of Washington against the government of England, {{there can be no doubt}} that a very strong feeling of antipathy to England has sprung up in America during this war, and that it is even yet so intense in its bitterness that, were the North to become speedily victorious in their present contest, very many Americans would be anxious to turn their arms at once against Canada. And I fear that that fight between the Monitor and the Merrimac has strengthened this wish by giving to the Americans an unwarranted confidence in their capability of defending themselves against any injury from British shipping. It may be said by them, and probably would be said by many of them, that this feeling of enmity had not been engendered by any idea of national injustice on our side; that it might reasonably exist, though no suspicion of such injustice had arisen in the minds of any.
