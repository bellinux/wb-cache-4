5|$|P.T. {{centers on}} an unnamed protagonist who awakens in a concrete-lined room, and opens {{a door to}} a haunted corridor, in which he can only <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> hallway which {{continuously}} loops and redecorates itself. The first time he passes, a radio reports on a familicide, which was committed by the father, and later mentions two other cases exactly like it.|$|E
5|$|Several walking {{trails in}} the park vary in hiking {{difficulty}} on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility make {{it one of the}} most visited sites {{in the park}}. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half a mile long. It loops through a canopy of hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), and a variety of epiphytes. Twenty eight miles (45km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors to <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to Swietenia mahagoni) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of mosquitoes and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.|$|E
25|$|The {{estate is}} bounded {{on the east}} by Annandale Road, on the north by the Saw Kill and the west by the river. A tree-lined {{driveway}} from the road leads west to a visitor center and parking lot next to an orchard. From there it is short <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> grove of trees to an open lawn {{in front of the}} main house, atop a bluff overlooking the river and the Catskill Escarpment across it in the distance.|$|E

25|$|Moor Street {{station is}} 660 yards (600 metres) away from New Street station; the city's main railway station. There is a signposted route for {{passengers}} travelling between New Street and Moor Street stations which involves a short <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> tunnel under the Bullring shopping centre. Although the railway lines into New Street pass directly underneath Moor Street station, {{there is no}} track connection. In 2013 a new direct walkway was opened between the two stations making interchange easier.|$|E
25|$|Museum L-A: Museum L-A is {{a museum}} in a former textile factory building. It honors {{the people who worked}} and lived in this community. At Museum L-A {{visitors}} can <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> simulated production line, then view exhibits covering the textile, shoe, and brick industries that once thrived in Lewiston and Auburn. The museum is currently located in Bates Mill Number 4 in the Bates Mill Complex. In June 2009 the museum acquired Camden Mill and plans on moving to those facilities once it is refurbished.|$|E
25|$|The Theodore Roosevelt Nature Center at Jones Beach State Park {{includes}} an exhibit area which depicts {{a variety of}} marine habitats, such as the South Shore Estuary Reserve, the seashore, and the dune environment. Inside the building, children may feel live marine animals and look through a microscope; outdoors, visitors may dig up whale bones in the Discovery Bone Cove, <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> butterfly garden, view a shipwreck, or walk along a boardwalk through the dune environment. The center also offers interpretive programs for organized groups and the general public.|$|E

25|$|During Fischer’s {{years at}} The Iowa Writers’ Workshop, he met poets {{associated}} with the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry movement of the seventies and eighties. After receiving his MFA in poetry from the University of Iowa in 1970, he moved to San Francisco where he remained {{associated with the}} movement, writing language-centered avant-garde poetry with a spiritual bent and publishing his first poems in 1979. His first collection Like a <b>Walk</b> <b>Through</b> <b>a</b> Park (Open Books, 1980) comprises poems written at Tassajara Zen Mountain Monastery, where he was in residence with poets Jane Hirshfield and Philip Whalen. After Whalen’s death in 2003, Fischer became his literary executor.|$|E
25|$|Ford usually {{gave his}} actors little {{explicit}} direction, although on occasion he would casually <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> scene himself, and actors {{were expected to}} note every subtle action or mannerism; if they did not, Ford would make them repeat the scene until they got it right, and he would often berate and belittle those who failed to achieve his desired performance. On The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Ford ran through a scene with Edmond O'Brien and ended by drooping his hand over a railing. O'Brien noticed this but deliberately ignored it, placing {{his hand on the}} railing instead; Ford would not explicitly correct him and he reportedly made O'Brien play the scene forty-two times before the actor relented and did it Ford's way.|$|E
25|$|In modern language, Euler {{shows that}} the {{possibility}} of a <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> graph, traversing each edge exactly once, depends on the s of the nodes. The degree of a node is the number of edges touching it. Euler's argument shows that a necessary condition for the walk of the desired form is that the graph be connected and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree. This condition turns out also to be sufficient—a result stated by Euler and later proven by Carl Hierholzer. Such a walk is now called an Eulerian path or Euler walk in his honor. Further, if there are nodes of odd degree, then any Eulerian path will start at one of them and end at the other. Since the graph corresponding to historical Königsberg has four nodes of odd degree, it cannot have an Eulerian path.|$|E

25|$|St Stephen's Entrance, roughly in {{the middle}} of the building's western front, is the {{entrance}} for members of the public. From there, visitors <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> flight of stairs to St Stephen's Hall, location of a collection of marbles, which includes Somers Mansfield, Hampden, Walpole, Pitt and Fox. Traversal of this hallway brings them to the octagonal Central Lobby, the hub of the Palace. This hall is flanked by symmetrical corridors decorated with fresco paintings, which lead to the ante-rooms and debating chambers of the two Houses: the Members' Lobby and Commons Chamber to the north, and the Peers' Lobby and Lords Chamber to the south. Another mural-lined corridor leads east to the Lower Waiting Hall and the staircase to the first floor, where the river front is occupied by a row of 16 committee rooms. Directly below them, the libraries of the two Houses overlook the Thames from the principal floor.|$|E
25|$|In Manhunt {{there are}} two teams of four. One team is the hunters, {{the other is the}} hunted. Each team looks like a {{specific}} character and takes turns being the hunter and the hunted. Hunters obtain points by assassinations, while the hunted obtain points from escapes, stuns, and remaining hidden. The team with the highest score wins. In Chest Capture {{there are two}} teams of four. One team is the hunters, and the other is the hunted who need to steal chests by standing close to them. Each team looks like a specific character and takes turns being the hunter and the hunted. Hunters obtain points by assassinations, while the hunted obtain points from escapes, stuns, and stealing chests. The team with the highest score wins. The Escort mode sees one team of four players protecting a wandering NPC while the other team of four tries to assassinate him. There are two NPCs to protect at a time and they <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> series of checkpoints, which are visible to both teams. When an escorted NPC is killed, another is synchronized. This mode has two rounds with each team playing once as an escort and once as assassins.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels around the back of the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> dimly lit corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors up the stairs to the station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|E

500|$|Lead vocalist Mark Hall {{says that}} [...] "Praise You In This Storm" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's experience with a young girl, Erin Browning. The band made arrangements to meet Erin, who had performed a dance at her public school to one of the band's songs, and her family on Valentine's Day 2004 before one of their concerts. Right around the time the band connected with Erin and her family was when she was found to have cancer. Erin died on November 1, 2004. According to Hall, [...] "Watching [...] walk through this really showed me truth about my worship. Watching her <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> real storm showed me that my worship was extremely situational". Hall began writing the song before Erin's death and told her about it, but was not able to complete it before she died.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts out}} with Psy, who is {{lounging}} at {{what looks like}} a sandy beach, under a sun umbrella and holding a cold drink, but the camera zooms out to reveal he is actually at a playground. The video then alternates between the playground, where a boy (Hwang Min-woo) dances next to him; and a row of horses in stalls, where Psy performs his signature [...] "invisible horse dance". As Psy (and two girls) <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> parking garage, they are pelted by pieces of newspaper, trash, and snow. At a sauna, he rests his head on a man's shoulder, dressed in blue, while another man covered in tattoos is stretching. He then sings in front of two men playing Janggi (Korean chess), dances with a woman at a tennis court, and bounces around on a tour bus of seniors. The scenes alternate quickly until there is an explosion near the chess players, causing them to dive off the bench. Psy immediately walks towards the camera, pointing and shouting [...] "Oppan Gangnam Style". The chorus starts as he and some dancers perform at a horse stable. He dances as two women walk backwards. He dances at the tennis court, a carousel, and the tour bus. He shuffles into an outdoor yoga session and on a boat. The camera zooms in on a woman's butt, then shows Psy [...] "yelling" [...] at it.|$|E
