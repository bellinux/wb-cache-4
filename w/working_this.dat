5|$|Bavetta was one {{of three}} referees for the Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Kings and the Lakers. Former referee Tim Donaghy has alleged {{that at least one of}} the referees <b>working</b> <b>this</b> game had {{subjective}} motives for wanting the Lakers to defeat the Kings, and made officiating calls to effectuate this outcome. The NBA has not permitted Bavetta to speak publicly regarding the incident, though The New York Times reported on June 12, 2008 that the FBI is investigating allegations that Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals had been manipulated to further the series to a seventh game. Even the television announcers commented on how obvious it was that the fix was in.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 a jadeitite axehead {{was found}} {{alongside}} the track; {{it is thought}} to have been placed there as an offering. One of over 100similar axe heads found in Britain and Ireland, its good condition and its precious material suggest that it was a symbolic axe, rather than one used to cut wood. Because of the difficulty of <b>working</b> <b>this</b> material, which was derived from the Alpine area of Europe, all the axe heads of this type found in Great Britain are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange. Radiocarbon dating of the peat in which the axe head was discovered suggests that it was deposited in about 3200 BC. Wooden artefacts found at the site include paddles, a dish, arrow shafts, parts of four hazel bows, a throwing axe, yew pins, digging sticks, a mattock, a comb, toggles, and a spoon fragment. Finds made from other materials, such as flint flakes, arrowheads, and a chipped flint axe (in mint condition) have also been made.|$|E

25|$|The {{early days}} of the {{settlement}} were chaotic and difficult. With limited supplies, the cultivation of food was imperative, but the soils around Sydney were poor, the climate was unfamiliar, and moreover very few of the convicts had any knowledge of agriculture. The colony {{was on the verge of}} outright starvation for an extended period. The marines, poorly disciplined themselves in many cases, were not interested in convict discipline. Almost at once, therefore, Phillip had to appoint overseers from among the ranks of the convicts to get the others <b>working.</b> <b>This</b> was the beginning of the process of convict emancipation which was to culminate in the reforms of Lachlan Macquarie after 1811.|$|E

25|$|During the 1983 season, Martin was {{involved}} {{in one of the}} most controversial regular season games, known as the Pine Tar Incident, where umpires nullified a go-ahead home run by Yankee nemesis, Kansas City Royals third baseman George Brett, when Martin protested that there was too much pine tar on his bat. Ultimately, American League President Lee MacPhail ruled in favor of the Royals' protest, reinstating the home run, and replaying the game from the point of the nullification. At the start of the replayed game, Martin tried to protest on the grounds that Brett had missed a base. The umpires <b>working</b> <b>this</b> game, however, had anticipated this, and had obtained an affidavit from the crew who had worked the original game saying that Brett had indeed touched all the bases.|$|E
25|$|At Thanbyuzayat, {{other groups}} of prisoners would {{gradually}} {{be brought into the}} camp, and these would come under Varley's jurisdiction such that he was eventually responsible for 9,000 men in total. To manage A Force, he had a small headquarters, with departments responsible for food, medical care and so forth. During his time in Burma, Varley constantly agitated to improve conditions as much as possible for the men under his command. He also tried to keep as many men as possible <b>working.</b> <b>This</b> meant that a possibly more cordial relationship existed with the Japanese at Thanbyuzayat than elsewhere, to the benefit of the welfare of the men under his charge. The Japanese commander also seemed to be more lenient than other commandants in charge of prison camps in the region.|$|E
25|$|On March 30, 1911, Augustus Charles Kick, an {{experienced}} {{man who had}} served as Sechelts chief engineer from about March 4 to March 17, 1911, testified that her bilge pumps were inadequate and she tended to ship {{a lot of water}} when the engine was <b>working,</b> <b>this</b> was apparently the result of the loss of two of her propeller blades. The engineer considered Sechelt unstable unless she were well-ballasted, and if cargo were carried only on the main deck (instead the hold, which was entirely used for a coal bunker except for some ballast forward), in his opinion her instability would increase. The engineer testified that he had left Sechelt for this reason. Kick described the weather conditions {{on the day of the}} sinking, which he ascribed entirely to the vessel's instability.|$|E

25|$|The shaft was {{elevated}} as {{it moved}} toward the Confederate lines to make sure moisture did not clog up the mine, and fresh air was drawn in via an ingenious air-exchange mechanism near the entrance. A canvas partition isolated the miners' air supply from outside air (also allowing miners to easily enter and exit the work area). The miners had constructed a vertical exhaust shaft located well behind Union lines. At the vertical shaft's base, a fire was kept continuously burning. A wooden duct ran {{the entire length of}} the tunnel and protruded into the outside air. The fire heated stale air inside of the tunnel, drawing it up the exhaust shaft and out of the mine via the chimney effect. The resulting vacuum then sucked fresh air in from the mine entrance via the wooden duct, which carried it down the length of the tunnel to the location where the miners were <b>working.</b> <b>This</b> precluded the need for additional ventilation shafts that could have been observed by the enemy, and served well in disguising the diggers' progress.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} several costs {{associated}} with circular migration. One of these is brain drain, where a migrant who migrates because of skills or education creates a loss of human resources {{in the country of}} origin. These highly skilled workers are in demand in the more developed countries, where in some areas the barriers to immigration have been reduced to allow for both permanent and temporary migration. At the same time, barriers against unskilled workers have been strengthened. The ability to use skills also varies and can constitute a cost to the migrant and the economy, If the migrants had unskilled jobs while working abroad, they will have little experience that will {{contribute to the development of}} their home country upon return. Additionally, even if the worker learned new technical or industrial skills, they may not be able to use them if their country of origin does not have the infrastructure or institutional framework to support them. Circular migration also has a social impact on the families of migrant workers. If labor migrants have children, these minors may be temporarily abandoned while their parents are abroad <b>working.</b> <b>This</b> issue is problematic and some authorities have begun to formulate policies to monitor the situation.|$|E

There were to be chapters on Chaudel, Iron Teeth, Wooden Leg, and Tangled Yellow Hair. However, Marquis developed a particularly strong relationship with Wooden Leg, whose lengthy narrative eventually became a separate book, A Warrior Who Fought Custer. Also covered separately was Kate Big Head's narrative, published as She Watched Custer's Last Battle. Another narrative included in The Cheyennes is, [...] "A Cheyenne Old Man". Though the man was not named by Marquis, a photograph of him {{was included in the}} book, and he was subsequently identified as Sun Bear, a veteran of both the Fetterman Fight and the Custer battle.|$|E
500|$|As {{usual for}} him, Yankovic sought {{permission}} from the original artists for his parodies; in contrast to previous albums, he had few difficulties in obtaining these. Yankovic stated [...] "This {{is the first time}} where I've gotten everybody that I wanted, and I couldn't be happier about it." [...] He was able to get Pharrell Williams' permission for three of the songs he represented on the album, Williams' [...] "Happy", Robin Thicke's [...] "Blurred Lines", and [...] "Get Lucky", through a personal email to the artist after Yankovic's manager had difficulty <b>working</b> <b>this</b> with Williams' manager; according to Yankovic, Williams was [...] "honored" [...] to have his work used by Yankovic.

500|$|A {{murder of}} giant crows attacks the {{vegetable}} car during the drive, forcing Wirt to veer {{off into a}} cornfield and crash into a scarecrow pole, which scares off the crows. Crops then reveals that they have arrived at the [...] "big city," [...] {{which turns out to}} be an old-fashioned small farm community {{in the middle of the}} cornfield. While Wirt and Beatrice try to repair the car, Greg wanders off with Crops and they explore the city's gazebo garden party. Crops then bumps into a woman made of cabbage. Crops apologizes and there's a sudden announcement that the party's scheduled entertainment has been cancelled. Greg tells Crops that he could fill in for the party with his guitar and singing abilities, and the woman finds herself flattered after learning that Crops is a musician. Back at the car, Wirt, who can't figure out how to fix the vehicle as all it is to him is a cluster of vegetables, and Beatrice, who recommends that all he had to do was turn the crank on the car's front bumper to start the engine, knock over the scarecrow as they leave with the car <b>working.</b> <b>This</b> summons the giant crows, as well as giant turkeys, who terrorize the city and its vegetable inhabitants. Wirt and Beatrice drive up and pick up Greg, while Crops continues to woo the woman with his music, unaware of the chaos around him, even as a crow attacks one of the members of the band he's performing with and as Wirt tries to get his attention. As Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice attempt to escape without Crops, they are set upon by the giant animals, who start to devour the vegetable car. As Wirt tries to fend them off, Greg suddenly jumps out of the car unnoticed. Suddenly, they hear Greg's screams from the cornfield. The screams continue, until Wirt and Beatrice finally find Greg in the cornfield, unharmed and yelling with joy as he had finally found a goose big enough for them to ride. The city becomes peaceful once more, as Greg's screams had scared the birds off forever, and John Crops goes back to his countryside home with his soulmate, the cabbage woman. Wirt, Gregory, Beatrice, and their new companion Goose, continue to travel onwards, deeper and deeper, into the Unknown.|$|E
