5|$|Feynman was a keen popularizer {{of physics}} through both books and lectures, {{including}} a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume {{publication of his}} undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and <b>What</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Care</b> What Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.|$|E

500|$|Feynman devoted {{the latter}} half of his book <b>What</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Care</b> What Other People Think? to his {{experience}} on the Rogers Commission, straying from his usual convention of brief, light-hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative. Feynman's account reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts. For instance, NASA managers claimed that there was a 1 in 100,000 chance of a catastrophic failure aboard the shuttle, but Feynman discovered that NASA's own engineers estimated the chance of a catastrophe at closer to 1 in 200. He concluded that NASA management's estimate of the reliability of the space shuttle was unrealistic, and he was particularly angered that NASA used it to recruit Christa McAuliffe into the Teacher-in-Space program. He warned in his appendix to the commission's report (which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report), [...] "For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Hockney {{perceives}} {{music as}} color, shape, and configuration and uses these perceptions when painting opera stage sets (though not while creating his other artworks). Kandinsky combined four senses: color, hearing, touch, and smell. Nabokov described his grapheme-color synesthesia at length in his autobiography, Speak, Memory, and portrayed {{it in some}} of his characters. In addition to Messiaen, whose three types of complex colors are rendered explicitly in musical chord structures that he invented, other composers who reported synesthesia include Duke Ellington, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Jean Sibelius. Michael Torke is a contemporary example of a synesthetic composer. Physicist Richard Feynman describes his colored equations in his autobiography, <b>What</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Care</b> What Other People Think? ...|$|E

If you were infatuated by my unlucky beauty, I loved devotedly on my side.

A man doesn't {{want to talk}} politics to his wife, and <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think I <b>care</b> for Betty's views upon the Differential Calculus? A man wants a wife who can cook his dinner and look after his children. I've tried both and I know. Let's have the pudding in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Doing myself well!" [...] he repeated, with fierce contempt.

But you--what do you care? You went to town to get a job--and you come back with new mackerel spinners! You are off fishing to-morrow morning with Jimmy Dumble.

You have no heart, and you have no mind, or you would have understood that it was for you, for your happiness I was working. I wanted to be rich; I wanted to get away from here. I wanted to see white men bowing low before the power of your beauty and your wealth. Old as I am I wished to seek a strange land, a civilisation to which I am a stranger, so as to find a new life in the contemplation of your high fortunes, of your triumphs, of your happiness. For that I bore patiently the burden of work, of disappointment, of humiliation amongst these savages here, and I had it all nearly in my grasp." ...|$|E
6000|$|I did {{not think}} that you would much like the 'Duchess May;' but among the profanum vulgus you cannot think how {{successful}} it has been.

And I believe he hated everybody and everything. But I think he was afraid to die. I believe I am the only man who ever stood up to him. I faced him in that cabin where you live now, when he was sick, and I cowed him then. He thought I was going to twist his neck for him. If he had had his way we would have been beating up against the Nord-East monsoon, as long as he lived and afterward, too, for ages and ages. Acting the Flying Dutchman in the China Sea! Ha! Ha!" ...|$|R
