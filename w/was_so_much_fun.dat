5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
500|$|In early August 2010, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that Eric the Actor, from The Howard Stern Show, had been cast {{for a small}} role in the new season's second episode. Deaf actor Russell Harvard portrayed Joe, {{a man who is}} able to survive the box being opened only to be killed by Fauxlivia. Harvard later commented in an interview, [...] "Fringe <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> and not even stressful compared to [...] Hamill. It was very fast and rapid. Playing the dead guy was very easy. Working with Anna Torv <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun,</b> she is a great, great actress and very sweet. I did not think she would be that kind of person." [...] He continued, [...] "There was a stunt which {{she did not want to}} do herself, but I told her 'You want to be authentic so I want you to pull me,' so she obliged. It was a great experience and so much fun and I wish I could have stayed on the show for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Kim Manners {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Not a great show, but a good one. It's {{a lighter}} show. There {{is a lot of}} humor in it, but I think it's a hit with fans because there is some {{wonderful}} Mulder and Scully's relationship stuff. The entire third act is {{just the two of them}} talking, which is actually kind of interesting. The scene where Mulder and Scully talk while stranded on a rock included approximately 10 pages of dialogue. Gillian Anderson said of the scene: [...] "I loved that. That <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun,</b> and I think it was written really well... It was just neat to have us separated from everything and stuck on this island where we could wax philosophical and kind of tell the truth to each other in strange ways." [...] Character Dr. Paul Farraday was named after English scientist, Michael Faraday, maybe.|$|E

Looking back, Totter stated in August 1999, [...] "The bad girls <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> to play. I wouldn't have wanted to play Coleen's good-girl parts." ...|$|R
5000|$|Paranoid {{is among}} the most {{critically}} acclaimed Dollar Babies. Rolling Stone magazine's David Wild said of the film [...] "Rarely has paranoia <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun...</b> Jay Holben has created a stunning and artful rendering of madness, turning a poem by Stephen King into a vivid and compelling nightmare vision." ...|$|R
500|$|The cast enjoyed {{shooting}} at the mall, but were faced with fans [...] "in full force." [...] Crowds followed them while shooting, holding up camera phones and yelling Carell's name. Flannery said of the episode, [...] "We shot some really fun stuff with Steve and the ladies just running around the mall. The food-court scene <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> Steve is an amazing actor." [...] Lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret agreed to close their store {{to the public for}} filming. In the episode, Angela reveals that she wears large sizes of clothes purchased from American Girl, a doll store chain, but will not shop at children's retailer Gap Kids because it is [...] "too flashy." [...] In the DVD audio commentary, Kinsey remarked that after the episode broadcast, people would bring up American Girl Doll catalogs for her to sign. Passerby also yelled out Carell's name during the scene where Pam changes a tire.|$|E
500|$|After Underwood's Play On Tour {{ended in}} December 2010, {{she started to}} work on her then-untitled fourth studio album. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts, worked on a track titled [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{and sent it to}} the singer. Underwood loved the song and recorded it, also naming her album Blown Away as it was the song that defined the album's darker direction. She then started writing material with several songwriters, including Hillary Lindsey and Kear. Together, the trio wrote [...] "Two Black Cadillacs", which is about two women finding out that they both are involved in a relationship with the same man and set their differences aside to kill him. Underwood said that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> to write and just be in that room" [...] with Lindsey and Kear, as they [...] "didn't really know what to expect or where we were headed or what we would end up with." [...] Kear described the writing session: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} how they worked {{hard to make the}} {{animation}} believable, saying: [...] "It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator {{to be able to put}} some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way." ...|$|E
5000|$|Johnston {{and fellow}} musicians Jay Moran, James [...] "Pie" [...] Cowan, Duke Erikson, and Butch Vig perform {{occasional}} shows as a covers band called [...] "The Know-it-All Boyfriends". Vig put the ensemble together for his brother's Christmas party, and {{it proved to}} <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> that they decided to keep going.|$|R
5000|$|Mizuguchi {{has also}} stated that Space Channel 5 was {{inspired}} by the dance troupe Stomp. He highly enjoyed the performance, and began thinking why musicals <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun,</b> but more importantly [...] "How can we get this feeling into an interactive process?". It was then that Space Channel 5 was born.|$|R
2500|$|The Rhino Party also {{declared}} that, {{should they}} somehow actually win an election, they would immediately dissolve and force a second election: [...] "We Rhinos think that elections <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun,</b> {{we want to}} hold them all the time". They also declared victory after one election, claiming all candidates were Rhinoceroses, whether they knew or acknowledged it: thick-skinned, short-sighted, mean-tempered, etc.|$|R
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun for us because we got to go back to our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{aimed to}} {{demonstrate}} variety in the lyrics on their self-titled debut album, a fact expanded upon by James: [...] "Some songs {{are inspired by}} dreams, fantasizing, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. This Language is an anti-war song, Exit is just an explosion and Bluetrace is trippy, with the second half like a primal scream. We {{just wanted to make}} a lot of noise!" [...] In regards to their second album, the band aimed for an increased sense of maturity and self-awareness, and wanted to focus less on [...] "break-ups and such things" [...] and more on [...] "longing, searching, loving, life, death, magic, lust and forgiveness," [...] according to James. [...] "We've also developed our relationships off the stage as well. This album <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> because it was like five best mates playing around in a studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Oliver {{was also}} an {{acclaimed}} artist with his work being displayed in exhibitions depicting Rhondda life. There are slight variations with the cover in different territories with some showing {{the shadow of the}} figure with wings - either angels wings or more likely bird wings. This is best depicted in an official promotional colour wallpaper the band released for fans. Whilst it has never been clarified, the city in the background is believed to depict Los Angeles in the United States where the album was recorded and mixed. Ian Watkins said that he regarded artwork as [...] "just as important as the music", and in January 2010 reflected back on some of the Lostprophets' artwork saying [...] "I remember doing the ‘Start Something’ record and compiling the inlay which is a collage of two years of our lives. It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> I’d sit there for hours looking at the booklet and all the little pictures. I did that to all the albums I bought." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brodsky told book {{reviewer}} Ella Johnson, in a 2011 interview:Encourage {{your kids}} to read, read, read! Then when they're older, they'll have tons of images and stories in their heads. When they're asked to write something, they can 'reach inside' and pull out something in their imagination. That's what happened to me. Writing is whatever you make it, and it's yours. It can <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun!</b> ...|$|R

On June 24, 2011, [...] "Countdown" [...] was the ninth song to be chosen. The quote found Beyoncé elaborating on the song's inspiration: [...] "I really liked mixing the 90s with the 70s.

"The {{full circle}} poetry of my having written 'Uninvited' for its remake, {{combined}} with {{my love of}} the original movie... my love of Germany, having lived there for three years as a child (by the Black Forest), combined most importantly with how this video is such a visual extension of the song 'Guardian,' which {{is so close to}} my heart… it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> to make it in Berlin!." ...|$|E
