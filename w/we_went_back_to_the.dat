500|$|A Watch Tower Society {{staff member}} {{said of the}} {{announcement}} of Rutherford's death, [...] "It was at noontime when the family was assembled for lunch. ... The announcement was brief. There were no speeches. No one took the day off to mourn. Rather, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> factory and worked harder than ever." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When we {{got them}} {{surrounded}} the fight was over in one hour. There was so much dust we could not see much, but the Indians rode around and yelled the war-whoop and shot into the soldiers {{as fast as they}} could until they were all dead. One soldier was running away to the east but Crazy Horse saw him and jumped on his pony and went after him. He got him about half a mile from the place where the other soldiers were lying dead. The smoke was lifted so we could see a little. We got off our horses and went and took the rings and money and watches from the soldiers. We took some clothes off too, and all the guns and pistols. We got seven hundred guns and pistols. Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> women and children and got them together that were not killed or hurt." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Gamasutra, Twisted Pixel CEO Michael Wilford {{revealed}} that though the developers had plans for downloadable content from the beginning, decisions {{on what would}} be included in that content were not made until after the game was released. [...] " [...] didn't work on {{them in any way}} until after the main game was wrapped," [...] stated Wilford. [...] "Once the game was out of our hands, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drawing board to design everything from scratch, but we obviously had a lot of half-finished pieces on the cutting room floor that we could leverage." [...] Wilford further explained that due to the way The Maw ends extending past the ending would not be possible. [...] Therefore, plans were made for the downloadable content to be dubbed [...] "Deleted Scenes"; levels that take place inside the story of the main game. Wilford was quick to note that these levels were not simply unlock codes that provided the player with access to things already in the game. [...] "I think some people took it to mean that we intentionally stripped out levels that were 100 percent complete only to sell them as DLC," [...] he said, adding that it was [...] "not the case." ...|$|E

60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house, where, of course, {{we looked}} at some wood work, agates, and all the et cetera.|$|E
60|$|After dinner <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drawing rooms again; {{and while}} tea and coffee were being served, names were {{constantly}} being announced, till {{the rooms were}} quite full.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{we are to}} {{hunt for}} Kenton, or count on {{learning}} what has become of him, {{would it not be}} better that <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canoe, and waited for the coming of day?" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house; the Sergeant {{requesting}} that I {{would give him}} a room to himself, and then send in the servants (the indoor servants only), one after another, in the order of their rank, from first to last.|$|E
6000|$|... "After this <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station, {{and then}} came home. I thought from the map that we should go through Paisley; but we did not. We went over it. We went over it, higher than {{the tops of the}} chimneys.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tavern hoping {{against hope}} that Legros {{had not yet}} turned out {{the pockets of the}} blouse, and that we might induce him, by threat or cajolery or the usurious {{interest}} of twenty-five sous, to grant his client a further twenty-four hours wherein to redeem the pledge.|$|E

6000|$|... "We didn't get out. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pool {{where we}} sent you. The pack-ponies were there, {{but you were}} gone. By George! I was mad, and then I was just broken up. I was... afraid you'd been burned. We {{weathered}} the fire all right, and then rode in to Holston. Now the mystery is where were you?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little lodging {{over the}} chandler's shop, and there I found an {{opportunity}} of repeating to Peggotty {{what he had}} said to me. She informed me, in return, that he had said the same to her that morning. She knew no more than I did, where he was going, but she thought he had some project shaped out in his mind.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> yard, {{in which}} I had left my travelling-bag. After putting a stick through the handle, and {{swinging}} the bag over his shoulder, Betteredge appeared to relapse into the bewilderment which my sudden appearance had caused, when I surprised {{him in the}} beehive chair. He looked incredulously at the house, and then he wheeled about, and looked more incredulously still at me.|$|E

6000|$|When <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cave {{we found}} Margaret {{sitting in the}} dark. She had {{switched}} off the electric light, and only a faint glow of the evening light came through the narrow openings. Her father went quickly {{over to her and}} put his arms round her in a loving protective way. She laid her head on his shoulder for a minute and seemed comforted. Presently she called to me: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "While we {{were there}} they called us {{to tell us that}} the machine was ready. So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inn. There were two {{machines}} ready at the door. One was for another party. There was a lady in that machine, and it was just starting. Ours was just starting, too. They told us that there was a steep hill at the beginning, and that it was customary for the gentlemen to walk up.|$|E
6000|$|We talked it all over. It wouldn't do {{to take to}} the shore; we couldn't {{take the}} raft up the stream, of course. There warn't no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work, and when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> raft about dark the canoe was gone! ...|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp. I {{lay down}} near the fire and fell asleep. Some time in the night I awoke. The fire was still burning brightly. Bud and Bill were lying with their backs to it almost close enough to scorch. Herky sat in his shirtsleeves. The smoke of his pipe and the smoke of the campfire wafted up together. Then I saw and {{felt that he had}} covered me with his coat and vest.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others whom {{we found}} {{crouched}} {{on the ground}} among the coffins, looking distinctly depressed. No wonder; night was closing in, the thunder was beginning to growl and echo through the forest and rain to fall in big drops. In short, although Stephen remarked that every cloud has a silver lining, a proverb which, as I told him, I seemed to have heard before, in no sense could the outlook be considered bright.|$|E
60|$|Every {{summer we}} had some hobby. The last summer before Dick and Mimi came we were crazy about kites. A winter boy on the {{mainland}} showed Claude how to make them, and when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Big Half Moon we made kites galore. Even pirating wasn't such good fun. Claude would go {{around to the other}} side of the Big Half Moon and we would play shipwrecked mariners signalling to each other with kites. Oh, it was very exciting.|$|E
