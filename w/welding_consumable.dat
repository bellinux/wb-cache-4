In the present study, susceptibility to hydrogen assisted cracking of DMR- 249 A steel welds made using this electrode has been assessed using implant test.

Although T-stubs {{have been used for}} many years to model the tension zone of bolted joints, the research was mainly concentrated on rolled profiles as T-stub elements. To extend this model to the case of welded plates as T-stub elements, a test programme was undertaken at the Delft University of Technology and is reported in this paper. It provides insight into the behaviour of this different type of assembly, in terms of resistance, stiffness, deformation capacity and failure modes, in particular. The key variables tested include the weld throat thickness, the size of the T-stub, the type and diameter of the bolts, the steel grade, the presence of transverse stiffeners and the T-stub orientation. The results show that the welding procedure is particularly important to ensure a ductile behaviour of the connection. Most of the T-stubs failed by tension fracture of the bolts after significant yielding of the flanges.

40|$|Welding of {{stainless}} steels can generate welding fumes containing carcinogenic hexavalent chromium (Cr + 6). To mitigate this problem, a new Ni-Cu-Pd <b>welding</b> <b>consumable</b> alloy has been developed. The {{addition of a}} small amount of Cu and Pd in Ni enhances the galvanic compatibility of Ni with stainless steels and improves its localized corrosion behavior. In this paper, the artificial pit electrode technique and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to study the benefits of Cu and Pd alloying. The passive film on Ni- 10 Cu- 1 Pd alloy mainly consisted of outer Ni-hydroxide and inner oxide, and the noble elements Pd and Cu apparently did not contribute to the formation of the passive film. However, Pd catalyzed the reduction of Cu at the bottom of artificial pits, which enhanced the cathodic reaction and thus ennobled the protection potential, making stable pit growth more difficult. This catalytic effect of Pd also prevented the propagation of deep pits in a test using a thin foil crevice sample. During welding {{of stainless}} steels (SS), the evaporation and oxidation of Cr from the molten weld pool can result in the generation of carcinogenic hexavalent chromium (Cr + 6) in the welding fume. 1, 2 The U.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this project is to {{increase}} the fatigue life of a welded-joint by 10 times and to reduce energy use by 25 % through product performance and productivity improvements using an integrated modeling approach. The fatigue strength of a welded-joint is currently the bottleneck to design high performance and lightweight welded structures using advanced materials such as high strength steels. In order to achieve high fatigue strength in a welded-joint it is necessary to manage the weld bead shape for lower stress concentration, produce preferable residual stress distribution, and obtain the desired microstructure for improved material toughness and strength. This is a systems challenge that requires the optimization of the welding process, the <b>welding</b> <b>consumable,</b> the base material, as well as the structure design. The concept of virtual welded-joint design has been proposed and established in this project. The goal of virtual welded-joint design is to develop a thorough procedure to predict the relationship of welding process, microstructure, property, residual stress, and the ultimate weld fatigue strength by a systematic modeling approach. The systematic approach combines five sub-models: weld thermal-fluid model, weld microstructure model, weld material property model, weld residual stress model, and weld fatigue model. The systematic approach is thus based on interdisciplinary applied sciences including heat transfer, computational fluid dynamics, materials science, engineering mechanics, and material fracture mechanics. The sub-models are based on existing models with further development. The results from modeling have been validated with critical experiments. The systematic modeling approach has been used to design high fatigue resistant welds considering the combined effects of weld bead geometry, residual stress, microstructure, and material property. In particular, a special welding wire has been developed in this project to introduce compressive residual stress at weld toe for weld fatigue resistance...|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} of high strength steels {{in terms of}} reduced material volume due to enhanced mechanical performance have been known for some time. Large diameter transmission linepipe steels of minimum 690 MPa ('X 1 OO') yield strength have been developed throughout the previous decade, and have recently become commercially available. Before these steels are used in linepipe construction projects, fimdamental work regarding their ability to be field welded required undertaking. This thesis presents data arising from girth welding experiments involving a variety of X 100 linepipe steels, welding consurnables and welding processes. Target girth weld mechanical properties thought suitable for a strain-based MOO pipeline design were proposed {{at the outset of}} the research. Optimisation of pulsed gas metal arc welding waveforms for the single and tandem wire processes, alongside the establishment of the base material properties formed an early part of the research. An extensive programme of solid wire <b>welding</b> <b>consumable</b> evaluation was then undertaken for single, tandem and dual torch narrow gap welding processes. The majority of equipment and procedures used throughout the work were as close to current field practice as possible, to minimise the time required to transfer the technology to the field situation. Work then focussed on the optimised alloy levels and welding procedure requirements for the production of full girth welds, using a variety of industry pipeline welding standards and supplemental techniques to assess the joint integrity. It has been demonstrated that, subject to careful selection of <b>welding</b> <b>consumable</b> and fairly precise control of welding process variables and parameters, there are no major problems in obtaining weld metal strength levels of at least 120 MPa above the 690 MPa specified minimum yield strength (SMYS) of the parent pipe. This objective has been achieved in welds made usirig all three mechanised process variants examined. The desired target properties of strength and toughness were achieved with a variety of consumables and pipe materials of different composition. Tie-in and repair procedures were also developed during the course of the research, with particular attention focussed on the application of high strength rutile flux cored ýVires. These wires attained strength levels overmatching the pipe specified minimum yield strength (690 MPa), but would not reach the guaranteed overmatch level of 81 OMPa. An examination of the thermocycles associated with four mechanised narrow gap welding techniques (single, tandem, dual and dual tandem) was undertaken. The experimental technique developed allowed the solidifying weld bead to be monitored, as well as the cumulative temperature cycles experienced by the underlying layers. Succesful determination of the cooling rates, times and transformation temperatures allowed a comparative evaluation of the four processes, using an optimum weld metal composition suitable for single wire welding of X 100. This led to an understanding of the metallurgical history, and its consequent effect on the associated mechanical and microstructural properties. A similar series of experiments was undertaken to examine these effects using variations in preheat with a single wire process. In most cases considerable property variations were attained for'the same weld metal chemistry, joint geometry and arc energy, highlighting the sensitivity of the process and procedure in achieving the required properties. The high cooling rates determined from the thermocycle experiments explained the microstructural and mechanical properties attainable from lean alloying levels. A series of metal cored wires, based around the same alloy as for the thermocycle experiments, was consequently manufactured to examine small changes in weld metal chemistry. The individual wires involved changes in carbon, nickel, molybdenum and chromium to examine potential property variations arising from a highly controlled narrow gap welding procedure. The results again highlighted the sensitivity of the narrow gap welding technique in generating considerable property variation within the weld metal. Tolerance ranges for specific alloying additions to attain the proposed strength levels with a single and tandem wire process were derived from the data.
