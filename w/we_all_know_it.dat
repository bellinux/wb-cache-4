500|$|One of Jenny's storylines {{in season}} two was her revelation of being sexually abused as a child. The events were portrayed {{in a series}} of flashbacks and dream sequences. Yet, this left viewers {{confused}} about what actually happened to Jenny. During an interview with LGBT monthly magazine The Advocate, Chaiken commented about the storyline: [...] "Well <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was an incident of sexual abuse. I had not wanted to be more explicit about it than that – one because memory of trauma is very strange. Who knows what happened to Jenny? Jenny doesn't necessarily know herself." ...|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on {{the success}} of the song in 2002, Vig admitted: [...] "People still ask us who the 'Stupid Girl' is, and that's {{impossible}} to answer. The song is sort of meant to be a wake up call. It could be about an ex-girlfriend. It could be about a rock diva that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> could be about your sister. It could also be called 'Stupid Boy'." [...] Looking back, he also stated, [...] "It's impossible to predict what will be a hit. But subconsciously, I knew the song was good when I kept playing the same rough mix over and over again on my car stereo for months." ...|$|E
2500|$|You pledged {{during the}} last debate {{that you would not}} raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of {{everything}} is going up, and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> Health care costs, as you all talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war. My question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children? ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1873, Congressman Sidney Clarke, who {{assisted}} in Caldwell's election, testified that Caldwell's campaign had claimed {{that it would}} pay $250,000 to secure the election. Kansas Governor Thomas Carney testified that he was paid $15,000 {{to drop out of}} the race. An investigation followed; its final report asked the Senate to expel Caldwell for not being [...] "duly and legally elected". On March 21, 1873, Ferry took to the floor of the Senate and gave a speech asking the Senate to expel Caldwell: [...] "The crime of bribery goes down to the very foundations of the institutions under which we live. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> and...we shall stifle our consciences if we do not vote to expel." [...] After a survey of the Senate, Caldwell saw his inevitability of being expelled, and resigned, on March 23.|$|E
2500|$|Graham {{always told}} me right early on {{that he would never}} get married. He told me that his life was devastated when his parents split up, and he said {{straight}} out, [...] "Mrs Fox, I'll never get married", so I never expected anything more of him than what did happen. Even when Lana Cantrell came into the scene I was puzzled and I did say to him why all this, and of course <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was good publicity. Lana came to the house and I had to go up, and have it all cleaned, ready for her and her party to come one Sunday night. And then on the Monday night, this great big announcement was going to be made that {{he was supposed to be}} engaged to Lana Cantrell. Well, the ratings went through the roof...|$|E

6000|$|... "In course <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it's</b> along of her ladyship's {{marriage}} which warn't no marriage," [...] {{said the}} cook.

6000|$|... "Oh, {{of course}} nobody would ask Mr. Campbell. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> {{would be of}} no use. He doesn't believe in {{missions}} at all--in fact, he says he detests the very mention of missions--and he never gives one cent to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Songbird, {{you take}} the loss of that money too much to heart," [...] he said kindly. [...] "Of course <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was a great loss. Yet it won't do to grieve over it too much. And besides, there is hope that some day the {{authorities}} will catch that Blackie Crowden and get {{at least part of}} the money back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{a terrible}} time. I was only a child, but I can {{remember}} how wild the men all seemed when you drove up and leaped out of the wagon. I didn't realize that my father's life depended on your coming, but <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was brave of you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Look, {{technically}} it's not plagiarized. It's not {{the same}} chord progression. It's a feeling. Because there's a cowbell in it and a Fender Rhodes as the main instrumentation—that still doesn't make <b>it</b> plagiarized. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it's</b> derivative. That's how Pharrell works. Everything that Pharrell produces is derivative of another song—but it's a homage.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{received}} universally positive critical reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called [...] "Romantic Expressionism" [...] {{his favorite}} {{episode of the}} series so far, giving it an 'A'. Jonah Krakow of IGN called it the best episode of the season so far, adding he was [...] "thrilled that Community is finally coming around and reaching the potential <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> had." ...|$|R

He cares nothing for me, and he does love you. But is he {{therefore}} to be ruined? Which had he better lose? All that {{he has in the}} world, or the girl that has taken his fancy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it!</b> It is empty, and {{the park}} is a wreck; the owner fled from it at the very {{outbreak}} of the revolution; he left some kind of steward nominally in charge, a curious creature, half imbecile; the chateau and the chapel in the forest just outside the grounds have oft served Blakeney {{and all of us}} as a place of refuge {{on our way to the}} coast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} he is a very tall man. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> There can be no doubt about it.

[...] After some further agonising delay Lord Fawn at last acknowledged that it had been so. [...] "Now we shall get on like a house on fire," [...] said Mr. Chaffanbrass.|$|E

"Once you've stood onstage bleating your schoolgirl poetry," [...] Love observed, [...] "are {{you going}} to stay there, {{when you have the}} power and ability to give {{yourself}} a platform?

5000|$|JAB {{relocated}} to Melbourne in August 1977 joining the punk scene and playing alongside the Boys Next Door and X-Ray-Z. Bohdan later recalled, [...] "They were very exciting times, we were changing {{the face of}} the music scene and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> .... <b>All</b> the bands on the scene just kind of found each other. Usually it was through playing together at places like the Tiger Lounge in Richmond, Bombay Rock in Brunswick and of course Bananas down in St Kilda." ...|$|R

[...] "You were staring at {{something}} he said; {{and the first thing}} <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> will be another case of Bittridge!" [...] Ellen winced, but Lottie had no pity. [...] "You don't know it, because you don't know anything, and I'm not blaming you; but if you let that simpleton--I don't care if he is a minister!--go 'round with you when your family are all sick abed, you'll be having the whole ship to look after you." ...|$|E

"Thy meadows are {{the weeds}} of the ocean, and prove the {{richness}} of the nature that hath produced them; while thy breezes from the east, are what all who have ever made the Guinea voyage, well know to exist in latitudes so low. I see naught in either to alarm a bold seaman; and as for the bottom, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> hath not yet been found by many a long and weary fathom of line.

60|$|The State of New York {{contains}} about 43,000 {{square miles of}} land; or something like 27,000,000 of acres. In 1783, its population must have been about 200,000 souls. With such a proportion between people and surface it is unnecessary {{to prove that the}} husbandman was not quite as dependent on the landholder, as the landholder was dependent on the husbandman. This would have been true, had the State been an island; but <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was surrounded by many other communities similarly situated, and that nothing else was so abundant as land. All notions of exactions and monopolies, therefore, must be untrue, as applied to those two interests at that day.|$|E
2500|$|Critic Greil Marcus {{identifies}} the tune {{as that of}} the ancient children's ditty [...] "Froggy Went A-Courtin'" [...] and quotes Danko's description of the recording: [...] "It <b>all</b> felt natural, <b>we</b> didn't rehearse. One or two takes from conception, on paper, to the finish. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would never happen twice." [...] Describing it as a good-natured nonsense song that really swings, Griffin suggests {{it was one of the}} last basement compositions to be recorded before Helm arrived in Woodstock and Dylan departed for Nashville.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was the end}} {{of sorrow}} lies. The rail {{stations}} were dead, flowing like bees stung from honeysuckle. The people hung back and watched the ocean, animals flew in and out of focus. The time had come. Yet king dogs never grow old - they stay young and fit, and someday they might come to the beach and have a few drinks, a few laughs, and get on with it. But not now. The time had come; <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> But who would go first? ...|$|R
5000|$|A one-star review {{came from}} Roger Ebert who wrote, [...] "Here it is, the goofiest {{movie of the}} year, a movie so bad in so many {{different}} and endearing ways that I’m damned if I don’t feel genuine affection for <b>it.</b> <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it’s</b> bad manners to talk during a movie, {{but every once in a}} while a film comes along that positively requires the audience to shout helpful suggestions and lewd one-liners at the screen. “Heartbreak Hotel” is such a movie. All it needs to be perfect is a parallel soundtrack." ...|$|R
60|$|And John {{put on his}} cap and squared {{his broad}} shoulders, and, marching off with a {{resolute}} stride, went to his office, and had a most uncomfortable morning of it. You see, my dear friends, that though Nature has set the seal of sovereignty on man, in broad shoulders and bushy beard; though he fortify and incase himself in rough overcoats and heavy boots, and walk with a dashing air, and whistle like a freeman, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> {{is not an easy}} thing to wage a warfare with a pretty little creature in lace cap and tiny slippers, who has a faculty of looking very pensive and grieved, and making up a sad little mouth, as if her heart were breaking.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{make herself}} out the same?" [...] Vanderbank took him {{straight}} up. [...] "It was nasty my doing that? I see, I see. Yes, yes: I rather gave her away, and you're struck by it--as is most delightful you SHOULD be--because you're {{in every way}} of a better tradition and, knowing Mrs. Brookenham's my friend, can't conceive of one's playing on a friend a trick so vulgar and odious. It strikes you also probably {{as the kind of}} thing we must be constantly doing; it strikes you that right and left, probably, we keep giving each other away. Well, I dare say we do. Yes, 'come to think of it,' as they say in America, we do. But what shall I tell you? Practically <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> and allow for it and it's as broad as it's long. What's London life after all? It's tit for tat!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{news of the}} President looks decidedly hopeful, {{and we are all}} glad, and the {{household}} faces are much improved, as to cheerfulness. Oh, the talk in the newspapers! Evidently the Human Race is the same old Human Race. And how unjust, and unreflectingly discriminating, the talkers are. Under the unsettling effects of powerful emotion the talkers are saying wild things, crazy things--they are out of themselves, and do not know it; they are temporarily insane, yet with one voice they declare the assassin sane--a man who has been entertaining fiery and reason--debauching maggots in his head for weeks and months. Why, no one is sane, straight along, year in and year out, and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> Our insanities are of varying sorts, and express themselves in varying forms--fortunately harmless forms as a rule--but in whatever form they occur an immense upheaval of feeling can at any time topple us distinctly over the sanity-line for a little while; and then if our form happens to be of the murderous kind we must look out--and so must the spectator.|$|E

50|$|Goldman stopped writing novels {{after the}} {{publication}} of Brothers:It was one of those funny things. It just ended. It came as a shock to me. I don't know what happened. My wife left me the next year and that certainly was a change... When I was a novelist - those thirty years - something comes along and hits you and you think, 'Oh my God, that might be interesting,' but I haven't had an idea for that for twenty years now.
