25|$|Actuality is the {{fulfillment}} {{of the end of}} the potentiality. Because the end (telos) is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.|$|E
25|$|Mammals are a clade, and {{therefore}} the cladists are happy to acknowledge the traditional taxon Mammalia; and birds, too, are a clade, universally ascribed to the formal taxon Aves. Mammalia and Aves are, in fact, subclades within the grand clade of the Amniota. But the traditional class Reptilia is not a clade. It is just {{a section of the}} clade Amniota: the section that is left after the Mammalia and Aves have been hived off. It cannot be defined by synapomorphies, as is the proper way. Instead, it is defined by a combination of the features it has and the features it lacks: reptiles are the amniotes that lack fur or feathers. At best, the cladists suggest, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that the traditional Reptilia are 'non-avian, non-mammalian amniotes'.|$|E
500|$|DNA {{tests were}} carried out by LGC Forensics, a private company which {{undertakes}} forensic analysis for criminal investigations. Lindsey Lennen, a body fluids and DNA specialist {{member of the team}} that analysed DNA samples from Yeates' body, said that although DNA swabs matched Tabak, they were not of sufficient quality to be evaluated. The team deployed a method known as DNA SenCE, which enhances unusable DNA samples through purification and concentration: [...] "We couldn't say whether the DNA was from saliva, or semen, or even touch. But <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that the probability of it not being a match with Tabak was less than one in a billion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No, sir; {{everything}} has been upset by this fog. They sent down from the batteries to enquire where you and Mr. Gilmore were, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>say</b> that <b>we</b> supposed you were on board the ship. They sent from the ships to ask, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>say</b> that <b>we</b> didn’t know, but supposed that you were somewhere up in the batteries. Some thought, when you did not return this afternoon, that you had lost your way in the fog; but {{no one seemed to}} think that anything serious could have happened to you.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, father, how <b>could</b> you <b>say</b> that?" [...] Rupert exclaimed. [...] "Oh, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> but <b>say</b> so! I {{should be}} quite, quite content {{to know that}} either of us might be her son--that would not matter so much if we felt that you loved us both equally; but how <b>could</b> you <b>say</b> so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We won't try to {{say what}} {{we would like to}} say," [...] the man began, [...] "'cause <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> it, but we feels it just the same. Here we are with {{everything}} man or woman could wish for, ready to hand." ...|$|R
500|$|To evoke genuine {{emotions}} {{of shock and}} sadness, the final O.R. scene was kept a secret from the cast, {{with the exception of}} Alan Alda, until immediately before filming; only then did Gelbart hand out the last page of the script. As a result, Stevenson was still on the set to see the final scene being filmed. After shooting was completed, a season-ending cast party was planned. Stevenson left the set almost immediately after the end of filming, and the party was canceled due to the poor mood of the cast. Stevenson later {{said in an interview that}} he was deeply hurt that his character's death was revealed in that fashion and the party was [...] "ruined." [...] Gelbart later said of the event, [...] "I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> to him, 'We didn't mean it, Mac.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The allies {{decided to}} divide their forces into two armies: a {{multinational}} force {{that included the}} 1st Division and a second army composed entirely of Brazilians under Caxias. The 1st Division led by Marques de Sousa, along with Uruguayan and Argentine rebel troops, invaded Argentina. He found the long march to Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, highly uncomfortable. He had spent his life {{up to that point}} fighting Hispanic-Americans, and he was now marching as their ally, surrounded by them. He did not trust them, and they trusted neither him nor his men. The only person among the allies with whom he shared his thoughts, and guardedly at that, was Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (later president of Argentina): [...] "We [...] form in here a separate group; we do not talk to anyone; no one approaches us and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that we walk among enemies." [...] On 3 February 1852, in the Battle of Caseros, they faced Rosas and his army. The allies were victorious, Rosas fled to the United Kingdom, and Marques de Sousa acquired his carriage as a war trophy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} the EMH defence to make sense, [...] would {{have to show that}} [...] small number of investors that beat the market in the long-run are not doing so because they are skilled but rather that they are lucky. How would they show this? Frankly, it is {{impossible}} to prove either way. But it strikes me as a very silly argument. We could just as easily apply it to [...] poker players. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Oh, they are not really skilled, they are just lucky. They are just a statistical anomaly." [...] Moving on from this, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> this about anything and everything. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> this about professional football players, master chefs and seminal guitar players. None of these people, by EMH logic, should be seen as skilled. Rather, they are just getting lucky over and over again. The professional football players are just getting lucky every time they play well; the master chef is getting lucky every time he cooks a fabulous meal; and the seminal guitar player is just fortunate that his hands move {{in the way that they}} do. At this point, the reader will appreciate the vacuity of the EMH argument.|$|E
6000|$|The fine French kings {{came over}} in a flutter of flags and dames. [...] We liked their smiles and battles, but <b>we</b> never <b>could</b> <b>say</b> their names. [...] The blood ran red to Bosworth and the High French lords went down; [...] There was naught but a naked people under a naked crown.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Upon my honour, Dombey, I don't think <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do better,' <b>says</b> Cousin Feenix. 'It's on the spot, you see, {{and a very}} cheerful place.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{were able}} to {{determine}} that they are carrying weapons, but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> exactly what they are carrying in the holds. The Soviet people were very wise. They kept the rocket deep down, and when they unloaded them in Cuba, it was carried at night only", - shared the information the American expert Dino Brugioni.|$|R
2500|$|Wales has speculated on a {{possible}} warning to anonymous editors: [...] "When someone clicks on 'edit,' {{it would be}} interesting if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say,</b> 'Hi, thank you for editing. We see you're logged in from The New York Times. Keep in mind that we know that, and it's public information' … That might make them stop and think." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{code name}} for the project was [...] "GameCom", but Masayuki Uemura's wife {{proposed}} the name [...] "Famicom", arguing that [...] "In Japan, 'pasokon' is used to mean a personal computer, but it is neither a home or personal computer. Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> it is a family computer." [...] Meanwhile, Hiroshi Yamauchi decided that the console should use a red and white theme after seeing a billboard for DX Antenna which used those colors.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the {{language}} {{is the importance of}} using poetry in conversations. Modifying or rephrasing a classic poem according to the current situation was expected behavior in Heian court life, and often served to communicate thinly veiled allusions. The poems in the Genji are often in the classic Japanese tanka form. Many of the poems were well known to the intended audience, so usually only the first few lines are given and the reader is supposed to complete the thought themselves, much like today <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> [...] "when in Rome..." [...] and leave the rest of the saying ("...do as the Romans do") unspoken.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{stated in}} a webchat session with AbsolutePunk.net {{that they would}} be using a wide range of {{instruments}} including the sitar, this claim was later declared as a joke, with Joseph Milligan saying, [...] "It was a joke! There’s no sitar! Now I kind of wish there was so that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> actually <b>say</b> that!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the girl}} took {{a gun and}} fired it. We stood ready to count the {{astonishing}} clatter of reverberations. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> one, two, three, fast enough, but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> dot our notebooks with our pencil points almost rapidly enough to take down a sort of short-hand report of the result. My page revealed the following account. I could not keep up, but I did as well as I could.|$|R
50|$|Another way of stating {{things is}} that with {{probability}} 1 − 0.014 = 0.986, a simple random sample of 55 students would have a mean test score within 4 units of the population mean. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> also <b>say</b> that with 98.6% confidence we reject the null hypothesis that the 55 test takers are comparable to a simple random sample from the population of test-takers.|$|R
2500|$|In a {{contribution}} to a work on the church's 1995 official statement, Robert L. Millet writes that [...] "ver the last four decades, we have observed widespread consideration of ideas and worldviews that are destructive of individuals and families." [...] He then discusses instances such as when men have been instructed to be stoic, or stern, to hide their emotions. [...] He continues:In general <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that men and women, {{in and out of}} the Church, have been taunted and titillated with views concerning man, woman, priesthood, and family that are at odds with the revealed word and thus with [...] "things as they really are, and...as they really will be" [...] (Jacob 4:13). ...No person who revolts against the divinely established role and calling he or she was given before the foundations of this earth were laid can be happy or find real fulfillment, not here or in eternity.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{problem was}} that he claimed (or seemed to claim) that AI {{would never be able}} to capture the human ability to {{understand}} context, situation or purpose in the form of rules. But (as Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell would later explain), an argument of this form can not be won: just because one can not imagine formal rules that govern human intelligence and expertise, this does not mean that no such rules exist. They quote Alan Turing's answer to all arguments similar to Dreyfus':"we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say,</b> 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'"Dreyfus did not anticipate that AI researchers would realize their mistake and begin to work towards new solutions, moving away from the symbolic methods that Dreyfus criticized. In 1965, he did not imagine that such programs would one day be created, so he claimed AI was impossible. In 1965, AI researchers did not imagine that such programs were necessary, so they claimed AI was almost complete. Both were wrong.|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{adapting the}} Boris Pasternak novel for television, screenwriter Andrew Davies revealed {{the task was}} [...] "daunting because the book is reckoned to be a masterpiece and the film is a great movie and one that I admire very much. Robert Bolt is the king of epic screenplay writers in my book. But as I got further into the book I kept thinking that I didn't agree with Robert Bolt about how to tell the story... and I began to feel much more excited." [...] He added, [...] "It was also a relief to find {{so much in the}} book that hadn't found its way into the first movie and could make great drama.... I thought the film does the spectacle really well. Rather surprisingly, it also explains the politics very well, but I thought it could do a better job on the relationships. It's probably a bit controversial, but I thought <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> more about Lara and Yuri and how they get together; about Lara's extraordinary situation {{at the beginning of the}} story and Yuri having a dreadful start to his life with his parents dying. None of these things really came out in the movie, but they are there in the book. I think that if they look at both versions now, people will probably think that this version in a lot of ways works better for our time. It's more contemporary. I think they'll find the performances are more subtle yet speak to us in our time. Maybe my script will seem out of date in 20 years time because a lot of them do, but watching the original film, I think the central performances look stilted and dated now." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Dr. Marion Nestle, former {{chair of}} the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at New York University, [...] "There’s {{a great deal of}} money at stake in what these {{guidelines}} say". Talking about her work as an HHS and USDA expert, she said [...] "I was told <b>we</b> <b>could</b> never <b>say</b> ‘eat less meat’ because USDA would not allow it.".|$|R
50|$|Day 3 is {{the most}} compact day of the whole rally, and <b>we</b> even <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that maybe {{it will be the}} most compact of the whole 2010 World Rally Championship. If we exclude the final liaison section from the closing Service Park to the HQ, Day 3 would have between 50% and 60% of Special Stages. So, with this closing road section, the {{competitive}} kilometers will be 48.41% of Day 3’s itinerary.|$|R
5000|$|This {{raises the}} {{question}} of reasonableness: assume it is theoretically possible to identify a person from core information which say does NOT include a simple name and address, but does contain clues which could be pursued to ascertain who it relates to. Just how much extra effort or difficulty would such a step need before <b>we</b> <b>could</b> clearly <b>say</b> that the identity could NOT be [...] "reasonably ascertained" [...] from it? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> no more at that time. Our {{friends in}} advance {{were waiting for}} us. We joined them at once.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was the}} Government, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> {{nothing to}} hinder it; we could only say it was not our doing, and we could not answer for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> with truth `All safe,'" [...] was Okiok's gloomy response, as he {{surveyed}} the ice-laden sea; [...] "we have escaped being crushed or drowned, but only to be starved to death." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{went all}} through the cathedral, which is fitted up as a Protestant place of worship, and has a simple and massive {{grandeur}} about it. In fact, to quote again from our friend Andrew, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> truly <b>say,</b> [...] "Ah, it's a brave kirk, nane o' yere whig-malceries, and curliewurlies, and opensteek hems about it--a' solid, weel-jointed mason wark, that will stand as lang as the warld, keep hands and gun-powther aff it." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, it is, I say, for us {{that the}} {{consequences}} of neglecting the body can be clearly seen and felt; {{and it might be}} well for some if the mind were equally visible and tangible--if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> take it, <b>say,</b> to the doctor, and have its pulse felt.|$|R
5000|$|Svātantrya is {{the first}} stage of creation, an {{undifferentiated}} energy, or, looking from bottom up, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> also <b>say</b> that it is the force that unifies all the energies of creation The first creation of svātantrya is the energy of will (icchā śakti). Then come the energies of knowledge (jñāna śakti) and action (kriyā śakti) and together with the energy of consciousness (cit śakti) and the energy of bliss (ānanda śakti) they form the supreme pentad of creation, the so-called [...] "pure creation".|$|R
60|$|We {{were both}} so taken aback {{that for a}} moment <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> nothing. My friend stammered out an apology about having mistaken the house, and rejoined me. At the corner we burst out {{laughing}} almost simultaneously. And then my friend suddenly stopped and stared at me.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{we might}} be able to find Jacob or not, and the chances were that he had already been made prisoner, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> to {{ourselves}} that the poor lad was not deserted by us in his hour of need, and, if the worst happened, it would be no slight satisfaction to us in after years.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was indeed}} he. It {{was a most}} joyful meeting, that you will easily know; and also as sad as it was joyful. We could not speak Joan's name. One's voice would have broken down. We knew who was meant when she was mentioned; <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> [...] "she" [...] and [...] "her," [...] but we could not speak the name.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> all <b>say</b> as much!" [...] groaned the chaplain. [...] "How happy we, and {{how happy}} the duns would be! What {{have we got}} to play against our conqueror? There is my new gown, Mr. Warrington. Will you set me five pieces against it? I have but to preach in stuff if I lose. Stop! I have a Chrysostom, a Foxe's Martyrs, a Baker's Chronicle, and a cow and her calf. What shall we set against these?" ...|$|R
50|$|Philosophical {{problems}} associated with uninformative priors {{are associated with the}} choice of an appropriate metric, or measurement scale. Suppose we want a prior for the running speed of a runner who is unknown to us. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> specify, <b>say,</b> a normal distribution as the prior for his speed, but alternatively <b>we</b> <b>could</b> specify a normal prior for the time he takes to complete 100 metres, which is proportional to the reciprocal of the first prior. These are very different priors, {{but it is not clear}} which is to be preferred. Jaynes' often-overlooked method of transformation groups can answer this question in some situations.|$|R
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{potential}} for respiratory transmission of Saffold cardiovirus (SAFV) and characterize the pathogen, we analyzed respiratory specimens from 1, 558 pediatric patients in Beijing. We detected SAFV in 7 (0. 5 %) patients and identified lineages 1 - 3. However, because 3 patients had co-infections, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not definitively <b>say</b> SAFV caused disease...|$|R
