In March his program Ra'is el-Tahrir ("Editor-in-Chief") began airing. Qandil stated he returned to Egyptian television because he felt he owed [...] "a debt of gratitude to the institution that built my fame <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> twenties. Also, working in Egypt is more immediately rewarding than anywhere else." [...] With the relaxation of media restrictions during this period, Ra'is el-Tahrir {{became one of the}} most popular and respected television programs in Egypt. Describing the relative freedom afforded to the media, Qandil stated in 2001 that the situation was an improvement from when he first began the program, but [...] "as long as there remains a censor, we will continue to ask for more [...]" ...|$|E

In an interview with The New York Post following the film's release, Baker commented on her role, saying: [...] "It's an important movie and I'm honored to be in it. Of course, I'd {{like to be the}} romantic lead, and I'm actually closer to Michael's [...] age than Deborah Kara Unger is, [...] I think it's always worked that way in Hollywood. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> 20s, I played opposite Jimmy Stewart, Robert Mitchum, and Clark Gable, all of whom were old enough to be my father." [...] The Game proved to be a major success among Baker's later films, performing successfully at the box office and garnering widespread critical acclaim.|$|E

Competing against Bruno Brodd of the Irish American Athletic Club and J. Bredemus of Princeton University, he won seven of the ten events contested and came in second in the remaining three. With a total point score of 7,476points, Thorpe broke the previous record of 7,385points set in 1909, (also set at Celtic Park), by Martin Sheridan, the champion athlete of the Irish American Athletic Club. Sheridan, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, was present to watch his record broken, approached Thorpe after the event and shook his hand saying, [...] "Jim, my boy, you're a great man. I never expect to look upon a finer athlete." [...] He told a reporter from New York World, [...] "Thorpe is the greatest athlete that ever lived. He has me beaten fifty ways.
