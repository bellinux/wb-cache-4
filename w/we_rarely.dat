500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. Sava awarded the episode a [...] "B+", and wrote that Ricardio is [...] "always welcome on this series, {{largely due to}} Takei’s delightful voice work." [...] Furthermore, he praised the way that Takei delivered his lines, noting that [...] "there’s a theatrical smarminess to his vocals that is {{a stark contrast to}} the Ice King’s nasality", and that [...] "Takei always sounds like he’s having a great time reading the ridiculous lines that are written for him." [...] Sava also wrote positively of Bubblegum's character, noting that she [...] "dominates this episode" [...] and that the [...] "episode reveals a side of her that <b>we</b> <b>rarely</b> see, and hopefully we’ll get more of badass PB in the future." ...|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode in 2010, for The A.V. Club, {{giving it a}} rating of an A. He praised {{the fact that there}} was no mystery to the episode, and that it was instead explained immediately that Sarek was the cause of the crewmembers' problems. He added that there was a [...] "beautiful simplicity to this concept, an elegance that makes the tragedy at the heart of the episode all the more powerful". Handlen said that the scene in which Picard deals with the emotions of Sarek after the mind meld was a [...] "remarkable work, a level of naked, raw intensity that <b>we</b> <b>rarely</b> get on , and in the hands of a lesser actor (basically anyone else in the ensemble), this could've been ridiculous".|$|E
500|$|A {{large portion}} of the episode was based on the ancient {{astronaut}} theory, which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans. Frank Spotnitz later remarked that he was astounded at how little negative fan mail the show received, {{despite the fact that the}} [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"" [...] story arc heavily hinted that aliens were the originators of the notion of God and religion. He credited the manner in which the show handled this delicate subject, saying, [...] "Often in the past, we've done stuff where I was sure we would get angry letters. But <b>we</b> <b>rarely</b> do. And the reason is because of the way we handle things. In 'Amor Fati' we treated the religious side with respect." [...] The ancient astronaut themes were later revisited in the two season nine episodes [...] "Provenance" [...] and [...] "Providence." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{portions}} of the episode about the alien shard and Mulder's telepathic abilities allude to the ancient astronaut theory, which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity or prehistory. Spotnitz was surprised that the show received few complaints, even though the [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"Amor Fati" [...] story arc heavily suggested that aliens developed the notions of God and religion. He praised {{the manner in which}} the show handled this subject, saying, [...] "Often in the past, we've done stuff where I was sure we would get angry letters. But <b>we</b> <b>rarely</b> do. And the reason is because of the way we handle things. In 'Amor Fati' we treated the religious side [...] with respect." [...] Spotnitz later identified the combination of science and religion as [...] "a conjunction of science and mysticism, of aliens and religion, that we're starting to develop. It's deliberate on our part, to help bring all the mythologies together into one story line." [...] The ancient astronaut themes were revisited in two season nine episodes: [...] "Provenance" [...] and [...] "Providence".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in the early 2000s, Moffat refused to even mention Chalk, joking that he might get attacked in the street. The first series received criticism from some teachers and teaching unions, who criticised the representation of their professions. Letters were printed in specialist publications such as the Education Guardian. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers labelled Chalk as [...] "perverse" [...] and [...] "vapid", and its leader called upon the show to be axed. [...] Teachers, according to the Daily Record, complained that the show portrayed teachers as [...] "mentally unstable", and deterred people from entering the profession. John Grillo, who played Mr Carkdale, recalls that he was appearing in a West End play {{at the time he}} was auditioning for the role; a fellow actor in the play was meant to be auditioning for Chalk but, having been a deputy head teacher earlier in his career, was so disgusted by the material that he refused to attend. The unions' derision actually inspired The Timess [...] Matthew Bond to like the show. However, despite identifying [...] "genuine humour" [...] such as Slatt's rant against French teachers, Bond's review is largely critical. He concedes, [...] "the teaching organisations, you see, are half right. Slatt has no credible basis in the teaching profession, but far more importantly he has no credible basis in the human race. And what we don't believe in, <b>we</b> <b>rarely</b> find funny." ...|$|E
500|$|Reception of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics has been generally positive. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club praised the episode, gave a A- and commented that it is [...] "good to see The Simpsons try an ambitious episode, and great to see those ambitions largely fulfilled." [...] He added that episodes that [...] "give Bart extra depth ('Bart Sells His Soul' especially) are among my favorite Simpsons half-hours," [...] and noted that this episode features [...] "a side of Bart that <b>we</b> <b>rarely</b> see: someone living outside the moment. Imagining himself on his deathbed and thinking of how his whole life outside of the cruise was wasted {{is the sort of}} device typically reserved for the Simpson women, particularly Lisa." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that in the episode there [...] "are elements that will be familiar – it's another episode where a Simpson family vacation verges on disaster – but the main emotional storyline involving Bart is one The Simpsons hasn't touched on before, as a fantastic luxury cruise makes him uneasy {{about the state of the}} rest of his life." [...] Sepinwall concluded that he is [...] "always a fan of single-story Simpsons episodes, as well as ones built around an emotional issue facing a member of the family, and this has both – in addition to being funny and sweet and clever in its depiction of the Best Cruise Ever." ...|$|E

500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode a 4.6 out of 5 stars, {{and went on}} to {{describe}} the episode as [...] "A funny, touching, entertaining Glee episode that didn't feature a single line from Sue Sylvester? I never thought I'd see the day. But that's exactly what transpired on 'Silly Love Songs', as the show stopped feeling like a Public Service Announcement for a week and actually focused on well-paced, well-written relationship developments among its core characters." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, and wrote, Silly Love Songs' strikes an interesting contrast to Sunday night's post-Super Bowl episode in that tonight was more about the kids and where they are in their stories than about big production numbers and Sue's cartoon evilness. It was also the funniest episode of the season, in no small part because we got some insight into the lives of two New Directions members <b>we</b> <b>rarely</b> get to hang out with for any length of time: Santana and Lauren." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine praised the storyline and the musical performances of the episode. However, Soraya Roberts of the Daily News gave the episode a negative review: [...] "This show sometimes sounds like it was written by a PIT, prime idiot TV writer. It's almost as bad as Tina breaking down into tears for no reason while singing 'My Funny Valentine' to Mike and Blaine attempting to channel Frank Sinatra while singing Paul McCartney's 'Silly Love Songs' in the middle of Breadsticks." [...] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised the storyline, calling it cohesive.|$|E

2500|$|The life-history of this insect {{is given}} by Messrs. Davidson and Aitken: One of these gentlemen watched a female, P. liomedon, laying its eggs on a tender shoot of a small jungle tree or shrub (Acronychia laurifolia). There were [...] "ten eggs, laid {{one on top of}} the other." [...] Of the {{caterpillars}} which emerged five days after the eggs were laid, [...] "five passed successfully through all dangers and became beautiful specimens, one female and four males. (This is one of the butterflies of which <b>we</b> <b>rarely</b> find females.) All through their lives these larvae continued gregarious, dispersing occasionally to feed, but always returning to rest side by side on the upper surface of a leaf. The following dates may be interesting. Eggs laid 2 August, hatched 7 August; skins cast (and eaten) 12 August; again 17 August; again 20 to 22 August. The most advanced cast its skin again on the 28th August, became a pupa on the 2nd of September, and emerged on the 15th of September. [...] The others followed within two days. [...] At first the larvae were of an oily yellow colour and bore many pairs of spiny points, but these disappeared with age and after the last moult there were only the short fleshy processes on the 2nd and last segment which characterise the group, and one additional curved pair on the ninth segment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeremy Estes of PopMatters called Tatsumi's {{imagination}} [...] "dark and disturbing, {{but definitely}} worth the trip." [...] Esters added that Tatsumi's utilitarian art style and clean style of storytelling make the manga {{easy to follow}} visually, but its tone of despair can be overwhelming. Bill Randall of The Comics Journal described the manga's stories [...] "as subtle as pissing in someone's face", but acknowledged Tatsumi's place in manga history {{and the strength of}} his images. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly observed that Tatsumi tackles difficult subjects, but instead of exploiting, he humanizes his characters. It also called his art masterful in how he varies his style and depicts [...] "graceful motion, grisly suffering and complicated emotion." [...] Gordon Flagg of Booklist noted that the stories in the manga are more political than usual for Tatsumi in their portrayal of postwar Japan, saying of the manga: [...] "Tatsumi's mastery of the visual simplicity of classic manga gives a stark power to these devastating, uncompromising pieces." [...] Richard Rayner of the Los Angeles Times described the stories as [...] "remarkable, amazing" [...] saying that their style is [...] "spare, elliptical and it's sometimes necessary to read two or three times to appreciate the full nightmarish power." [...] Andrew Wheeler of ComicMix preferred the stories translated in Abandon the Old in Tokyo, but still found the stories [...] "Hell" [...] and the titular title to be comparable, calling the manga [...] "a stunning achievement, a collection of dark, realistic stories from a side of the world <b>we</b> <b>rarely</b> see." [...] Calling the manga bleak, Tom Baker of The Daily Yomiuri said that [...] "there's no point in reading such depressing stuff unless it is done very well. And Tatsumi does it excellently." ...|$|E
