Scholars address the delivery system that conveyed and stored water, and the fountains, large and small, from which it gushed. Papers consider spring water, rainwater and seawater; water suitable for drinking, bathing and baptism; and fountains real, imagined and symbolic. Experts in the history of art and culture, archaeology and theology, and poetry and prose, offer reflections on water and fountains across two millennia in one location...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Copper {{and zinc}} are vitally {{important}} nutrient elements, {{but are also}} potential soil polluters. More promising forms have to be found, in which these microelements could {{be presented to the}} plants. The aim of this investigation was to modify the method of <b>water</b> <b>cultures</b> {{in such a way that}} the concentration of copper and zinc hydroxosalts could be controlled in order that their qualities as sources of microelements could be compared to the simple salts of sulphur acid. Vegetation pot experiments were conducted with the synthesized hydroxyde carbonates and hydroxyde sulphates of Cu and Zn in <b>water</b> <b>cultures</b> using the lettuce cv. Zhulta Gyumyurdzhinska. The hydroxosalts of Cu and Zn are equivalent sources of microelements and as compared to simple salts stimulate the root’s growth. Hydroxyde carbonates are better as a source of Zn and hydroxyde sulphates – as a source of copper...|$|R
50|$|Top-fed deep <b>water</b> <b>culture</b> is a {{technique}} involving delivering highly oxygenated nutrient solution direct to the root zone of plants. While deep <b>water</b> <b>culture</b> involves the plant roots hanging down into a reservoir of nutrient solution, in top-fed deep <b>water</b> <b>culture</b> the solution is pumped from the reservoir up to the roots (top feeding). The water is released over the plant's roots and then runs back into the reservoir below in a constantly recirculating system. As with deep <b>water</b> <b>culture,</b> there is an airstone in the reservoir that pumps air into the water via a hose from outside the reservoir. The airstone helps add oxygen to the water. Both the airstone and the water pump run 24 hours a day.|$|E

In this paper, {{the effects}} of the <b>culture</b> <b>water</b> of three types of higher {{landscape}} plants Typha latifolia L, Canna indica L and Iris tectorum Maxim on the growth of Chlorella pyrenoidosa have been investigated. The results show that Iris <b>culture</b> <b>water</b> promoted the growth of Chlorella pyrenoidosa, which was facilitated at low contentions and inhibited at high concentrations by the <b>culture</b> <b>water</b> of Canna indica L. Moreover, inhibitory effect of the <b>culture</b> <b>water</b> of Typha latifolia L was the strongest with the rate of 50. 7 %. Differences of {{the effects of}} the three plants on the chlorophyll a contents of Chlorella pyrenoidosa were significant (P < 0. 05). The chlorophyll-a content was up to 1035 g/L when 60 % of the <b>culture</b> <b>water</b> of Iris tectorum Maxim was utilized, whereas the content was lowest at merely 41 % of that of the control group when treated with 80 % of the <b>culture</b> <b>water</b> of Typha latifolia L...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether environmental cultures for Legionella increase {{the index of}} suspicion for legionnaires' disease (LD). Design: Five-year prospective study. Setting: Twenty hospitals in Catalonia, Spain. Methods: From 1994 to 1996, the potable water systems of 20 hospitals in Catalonia were tested for Legionella, Cases of hospital-acquired LD and availability of an “in-house” Legionella test in the previous 4 years were assessed. After the hospitals were informed {{of the results of}} their <b>water</b> <b>cultures,</b> a prospective 5 -year-study was conducted focusing on the detection of new cases of nosocomial legionellosis and the availability and use of Legionella testing. Results: Before environmental cultures were started, only one hospital had conducted active surveillance of hospital-acquired pneumonia and used Legionella tests including Legionella urinary antigen in all pneumonia cases. Only one other hospital had used the latter test at all. In six hospitals, Legionella tests had been completely unavailable. Cases of nosocomial LD had been diagnosed in the previous 4 years in only two hospitals. During prospective surveillance, 12 hospitals (60 %) used Legionella urinary antigen testing in house and 11 (55 %) found cases of nosocomial legionellosis, representing 64. 7 % (11 of 17) of those with positive <b>water</b> <b>cultures.</b> Hospitals with negative <b>water</b> <b>cultures</b> did not find nosocomial LD. Conclusions: The environmental study increased the index of suspicion for nosocomial LD. The number of cases of nosocomial LD increased significantly during the prospective follow-up period, and most hospitals began using the Legionella urinary antigen test in their laboratories...|$|R
40|$|Photosynthetic cyanobacteria, {{heterotrophic}} bacteria, free-living amoebae, and ciliated protozoa may support {{growth of}} Legionella pneumophila. Studies {{were done with}} two tap <b>water</b> <b>cultures</b> (WS 1 and WS 2) containing L. pneumophila and associated microbiota to characterize growth-supporting activity and assess {{the relative importance of}} the microbiota in supporting multiplication of L. pneumophila. The <b>water</b> <b>cultures</b> were incubated in the dark at 35 degrees C. The growth-supporting factor(s) was separated from each culture by filtration through 1 -micron-pore-size membrane filters. The retentate was then suspended in sterile tap water. Multiplication of L. pneumophila occurred when both the retentate suspension and the filtrate from either culture were inoculated into sterile tap water. L. pneumophila did not multiply in tap water inoculated with only the filtrate, even though filtration did not reduce the concentration of L. pneumophila or heterotrophic bacteria in either culture. Growth-supporting activity of the retentate suspension from WS 1 was inactivated at 60 degrees C but unaffected at 0, 25, and 45 degrees C after 30 -min incubations. Filtration experiments indicated that the growth-supporting factor(s) in WS 1 was 2 to 5 micron in diameter. Ciliated protozoa were not detected in either culture. Hartmannellid amoebae were conclusively demonstrated in WS 2 but not in WS 1. L. pneumophila multiplied in tap water inoculated with the amoebae (10 (3) /ml) and the 1 -micron filtrate of WS 2. No multiplication occurred in tap water inoculated with the filtrate only. Growth-supporting activity for L. pneumophila may be present in plumbing systems; hartmannellid amoebae appear to be important determinants of multiplication of L. pneumophila in some tap <b>water</b> <b>cultures...</b>|$|R

40|$|Adapting {{to water}} {{scarcity}} {{is a critical}} issue for many cities {{around the world as}} they respond to the influences of population growth, urbanisation and climate change. There is increasing recognition that geographic context has an impact on experiences of and approaches to domestic water use, but research comparing urban environments is scarce. This paper describes different domestic <b>water</b> <b>cultures</b> after the Millennium drought in three Australian cities—Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. All three cities have experienced drought, or severe water shortages, over the past 15 years, and each city has responded differently. The experience of water scarcity and water restrictions imposed by governments impacted on people’s everyday lives in varied and profound ways. Drawing on quantitative data from a national survey (n = 5194) and qualitative data from focus groups, we found that a sense of water crisis led to household water conservation in Brisbane and Melbourne. In contrast, access to alternative water sources in Perth through desalination plants and household bores de-emphasised personal responses to household water conservation. The implications are that urban specific policies and interventions are needed to provide durable change in domestic <b>water</b> <b>cultures.</b> We argue that greater water sensitivity and responsiveness to water availability should be promoted in different urban centres, and that water supply solutions should be accompanied by initiatives that promote adoption of sustainable water practices and future resilience...|$|R
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of Legionella pneumophila to iodination was {{studied with}} cultures grown in well water, on rich agar media, {{and attached to}} stainless-steel surfaces. Legionella pneumophila grown in <b>water</b> <b>cultures</b> in association with other microorganisms were less sensitive to disinfection by chlorine and iodine than were agar-passaged cultures. Differences in sensitivity to disinfection between water-cultured and agar-grown legionellae were determined by comparing C x T values (concentration in milligrams per litre multiplied by time in minutes to achieve 99 % decrease in viability) and CM x T values (concentration in molarity). Iodine (1500 x) gave a greater difference in CM x T values than did chlorine (68 x). Iodine was 50 times more effective than chlorine when used with agar-grown cultures but was only twice as effective when tested against water-grown Legionella cultures. C x T x S values (C x T multiplied by percent survivors), which {{take into consideration the}} percent surviving bacteria, were used to compare sensitivities in very resistant populations, such as those in biofilms. <b>Water</b> <b>cultures</b> of legionellae associated with stainless-steel surfaces were 135 times more resistant to iodination than were unattached legionellae, and they were 210, 000 times more resistant than were agar-grown cultures. These results indicate that the conditions under which legionellae are grown can dramatically affect their susceptibility to some disinfectants and must be considered when evaluating the efficacy of a disinfecting agent...|$|R
