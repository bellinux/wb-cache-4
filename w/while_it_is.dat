5|$|<b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{structurally}} {{similar to}} the Cotinga species, the purple-throated cotinga differs from them in {{that it has a}} heavier, stubbier bill, distinctive pale fringing on the back feathers, and barred underparts in the female. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> still generally considered to be closely related to the Cotinga species, recent molecular analysis has suggested that the species may in fact form a separate clade with other canopy-dwelling cotingas, specifically the neotropical bellbirds of the genus Procnias, the cotingas of the genus Carpodectes, the black-faced cotinga of the monotypic genus Conioptilon, and the bare-necked fruitcrow of the monotypic genus Gymnoderus. Of these genera, the molecular analysis suggested that the purple-throated cotinga was most closely related to the neotropical bellbirds. This cotinga does not have a recognized subspecies.|$|E

5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of maat. Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt {{made it impossible for}} him to do so in all cases, {{and most of the time}} these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.|$|E

5|$|Elemental bromine is very {{reactive}} {{and thus}} {{does not occur}} free in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br−) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth of that of chlorine.|$|E
