Dual hearing protection with electronic/communication elements may aid a person with hearing loss in hearing warning signals and help with communication. Workers with a high frequency hearing loss may benefit more from HPD that attenuates sounds equally across the pitch range. This is helpful because traditional HPD will attenuate the higher frequencies (where these individuals have a hearing loss) more than the mid- and low-frequencies. Whereas, HPD that attenuate equally across the pitch range, can provide more comfort and balancing of loudness across the pitches for these individuals.

40|$|Variable Gain Amplifier finds {{extensive}} {{use in the}} high frequency demonstrators specially those operating in the millimeter-wave regions and beyond where the incoming RF signal level can have wide variations. To maintain a constant signal level an IF VGA has been designed that can offer a dynamic variation of gain as much as 45 dB together with a high maximum gain and a low noise figure. The {{first part of the}} thesis starts with theoretical as well as analytical investigations of designing a VGA based on the various possible topologies. Feasibility of implementing the Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) version of the IF VGA is then followed. Foundry based High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT) have been used for the realization of the circuit. Two high gain, low noise, VGA have been designed and characterized based on series feedback and parallel feedback topologies. A 45 dB of gain control and a maximum gain of 47 dB have been achieved with the series feedback VGA whereas the corresponding figures for the parallel feedback VGA are, 55 dB and 35 dB, respectively. The circuits were designed for a center frequency of 2. 5 GHz. The noise figure for the series feedback VGA is 0. 81 dB in the highest gain mode and for the parallel feedback VGA it is 0. 86 dB. The - 1 dB compression and OIP 3 for the series feedback VGA are - 7. 2 dBm and + 2 dBm, respectively. The corresponding figures for the parallel feedback VGA are - 9. 5 dBm and + 1. 3 dBm, respectively. The second part of the thesis discusses the design and characterization of small signal amplifiers using a foundry based submicron CMOS processes both with the 45 nm and the 90 nm technology. The latest state-of-the-art 45 nm CMOS process i. e the bulk CMOS and the FinFET have recently got much attention of the researchers. A brief investigation on ft for both the devices have been carried out followed by a concise overview on the technology. Maximum achievable value of ft for 45 nm bulk CMOS is of the order of 200 GHz. For FinFET this value is around 100 GHz. Two <b>wiring</b> <b>options</b> i. e. the Back-End-Of-Line (BEOL) and the post process Wafter-Level-Packaging (WLP) have been considered for transmission line as well as passive implementations and are discussed in some details. It is then followed by the MMIC implementations of the small signal amplifiers. Foundry provided models as well as in-house developed models are used in the circuit analysis.

40|$|Silicon on Insulator (SOI) device {{technology}} {{has been shown to}} be capable of functioning satisfactorily at operating temperatures of > 200 C. Most of the applications to date have required performance for short times (< 2, 000 hours) at the highest operating temperatures of up to 225 C in down-well dulling applications. There is interest in extending the endurance of high temperature electivnics into aero-engine and other applications where a minimum 20 year operating life is stipulated. In order to gain confidence in high temperature electronics that can meet this requirement, accurate reliability data are needed and end of life failure modes need to be identified. Most of the reliability data on the high temperature endurance of the integrated circuit is generated with little consideration of the packaging technologies, whilst most of the reliability data pertinent to high temperature packaging technologies uses test pieces rather than devices, which limits any conclusions relating to long term electrical performance.

By high speedimaging of leading wire addition during fibre laser keyhole welding {{it was observed}} that for the 40 experiments underconsideration the wire tip always established a concave boiling front. The front appears similar to a keyhole front and issort of a continuation of the keyhole, owing to the leading wire employment. For most of the parameters the melt istransferred downwards from the wire tip into the melt pool surrounding the keyhole front. In other words, hardly anyuncontrolled spatter to the sides was observed. A trailing wire would normally tend to a completely different behaviour. Typical as well as limiting phenomena of the wire melt transfer mechanism are presented and discussed. Controlledvertical melt transfer of the wire through the ablation pressure from a laser-induced boiling front, either in contact withthe workpiece surface or positioned higher above, can be a desirable mechanism of metal deposition for the differenttechniques, namely welding, surface treatment or LAM. By suitable choice of the laser power density above the boilingthreshold, the here observed mechanism can be applied in a controllable manner. An interesting technique option islateral beam oscillation for example by a galvanometer optics which shears off the melt {{in a manner similar to}} remotefusion cutting. The process limits become different to the static technique.

40|$|ObjectiveRisk {{factors for}} poor outcome with {{congenital}} complete heart block include prematurity, low birth weight, hydrops, low ventricular rates, and congenital heart disease. In this group, medical therapy is often ineffective, pacing is technically challenging, and mortality exceeds 80 %. The {{purpose of this}} study is to assess outcomes of patients with congenital complete heart block who were paced in the first 24 hours after birth owing to the presence of known risk factors. MethodsWe performed a retrospective review of patients with congenital complete heart block paced in the first 24 hours after birth at our institution between November 1, 1995, and July 31, 2007. ResultsThirteen patients were identified, 4 of whom had heterotaxy syndrome. Eleven patients had temporary epicardial pacing wires placed; 2 received permanent pacemakers as the initial mode of pacing. There were 7 deaths (54 % mortality) at a mean age of 19. 9 ± 19 days. Among 7 patients with structural heart disease, there was 1 survivor. Among 6 patients with structurally normal hearts, there were 5 survivors (P =. 025). Patients with temporary wires who survived to permanent pacemaker implantation (6 / 11) used their temporary leads for 33. 8 ± 18. 3 days.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to revisit the old debate between rationalists and empiricists in {{relation}} to language development with new longitudinal data in hand. I show {{that when it comes to}} the development of a specific piece of linguistic knowledge, namely the distribution of the third person singular morpheme -s in child English, the generativist approach can satisfactorily account for the quirks observed in the longitudinal data presented herein. First, I argue that children are not conservative learners in the sense of Tomasello (2003), but they set parameters in the sense of Crain (1991). That is to say, child grammars may vary from the adult -significantly-, but the variation is conservatively limited by the hard-wired principles and parameters of Universal Grammar. I conclude that a parameter setting account of the development of functional categories is preferred as it attains explanatory adequacy with a minimal set of assumptions. I then adopt Lasnik's (1995 a) parametric account of verbal morphology, which distinguishes two types of Infl(ectional) items: affixal Infl and featural Infl. Furthermore, I use the same distinction to account for the development of sentential Neg(ation), as well, arguing that there are two parametric values associated with the Neg(ation) category: affixal Neg and featural Neg. In natural languages, the intersection of these values defines different grammars (e. g. Swedish vs. English, Middle English vs. Modern English). Based on the Principles and Parameter theory, I show that at any given point in development, innately hard-wired UG principles and parameters can accurately define child grammars the same way they define any natural language. I argue that longitudinal evidence suggests that these parametric values are hard <b>wired</b> as those <b>options</b> are explored by four different English-speaking 2 -year-old children. Thus, I conclude that language development is better understood as language change driven by parameter setting and re-setting...|$|R

Colburn Kennedy, Project Director, CH 2 M HILL Plateau Remediation Company (CHPRC) requested the workshop and Richard Harrington provided facilitation. The purpose of the session was to select the preferred Bio Shield Alternative, for integration with the Thermal Shield and Core Removal and develop the path forward to proceed with project delivery. Prior to this workshop, the S. A. Robotics (SAR) Obstruction Removal Alternatives Analysis (565 -DLV- 062) report was issued, for use prior to and throughout the session, to all the team members. The multidisciplinary team consisted ofrepresentatives from 100 -KE Project Management, Engineering, Radcon, Nuclear Safety, Fire Protection, Crane/Rigging, SAR Project Engineering, the Department of Energy Richland Field Office, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington State Department of Ecology, Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board, and Deactivation and Decommission subject matter experts from corporate CH 2 M HILL and Lucas. Appendix D contains the workshop agenda, guidelines and expectations, opening remarks, and attendance roster going into followed throughout the workshop. The team was successful in selecting the preferred alternative and developing an eight-point path forward action plan to proceed with conceptual design. Conventional Demolition {{was selected as the}} preferred alternative over two other alternatives: Diamond <b>Wire</b> with <b>Options,</b> and Harmonic Delamination with Conventional Demolition. The teams preferred alternative aligned with the SAR Obstruction Removal Alternative Analysis report conclusion. However, the team identified several Path Forward actions, in Appendix A, which upon completion will solidify and potentially enhance the Conventional Demolition alternative with multiple options and approaches to achieve project delivery. In brief, the Path Forward was developed to reconsider potential open air demolition areas; characterize to determine if any zircaloy exists, evaluate existing concrete data to determine additional characterization needs, size the new building to accommodate human machine interface and tooling, consider bucket thumb and use ofshape-charges in design, and finally to utilize complex-wide and industry explosive demolition lessons learned in the design approach. Appendix B documents these results from the team's use ofValue Engineering process tools entitled Weighted Analysis Alternative Matrix, Matrix Conclusions, Evaluation Criteria, and Alternative Advantages and Disadvantages. These results were further supported with the team's validation of parking-lot information sheets: memories (potential ideas to consider), issues/concerns, and assumptions, contained in Appendix C.

40|$|Zenergy Power has {{successfully}} designed, built, tested, and {{installed in the}} US electrical grid a saturable reactor Fault Current Limiter. Beginning in 2007, first as SC Power Systems and from 2008 as Zenergy Power, Inc., ZP used DOE matching grant and ARRA funds to help refine {{the design of the}} saturated reactor fault current limiter. ZP ultimately perfected the design of the saturated reactor FCL to the point that ZP could reliably design a suitable FCL for most utility applications. Beginning with a very basic FCL design using 1 G HTS for a coil housed in a LN 2 cryostat for the DC bias magnet, the technology progressed to a commercial system that was offered for sale internationally. Substantial progress was made in two areas. First, the cryogenics cooling system progressed from a sub-cooled liquid nitrogen container housing the HTS coils to cryostats utilizing dry conduction cooling and reaching temperatures down to less than 20 degrees K. Large, round cryostats with âwarm boreâ diameters of 1. 7 meters enabled the design of large tanks to hold the AC components. Second, the design of the AC part of the FCL was refined from a six legged âspiderâ design to a more compact and lighter design with better fault current limiting capability. Further refinement of the flux path and core shape led to an efficient saturated reactor design requiring less Ampere-turns to saturate the core. In conclusion, the development of the saturable reactor FCL led to a more efficient design not requiring HTS magnets and their associated peripheral equipment, which yielded a more economical product in line with the electric utility industry expectations. The original goal for the DOE funding of the ZP project âDesign, Test and Demonstration of Saturable Reactor High-Temperature Superconductor Fault Current Limitersâ was to stimulate the HTS wire industry with, first 1 G, then 2 G, HTS wire applications. Over the approximately 5 years of ZPâs product development program, the amount of HTS wire employed per FCL and its cost {{as a percentage of the}} total FCL product content had not dropped substantially from an unsustainable level of more than 50 % of the total cost of the FCL, nor had the availability increased (today the availability of 2 G wire for commercial applications outside of specific partnerships with the leading 2 G wire manufacturers is extremely limited). ZP had projected a very significant commercial potential for FCLs with higher performance and lower costs compared to the initial models built with 1 G wire, which would come about from the widespread availability of low-cost, high-performance 2 G HTS wire. The potential for 2 G wires at greatly reduced performance-based prices compared to 1 G HTS conductor held out the potential for the commercial production of FCLs at price and performance levels attractive to the utility industry. However, the price of HTS wire did not drop as expected and today the available quantities of 2 G wire are limited, and the price is higher than the currently available supplies of 1 G <b>wire.</b> The commercial <b>option</b> for ZP to provide a reliable and reasonably priced FCL to the utility industry is to employ conventional resistive conductor DC electromagnets to bias the FCL. Since the premise of the original funding was to stimulate the HTS wire industry and ZP concluded that copper-based magnets were more economical for the foreseeable future, DOE and ZP decided to mutually terminate the project...|$|R
