This thesis presents an evaluation of the effectiveness of Simple Regression and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) forecasting models to predict the demand of Chemical Biological consumable items using the procurement history data for four specific items. Neither forecasting model proved effective at predicting the demand for the items {{due in large part to}} large variation in demand patterns. The inventory policies and supply issues which currently exist at an Army production site were investigated and it was recommended to consider Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) or Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory management models as possible alternatives to achieve smoother demand patterns. Additionally, recommendations were made to examine the integrity of the historical demand data as well as using a Multiple Regression forecast model with several causal effects in addition to time.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} Illumina's two-channel NextSeq 500 sequencing {{system for}} noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) of fetal whole chromosome and partial aberrations. METHODS: A total of 162 plasma samples, previously sequenced for NIPT on a SOLiD 5500 xl platform, were sequenced on the NextSeq 500 using 75 -bp single-end sequencing, followed by analysis using the WISECONDOR algorithm. RESULTS: For whole chromosome aneuploidy detection, all samples were classified correctly (in total 3 x T 13, 3 x T 18, 8 x T 21 and 145 x euploid). Three partial aberrations (36 -Mb terminal loss of 5 p, 14 -Mb gain on 18 p and 33 -Mb terminal loss of 13 q) were also correctly identified. Fetal fractions in 34 male samples sequenced {{on both the}} SOLiD 5500 xl and NextSeq 500 platform showed no significant difference. To test robustness, two sample sets, containing both euploid and aneuploid samples, were sequenced on different NextSeq 500 machines, revealing identical results. With unchanged laboratory flow, the NIPT turnaround time could be reduced from <b>15</b> - 16 <b>calendar</b> <b>days</b> to 7 - 8 <b>calendar</b> <b>days,</b> after switching from the SOLiD 5500 xl to the NextSeq 500 platform. CONCLUSIONS: The NextSeq 500 platform {{can be used for}} NIPT to detect both whole and partial chromosome aberrations. It has fast turnaround times and is suitable for mid-sized laboratories.
