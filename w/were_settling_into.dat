25|$|It {{appeared}} Holliday and Horony <b>were</b> <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> life in Las Vegas when Wyatt Earp {{arrived on}} October 18, 1879, {{with news of}} the boom going on in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. Holliday and Horony joined Wyatt and his wife Mattie, as well as Jim Earp {{and his wife and}} step daughter, as they traveled the next day to Prescott, Arizona Territory. They arrived within a few weeks and went straight to the home of Constable Virgil Earp and his wife Allie. Holliday and Horony checked into a hotel and when Wyatt, Virgil, and James Earp with their wives left for Tombstone, Holliday remained in Prescott, where he thought the gambling opportunities were better. Holliday finally joined the Earps in Tombstone in September 1880. Some accounts report that the Earps sent for Holliday for assistance with dealing with the outlaw Cowboys]. Holliday quickly became embroiled in the local politics and violence that led up to the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in October 1881.|$|E

60|$|Thereupon {{the racket}} of chair-legs {{on the floor}} {{signified}} that they <b>were</b> <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> their seats,--a disturbance which Swithin took advantage of by going on tiptoe across the floor above, and putting sheets of paper over knot-holes in the boarding at points where carpet was lacking, that his lamp-light might not shine down. The absence of a ceiling beneath rendered his position virtually that of one suspended in the same apartment.|$|E
6000|$|Every {{one knows}} that coal-strata, in common with women, horses, and {{official}} superiors, have [...] "faults" [...] caused by some colic of the earth {{in the days when}} things <b>were</b> <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> their places. A coal-seam is suddenly sliced off as a pencil is cut through with one slanting blow of the penknife, and one-half is either pushed up or pushed down any number of feet. The miners work the seam till they come to this break-off, and then call for an expert to [...] "read the fault." [...] It is sometimes very hard to discover whether the sliced-off seam has gone up or down. Theoretically, the end of the broken piece should show the direction. Practically its indications are not always clear. Then a good [...] "fault-reader," [...] who must more than know geology, is a useful man, and is much prized; for the Giridih fields are full of faults and [...] "dykes." [...] Tongues of what was once molten lava thrust themselves sheer into the coal, and the disgusted miner finds that for about twenty feet {{on each side of the}} tongue all coal has been burnt away.|$|E
50|$|By the 1870s {{a wave of}} Italian and Eastern European Jewish {{immigrants}} <b>were</b> <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> the area.

Monk Eastman's Eastman Coin Collectors had many Irish members.|$|E

50|$|The Altay were {{originally}} nomadic, with a lifestyle based on hunting / trapping and pastoralism (mainly based on herds of cattle, sheep, goats). As {{a result of}} the Soviet Union and Russian influence, many <b>were</b> <b>settled</b> <b>into</b> sedentary communities.|$|R

50|$|Later on, {{during the}} 1970s-80s, Taiwanese and Fuzhou-speaking {{immigrants}} began to arrive into New York City. Taiwanese <b>were</b> <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> Flushing, Queens {{when it was}} still predominantly European American, while Fuzhou immigrants were settling in Manhattan's then very Cantonese-dominated Chinatown. The Taiwanese and Fuzhou people were the earliest Chinese immigrants to arrive into New York who spoke Mandarin but not Cantonese, although many spoke their regional Chinese dialects as well.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1864, the {{beginning}} of a very cold winter was setting in over northern Virginia. Colonel Elijah V. White and his 35th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry were in winter quarters with the Confederate army in the Shenandoah Valley, watching their rations dwindle. White, facing the desertion and starvation of his ranks, managed to obtain permission to take the 35th back home to Loudoun County so that he might try to obtain forage and resume partisan activities against the Federal army occupying the county. The Federals too <b>were</b> <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> winter quarters, though with far greater rations and prospects for the spring campaign season. Around Christmas 1864, Col. Thomas C. Devin's cavalry brigade from the Harpers Ferry garrison, who regularly patrolled Loudoun, made camp northwest of the Unionist village of Lovettsville in the vicinity of George's Schoolhouse, just east of the Short Hill Mountain.|$|E

5000|$|Pacifiers <b>were</b> <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> their modern form around 1900 {{when the}} first teat, shield and handle design was {{patented}} in the US as a [...] "baby comforter" [...] by Manhattan pharmacist Christian W. Meinecke. [...] Rubber {{had been used in}} flexible teethers sold as [...] "elastic gum rings" [...] for British babies in the mid-19th century, and also used for feeding-bottle teats. In 1902, Sears, Roebuck & Co. advertised a [...] "new style rubber teething ring, with one hard and one soft nipple". And in 1909 someone calling herself [...] "Auntie Pacifier" [...] wrote to the New York Times to warn of the [...] "menace to health" [...] (she meant dental health) of [...] "the persistent, and, among poorer classes, the universal sucking of a rubber nipple sold as a 'pacifier'." [...] In England too, dummies were seen as something the [...] "poorer classes" [...] would use, and associated with poor hygiene. In 1914 a London doctor complained about [...] "the dummy teat": [...] "If it falls on the floor it is rubbed momentarily on the mother's blouse or apron, lipped by the mother and replaced in the baby's mouth." ...|$|E
50|$|The first European to {{reportedly}} {{explore the}} Clare Valley was John Hill, who {{did so in}} early April 1839, discovering and naming the Hutt River. Its nearby twin, the Hill River, was later discovered and named in his honour. On returning to Adelaide, he reported his findings of potentially good farmland to his friend and associate, Edward John Eyre. Eyre in turn informed John Horrocks, who had only arrived in South Australia during March 1839. Eyre later explored the Clare Valley on the return journey from his second 1839 expedition to the northern regions of South Australia. Horrocks set out with his servant, John Green and established himself in the area now known as Penwortham. This became the first permanent settlement in the valley. By 1840, Edward Burton Gleeson had set up the Inchiquin pastoral run to the north which was later developed into the town of Clare and in 1848, Jesuits <b>were</b> <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> the place which would become the town of Sevenhill. Settlers came from places including England, Ireland, Poland and Silesia during the 1840s, producing a rich heritage of architecture and villages, which remain largely intact. Vineyards were planted alongside those first villages and winemaking has continued ever since.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Post World War II victory {{culture and}} its fallout-the {{consensus}} ideology-led {{to the creation of}} a middle class willing to conform to a prescribed set of ideals, safely removed from all danger, and enjoying the material benefits of a growing middle-class income bracket. Walt Disney and Hugh Hefner, two seemingly ideologically opposed businessmen, recognized this economic, political, and cultural shift and sought to capitalize on it financially. A cultural-history study of both companies revels many similarities in each company's design, development, and impact on American culture. To begin with, Disneyland and Playboy appeared in the mid- 1950 s as Americans <b>were</b> <b>settling</b> <b>into</b> postwar affluence and consumerism. Disney and Hefner each recognized the changes occurring within society and intended to design areas of reprieve. As such, Disneyland and Playboy were designed as areas of refuge where one could escape the stifling conformity of middle-class America and simultaneously forget Cold War fears. Instead, Disneyland and Playboy embraced the consensus and became reflections of society and culture rather than operatives of counter-culture. To understand how each company could fail in its original intent but remain as an emblem of American culture, it is necessary to understand the era, the men behind the visions, and how each company absorbed and reacted to cultural attitudes and strains. Disney and Hefner manipulated their way into the American cultural consciousness through a series of ironies and inconsistencies. Each sought to provide a haven of diversity as an alternative to the consensus conformity rampant within 1950 s society. Ultimately, Disneyland and Playboy came to represent the homogeneity Disney and Hefner sought to escape...|$|E
