Some computer scientists believe that the specialty of AI can still make new contributions to {{the resolution of the}} [...] "mind body problem". They suggest that based on the reciprocal influences between software and hardware that takes place in all computers, it is possible that someday theories can be discovered that help us to understand the reciprocal influences between the human mind and the brain (<b>wetware).</b>|$|E
500|$|Dennis Feldman had {{the idea}} for Species in 1987, as he worked on another film about an alien invasion, Real Men. Having read an article by Arthur C. Clarke about the insurmountable odds against an {{extraterrestrial}} craft ever locating and visiting Earth, given that stellar distances are great, and faster-than-light travel is unlikely, Feldman started {{to think that it}} was [...] "unsophisticated for any alien culture to come here in what 'd describe as a big tin can." [...] Thus in turn he considered that the possibility of extraterrestrial contact was through information. Then he detailed that a message would contain instructions from across the void to build something that would talk to men. Instead of a mechanical device, Feldman imagined <b>wetware.</b> The visitor would adapt to Earth's environment through DNA belonging to Earth's organisms. Mankind has sent to space transmissions [...] "giving out directions" [...] such as the Arecibo message, which Feldman considered unwary, as they relay information to potential predators from outer space. He pointed out that [...] "in nature, one species would not want a predator to know where it hides." ...|$|E

5000|$|Rudy Rucker {{references}} {{the term}} {{in a number of}} books, including one entitled Wetware: [...] "... all sparks and tastes and tangles, all its stimulus/response patterns - the whole bio-cybernetic software of mind." [...] Rucker did not use the word to simply mean a brain, nor in the human-resources sense of employees. He used <b>wetware</b> to stand for the data found in any biological system, analogous perhaps to the firmware that is found in a ROM chip. In Rucker's sense, a seed, a plant graft, an embryo, or a biological virus are all <b>wetware.</b> DNA, the immune system, and the evolved neural architecture of the brain are further examples of <b>wetware</b> in this sense.|$|E
