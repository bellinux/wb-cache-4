If you get high, you can do that, which is <b>why</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Sorkin {{attended}} Syracuse University. In {{his freshman}} year he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback {{because he wanted to}} be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that [...] "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason <b>why</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of us went to [...] 'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year. He was still saying it in May. On the last day of classes, he said it again, and I said, 'How?', and he answered, 'Dare to fail'. I've been coming through on his admonition ever since".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. IGN contributor Robert Canning praised [...] "The Funcooker" [...] {{writing that}} it was fantastic and [...] "never felt like a moment was wasted or that a scene was extraneous." [...] He enjoyed all the storylines in the episode, writing they were interesting and funny enough, and complimented the way they all tied together with such ease. Canning enjoyed Tracy's actions writing that they fit perfectly for the Tracy character, and gave the episode a 9.6 out of 10 rating. [...] "Holy normalsauce, did I ever love this episode", wrote Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons. Her only complaint about this episode was Scott Adsit's absence. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was grateful that the episode focused on NBC, TGS, {{and the work of}} the staff. Sassone wrote that despite [...] "The Funcooker" [...] not being [...] "the most laugh-out-loud episode" [...] he believed it was still funny. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin praised Jackie Hoffman's performance, noting that her monologue in court was brilliant. He enjoyed all of the episode's storylines, except for Tracy's, which he opined fell flat. In conclusion, Rabin gave this episode a B+ rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall wrote that an episode like [...] "The Funcooker" [...] is [...] "really instructive about <b>why</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of other shows... haven't quite worked. Even when they have lots of funny things in them, they never really build to a climax in the way that this one did, as everything went wrong at once." [...] Sepinwall enjoyed Tina Fey's Liz in the episode, noting that her craziness worked well, but his concern was that when Liz loses it [...] "there's nobody sane for her to push against." ...|$|E

2500|$|Goodfellas {{is based}} on New York crime {{reporter}} Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguy. Martin Scorsese {{did not intend to}} make another mob film until he saw a review of Pileggi's book, which he then read while working on the set of Color of Money in 1986. He had always been fascinated by the Mob lifestyle and was drawn to Pileggi's book because it was the most honest portrayal of gangsters he had ever read. After reading Pileggi's book, the filmmaker knew what approach he wanted to take: [...] "To begin Goodfellas like a gunshot and have it get faster from there, almost like a two-and-a-half-hour trailer. I think it's {{the only way you can}} really sense the exhilaration of the lifestyle, and to get a sense of <b>why</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people are attracted to it." [...] According to Pileggi, Scorsese cold-called the writer and told him, [...] "I've been waiting for this book my entire life", to which Pileggi replied, [...] "I've been waiting for this phone call my entire life".|$|E

5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head.

He might have been a fine young man with a bad toothache; with the first even of his life. What ailed him above all, she felt, was that trouble was new to him: he had never known a difficulty; he had taken all his fences, his world wholly the world of the personally possible, rounded indeed by a gray suburb into which he had never had occasion to stray. In this vulgar and ill-lighted region he had evidently now lost himself. [...] "We left it quite to her honor, you know," [...] he said ruefully.|$|E
