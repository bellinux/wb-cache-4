Real, significant, innovation occurs mostly when several people simultaneously have the same idea and mysteriously move in the same direction, following subliminally emitted and received signals. The contemporary cultural inclination to see innovation as an inherently collaborative effort, a communal, discursive growing and groping towards the new, as consensual and shared, appears to find confirmation throughout history, going back to the Renaissance, looking at Picasso and Braque, the Surrrealists, and the radical architecture groups of the 1960's and the early 70's such as Superstudio and Archigram. So we seek the experiment of working with others, including other architects. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to lose?

40|$|In ideological terms, punk is a contestation {{movement}} in its artistic, {{economic and social}} dimensions. It resembled the 1960 s' garage rock since it favoured the public mobilization of youths through the proliferation of bands that campaigned for the do it yourself strategy. In Western societies, punk represented a departure from and a repositioning towards the existing social structure for which it also provided a soundtrack. It is {{in this context that}} we ap-proach the Portuguese punk, considering its importance in a society under recent processes of democratization and modernization. In fact, sociological theory must contribute to understand the set of social practices related to music in light of both the structural principles and properties of social life and the new emergent subjectivities, particularly among youths. Thus, in this article, we propose to look at punk from its protagonists' discourses. We will consider the words used by punk bands in two ways: their names and the words they use in their lyrics. In both cases, we deal with self-representation issues: who are <b>we,</b> how <b>do</b> <b>we</b> position and distinguish ourselves from others, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to say about ourselves, our time and our world? What are our values and <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to say regarding dominant social values? What are the causes that move us, how <b>do</b> <b>we</b> want to act, how <b>do</b> <b>we</b> want the world to be like? As with any other self-representations, content is not independent from form. Therefore, mat-ters such as identification and actors (who speaks? who is he/she speaking to?) or language (how does the speaker express him/herself? Which codes does he/she resort to? Using which forms?) are also examined. Our analysis suggests that the punk discourse about identity tends to be structured around three main axes: (a) cosmopolitanism; (b) the radical assumption of an irreducible difference towards social order; and (c) an ambivalent attitude towards politics and political action...|$|R
