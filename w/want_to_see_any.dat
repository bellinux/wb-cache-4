5|$|Despite this success, Berger {{still had}} to {{negotiate}} with the Wehrmacht, which opposed his attempts to expand the Waffen-SS at almost every turn. In early 1940, Himmler and Berger were outmaneuvered by Generaloberst Wilhelm Keitel, Chief of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Wehrmacht High Command or OKW) {{on a number of issues}} around Waffen-SS recruiting, reflecting the strong influence the Wehrmacht still had with Hitler. On 20 April 1940, Berger was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer. According to Berger, Himmler never intended that the Waffen-SS would supplant the Army, and after the war he intended that it would be reduced to seven active and five reserve divisions. Berger created a recruiting structure throughout the Reich, mirroring that of the Army, but while the Wehrmacht, which controlled the draft, was willing to allow Berger enough recruits to maintain the three divisions and the LSSAH, it did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> further expansion. To get around this, Berger had to look outside the Reich.|$|E
500|$|Akhmatova {{started writing}} poetry {{at the age}} of 11, and was {{published}} in her late teens, inspired by the poets Nikolay Nekrasov, Jean Racine, Alexander Pushkin, Evgeny Baratynsky and the Symbolists; however, none of her juvenilia survives. Her sister Inna also wrote poetry though she did not pursue the practice and married shortly after high school. Akhmatova's father did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> verses printed under his [...] "respectable" [...] name, so she chose to adopt her grandmother's distinctly Tatar surname 'Akhmatova' as a pen name.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of juntas in Spanish America, {{such as the}} Junta Suprema de Caracas on April 19, 1810, {{set the stage for}} the fighting that would afflict the region for the next decade and a half. Political fault lines appeared, and were often the causes of military conflict. [...] On the one hand the juntas challenged the authority of all royal officials, whether they recognized the Regency or not. On the other hand, royal officials and Spanish Americans who desired to keep the empire together were split between liberals, who supported the efforts of the Cortes, and conservatives (often called [...] "absolutists" [...] in the historiography), who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> innovations in government. Finally, although the juntas claimed to carry out their actions in the name of the deposed king, Ferdinand VII, their creation provided an opportunity for people who favored outright independence to publicly and safely promote their agenda. The proponents of independence called themselves patriots, a term which eventually was generally applied to them.|$|E

5000|$|On June 3, 2011 in the {{aftermath}} of the June 1 meeting, Mayor Pike announced his opposition to the Gateway Pacific Terminal project, stating [...] "At this point, I don't think this community <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> coal, and I'm kind of with them on that," [...] and critiqued the concerns over employment opportunities, stating [...] "We cannot turn our backs on people who are struggling in this community, but that doesn't mean we take jobs at any cost." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{requirements}} {{for a new}} class of dreadnoughts were in a state of flux during 1907, but Vickers Ltd submitted a design that met the latest specifications and was very nearly accepted by the Navy for a [...] ship with twelve [...] guns in triple, superimposed turrets. However rumors of a contract with Vickers raised a public outcry as they had some problems with the armored cruiser [...] then building in England. The Naval Ministry defused the situation on 30 December 1907 by announcing an international design contest with the ship built in Russia regardless of the nationality of the winning firm. By the deadline of 12 March 1908 a total of 51 designs had been submitted by 13 different shipyards. The winner of the competition was a design from the German firm of Blohm & Voss, but the French protested that they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> of the money that they had loaned Russia to build up its defenses in German pockets. The Russians bought the design for 250,000 rubles and shelved it to placate both sides. A design by the Baltic Works had been the runner-up and was revised for the Navy's updated requirements with a complete design to be presented by 22 March 1909. This was extended by a month to allow the Baltic Works to finalize its contract with the British firm of John Brown & Company for design assistance with the hull form and machinery.|$|E
2500|$|About Iran nuclear program, the Omani {{government}} official position on Iran’s nuclear program is as follows: [...] "The sultanate hopes Washington will {{engage in a}} ‘direct dialogue’ with Teheran to resolve the crisis over the Iranian nuclear program. The sultanate has {{no reason not to}} believe Iran’s assurances that its program has purely civilian purposes. This region, no doubt, does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> military confrontation or any tension".|$|E
2500|$|Frank Spiering further {{developed}} the theory in his book Prince Jack (1978), which depicted Albert Victor as the murderer and Stephen as his lover. The book is widely dismissed as a sensational fiction based on previous theories rather than genuine historical research. Spiering claimed to have discovered a copy of some private notes written by another suspect, Sir William Gull, {{in the library of}} the New York Academy of Medicine and that the notes included a confession by Albert Victor under a state of hypnosis. Spiering further suggested that Albert Victor died due to an overdose of morphine, administered to him on the order of Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and possibly Albert Victor's own father, Edward VII of the United Kingdom. The New York Academy of Medicine denies possessing the records Spiering mentioned, and when Spiering was offered access to the Royal Archives, he retorted: [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> files." ...|$|E

2500|$|United States – The US Department of State {{announced}} limited {{support for}} the PYD in February 2016, although it opposes the unilateral establishment of a federal region in northern Syria. In March 2016, {{the day after the}} declaration of the Democratic Federation of Rojava - Northern Syria, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter praised the Rojava YPG militia as having [...] "proven to be excellent partners of ours on the ground in fighting ISIL. We are grateful for that, and we intend to continue to do that, recognizing the complexities of their regional role." [...] The USA have usually supported the YPG militia in its fight against ISIL, both with air support in combat and with embedded US Special Forces. During the Northern Raqqa offensive (May 2016), US Special Operation Forces were widely reported and photographed taking part, wearing YPG and YPJ badges on their uniforms. When in June 2016 the Manbij offensive started, the Washington Post reported it under the headline of [...] "Ignoring Turkey, U.S. backs Kurds in drive against ISIS in Syria". On 7 November 2016, when asked about the federalization of Syria, Mark C. Toner, the Deputy Spokesperson for the US Department of State, said [...] "We don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> kind of ad hoc federalism or federalist system arise. We don’t want to see semi-autonomous zones. The reality is, though, as territory is liberated from Daesh, you got to get some kind of governance back into these areas, but by no means are we condoning or – any kind of, as I said, ad hoc semi-autonomous areas in northern Syria". According to lieutenant general Stephen J. Townsend of the United States Army in an interview on 29 March 2017, the US does not recognize Rojava as a [...] "Kurdish state" [...] but instead sees it as a [...] "multi-cultural, multi-party, multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian Syrian region being liberated from ISIS." ...|$|E

50|$|Unlike Orpheus who was {{actually}} descended from Gods, Sir Orfeo's parents were just named after Gods. When Sir Orfeo goes to take his wife back, no condition is issued to not look back at her. Sir Orfeo exiles himself for ten years, citing not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> more women after suffering {{the loss of his}} beautiful wife. For Orpheus, this self-exile occurs after he has lost Eurydice the second time. The loss of Eurydice, and the saving of Heurodis is the main difference between the tragedy of the original myth and the romance lai Sir Orfeo.|$|R
