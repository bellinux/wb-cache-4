40|$|During the {{renovation}} of flat roofs, the waterproofing layer is often repaired locally rather than completely replaced. When making such repairs, {{it is very important}} to know whether the proposed <b>bitumen</b> <b>sheets</b> are compatible in order to prevent delamination and the release of the joints. This paper deals with the determination of the resistance of <b>bitumen</b> <b>sheet</b> joints against peeling when combined with different bitumen materials. On the basis of the described test methodology it was possible to determine whether the selected bitumen materials were compatible with <b>bitumen</b> <b>sheets.</b> As part of the experiments, modified <b>bitumen</b> <b>sheets</b> with plastomers (PO), oxidized bitumen (OX), and elastomers (SBS), were tested...|$|R

40|$|One-layer {{mechanical}} fastening waterproofing systems {{are often used}} within the compositions of flat roofs. Although in case of plastic based systems {{it is a common}} solution, for asphalt felts it handles about a relatively new approach, since the application of asphalt has a long history in the building industry. There are some key factors which all of the one-layer mechanically fastening systems should meet, especially water-resistance and resistance against the suction of wind. The application of dynamic loads on the joints may damage the bonds, which may lead to leakage of water. In particular the most delicate locations are the anchoring points at places where the waterproofing sheets are not connected mutually and the wind is captured. The characteristics of mechanically fastening waterproofing membranes may be verified by a specific test which is able to simulate the winds suction force, nonetheless it is quite expensive. Throughout the solution of the presented work an equipment was designed to observe the behaviour of roof compositions on smaller segments while taking into account the fastening elements, thus bringing the results closer to reality. In the first phase the presented dissertation aims to look at the possibilities of comparison of mechanically fastening <b>bitumen</b> reinforced <b>sheets</b> in a way, that they would show {{the extent to which the}} joints depend on the parameters of <b>bitumen</b> <b>sheet</b> - like the quality of the bitumen mass, the type bearing linen, the thickness of the layer or just the width of strip overlap. In the next phase the research was focused on the extent at which the strength of the resulting mechanically fastened joints is affected by the placement of fastenings elements within the strip overlap, including the possibilities when the distances from the edges of the bitumen strip cannot be maintained or because of improper geometry of fastening elements. The measurements were performed on both variants of flat roofs, thermally insulate...|$|R
40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} within the project DuraTB - Durable Timber Bridges. The {{goal of the}} project is to develop sustainable timber bridges by developing guidelines for moisture design and developing new and improved bridges and bridge details. This report describes the results from a subproject with the participation of SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden, Martinsons Byggsystem AB, Moelven Töreboda AB and the Swedish Transport Administration. Also waterproofing contractors and entrepreneurs participated in the work. The purpose of the subproject was to investigate primers and waterproofing and to improve the edge details of Swedish timber bridges with stresslaminated decks made of spruce. This report contains a summary of follow-up of blistering on wooden decks, tests of bitumen primers with regard to adhesion and water resistance and tests of new edge solutions for wooden bridges. A review of inspection results {{from more than one}} hundred inspected Swedish timber bridges with asphalt pavement on stress-laminated decks showed that about 30 % had some remarks about the pavement. The most common damages were cracks especially at deck ends in connection to abutments. Bridges with blisters at the time of inspection were few. Laboratory tests of adhesion were carried out which showed that the primer can contribute to the adhesion of the waterproofing <b>bitumen</b> <b>sheet</b> to the wood, although both tensile and tear tests gave large variations in the results so it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. The tests showed that both water-based and solvent-based primer can be used. Timber bridge manufacturers want to use the more environmentally friendly waterbased primer in the factory and the more weather resistant and quick drying solvent-based at the building site. The tests showed, however, also some adhesion of waterproofing sheets to a wood surface without primer, even to a damp or dirty surface. Testing of water resistance of primer on wood surfaces showed that the primer provides some moisture protection which is favorable for the wood. The penetration of moisture was less than for untreated wood, but the primer was not completely waterproof. An untreated moist wood surface, however, dried out relatively quickly. At the testing of edge details with installations of edge steel angels on wooden deck specimens, the steel angels showed a tendency to deform under the effect of heat from welding of the waterproofing <b>bitumen</b> <b>sheet.</b> To get a robust solution with little deformation also mechanical fixings to the wood deck was tested and is recommended. Several parties are involved in the construction process, so {{there is a need for}} detailed descriptions for the work.

40|$|AbstractThe use of PCMs for {{improving}} buildings’ thermal comfort conditions and reducing summer cooling need {{has been largely}} investigated in the last decade. The capability of these materials of storing heat in latent form has been pointed out, especially when integrated in building envelopes. This paper deals with {{the analysis of the}} benefits in terms of buildings’ energy saving generated by the integration of PCMs inside two types of membrane for roofing applications, i. e. a traditional bitumen membrane and an innovative cool polyurethane-based membrane. To this aim, the dynamic simulation of the energy performance of a test-room was carried out. Four configurations were simulated and compared: (i) roof covered by a <b>bitumen</b> <b>sheet</b> membrane, (ii) roof covered by a cool membrane, (iii) the cool membrane with integrated PCMs, and (iv) the bitumen membrane with integrated PCMs. Both winter and summer conditions were studied. The results showed that PCMs integrated into the cool membrane are able to guarantee a 10. 4 % cooling energy saving, while PCMs integrated into the bitumen membrane generate a 12. 6 % of energy reduction for cooling if compared to the only bitumen membrane. The same roof configurations without taking into account the roof insulation layer generate a reduction of the cooling energy requirement of about 9. 4 % and 16. 6 %, respectively. In winter conditions, the reduction of the heating demand generated by the integration of PCMs inside the bitumen membrane is about 4. 4 % and 6. 9 %, with and without considering the roof insulation, respectively. Additionally, the heating energy saving generated by including PCMs into the cool membrane is equal to 5. 4 % and 8. 4 %, with and without considering the roof insulation layer, respectively. These results demonstrated that the integration of PCMs in both cool and non-cool roof membranes is able to reduce building energy requirement in both summer and winter conditions, especially in non-insulated roof configuration...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of atmospheric deposition {{to the metal}} load at the outlet of a small urban catchment (Pin Sec, France) was studied. A new method {{taking into account the}} nature of urban surfaces (glass, tile, <b>bitumen,</b> zinc <b>sheet,</b> grass, façade coating, and slate) was developed to measure atmospheric dry deposition. Dry deposition, wet deposition and stormwater loading were measured from September 2010 to August 2011. At the year scale, atmospheric deposition was not a major contributor to the metal load at the outlet of this small catchment. Wet deposition ranged from &# 60; 1 % to 29 %. The {{contribution of}} dry deposition (generally less than 5 %) was especially low and appeared to be smaller than that reported in previous studies. On this catchment, the major part of the metal load could be attributed to stormwater runoff (64 - 99 %). Though several hypotheses were made e. g. grass (not an impervious surface) was not taken into account and it was considered that all the deposits were washed off. This methodology looks promising and should be taken into consideration when carrying out new researches on the contribution of atmospheric deposition to the pollution load in urban catchments.

40|$|Highly {{reflective}} roofs can {{decrease the}} energy required for building air conditioning, help mitigate the urban heat island effect, and slow global warming. However, these benefits are diminished by soiling and weathering processes that reduce the solar reflectance of most roofing materials. Soiling {{results from the}} deposition of atmospheric particulate matter {{and the growth of}} microorganisms, each of which absorb sunlight. Weathering of materials occurs with exposure to water, sunlight, and high temperatures. This study developed an accelerated aging method that incorporates features of soiling and weathering. The method sprays a calibrated aqueous soiling mixture of dust minerals, black carbon, humic acid, and salts onto preconditioned coupons of roofing materials, then subjects the soiled coupons to cycles of ultraviolet radiation, heat and water in a commercial weatherometer. Three soiling mixtures were optimized to reproduce the site-specific solar spectralreflectance features of roofing products exposed for 3 years in a hot and humid climate (Miami, Florida); a hot and dry climate (Phoenix, Arizona); and a polluted atmosphere in a temperate climate (Cleveland, Ohio). A fourth mixture was designed to reproduce the three-site average values of solar reflectance and thermal emittance attained after 3 years of natural exposure, which the Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) uses to rate roofing products sold in the US. This accelerated aging method was applied to 25 products?single ply membranes, factory and field applied coatings, tiles, modified <b>bitumen</b> cap <b>sheets,</b> and asphalt shingles?and reproduced in 3 days the CRRC's 3 -year aged values of solar reflectance.

50|$|The root words photo, litho, and graphy {{all have}} Greek origins, with the {{meanings}} 'light', 'stone' and 'writing' respectively. As {{suggested by the}} name compounded from them, photolithography is a printing method (originally based {{on the use of}} limestone printing plates) in which light plays an essential role. In the 1820s, Nicephore Niepce invented a photographic process that used Bitumen of Judea, a natural asphalt, as the first photoresist. A thin coating of the <b>bitumen</b> on a <b>sheet</b> of metal, glass or stone became less soluble where it was exposed to light; the unexposed parts could then be rinsed away with a suitable solvent, baring the material beneath, which was then chemically etched in an acid bath to produce a printing plate. The light-sensitivity of bitumen was very poor and very long exposures were required, but despite the later introduction of more sensitive alternatives, its low cost and superb resistance to strong acids prolonged its commercial life into the early 20th century. In 1940, Oskar Süß created a positive photoresist by using diazonaphthoquinone, which worked in the opposite manner: the coating was initially insoluble and was rendered soluble where it was exposed to light. In 1954, Louis Plambeck Jr. developed the Dycryl polymeric letterpress plate, which made the platemaking process faster.|$|R
40|$|Roofing {{membranes}} for low-slope application {{are generally}} asphalt- or polymer-based. 1 Bitumen {{has been used}} as a roof water-proofing agent for many years. To make bitumen tougher and more elastic, a synthetic polymer is usually added. The resulting mixture is called modified <b>bitumen.</b> Modified bituminous <b>sheets</b> are made by combining the modified bitumen with reinforcements such as glass and polyester fibres. Two types of modifiers are commonly used: atactic polypropylene (APP) and styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS). SBS is a rubber-type modifier that gives bitumen the ability to stretch and resist damage, and improves its cold-temperature flexibility. In asphalt-based roofs, blisters occur fre-quently. Blisters are pockets of entrapped air and/or moisture in roof membranes. They can occur between the cap and the base sheets and/or between the base sheet and the substrate (Figure 1). Blisters range from barely detectable spongy spots to bloated humps several square metres in area. Not only are blisters unsightly, but they can also shorten the service life of a roof, by increasing the membrane’s vulnera-bility to physical and chemical degradation. Their sloping sides can also change the direction of water flow on a roof and cause ponding. Blisters are the most common problem with built-up roofs (BUR) 2, and they may occur even more frequently in modified bituminous roofs. Field research indicates that blistering is more common with SBS-than APP-modified membranes. ...|$|R
5000|$|Temple II is most liveable {{still with}} {{retaining}} walls and terraces stiffs, first stage the oval terrace {{was built in}} local stone, but after an enlargement {{it was built in}} limestone which must have been carried by boat from nearby Jidda island where stone was hewn out by hand and carefully dressed into remarkably neat masonry blocks. The skill with which this task was carried out may be clearly seen in the temple walls and especially around the sacred well. A double circular altar and an offering table stood {{in the center of the}} shrine. To the south were three cult stones shaped like the anchors of the merchant ships. Although the central one bore a protruding animal head, like the altars depicted on the seals. A temple treasure lay in the stone frame pit in the north-east comer.The central terrace was crowned by a shrine built of cut stone with stone paving. Smaller buildings clustered around it covering the rest of the terrace. There were no buildings on the outer oval terrace but altars and cult symbols were visible. A plinth with recessed stone cylinder lay to the south and a plinth with three pillars was situated near the north-west wall. A double row of plinths for cult objects lined both sides of the stairs from the upper terrace. On each of these plinths were two square holes lined with <b>bitumen</b> and <b>sheet</b> copper nailed to wood.Here may have stood copper mounted poles with the emblems of gods, so often seen on the stamp seals, or, perhaps, wooden statues. From the central terrace a ceremonial stairway led to the subterranean shrine where water cult ceremonies took place. Halfway down the stair was a portal, and from there the stair was roofed. The rich natural spring which filled the pool probably accounts for the siting of the temple at Barbar.
