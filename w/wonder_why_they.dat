500|$|Many reviewers {{praised the}} game's combat and pacing. G4 called the game's combat [...] "sublime," [...] {{and said that}} [...] "no Infinity Engine game thus far has had such {{interesting}} and intricate tactical combat." [...] GameSpot called it [...] "expertly paced." [...] PC Zone complained that certain gameplay mechanics had become outdated, but that [...] "the only real downer is the antiquated spell system and the inexplicable necessity to rest after every fight." [...] The game was also praised for its implementation of the Third Edition rules and interface. Computer Gaming World said that [...] "IWD II has the Third Edition rules down, and in no other place in the game is it more apparent than with character development," [...] and PC Gamer said it had [...] "a dazzling implementation of the D 3rd Edition rules." [...] GameSpot called the interface [...] "a big improvement on the spread-out interface of all previous Infinity Engine games," [...] and IGN said that [...] "the customization improvements to the interface that seem so natural, they make you <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> weren't thought of before." [...] Game Informer called the interface [...] "absolutely inspired" [...] and its inventory system [...] "second to none." ...|$|E
2500|$|Detective Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) is a mild-mannered {{forensic}} accountant. Hot-tempered detective Terry [...] "Yankee Clipper" [...] Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) {{has been}} partnered with Allen {{ever since he}} mistakenly shot Derek Jeter during the World Series. Allen and Terry receive no respect from the other officers, particularly detectives Martin (Rob Riggle) and Fosse (Damon Wayans, Jr.). All but Terry idolize cocky detectives Chris Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and P. K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson), who are considered the city's best policemen even though they frequently cause {{millions of dollars in}} property damage catching petty criminals. During a pursuit, Danson and Highsmith leap to their deaths after misjudging their ability to survive a fall, which causes the precinct to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> did it and who will take their place.|$|E
6000|$|She {{laughed and}} played with her fan. [...] "Oh, well; we are curious about strangers, {{particularly}} when they are friends of the president's. One <b>wonders</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> come." ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not doubt}} it, yet I dared not make so bold as to confess it, and I <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> should laugh {{to hear her}} earnest censure of them.|$|R
50|$|In the tape, Khaled al-Harbi {{states that}} he and those with him began <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> had not heard news of the attacks, and then they got the news and celebrated.|$|R
2500|$|Criticism of {{the game}} was largely leveled at the storyline, which reviewers found at times to be {{confusing}} or poorly executed and with IGN UK advising players to revisit the earlier titles for clarity. The game's final cinematic is over 90 minutes long. However, the overall result was praised as emotionally engaging and topical, and characters such as Liquid Ocelot were singled out {{for the quality of}} their depiction. It was generally conceded that although the use of cut scenes is more intrusive than it needs to be (comprising [...] "about half of the content {{of the game}}" [...] by one estimate, and which [...] "might make you crave action, or <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> couldn't have been turned into interactive sequences"), the style is somewhat appropriate given the rest of the series ("in many ways it's a vindication of Kojima's unique interpretation of the videogame medium") and unlikely to trouble fans. The addition of a pause function for these story sequences was universally welcomed.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{they will}} trace our {{footsteps}} {{up to the}} hole or the bush," [...] said Miles, [...] "and <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> can trace them no further. What then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all in {{that paper}} Sankey {{left in his}} {{overcoat}} pocket. Get it an' you have the whole story. I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> don't put you in jail?" ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> had dug a great hole in {{the ground}} merely to bury dry bones. Surely there was no sense in that; no one wanted to steal dry bones.|$|R
60|$|Since then, {{her memory}} is wholly faded out and gone; {{and now she}} writes letters to the school-mates who had been dead forty years, and <b>wonders</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> neglect her and do not answer.|$|R
60|$|Martin {{thought they}} must be the black people of the sky; he <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were black and not white, like white birds, or blue, and of other {{brilliant}} colours like {{the people of the}} Mirage.|$|R
60|$|ANDROCLES (naively) Now I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> all {{run away}} from us like that. (The lion {{combining}} a series of yawns, purrs, and roars, achieves something very like a laugh).|$|E
6000|$|... "They're real darlings!" [...] she soliloquised. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> pity me so!" [...] And {{she wandered}} on, murmuring to herself [...] "It must have two good marks, and----" ...|$|E
60|$|WAKI Yes, I {{know that}} the cloth of this place and the {{lacquers}} are famous things. I have already heard of their glory, and yet I still <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> have such great reputation.|$|E
60|$|He {{was sitting}} on his throne, {{surrounded}} by {{the sons of the}} other emperors, who served him as pages. These youths came forward to greet their new companion, and <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> felt so attracted towards him.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is what I {{thought of}} when they were attacking us," [...] the archer said, [...] "and <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> should waste men so freely when a torch would have done their {{business}} just as well for them." ...|$|R
60|$|In a few minutes, all {{had joined}} him. They {{were in high}} spirits at {{the success of this}} first skirmish; and <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> had been so {{suddenly}} called off, when the Romans had shown no signs of advancing against them.|$|R
6000|$|... "He left {{my father}} {{alone in his}} trouble," [...] said Thirlwell grimly. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> gave him his title. There were things done when the combine was made the {{shareholders}} didn't know, besides injustices to the staffs. You see, I had friends--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At first, I used to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> cried so {{when they}} went, and why the others all cried, too; {{but by the time}} the last two left, I had come to know all about it, and knew that they had been given by the sultan to his {{favourite}} officers.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> {{made you}} the Newdigate poet at Oxford, Sholto: you mix your metaphors most dreadfully. Dont {{be angry with}} me: I {{understand}} what you mean; and I am very sorry. I say flippant things because I must. How can one meet seriousness in modern society except by chaff?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I rather <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> let me out," [...] she observed. [...] "Perhaps you {{can explain}} why Frau Essendorf keeps on writing to me under my {{pseudonym}} of 'Miss Brown' and to my reputed address in Lincolnshire, begging me to return." ...|$|R
6000|$|So for a {{while they}} sat, one {{each side of the}} paper [...] "fire-stove ornament," [...] both <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> had shed such {{scalding}} tears on that day they had kissed each other good-bye; then said [...] "good-bye" [...] again, and were glad.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I do all that? I didn't know I was of any use. I only {{tried to}} be good and grateful, for there didn't seem to be {{anything}} else I could do," [...] said Jill, <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were all so fond of her.|$|R
6000|$|... "God Almighty! {{there is}} no cure, except the {{abolition}} of government. Government means that kind of thing. Look at it! Here we enthrone the hungry, vicious, uneducated mob of incapables, and then <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> steal, and gorge and riot like satyrs. The wonder is they don't scrape the paint off the walls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, aunt, I {{was going}} to say footman, and then I thought of Thomas à Becket; and there was Thomas the Rhymer. I have heard of him, but I never read any of his rhymes. I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> did not call them poems. But I expect even Thomas à Becket was called Tom in his own family." ...|$|E
6000|$|Vane disregarded the ironical question. [...] "She's Irish; that {{accounts}} for a good deal." [...] He paused and looked thoughtful. [...] "If I {{knew how to do}} it, I'd like to give the child who dances five dollars. It must be a tough life, and her mother--the woman at the piano--looks ill.

6000|$|... "I {{should n't}} think you 'd envy anybody, for you 've got one another," [...] said Polly, with such a wistful look, that it {{suddenly}} set Tom and Fanny to <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> did n't have better times together, and enjoy themselves, as Polly and Jim did.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile Hank Busche, the {{unwanted}} {{pastor of the}} little Ashton Community Church discovers {{that there are many}} demons in the town and <b>wonders</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> have all congregated here.

60|$|For some {{minutes they}} {{scarcely}} held the craft against the stream. Indeed, Thirlwell afterwards <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> kept it up, {{since it was}} obvious that they could not reach the landing, but imagined that Driscoll urged them. The fellow seemed resolved not to be drawn into the rapid.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> {{are coming}} round here?" [...] {{one of the}} chiefs said; [...] "they might have landed at Rhegium in the straits, and thence marched {{straight}} up into the hills. From where your camp is, Beric, you should {{know what is going}} on there, for the town stands almost below you. Is nought said there about military preparations?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems, then, {{that this}} horrible Beast keeps him a prisoner. How can I set him free? I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> both {{told me not}} to trust to appearances? I don't {{understand}} it. But, after all, it was only a dream, so why should I trouble myself about it? I had better go and find something to do to amuse myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hawkins?" [...] {{said the}} Angel softly,.... "Hawkins? The name is strange to me.... He {{did not die}} then.... It is plain enough,--Joined the Angelic Hosts, May 17, 1863. He must have felt as much out of place as I do down here. But I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> put that little pot thing {{on the top of}} this monument. Curious! There are several others about--little stone pots with a rag of stiff stone drapery over them." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{thought that}} this would be a fine plan, and <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> had not thought of it before. A few days afterwards, they decided to buy two little shovels with their money, one for each, so that they might shovel sand and gravel easier than with the wooden shovels that Jonas made.|$|R

However, a generic list of reasons is for example given in the guidelines.

6000|$|... 'My rose! my rose!' cried Bulbo; and his chamberlain dashed {{forwards}} {{and picked}} it up, {{and gave it}} to the Prince, who put it in his waistcoat. Then people <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> had laughed; there was nothing particularly ridiculous in him. He was rather short, rather stout, rather red-haired, but, in fine, for a Prince, not so bad.|$|R
