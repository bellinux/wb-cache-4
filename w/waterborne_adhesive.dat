40|$|Waterborne {{adhesives}} for rubber to metal bonding {{have been}} available since 1990. However, published information about their formulation has been limited, as proprietary restrictions are exercised by companies. As a consequence, the way these adhesives interact with substrates has not been studied extensively. With the aim of investigating the effect the components of a <b>waterborne</b> <b>adhesive</b> have on rubber to metal bonding, fractional factorial and surface response methodologies of design of experiments were employed in this study. Twenty six formulations were prepared with a polychloroprene latex as the adhesive polymer. Viscosity, wettability and non-volatile solids content were measured with each liquid adhesive, while the mechanical strength was evaluated by applying a tensile mechanical stress over cured solid adhesive films. Adhesion properties were evaluated by using a single lap-shear test on metal to metal joints and a pull-out test on rubber to metal joints. The {{results showed that the}} components with the largest relative influence on cohesive and adhesives forces were tackifier resin, silicon dioxide and polychloroprene latex type. In order to better understand the contributions of these variables, mathematical models correlating them with the response variables were obtained. This study is valuable in explaining how, through statistical methods, a <b>waterborne</b> <b>adhesive</b> for rubber to metal bonding can be formulated with a reasonably low number of experiments. This study was supported by EAFIT University...|$|E
40|$|Tackifying resins (TRs) {{are often}} added to {{pressure-sensitive}} adhesive films {{to increase their}} peel strength and adhesion energy. In <b>waterborne</b> <b>adhesives,</b> the TR is dispersed in water using surfactants and then blended with colloidal polymers in water (i. e., latex). In such waterborne systems, {{there are problems with}} the colloidal stability and difficulty in applying coatings of the particle blends; the films are often hydrophilic and subject to water uptake. Here, an alternative method of making <b>waterborne,</b> tackified <b>adhesives</b> is demonstrated. The TR is incorporated within the core of colloidal polymer particles via miniemulsion polymerization. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with force spectroscopy analysis reveals there is heterogeneity in the distribution of the TR in films made from particle blends and also in films made from miniemulsion polymers. Two populations, corresponding to TR-rich and acrylic-rich components, were identified through analysis of the AFM force-displacement curves. The nanoscale maximum adhesion force and adhesion energy were found to be higher in a miniemulsion film containing 12 wt % tackifying resin in comparison to an equivalent blended film. The macroscale tack and viscoelasticity are interpreted by consideration of the nanoscale structure and properties. The incorporation of tackifying resin through a miniemulsion polymerization process not only offers clear benefits in the processing of the adhesive, but it also leads to enhanced adhesion properties...|$|R
40|$|One of the time-tested {{challenges}} for waterborne latex pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) is {{to match the}} cohesive strength and resistance properties of a solventborne system while still providing the environmental impact and handling advantages that come with <b>waterborne</b> <b>adhesives.</b> In this paper, we will discuss the fundamental factors that have historically prevented acrylic latex PSAs from achieving the cohesive strength of solventborne dispersions. We will also discuss new technologies (including traditional and nanotechnology approaches) that have helped bridge the waterborne-solventborne cohesive strength gap and have enabled the use of waterborne PSA products in adhesive applications formerly reserved for solventborne systems. Replacing Solventborne Technology: A Multi-dimensional Problem Achieving the balance of adhesive and cohesive properties has been a challenge for waterborne latex PSA technology; however, the medium to high-end specialty PSA products have many additional requirements for acceptable performance. These properties include resistance to water degradation, water-whitening, and heat and humidity. 0...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{protection}} and legislative pressure {{to eliminate the}} use of solvents in the adhesive industry have inspired the search for safer alternatives. In the area of contact <b>adhesives,</b> the <b>waterborne</b> route {{has proved to be}} of particular interest. Based on the synergistic effect of polychloroprene latex and styrene-acrylate emulsion, a <b>waterborne</b> contact <b>adhesive</b> consisting of polychloroprene latex (PCL) and styrene-acrylate emulsion (SAE) blend has been developed. In order to blend PCL with SAE easily and to accelerate the drying rate of the adhesive, boric acid was chosen for use in the PCL/SAE blend system. Effects of boric acid and SAE content on the properties of PCL/SAE blends, such as pH value, storage stability and set time, were investigated. At the same time, the effect of SAE content on the mechanical properties of PCL/SAE blend films was studied. The morphology of blend films was characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy. The adhesive performance of the <b>waterborne</b> contact <b>adhesive</b> was evaluated by peel and shear tests. The results showed that when the <b>waterborne</b> contact <b>adhesive</b> formulation contained 40 wt % styrene-acrylate emulsion (dry weight) and 1. 25 wt % boric acid, it had a good shelf-stability, its set time was 5 min, and the blend film with this formulation was ductile and flexible with reasonably good tensile strength and very high elongation at break. And the blend films showed structure with a sea–island morphology. The waterborn...|$|R

In this paper, allyl maleated {{rosin ester}} was synthesized by the esterification of maleic rosin and allyl alcohol with catalyst. And {{then a new}} <b>waterborne</b> paper-plastic composite <b>adhesive</b> was prepared through the semi-continuous emulsion polymerization method with allyl maleated rosin ester, butyl acrylate, vinyl acetate and acrylic acid as raw materials. The product of esterification was analyzed by IR spectra, and its acid value was determined too. Polymer was analyzed by DSC and IR spectra and its T-style peel strength was determined.

40|$|An {{excess of}} {{processing}} oil was intentionally {{added in the}} formulation of vulcanized styrene-butadiene rubber for analyzing the effect on the treatment with UV radiation combined with ozone (UV-ozone) in improving the adhesion to <b>waterborne</b> polyurethane <b>adhesive</b> in footwear. Due to the excess of processing oil in the rubber, poor adhesion was expected. Both the length of the treatment and the distance between the UV radiation source to the rubber surface were studied, and the effects of the treatment on the surface chemistry, wettability and surface energy, and topography of the rubber were analyzed. The treatment of the rubber with UV-ozone removed hydrocarbon moieties and zinc stearate from the surface, and surface oxidation (C-O, C=O and COO- groups formation) occurred. As a consequence, improved wettability and increased surface energy (mainly due to the polar component of the surface energy) were obtained. The increase in the length of treatment and for a distance of 3 – 5 cm from the rubber to the UV radiation source favored the effectiveness of the UV-ozone treatment. Besides, whereas the UV-ozone treatment for 3 min produced the ablation of surface contaminants mainly, longer lengths of treatment (i. e., 6 – 9 min) caused roughness and cracks on the rubber surface. The UV-ozone treatment also caused heating of the surface. Finally, the treatment with UV-ozone increased the adhesion of the rubber to <b>waterborne</b> polyurethane <b>adhesive,</b> the highest adhesion was obtained in the joints made with UV-ozone treated rubber for 3 and 6 min at a UV radiation source-rubber surface distance of 5 cm...|$|R
30|$|Polychloroprene (CR) is {{commonly}} known as an excellent, versatile synthetic rubber with a variety of industrial application range. It has several advantages like extraordinary oil and fuel resistance, toughness, good adhesion to other materials and high heat resistance up to 100  °C [18]. The commercial application of CR was started in 1932 [19]. CR is available in both dry and latex forms. Dry grades of polychloroprene rubber are normally used in industrial and automotive rubber goods, such as hoses and belts. Latex grades of polychloroprene rubber are used in <b>waterborne</b> <b>adhesives</b> and dipped goods, such as gloves and constant velocity joint boots. Several studies have been reported on the incredible property improvement of CR nanocomposites in the presence of different types of nano filler [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Das et al. [18] studied the effect of surface-modified filler on CR-based nanocomposites with two different types of clay materials, namely montmorillonite (MMT) and layered double hydroxide (LDH). It was observed that organic modification improves the reinforcing efficiency of MMT in a greater extent than that of LDH [18]. Das et al. [20] explained an approach of compatibilization between polychloroprene (CR) and ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM) using nano clay as a compatibilizer as well as strong reinforcing filler. The remarkable improvement in the thermal stability of CR nanocomposites in the presence of ionic liquid modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was reported by Subramaniam et al. [21]. This was mainly due to the fine dispersion of modified MWCNTs within the CR matrix [21]. Very recently, Fahma et al. [23] elucidated that excellent improvement in the mechanical properties of CR was observed due to the introduction of a small amount of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) into the CR matrix. Moreover, most of the studies in the literature have reported fantastic property improvement of CR nanocomposites based on either MWCNTs or nano clay as nano filler. But, the vast study on nano CaCO 3 -filled CR composites is still very scanty.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{synthesis}} routes toward nanostructured polymer particles have emerged, but {{few examples}} demonstrate the essential {{need for such}} complex particle structures to achieve any added benefit in a target application. Here, polymer particles having Laponite clay armor were prepared by the Pickering miniemulsion polymerization of n-lauryl acrylate. The resulting "soft-hard" poly(lauryl acrylate) (PLA) -Laponite hybrid particles were blended at various low concentrations with a standard poly(butyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid) (PBA) latex for application as a <b>waterborne</b> pressure-sensitive <b>adhesive</b> (PSA). The tack adhesion properties of the resulting nanocomposite films were compared {{with the performance of}} the PBA when blended with either a conventional non-armored PLA latex, with Laponite RD nanosized clay discs, or a mixture of both. A true synergistic effect was discovered showing that the clay-armored supracolloidal structure of the hybrid particles was essential to achieve a superior balance of viscoelastic properties.

40|$|Copolymerizing an {{acrylic acid}} {{comonomer}} is often beneficial for the <b>adhesive</b> properties of <b>waterborne</b> pressure-sensitive <b>adhesives</b> (PSAs). Here, we demonstrate {{a new strategy}} in which poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) is distributed as a percolating network within a PSA film formed from a polymer colloid. A diblock copolymer composed of PAA and poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBA) blocks was synthesized using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and adsorbed onto soft acrylic latex particles prior to their film formation. The thin adsorbed shells on the particles create a percolating network that raises the elastic modulus, creep resistance and tensile strength of the final film. When the film formation occurs at pH 10, ionomeric crosslinking occurs, and high tack adhesion is obtained in combination with high creep resistance. The {{results show that the}} addition of an amphiphilic PAA-b-PBA diblock copolymer (2. 0 wt. %) to a soft latex provides a simple yet effective means of adjusting the mechanical and adhesive properties of the resulting composite film...|$|R

40|$|Acetylation of wood imparts {{moisture}} durability, decay resistance, and {{dimensional stability}} to wood; however, making durable adhesive bonds with acetylated wood {{can be more}} difficult than with unmodified wood. The usual {{explanation is that the}} acetylated surface has fewer hydroxyl groups, resulting in a harder-to-wet surface and in fewer hydrogen bonds between wood and adhesive. This concept was evaluated using four different adhesives (resorcinol–formaldehyde, emulsion polymer isocyanate, epoxy, and melamine–formaldehyde) with unmodified wood, acetylated wood, and acetylated wood that had been planed. Strikingly, acetylation did not hinder adhesive bonds with a <b>waterborne</b> resorcinol–formaldehyde <b>adhesive</b> that bonded equally well to both unmodified and acetylated yellow poplar. An epoxy adhesive bonded better to the acetylated wood than to the unmodified wood, in contrast to an emulsion polymer isocyanate, which gave less durable bonds to acetylated than to unmodified wood. Planing of the acetylated wood surface prior to bonding reduced bond durability for the epoxy adhesive and increased the amount of surface hydroxyl groups, as measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of the trifluoroacetic anhydride-treated wood. These experiments showed that wood modification is useful in understanding wood-adhesive interactions, in addition to determining how to develop adhesives for acetylated woods...|$|R
40|$|Vulcanized rubber (L 3 rubber) {{containing}} intentionally noticeable {{excess of}} processing oils in its formulation {{was treated with}} Argon–Oxygen (Ar–O 2) (2 : 1, vol/vol) low-pressure (LP) plasma for achieving a satisfactory level of adhesion to <b>waterborne</b> polyurethane <b>adhesive.</b> The effectiveness of the Ar–O 2 LP plasma treatment of L 3 rubber depended on both {{the configuration of the}} plasma chamber shelves and the treatment time. Surface modifications were assessed by attenuated total reflectance-IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, and scanning electron microscopy. Ar–O 2 LP plasma treatment in direct configuration provided the most effective surface modification of the L 3 rubber, and the increase in the treatment time improved the extent of the surface modifications. However, even important surface modifications were produced by Ar–O 2 LP plasma treatment, adhesion of treated L 3 rubber was not improved due to the creation of weak boundary layer at the polyurethane–rubber interface after joint formation. Heating at 80 °C for 12 h of the as-received L 3 rubber prior to Ar–O 2 LP plasma treatment enhanced the extent of the surface modifications, and improved adhesion was obtained for Ar–O 2 LP plasma treatment times higher than 600 s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tackifying resins (TR) {{are often}} used to improve the <b>adhesive</b> {{properties}} of <b>waterborne</b> pressure-sensitive <b>adhesives</b> (PSAs) derived from latex dispersions. There is a large gap {{in the understanding of}} how, and to what extent, the film formation mechanism of PSAs is altered by the addition of TR. Herein, magnetic resonance profiling experiments show that the addition of TR to an acrylic latex creates a coalesced surface layer or “skin ” that traps water beneath it. Atomic force microscopy of the PSA surfaces supports this conclusion. In the absence of the TR, particles at the surface do not coalesce but are separated by a second phase composed of surfactant and other species with low molecular weight. The function of the TR is complex [...] According to dynamic mechanical analysis, the TR increases the glass transition temperature of the polymer and decreases its molecular mobility at high frequencies. On the other hand, the TR increases the molecular mobility at lower frequencies and thereby promotes the interdiffusion of latex particles to create a skin layer. In turn, the skin layer is a barrier that prevents the exudation of surfactant to the surface. The TR probably enhances the coalescence of the latex particles b...|$|R

To ensure efficient chemical incorporation of the reactive PU into the hybrid latex particles, the NCO moieties were reacted with 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). The NCO-HEMA coupling reaction was thoroughly studied by conductimetry in order to control the extent of HEMA. incorporation into the PU chains. The resulting HEMA-end-capped prepolymers were chain extended in situ with Bisphenol A (BPA) and polymerized with n-butyl acrylate, methyl meth acrylate, and acrylic acid in the presence of small amounts of a chain transfer agent to form PU/acrylic particles. The amount of chain transfer agent, the ratio between HEMA and BPA, and the amount of PU were varied step by step to study their influence on the final film properties. The miniemulsions and resulting hybrid latexes were characterized in terms of size, monomer conversion, evolution of the ratio of the number of polymer particles to the number of droplets (N-p/N-d), and gel content. In parallel, the mechanical and adhesive properties of the films were tested using probe tack experiments. This allowed us to identify the reaction conditions making it possible to obtain high solids content PU/acrylic hybrid latexes, usable to prepare <b>waterborne</b> pressure-sensitive <b>adhesive</b> films with good adhesive properties, using a simple miniemulsion polymerization method...|$|R
40|$|Unexpectedly, it {{was found}} that when a <b>waterborne</b> {{polyacrylate}} <b>adhesive</b> was placed on carbon steel it was not tacky; {{this was not the case}} for the same adhesive placed on stainless steel. It was determined that the surface energy, as measured with liquid contact angles, of the adhesive films is significantly different between the two films, with the non-tacky film having a higher surface energy. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the non-tacky surface has a higher roughness which minimizes the contacting area between the film and a contacting surface. Analysis of the heating of the carbon steel coupon with infrared thermography shows a non-uniform temperature profile at the surface. This experimental data is corroborated using a 2 -D heat transfer model that incorporates the heat transfer characteristics of the various components of carbon steel. Surface driven flow, or Marangoni convection, can develop from temperature gradients and are known to cause increased roughness in polymer films. IR thermography measurements of the adhesive film during drying shows larger temperature differences for the films on carbon steel than on stainless steel. These larger temperature differences induce greater Marangoni convection, which result in the rougher surfaces on carbon steel that were measured with AFM. The effect of lowering the tack of a polyacrylate film has significant impact in the dryer section of a paper machine. This effect was quantified using the Web Adhesion Drying Simulator, which is a laboratory-scale apparatus that measures the energy required to pull the sheet from a metal surface. By substituting the adhesive-on-stainless steel with the less-sticky adhesive-on-carbon steel surface, the energy required to pull the sheet from the metal surface was reduced significantly and the picking associated with the test was nearly eliminated.
