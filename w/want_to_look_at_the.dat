6000|$|... "'My {{wife will}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> place to-morrow,' I replied; 'that is, {{if it does}} not rain: for she says she does not want to see it first in bad weather.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Meeting the {{landlord}} in the passage, Mr. Kirke nodded {{to him with}} the familiarity of an old customer. [...] "Have you got the paper?" [...] he asked; [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> visitors' list." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{waited at}} the door, {{apparently}} hesitating what to do next. [...] "I'll go upstairs," [...] he said suddenly; [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house. You needn't go with me; I know my way." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had dropped}} his head again, {{as if he}} did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|R
60|$|Bessie (Almost hysterical; laughs). Why, Captain Hagberd, {{perhaps your}} son won't even <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me--when he comes home.|$|R
60|$|She {{very much}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, {{but she would}} not. It seemed to her quite a time before he replied.|$|R
6000|$|... "What! That boy? Not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> only {{sensible}} {{girl for}} miles around? What {{do you think}} I am here for, my dear--my dear--my dear?... What? You wait. You just wait. You'll see to-morrow. I'll soon--" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was soon}} up. [...] "Now, {{do any of}} {{you want to go}} down?" [...] Dias and José shook their heads; and Bertie grumbled, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beastly hole; it has been trouble enough to get at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before I make my {{decision}} I {{want to see}} the papers on this, the theory and outline of construction. I'm not sure I like it.--For reasons of my own, I mean. But I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> material. If you'll do that--" ...|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT [stopping {{to examine}} the great stone]. Just a moment, Mr Doyle: I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this stone. It must be Finian's die-cast.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I suppose,' {{returned}} the lady, 'as nobody but yourself can <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a steam package, without <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> go a-boarding of it, can they! Booby!' ...|$|R
5000|$|... In this phase, infants {{begin to}} have a certain {{alertness}} about the outside world, and they're <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the world in a more enthusiastic way.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so. Anyhow, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cache. Stores are a {{consideration}} {{on a trip}} like this; the less you have to pack over the portages, the quicker you can travel. Though we didn't find it, Mappin knows where the cache was made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no sort {{of reason}} for our pushing through this crowd {{in a gang}} of three. Besides, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pictures, and not after you to see which way you go. I shall meet you here at six o'clock, sharp. Good-bye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, let us convert you instead," [...] Sybil declared. [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun, {{and we want}} to {{take you}} with us. You are really a very stupid person, you know. Why do you want to stay all alone amongst the shadows?" [...] Arranmore smiled faintly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{must have}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you,' {{proceeded}} Arthur, 'or {{she would never}} have treated us with such affability. But come along, here is Theodora's room.' ...|$|R
60|$|It now {{required}} deliberation on Venters's part {{to persist in}} his unconcern and to keep <b>at</b> work. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her, <b>to</b> volley questions at her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> no legs while I'm at dinner," [...] {{cried the}} skipper. [...] "O' course the dog'll bite you if you've been teasing him." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{must get}} this very clearly into our heads. Fig. 2, A, {{is a little}} tuft of a common wood moss of Norway,[10] in its fruit season, of its real size; but at present I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> central fibre and its leaves accurately, and {{understand}} that first.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the case}} of any other man, Benjulia would have seen that the one object of these prudent remarks was to irritate him. Misled by his {{profound}} conviction of his brother's stupidity, he now thought {{it possible that the}} concealed portions of the letter might be worth notice. He stopped Lemuel at the door. [...] "I've changed my mind," [...] he said; [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> letter again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My Romola," [...] said Tito, {{the second}} morning {{after he had}} made his speech in the Piazza del Duomo, [...] "I am to receive grand {{visitors}} to-day; the Milanese Count is coming again, and the Seneschal de Beaucaire, the great favourite of the Cristianissimo. I know you don't care to go through smiling ceremonies with these rustling magnates, whom we are not likely to see again; and as they will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> antiquities and the library, perhaps you had better give up your work to-day, and go to see your cousin Brigida." ...|$|E
6000|$|Satisfied so far, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the cipher next. She {{handed it}} to him with a stipulation: [...] "Yours, Jemmy, on the day when you marry me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He doesn't mind," [...] she replied. [...] "Let {{that stuff}} {{alone for a}} time. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you. You're fine, Dick, {{but what does it}} all mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> no legs while I’m at dinner," [...] {{cried the}} skipper. [...] "O’ course the dog ’ll bite you if you’ve been teasing him." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{yesterday}} {{ordered a}} 'Fors' {{to be sent}} you containing in its close the most important piece of a religious character in the book--this I hope you will also allow to stay on your shelves. The two that I sent with this note contain so much that is saucy that I only send them in case you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> challenge {{referred to in the}} Letters to the Bishop of Manchester, see October, 1877, pp. 322, 323, and January 1875, p. 11. You can keep as long as you like, but please take care of them, as my index is not yet done. The next letter will come before the week end, but it's a difficult one.|$|E
60|$|Jake put {{a kettle}} on the cylinder-top and took some {{provisions}} from a locker. He was hungry {{and thought he}} might need all the strength he had, while he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sea. The pump was clanking hard, but {{he could hear the}} water wash about under the floorings, and the launch was very wet. Darkness fell as he prepared a meal with the fireman's help, and they ate by the dim light of the engine-lamp, while Dick, to whom they handed portions, crouched at the helm, gazing close into the illuminated compass. Sometimes he missed the food they held out and it dropped and was washed into the pump-well, but he ate what he could without moving his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|He had to {{get those}} {{bicycles}}. Had he been told {{to go out and}} kill Bechamel he would have done it. His head was a maelstrom now. He walked out of the hotel, along the front, and into the big, black-shadowed coach yard. He looked round. There were no bicycles visible. Then a man emerged from the dark, a short man in a short, black, shiny jacket. Hoopdriver was caught. He made no attempt to turn and run for it. [...] "I've been giving your machines a wipe over, sir," [...] said the man, recognising the suit, and touching his cap. Hoopdriver's intelligence now was a soaring eagle; he swooped on the situation at once. [...] "That's right," [...] he said, and added, before the pause became marked, [...] "Where is mine? I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> chain." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rohmer said he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> [...] "thoughts {{rather than}} actions", dealing [...] "less with {{what people do}} than {{what is going on}} in their minds while they are doing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Among all {{the idle}} {{people who have}} come here, at one time or another, to see this house," [...] the woman said, [...] "only two have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the garden." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> picture-books, {{you know}} what books you may have to-day; and your mamma will get them for you when she comes in again," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Thorpe.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was very}} simple. For an infinitesimal {{fraction}} of a second, against the light of two flaring and guttering candles, through a blue, pungent, thin haze which made his eyes smart, he saw the man standing, as he had imagined him, {{with his back to}} the door, casting an enormous and distorted shadow upon the wall. Swifter than a flash of lightning followed the impression of his constrained, toppling attitude--the shoulders projecting forward, the head sunk low upon the breast. Then he distinguished the arms behind his back, and wrenched so terribly that the two clenched fists, lashed together, had been forced up higher than the shoulder-blades. From there his eyes traced in one instantaneous glance the hide rope going upwards from the tied wrists over a heavy beam and down to a staple in the wall. He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rigid legs, at the feet hanging down nervelessly, with their bare toes some six inches above the floor, to know that the man had been given the estrapade till he had swooned. His first impulse was to dash forward and sever the rope at one blow. He felt for his knife. He had no knife--not even a knife. He stood quivering, and the doctor, perched on the edge of the table, facing thoughtfully the cruel and lamentable sight, his chin in his hand, uttered, without stirring-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... “He’s nearly exhausted; {{not used}} to that sort of thing, you see. He sits in the stern-sheets with his eyes shut. Don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> white water boiling all around. The men drop into the boat one after another. Then he hears Captain Harry’s voice {{shouting}} in the wind to the coxswain, to hold on a moment, and some other words he can’t catch, and the coxswain yelling back: Don’t be long, sir. [...] . What is it? Cloete asks feeling faint. [...] . Something about the ship’s papers, says the coxswain, very anxious. It’s no time to be fooling about alongside, you understand. They haul the boat off a little and wait. The water flies over her in sheets. Cloete’s senses almost leave him. He thinks of nothing. He’s numb all over, till there’s a shout: Here he is! [...] . They see a figure in the fore-rigging waiting—they slack away on the grapnel-line and get him in the boat quite easy. There is a little shouting—it’s all mixed up with {{the noise of the}} sea. Cloete fancies that Stafford’s voice is talking away quite close to his ear. There’s a lull in the wind, and Stafford’s voice seems to be speaking very fast to the coxswain; he tells him that of course he was near his skipper, was all the time near him, till the old man said at the last moment that he must go and get the ship’s papers from aft; would insist on going himself; told him, Stafford, to get into the life-boat. [...] . He had meant to wait for his skipper, only there came this smooth of the seas, and he thought he would take his chance at once.|$|E
