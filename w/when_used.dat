30|$|Table 1 {{figures out}} the {{accuracy}} of LNBNN <b>when</b> <b>using</b> SIFT feature of spectrogram image higher than using MFCC. The highest different accuracy is in the TMW database.

5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects <b>when</b> <b>used</b> in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially <b>when</b> <b>used</b> during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E

We also study several MLP architectures, and we get better accuracies <b>when</b> <b>using</b> Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes.

Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion, <b>when</b> <b>used</b> for {{treating}} obesity {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in weight loss of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other medications, such as sibutramine or orlistat. It has been studied in combination with naltrexone. Concerns from bupropion include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. In September 2014, a combination (bupropion/naltrexone) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of obesity.|$|E

For evaluation, recordings of five different species were used, from which bird vocalization parts were chosen using a simple VAD system. The results imply an improvement of classification success almost by 10 % <b>when</b> <b>using</b> HFCCs and a hypercardioid microphone. <b>When</b> <b>using</b> HFCCs and a cardioid microphone, the improvement is by about 1 %. On average, the total success for classification of five different species is 85 % <b>when</b> <b>using</b> MFCCs and 90 % <b>when</b> <b>using</b> HFCCs.|$|R
