As a Gator swimmer, she won two individual NCAA national titles in the 100-yard freestyle and the 400-yard individual medley in 1985. With Gator teammates Laureeen <b>Welting,</b> Kathy Treible, Tracy Caulkins, Dara Torres and Paige Zemina, {{she was a member}} of the Gators' NCAA championship relay teams in the 400-yard and 800-yard freestyle relays for three consecutive years (1984, 1985, 1986), anchoring five of the six relays. In total, she won eight NCAA championships in those three years. She also won eleven individual Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships and was a member of ten SEC championship relay teams. Wayte was the SEC Swimmer of the Year in 1985, and received a total of twenty-six All-American honors in her four years as a collegiate swimmer.|$|E

2500|$|Stitches can {{be worked}} from either side, and various {{patterns}} are created by mixing regular knit stitches with the [...] "wrong side" [...] stitches, known as purl stitches, either in columns (ribbing), rows (garter, <b>welting),</b> or more complex patterns. [...] Each fabric has different properties: a garter stitch has much more vertical stretch, while ribbing stretches much more horizontally. [...] Because of their front-back symmetry, these two fabrics have little curl, making them popular as edging, even when their stretch properties are not desired.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{simplest}} of hand-knitted fabrics, every row of stitches are all knit (or all purl); this creates a garter stitch fabric. Alternating rows of all knit stitches and all purl stitches creates a stockinette pattern/stocking stitch. Vertical stripes (ribbing) are possible by having alternating wales of knit and purl stitches. [...] For example, a common choice is 2x2 ribbing, in which two wales of knit stitches are followed by two wales of purl stitches, etc. Horizontal striping (<b>welting)</b> is also possible, by alternating rows of knit and purl stitches. Checkerboard patterns (basketweave) are also possible, the smallest of which is known as seed/moss stitch: the stitches alternate between knit and purl in every wale and along every row.|$|E

6000|$|Our visitor had {{travelled}} in a dog cariole. This {{machine is}} very narrow, just broad enough to admit one person. It is a wooden frame covered with deer-skin parchment, painted gaudily, and is generally drawn by four Esquimaux dogs [see note 3]. Dogs are invaluable in the Arctic regions, where horses are utterly useless, {{owing to the}} depth of snow which covers the earth for so large {{a portion of the}} year. The comparatively light weight of the dogs enables them to walk without sinking much; and even when the snow is so soft as to be incapable of supporting them, they are still able to sprawl along more easily than any other species of quadruped could do. Four are usually attached to a sledge, which they haul with great vigour; being followed by a driver on snow-shoes, whose severe lash is brought to bear so powerfully {{on the backs of the}} poor animals, should any of them be observed to slacken their pace, that they are continually regarding him with deprecatory glances as they run along. Should the lash give a flourish, there is generally a short yelp from the pack; and should it descend amongst them with a vigorous crack, the vociferous yelling that results is perfectly terrific. These drivers are sometimes very cruel; and when a pack of dogs have had a fight, and got their traces hopelessly ravelled (as is often the case), they have been known to fall on their knees in their passion, seize one of the poor dogs by the nose with their teeth, and almost bite it off. Dogs are also used for dragging carioles, which vehicles are used by gentlemen in the Company's service who are either too old or too lazy to walk on snow-shoes. The cariole is in form not unlike a slipper bath, both in shape and size. It is lined with buffalo robes, in the midst of a bundle of which the occupant reclines luxuriously, while the dogs drag him slowly through the soft snow, and among the trees and bushes of the forest, or scamper with him over the hard-beaten surface of a lake or river; while the machine is prevented from capsizing by a voyageur who walks behind on snow-shoes, holding on to a line attached to the back part of the cariole. The weather during winter is so cold that it is often a matter of the greatest difficulty for the traveller to keep his toes from freezing, despite the buffalo robes; and sometimes, when the dogs start fresh in the morning, with a good breakfast, a bright, clear, frosty day, and a long expanse of comparatively open country before them, where the snow from exposure has become quite hard, away they go with a loud yelp, upsetting the driver in the bolt, who rises to heap undeserved and very improper epithets upon the poor brutes, who, careering over the ground at the rate of eleven miles an hour, swing the miserable cariole over the snow, tear it through the bushes, bang it first on one side, then on the other, against stumps and trees, yelling all the while, partly with frantic glee at the thought of having bolted, and partly with fearful anticipation of the tremendous <b>welting</b> that is to come; until at last the cariole gets jammed hard and fast among the trees of the forest, or plunges down the steep bank of a river head over heels till they reach the foot--a horrible and struggling compound of dogs, traveller, traces, parchment, buffalo robes, blankets, and snow! ...|$|E

5000|$|Die Neue <b>Welt</b> was revived as a daily {{newspaper}} by {{a section of}} Alsatian communists in early July 1929. The revived newspaper carried the byline [...] "Deutschsprachigen Tagesorgan der Kommunistischen Partei Frankreichs.

As Die Neue <b>Welt</b> effectively competed with the established party paper l'Humanité d'Alsace-Lorraine, the launch of Die Neue <b>Welt</b> became a cause of expulsions from the Communist Party. Amongst those expelled was Georges Schreckler, the editor of Die Neue <b>Welt.</b> Die Neue <b>Welt</b> became the organ of the Opposition Communist Party of Alsace-Lorraine (KPO).

50|$|Similar to ribbing, a <b>welting</b> pattern can be {{specified}} {{by the number of}} knit rows followed by the number of purl rows, e.g., 1x1 <b>welting</b> is garter stitch.

50|$|Garter stitch, {{also known}} as the knit stitch, is the most basic form of <b>welting</b> (as seen from the right side).

50|$|Other {{variations}} of basketweave change the stitch patterns that compose the rectangles.
