40|$|We {{provide a}} {{rationale}} for window dressing where investors respond to conflicting signals of managerial ability inferred from a fund's performance and disclosed portfolio holdings. We contend that <b>window</b> <b>dressers</b> take a risky bet on their performance during a reporting delay period, which affects investors' interpretation of the conflicting signals and hence their capital allocations. Conditional on good (bad) performance, <b>window</b> <b>dressers</b> benefit from higher (lower) investor flows as compared to non-window <b>dressers.</b> <b>Window</b> <b>dressers</b> also have poor past performance, possess little skill, and incur high portfolio turnover and trade costs, characteristics which in turn result in worse future performance...|$|R

500|$|In {{an early}} {{draft of the}} script, the {{skeleton}} was made of pastry dough baked by the mall's <b>window</b> <b>dresser.</b> Cohen had initially written the Stephen Jay Gould role as a generic scientist or paleontologist, not knowing that they would eventually get Gould. He had taken Gould's Introduction to Paleontology class at Harvard University. The only phrase Gould had objected to in the script was a line that introduced him as the [...] "world's most brilliant paleontologist". His original final line was [...] "I didn't do the test. I had more important work to do.", but it was cut because the writers felt it would be funnier {{to give him a}} short final line. In an earlier version of the episode, Marge would have ended up apologizing to Lisa for not supporting her, letting the ending be more of a nod to Lisa's correct assumptions all along.|$|E

40|$|Down {{the highway}} and off the {{interchange}} is the local shopping mall where suburbia celebrates the “consumer republic ” (Cohen 2004). Shopping these days isn’t the same as when mom went downtown to buy [a] dress or hat, but no matter if it’s in an urban business district or at the mega-mall, an invisible crew of <b>window</b> <b>dressers</b> and fashion mavens “pull it all together” … “especially for you”. Shopping malls and other retail environments are complex social spaces, a product of conflicting agendas and meanings. Workers such as <b>window</b> <b>dressers,</b> known as visual merchandisers in the trade, negotiate between these conflicting agendas and levels of discourse to create compelling images and merchandise presentations, even as corporate branding strategies limit creative control and deskill the craft. Fashion has always been about newness and change, a competitive marketplace encourages the adoption of new technologies, retail being no exception. The suburban mall is another permutation on the pattern of displacement of utopian dreams onto the personalized world of consumption.

40|$|Window {{dressing}} ” is {{the practice}} by fund managers of adjusting a fund’s portfolio composition immediately before disclosing the holdings {{to the public}} {{at the end of the}} quarter. The common wisdom on the street and in the financial press is that window dressing activity has become widespread as investors have become increasingly sophisticated in analyzing fund holdings as well as pastreturnsinaneffort to detect skill. So far there has been little empirical evidence on mutual funds in the academic literature to this effect. We analyze the semi-annual holdings and daily net asset values of 4, 025 U. S. domestic equity mutual funds over the period from 1997 to 2002 and find strong evidence of window dressing. In particular, a substantial fraction of funds report holdings that are very misleading due to window dressing activity. We show that growth funds and funds with poor recent performance are more likely to be <b>window</b> <b>dressers.</b> Furthermore, the <b>window</b> dressing activity is not associated with trading strategies that on average provide any added value to investors even before accounting for expenses. We find that neither liquidity costs nor momentum trading can explain these findings. ...|$|R
40|$|Between 1880 and 1920 {{displays}} in leading department stores reached an unprecedented level of artistic and commercial ambition that required professional skill, engaged with technology, earned consumer attention, and provided distinction between stores. Merchandise arrangements conveyed technical proficiency and innovation {{specific to the}} retail setting while their form and content were also in conversation with current events, art, urban life, and popular culture. This thesis explores the making, viewing, and meanings of display. Discussion will be framed around the following questions: What role did display design play {{in the development of}} department stores in Chicago, New York and London {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century and how can the impact and significance of display be identified in the stores’ material and visual cultures? Drawing from a diverse range of unexplored primary resources and archives, this thesis reveals a set of previously underrepresented design roles, tools, and techniques of display production in the practice of architects, <b>window</b> <b>dressers,</b> shopfitters, and interior decorators who employed manual and mechanical methods to create displays that were on constant view and in continual flux. In this newly changeable retail environment, display’s alignment with fin-de-siècle modernity is explored through the themes of speed, variation, fragmentation, rationalization, and theatricality. Overall this thesis analyzes how display achieved an agency to transform everyday objects into commodities and to make consumers out of passersby...|$|R
5000|$|Economists {{typically}} use {{the term}} consumption {{in a way that}} is far broader than merely purchasing something. It is quite common to talk about the consumption of time. Many of the items on this list can still be considered either production or consumption, or to involve production or consumption at some stage to be accomplished. For example, cooking a meal is production of food for someone's consumption, and it involves consuming (cooking) raw materials previously purchased or gathered; and, writing is production of material for someone to consume through reading. Both of these activities are often done for some return in value, whether it is for respect or monetary payment. In a similar way, some of these items are replacements for consumption [...] - [...] for example, rather than purchase a meal, you can cook the meal yourself. In cooking the meal, you have now in effect paid for the meal with your own labor rather than earning wages and paying for a meal with those wages. In this way, economists, and in general anyone, could view this list as containing nothing that is not consumption or production, other than possibly turning around in a circle, though this involves consuming calories that would, at some point, have been consumed. For example, even window shoppers are consuming [...] - [...] the product is marketers’ production (specifically in this case, the <b>window</b> <b>dresser's</b> creation). Possibly, only in death are we neither consuming nor producing, but merely being consumed, though it could be argued that one's body is consuming space, particularly in a cemetery plot (real estate), but even if cremated and scattered. Gary Becker's household production functions and similar topics note that people often purchase goods and then combine them with time to produce something that has meaning or practicality to them (which produce utility).|$|R
