40|$|Although peer {{reviewing}} of <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> {{to create more}} writing opportunities in college and university settings, the validity and reliability of peer-generated grades are a major concern. This study investigated the validity and reliability of peer-generated writing grades of 708 students across 16 different courses from 4 universities in a particular scaffolded reviewing context: Students were given guidance on peer assessment, used carefully constructed rubrics, and were provided clear incentives to take the assessment task seriously. Distinguishing between instructor and student perspectives of reliability and validity, the analyses suggest that the aggregate ratings of at least 4 peers {{on a piece of}} writing are both highly reliable and as valid as instructor ratings while (paradoxically) producing very low estimates of reliability and validity from the student perspective. The results suggest that instructor concerns about peer evaluation reliability and validity should not be a barrier to implementing peer evaluations, at least with appropriate scaffolds. Future research needs to investigate how to address student concerns about reliability and validity and to identify scaffolds that may ensure high levels of reliability and validity.

The work is a history written in {{dialogue}} form whose content is basically a product of orality, the speechs delivered by the most famous roman orators. Cicero, writer of this history, is a speechmaker (orator) as much as a speechwriter who proclaims itself as the pinnacle of the genre thanks to his mastery of writing. Cicero uses the written texts of the orators as the source and also as the support for his critical judgment. From his point of view, <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of development and learning for the orator and one important instrument of inuentio; also, {{as a result of a}} continuous practice, writing (and publishing) transforms himself in Cicero hands in a method to extend his auctoritas beyond the circumstances in which the original speech was delivered.

The study also explored the role of individual differences {{in an effort to}} identify features of the writing process that may influence what students learn through writing. The experiment used think-aloud protocols and comprehension testing in a mixed experimental design. Forty college freshmen each performed a writing task and a study task, in each case working with a 1, 200 -word reading passage which served as the to-be-learned material. The writing task led to lower scores than the study task on two of four comprehension measures. Writing and studying processes were analyzed along seven dimensions via the protocol transcripts. Stepwise regression analyses revealed several significant relationships between process features and comprehension. Results suggest that process features such as planning and audience awareness are important variables in the relationship between writing and learning.

40|$|While {{people can}} {{negotiate}} how identities are constructed through {{writing in a}} variety of contexts (see 3. 1, 2 ̆ 2 Writing Is Linked to Identity 2 ̆ 2), many first encounter unfamiliar disciplinary (or professional) discourse in college. In most American colleges and universities in the United States, students complete-general education courses (introductory courses designed to introduce students to both ways of thinking and disciplinary perspectives within the university) before continuing on to specialized courses within their chosen disciplines or fields. This increasingly discipline-specific learning process involves both the simple acquisition of new knowledge and an 2 ̆ 2 expansion and transformation of identity, of a learner 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 sense of self 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 (Meyer and Land 2006, 11). Writing—as a means of thinking, a form of inquiry and research, and a means for communication within a discipline—plays a critical role in that identity transformation and expansion. Disciplines have particular ways of asking and investigating questions enacted through and demonstrated in writing; teachers or researchers demonstrate their memberships in disciplines by using writing in ways validated by disciplines. It is thus through writing that disciplines (and writers [see 2. 3, 2 ̆ 2 <b>Writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Way</b> of Enacting Disciplinarity 2 ̆ 2]) are both enacted and encountered by writers—first as students, and then as professionals throughout their careers...|$|E

This process is often flexible and develops over time.

Often, students do not {{get the chance to}} do so. During my student teaching placement, I analyzed data collected from a second grade classroom after I introduced different writing techniques such as journaling, digital story telling, and note taking.

I also looked for improvement of spelling and grammatical errors throughout their writing pieces.

40|$|Inherent in ‘practice-led research’ is the {{dialectic}} between practice and research. For some time, this dialectic has been problematised in varying ways and {{to varying degrees}} across the creative arts in terms that are reminiscent of Deleuze’s ‘disjunctive synthesis’ (Deleuze and Guattari 2004 : 14). Further, creative writing has mostly theorised its practice and research according to models offered by the visual arts, thereby ignoring its own ‘domain specificity’ (Baer 2012). This paper, however, posits that creative <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of apprehending, knowing and being in the world; and more specifically it functions simultaneously as a perspective, an epistemology and an ontology specific to writing. It argues that our conceptual tools {{need to be made}} over in order to fit creative practice in writing: rather than being in thrall to the regime of images, these tools should enable us to deal specifically with writing in relation to the experiential and to subjectivity – that is, from the inside out. Reading Kristeva’s central argument in Revolution in poetic language (1974) against the grain, I reassess the relevance of the term ‘practice-led research’ for creative writing, asking how the poetic text can challenge the dominant paradigm and how it can be considered as research. More pointedly, building on Kristeva’s theorisation of the semiotic chora and on Lakoff’s work on metaphor, I ask what the epistemological thrust of creative writing might be, particularly if it is non-mimetic or experimental and hence destabilises polysemy and the syntactic function. I do so by questioning the role of sign, image and metaphor in the process of knowledge production from within an experiential practice which mobilises the unconscious, perception, pre-language and language. In such light, creative writing is a form of research in its own right which triangulates two seemingly mutually exclusive discourses encompassing (tacit) knowing and (explicit) knowledge...|$|E

Their very essence goes against much of what recent pedagogy says about teaching research and writing.

Multigenre <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to learn the necessary research skills developed in traditional methods and demonstrate {{a deeper understanding of}} multiple genres. By allowing the students to present their findings through both traditional and alternative forms of expression, multigenre essays challenge students to keep up instead of punishing them with monotonous methods. Students have a choice in what to research instead of being spoon-fed a dry topic. The motivation to work and the desire to finish comes from a passion for the subject that goes way beyond the traditional avenue of just getting it over with. In the secondary classroom we teach individuals and there must be multiple ways for writers to develop their skills. By giving students freedom in topic choice and assessment scales, we increase their investment in education. We should work with our class to shape the curriculum instead of imposing it upon the students. A multigenre unit opens itself up to this kind of teaching through its focus on the individual learner. During conferences, teachers meet one on one with students to address their needs, develop their writing, and guide the research. The workshop environment, one of sharing and support, will take students to the next level in their education, beyond the heights of a traditional essay. Teachers should embrace this research format for the betterment of their practice and their students' futures.

40|$|Venice Biennial, 2010 Hungarian Pavilion Sketching {{helps me}} to {{understand}} and navigate between the different scales. For example, when sketching the city I try to redefine the systems of the existing historical structures. Sketching {{is also a good}} way to define a place without a form. I consider architecture as a mixture of drawing, thinking and writing. In my work I write a lot about architecture. In one of my jobs the first step was to explore how to define the project literally, with words and emotions, as Aldo Rossi used to do. He was as much interested in writing as in building. After I’ve completed this phase I try to think about the building. I used to start planning by doing a lot of sketches first. Now it’s slightly different. We first prepare the program, then we write and explore the conditions around us {{in order to understand the}} client. After this we try to realize the organigram of the functions, making a scheme of the dimensions and connections. Then we start doing sketches of the volume, designing it on a computer and preparing other sketches to correct the computer drawings, all this to better understand what we are doing. The final stage is computer detailing. Designing by hand is much “warmer”, it has a more human touch compared to designing by autocad. I don’t know what other people think of sketching and drawing. I think it’s important but maybe it’s because of the generation I belong to. My students don’t use it. I don’t think that the quality of a sketch should be important since what's important is the idea in the hand, and you have to be able to express certain architectural thoughts with your hands. Nobody uses sketch paper, pens, or pencils from the younger generation. They just use primitive prints of cad drawings so they fail to gain an understanding of the scale, nor of the meaning of a line. They use the same computer elements for every drawing, and that destroys the idea of architecture. I think we should put some thought in a project before doing anything. Sketching or <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of thinking and understanding. Sketching, renderings and making models as simultaneously used techniques help you to understand proportions. Using just renderings can lead to a lot of mistakes. To sketch something well is to think about what is beyond building – not just in the sense of Aaron Betsky – but about what happened before the project was conceived. You need to consider what the connection is between your thoughts and your hand… Sketching answers the question of what exactly you want to do on an empty white sheet of paper...|$|E
