5|$|Calhoun was not openly religious. He {{was raised}} Calvinist but was {{attracted}} to Southern varieties of Unitarianism {{of the sort that}} attracted Jefferson. Southern Unitarianism was generally less organized than the variety popular in New England. He <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> outspoken about his religious beliefs. After his marriage, Calhoun and his wife attended the Episcopal Church, of which she was a member. In 1821 he became a founding member of All Souls Unitarian Church in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July, {{the day of}} the ceremony, pilgrims {{spent the}} morning and early {{afternoon}} exploring the landscape of the memorial park before congregating at the monument. For the ceremony, sailors from HMCS Saguenay provided the guard of honour. Also present were The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Band, French army engineers, and French-Moroccan cavalry who had fought on the site during the Second Battle of Artois. The ceremony itself was broadcast live by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission over shortwave radio, with facilities of the British Broadcasting Corporation transmitting the ceremony to Canada. Senior Canadian, British, and European officials, including French President Albert Lebrun, and a crowd of over 50,000 attended the event. Absent, though, was Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, it being well understood that he <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> comfortable around veterans and felt it more appropriate for a war veteran in Cabinet to act as minister in attendance.|$|E

25|$|Before the Second Avenue Subway {{opened in}} 2017, the BMT line <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> used for {{passenger}} service, except for detours due to emergencies or construction on other lines (including the aforementioned periods in 1995 and 1998). Because {{the line was}} not used in regular service from 1989 to 2016, it was not shown on the official subway map, except in 1995 and 1998. Prior to 2011, these tracks were often used to store trainsets outside of rush hour.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of armed resistance to white settlement <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> acknowledged by historians until the 1970s. In 1968 anthropologist W.E.H. Stanner wrote that historians' failure to include Indigenous Australians in histories of Australia or acknowledge widespread frontier conflict constituted a 'great Australian silence'. Works which discussed the conflicts {{began to appear}} during the 1970s and 1980s, and the first history of the Australian frontier told from an Indigenous perspective, Henry Reynolds' The Other Side of the Frontier, was published in 1982.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the siege, the {{garrison}} of the fort numbered about 430 officers and men, commanded by Colonel Moses J. White. Sickness reduced this number by about a third. Despite the poor diet and other living conditions that they suffered, only one man died. Morale among the men <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> good, as they were cut off from their families, and White was unpopular, both with his men and with the people of Beaufort. A few men deserted during the siege.|$|E

25|$|The Texas Revolution (1836) <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> {{felt in the}} region, as the American {{population}} was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas {{as part of the}} treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the village which consisted of El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} hundred years, the Church {{pushed for the}} {{persecution}} of the Jews while the rulers of Poland usually protected them. The Councils of Wrocław (1267), Buda (1279), and Łęczyca (1285) each segregated Jews, ordered them to wear a special emblem, banned them from holding offices where Christians would be subordinated to them, and forbade them from building more than one prayer house in each town. However, those church decrees required {{the cooperation of the}} Polish princes for enforcement, which <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> forthcoming, due to the profits which the Jews' economic activity yielded to the princes.|$|E
25|$|His chief {{stewardship}} of the Duchy of Lancaster was not renewed by Henry V, and his relationship with Henry V <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> as close {{as it had been}} with Henry IV, although he was sent on embassies to France in 1414 and 1416, and was given custody of the young Richard, 3rd Duke of York, from 1415 to 1423. From June 1417 an important French prisoner, Charles, Duke of Orléans, was in his charge at Pontefract; Henry V viewed with suspicion the friendship which developed between Waterton and the Duke, and had the latter moved to Windsor Castle.|$|E

25|$|The Brazilian economy <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> {{affected}} by the mensalão scandal, which related to vote buying in the Brazilian Congress. In early 2006, however, Palocci had to resign as finance minister due to his involvement in an abuse of power scandal. Lula then appointed Guido Mantega, {{a member of the}} PT and an economist by profession, as finance minister. Mantega, a former Marxist who had written a PhD thesis (in Sociology) on the history of economic ideas in Brazil from a left-wing viewpoint, was known for his criticism of high interest rates, something he claimed satisfied banking interests. Mantega was also supportive of a higher level of employment by the state.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of 2007, {{producer}} Frank Eakin wrote and produced a film entitled The Bracelet of Bordeaux, which became the first film to be shot completely in The Woodlands. The cast and crew were largely composed of local residents, and the film itself {{was part of a}} larger effort on Eakin's part to generate interest in using The Woodlands and Houston as shooting locations for major motion pictures. Following its completion, the film was heavily promoted in the local press and at area businesses, leading to its world premier at The Woodlands High School. The film <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> well received, and no further attempts have been made to bring the film industry to The Woodlands.|$|E
25|$|In Vianu's view, Momente şi schiţe {{was more}} vague in this respect, giving little insight into morals and states of mind, whereas the other, longer, novellas did depict {{feelings}} and occasionally provided additional {{details such as}} physiology or cenesthesia. Also according to Vianu, Ion Luca Caragiale, unlike the Naturalists, <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> interested in offering the reader access to his characters' psychological background—aside from his Năpasta and Păcat, and O făclie de Paşte, he only adopted the psychological technique in satirical contexts, {{as a means to}} parody its use. A similar view was expressed by Vianu's predecessor, Silvian Iosifescu, who also stressed that Caragiale always avoided applying the Naturalist technique to its fullest, while George Călinescu himself believed that the characters' motivations in O făclie de Paşte are actually physiological and ethnological.|$|E

25|$|Finland's {{climate and}} soils make growing crops a {{particular}} challenge. The country lies between 60° and 70° north latitude - {{as far north}} as Alaska - and has severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frosts. However, because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current moderate the climate, and because of the relatively low elevation of the land area, Finland contains half of the world's arable land north of 60° north latitude. In response to the climate, farmers have relied on quick-ripening and frost-resistant varieties of crops. Most farmland had originally been either forest or swamp, and the soil had usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralise excess acid and to develop fertility. Irrigation <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> necessary, but drainage systems were often needed to remove excess water.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} scales (squamae) {{were either}} iron or bronze, or even alternating metals {{on the same}} shirt. They could be tinned as well, one surviving fragment showing bronze scales that were alternately tinned and plain. The metal <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> very thick, 0.5mm to 0.8mm (0.02 to 0.032 in) perhaps being a common range. Since the scales overlapped in every direction, however, the multiple layers gave good protection. The size ranged from as small as 6mm (0.25in) wide by 1.2cm tall up to about 5cm (2in) wide by 8cm (3in) tall, with the most common sizes being roughly 1.25 by 2.5cm (0.5 by 1 in). Many had rounded bottoms, while others were pointed or had flat bottoms with the corners clipped off at an angle. The scales could be flat, slightly domed, or have a raised midrib or edge. All the scales in a shirt were generally of the same size; however, scales from different shirts varied significantly.|$|E
25|$|ESC {{is built}} {{on top of an}} {{anti-lock}} brake system, and all ESC-equipped vehicles are fitted with traction control. The ESC components include a yaw rate sensor, a lateral acceleration sensor, a steering wheel sensor, and an upgraded integrated control unit. In the US, Federal regulations require that ESC be installed as a standard feature on all passenger cars and light trucks as of the 2012 model year. According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration research, ABS in 2005 cost an estimated US$368; ESC cost a further US$111. The retail price of ESC varies; as a stand-alone option it retails for as little as $250 USD. ESC was once rarely offered as a sole option, and <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> available for aftermarket installation. Instead, it was frequently bundled with other features or more expensive trims, so the cost of a package that included ESC was several thousand dollars. Nonetheless, ESC is considered highly cost-effective and it might pay for itself in reduced insurance premiums.|$|E
