5|$|He {{finds the}} mixture of bird species {{intermediate}} between those of Java and Australia, with 36 species actually Javan, and 11 closely related; while there are only 13 actually Australian, with 35 closely related. Wallace interprets this to mean that {{a small number of}} birds from Australia, and a larger number from Java, colonised Timor and then evolved into new species endemic to the island. The land mammals were very few in number: the six species were endemic or related to those of Java or the Moluccas, with none from Australia, so he doubts there <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> land bridge to that continent.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1971, the Drain {{had been}} navigable, but this {{privilege}} was removed at that time. It {{is unclear whether}} there <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> right of navigation, or whether the Black Sluice Commissioners simply allowed it. The entrance lock was , and most trade was between Boston and Donnington Bridge, with pleasure boating not being allowed prior to 1962. The lock was closed and removed in 1971, with little protest being made. More recently, the East Anglian Waterways Association promoted {{the idea that the}} Drain could again be made navigable {{as part of a larger}} scheme to improve leisure facilities. The local authorities which were part of the Fens Tourism consortium conducted a feasibility study, and this report was formally adopted as the Fens Waterways Link by the Environment Agency in 2004, with the support of the local authorities, the East Anglian Waterways Association and the Inland Waterways Association.|$|E

5|$|Buczynski's {{continuing}} {{disagreements with}} {{senior members of}} the CES led him to resign from the priesthood on August 1, 1975. The New York Temple that he had led subsequently folded. Returning his interest to Wicca, he befriended a Gardnerian high priestess named Sheila Saperton, who had been initiated into the Craft years before by Raymond Buckland. Saperton had become increasingly interested in Buckland's newly developed tradition of Seax-Wica, and founded a Seax coven from her home in Huntington Station on Long Island. Although never initiated into Seax-Wica, Buczynksi associated with the group, and attended many of their rites. Eventually however, the group tired of the practices of Seax-Wica, and instead transformed into a Gardnerian coven, with Buczynski becoming high priest. Claiming that a mysterious witch known only as Jana, who had been involved in the New Forest coven back in Hampshire, England, had been communicating with him and providing him with a legitimate lineage, he began making further changes to the coven structure. Both Buczynski biographer Michael Lloyd and researcher Philip Heselton have expressed doubt that Jana <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> real figure operating in England, instead suggesting that she was perhaps an invention of Buczynski's to legitimize his practice of Gardnerian Wica.|$|E

25|$|Both Krafft-Ebing and Freud {{assumed that}} sadism in men {{resulted}} from the distortion of the aggressive component of the male sexual instinct. Masochism in men, however, {{was seen as a}} more significant aberration, contrary to the nature of male sexuality. Freud doubted that masochism in men <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> primary tendency, and speculated that it may exist only as a transformation of sadism. Sadomasochism in women received comparatively little discussion, as it was believed that it occurred primarily in men. Both also assumed that masochism was so inherent to female sexuality that {{it would be difficult to}} distinguish as a separate inclination.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{uncertainties}} {{in the text}} comes in the word , which indicates that the seaweed has a hold on the castaway. Some scholars prefer to read , indicating that he spews out seaweed. Scholars often contrast the poem's realism with the artificiality of Horace's Epode 10, but not all scholars {{are willing to go}} along with this view, citing the Homeric diction as a literary device and the absence of proof that the oath-breaker <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> real man rather than just a scapegoat or imaginary exemplar. Yet the poet has made the context seem real.|$|E
25|$|Some writers {{claim the}} Air Staff ignored a {{critical}} lesson, that British morale {{did not break}} and that attacking German morale was not sufficient to induce a collapse. Aviation strategists dispute that morale <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> major consideration for Bomber Command. Throughout 1933–39 none of the 16 Western Air Plans drafted mentioned morale as a target. The first three directives in 1940 did not mention civilian populations or morale in any way. Morale was not mentioned until the ninth wartime directive on 21 September 1940. The 10th directive in October 1940 mentioned morale by name but industrial cities were only to be targeted if weather prevented raids on oil targets.|$|E

25|$|He {{presented}} {{himself as a}} patrician, as the last Edwardian, as a Whig (in the tradition of his wife's family), as a romantic Tory, as intellectual, as a man shaped by the comradeship of the trenches and by the slump of the 1930s, as a shrewd man of business of bourgeois Scottish stock, and as a venerable elder statesman at home with modern youth. There was something in all these views, which he did little to discourage, and which commanded public respect into the early 1960s. Whether he <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> mainstream Conservative, rather than a skillful exponent of the postwar consensus, is more doubtful.|$|E
25|$|If there <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> sign {{of health}} of the ABA (and BMX in general) it was the 1988 Grand National in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It was then the largest BMX race in history at 470 motos. This was by 27 motos larger than the {{previous}} record holder, the 1982 ABA Grand National (the 1989 ABA Grand National would be 467 motos, knocking '82 back to third). This was {{in the teeth of}} a general two year sag in ridership on the racing side of the industry and {{in the face of the}} popularity of BMX Freestyle, skateboarding and the rise of Mountain Biking.|$|E
25|$|There is {{universal}} agreement that some Mesoamerican people practiced human sacrifice, {{but there is}} a lack of scholarly consensus as to whether cannibalism in pre-Columbian America was widespread. At one extreme, anthropologist Marvin Harris, author of Cannibals and Kings, has suggested that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward, since the Aztec diet was lacking in proteins. While most historians of the pre-Columbian era believe that there was ritual cannibalism related to human sacrifices, they do not support Harris's thesis that human flesh <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> significant portion of the Aztec diet. Others have hypothesized that cannibalism was part of a blood revenge in war.|$|E

25|$|This has led C.R. Whittaker {{to doubt}} that Tacfarinas' revolt <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> serious threat to Roman rule in Africa, {{suggesting}} that Tacitus may have exaggerated the war's importance for dramatic effect. In favour of this view is the inability of Tacfarinas' forces to take Roman fortified positions or {{to stand up to}} Roman armies in pitched battle. Against it are Tacfarinas' establishment of a Roman-style force, the despatch of an extra legion to the war zone and the award of triumphal honours to no less than 3 Roman proconsuls for successes in the war (implying, in each case, the killing of at least 5,000 insurgents), all events indicating more than just low-level guerrilla warfare.|$|E

25|$|Tennessee was {{admitted}} to the Union on June 1, 1796 as the 16th state. It was the first state created from territory {{under the jurisdiction of the}} United States federal government. Apart from the former Thirteen Colonies only Vermont and Kentucky predate Tennessee's statehood, and neither <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> federal territory. The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, Article I, Section 31, states that the beginning point for identifying the boundary is the extreme height of the Stone Mountain, at the place where the line of Virginia intersects it, and basically runs the extreme heights of mountain chains through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee past the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota, thence along the main ridge of the said mountain (Unicoi Mountain) to the southern boundary of the state; all the territory, lands and waters lying west of said line are included in the boundaries and limits of the newly formed state of Tennessee. Part of the provision also stated that the limits and jurisdiction of the state would include future land acquisition, referencing possible land trade with other states, or the acquisition of territory from west of the Mississippi River.|$|E
