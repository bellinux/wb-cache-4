25|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, Babur arrived from Fergana and {{captured}} Kabul from the Arghun dynasty. In 1526, he invaded Delhi in India {{to replace the}} Lodi dynasty <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mughal</b> <b>Empire.</b> Between the 16th and 18th century, the Khanate of Bukhara, Safavids, and Mughals ruled parts of the territory. Before the 19th century, the northwestern area of Afghanistan was referred to by the regional name Khorasan. Two of the four capitals of Khorasan (Herat and Balkh) are now located in Afghanistan, while the regions of Kandahar, Zabulistan, Ghazni, Kabulistan, and Afghanistan formed the frontier between Khorasan and Hindustan.|$|E
25|$|Until 1657, Shivaji {{maintained}} peaceful relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mughal</b> <b>Empire.</b> Shivaji {{offered his}} assistance to Aurangzeb in conquering Bijapur and in return, he was assured {{of the formal}} recognition of his right to the Bijapuri forts and villages under his possession. Shivaji's confrontations with the Mughals began in March 1657, when two of Shivaji's officers raided the Mughal territory near Ahmednagar. This was followed by raids in Junnar, with Shivaji carrying off 300,000 hun in cash and 200 horses. Mughal viceroy for Deccan at that time, Aurangzeb responded to the raids by sending Nasiri Khan, who defeated the forces of Shivaji at Ahmednagar. However, Aurangzeb's countermeasures against Shivaji were interrupted by the rainy season and his battle of succession with his brothers for the Mughal throne following the illness of the emperor Shah Jahan.|$|E

25|$|After Chilarai's death, his son Raghudev became {{governor}} of this portion. Since Nara Narayan {{did not have}} a son, Raghudev was seen as the heir apparent. However, a late child of Nara Narayan removed Raghudev's claim to the throne. To placate him, Nara Narayan had to anoint Raghudev as a vassal chief of the portion of the kingdom east of the Sankosh river. This area {{came to be known as}} Koch Hajo. After the death of Nara Narayan in 1584, Raghudev declared independence. The kingdom ruled by the son of Nara Narayan, Lakshmi Narayan, came to be known as Cooch Behar. The division of the Kamata Kingdom into Koch Behar and Koch Hajo was permanent. Koch Behar aligned itself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mughal</b> <b>Empire</b> and finally joined the India as a part of the West Bengal, whereas remnants of the Koch Hajo rulers aligned themselves with the Ahom kingdom and the region became a part of Assam.|$|E
25|$|Historian Richard Eaton has {{tabulated}} {{a campaign}} of destruction of idols and temples by Delhi Sultans, intermixed with instances of years where the temples were protected from desecration. In his paper, he has listed 37 instances of Hindu temples being desecrated or destroyed in India during the Delhi Sultanate, from 1234 to 1518, for which reasonable evidences are available. He also noted there were also many instances of Delhi sultans, who often had Hindu ministers, ordering the protection, maintenance and repairing of temples, according to both Muslim and Hindu sources. For example, a Sanskrit inscription notes that Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq repaired a Siva temple in Bidar after his Deccan conquest. There was often a pattern of Delhi sultans plundering or damaging temples during conquest, and then patronizing or repairing temples after conquest. This pattern {{came to an end}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mughal</b> <b>Empire,</b> where Akbar the Great's chief minister Abu'l-Fazl criticized the excesses of earlier sultans such as Mahmud of Ghazni.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, {{from around}} 1704, when the kingdom {{passed on to}} [...] "Muteking" [...] (Mukarasu) Kanthirava Narasaraja II, the {{survival}} and expansion of the kingdom was achieved by playing a delicate game of alliance, negotiation, subordination on occasion, and annexation of territory in all directions. According to historians Sanjay Subrahmanyam and Sethu Madhava Rao, Mysore was now formally {{a tributary of the}} Mughal empire. Mughul records claim a regular tribute (peshkash) was paid by Mysore. However, historian Suryanath U. Kamath feels the Mughals may have considered Mysore an ally, a situation brought about by Mughal–Maratha competition for supremacy in southern India. By the 1720s, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mughal</b> <b>empire</b> in decline, further complications arose with the Mughal residents at both Arcot and Sira claiming tribute. The years that followed saw Krishnaraja Wodeyar I tread cautiously on the matter while keeping the Kodagu chiefs and the Marathas at bay. He was followed by Chamaraja Wodeyar VII during whose reign power fell into the hands of prime minister (Dalwai or Dalavoy) Nanjarajiah (or Nanjaraja) and chief minister (Sarvadhikari) Devarajiah (or Devaraja), the influential brothers from Kalale town near Nanjangud who would rule for the next three decades with the Wodeyars relegated to being the titular heads. The latter part of the rule of Krishnaraja II saw the Deccan Sultanates being eclipsed by the Mughals and in the confusion that ensued, Haider Ali, a captain in the army, rose to prominence. His victory against the Marathas at Bangalore in 1758, resulting in the annexation of their territory, made him an iconic figure. In honour of his achievements, the king gave him the title [...] "Nawab Haider Ali Khan Bahadur".|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that there have been {{relatively}} fewer conflicts between Muslims and Christians in India in comparison to those between Muslims and Hindus, or Muslims and Sikhs, the relationship between Muslims and Christians have also been occasionally turbulent. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> advent of European colonialism in India <b>with</b> <b>the</b> demise of <b>Mughal</b> <b>empire</b> beginning from 18th century, Christians were persecuted in some Muslim ruled princely states in India.|$|R
50|$|Although, Guru Har Rai {{was a man}} of peace, {{he never}} disbanded the armed Sikh Warriors (Saint Soldiers), who earlier were {{maintained}} by his grandfather, Guru Hargobind. He always boosted the military spirit of the Sikhs, but he never himself indulged in any direct political and armed controversy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> contemporary <b>Mughal</b> <b>Empire.</b> Once, Dara Shikoh (the eldest son of emperor Shah Jahan), came to Guru Har Rai asking for help in the war of succession <b>with</b> his brother, <b>the</b> murderous Aurangzeb. The Guru had promised his grandfather to use the Sikh Cavalry only in defense. Nevertheless, he helped him to escape safely from the bloody hands of Aurangzeb's armed forces by having his Sikh warriors hide all the ferry boats at the river crossing used by Dara Shikoh in his escape.|$|R
2500|$|Jahangir {{attempted}} to assert {{authority over the}} Sikhs by imprisoning Guru Har Gobind at Gwalior. He felt compelled to release him {{when he began to}} suffer premonitions of an early and gruesome death. The Guru refused to be released unless the dozens of Hindu princes imprisoned with him were also granted freedom, to which Jahangir agreed. Sikhism did not have any further issues <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mughal</b> <b>Empire</b> until the death of Jahangir in 1627. His successor, Shah Jahan [...] "took offense" [...] at Guru Har Gobind's sovereignty and after a series of assaults on Amritsar forced the Sikhs to retreat to the Sivalik Hills. Guru Har Gobind's successor, Guru Har Rai maintained the guruship in the Sivalik Hills by defeating local attempts to seize Sikh land and taking a neutral role in the power struggle between Aurangzeb and Dara Shikoh for control of the Timurid dynasty.|$|E
2500|$|The Sikh {{religion}} began {{around the}} time of the conquest of Northern India by Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire. His conquering grandson, Akbar the Great, supported religious freedom and after visiting the langar of Guru Amar Das got a favourable impression of Sikhism. As a result of his visit he donated land to the langar and the Mughals did not have any conflict with Sikh gurus until his death in 1605. His successor Jahangir, however, saw the Sikhs as a political threat. He ordered Guru Arjun Dev, who had been arrested for supporting the rebellious Khusrau Mirza, to change the passage about Islam in the Adi Granth. When the Guru refused, Jahangir ordered him to be put to death by torture. [...] Guru Arjan Dev's martyrdom led to the sixth Guru, Guru Hargobind, declaring Sikh sovereignty in the creation of the Akal Takht and the establishment of a fort to defend Amritsar. Jahangir attempted to assert authority over the Sikhs by jailing Guru Hargobind at Gwalior, but released him after a number of years when he no longer felt threatened. The Sikh community did not have any further issues <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mughal</b> <b>empire</b> until the death of Jahangir in 1627. The succeeding son of Jahangir, Shah Jahan, took offence at Guru Hargobind's [...] "sovereignty" [...] and after a series of assaults on Amritsar forced the Sikhs to retreat to the Sivalik Hills.|$|E

2500|$|The Imperial complex was {{abandoned}} in 1585, shortly after its completion, {{due to the}} exhaustion of the small, spring-fed lake that supplied <b>the</b> city <b>with</b> water, and its proximity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Rajputana, <b>with</b> which <b>the</b> <b>Mughal</b> <b>Empire</b> was often at war. Thus the capital was shifted to Lahore so that Akbar could have a base in the less stable part of the empire, before moving back to Agra in 1598, where he had begun his reign as he shifted his focus to Deccan. In fact, he never returned to the city except {{for a brief period}} in 1601. In later Mughal history it was occupied for a short while by <b>the</b> <b>Mughal</b> emperor Muhammad Shah (1719 -1748) and his regent, Sayyid Hussain Ali Khan Barha, one of the Syed Brothers, was murdered here in 1720. [...] The palaces were occupied by the Marathas after their conquest of Delhi, then transferred to the British army, which used the fortified complex as a headquarters and barracks.

40|$|This work {{follows the}} rise and {{expansion}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mughal</b> <b>Empire</b> in India from the 16 th to the early 18 th century. <b>The</b> <b>Mughal</b> dynasty was ruled by six major emperors, each of them with significat contribution to the development and spread of Indian art and culture. <b>The</b> <b>Mughal</b> art is marvelous synthesis of Indian art that was nurtured by local Hindu population, Persian art, which was brought in India by Moguls, along with some influences from local regions and Europe. We follow <b>the</b> construction of <b>Mughal</b> gardens, especially chār bāgh, as well as patronage of Mughal emperors on painting, music and literature. Many artists have found their places at Mughal court. It was, indeed, a golden age of art. Also, very important is <b>the</b> development of <b>Mughal</b> architecture, which in size and magnificence even today still amazes people all around <b>the</b> world. <b>With</b> decline of <b>the</b> <b>Mughal</b> <b>Empire</b> ended <b>the</b> golden age of Indian art...|$|R
2500|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> Islamic <b>Mughal</b> <b>empire</b> {{falling apart}} in the 18th century, {{regional}} post-Mughal ruling elites and new dynasties from diverse religious, geographical and linguistic background attempted to assert their power {{in different parts of}} India. Bayly states that these obscure post-Mughal elites associated themselves with kings, priests and ascetics, deploying the symbols of caste and kinship to divide their populace and consolidate their power. In addition, in this fluid stateless environment, some of the previously casteless segments of society grouped themselves into caste groups. However, in 18th century writes Bayly, India-wide networks of merchants, armed ascetics and armed tribal people often ignored these ideologies of caste. Most people did not treat caste norms as given absolutes writes Bayly, but challenged, negotiated and adapted these norms to their circumstances. Communities teamed in different regions of India, into [...] "collective classing" [...] to mold the social stratification in order to maximise assets and protect themselves from loss. The [...] "caste, class, community" [...] structure that formed became valuable in a time when state apparatus was fragmenting, was unreliable and fluid, when rights and life were unpredictable.|$|R

What brought success to these Hindu princelings was the strong clan organisation on which they rested. There were perhaps as many as 100,000 Bhumihar clansmen backing the Benares rajas in what later became the districts of Benares, Gorakhpur and Azamgarh. This proved a decisive advantage when the dynasty faced its rival and nominal suzerain, the Nawab of Awadh, in the 1750s and the 1760s. Their support gave the Benares ruler the capacity to mount an exhausting guerrilla war against the Avadh camp using his Bhumihar clan levies which forced the Nawab to withdraw his main force.|$|R
25|$|In plains above Delhi, the mid-14th century Sultan of Delhi, Firoz Shah Tughlaq, had {{constructed}} the 150-mile long Western Jamna Canal. Taking {{off from the}} right bank of the Jamna river early in its course, the canal irrigated the Sultan's territories in the Hissar region of Eastern Punjab. By the mid-16th century, however, the fine sediment carried by the Himalayan river had gradually choked the canal. Desilted and reopened several decades later by Akbar the Great, the Western Jamna Canal was itself tapped by Akbar's grandson Shah Jahan, {{and some of its}} water was diverted to Delhi. During this time another canal was cut off the river. The 129-mile Eastern Jamna Canal or Doab Canal, which took off from the left bank of the Jamna, also high in its course, presented a qualitatively different difficulty. Since it was cut through steeply sloped land, its flow became difficult to control, and it was never to function efficiently. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> decline of <b>Mughal</b> <b>Empire</b> power in <b>the</b> 18th century, both canals fell into disrepair and closed. The Western Jamna Canal was repaired by British army engineers and it reopened in 1820. The Doab Canal was reopened in 1830; its considerable renovation involved raising the embankment by an average height of 9ft. for some 40 miles.|$|R
