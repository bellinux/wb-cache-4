50|$|The {{following}} description {{applies to}} a loam soil and agricultural crops. When a field is flooded, {{it is said}} to be saturated and all available air space is occupied by <b>water.</b> The <b>suction</b> required to draw water into a plant root is zero. As the field drains under the influence of gravity (drained water is called gravitational water or drain-able <b>water),</b> the <b>suction</b> a plant must produce to use such water increases to 1/3 bar. At that point, the soil is said to have reached field capacity, and plants that use the water must produce increasingly higher suction, finally up to 15 bar. At 15 bar <b>suction,</b> the soil <b>water</b> amount is called wilting percent. At that suction the plant cannot sustain its water needs as water is still being lost from the plant by transpiration; the plant's turgidity is lost, and it wilts. The next level, called air-dry, occurs at 1000 bar suction. Finally the oven dry condition is reached at 10,000 bar <b>suction.</b> All <b>water</b> below wilting percentage is called unavailable water.|$|R

The volumetric water content of the surface soil and subsoil of the reclaimed farmland began to be less than that of the unaltered farmland after the field capacity was reached, while the volumetric water content of the substratum soil of the reclaimed farmland started to be less than that of the unaltered farmland before the field capacity was reached, indicating that the substratum soil (sediment) of the reclaimed farmland drained water very quickly and had low capacity to retain water. There was difference in the shape and range in soil water characteristic curve of the two kinds of sampling sites shown in Fig.  4, which may be due to that there was more clay content in the surface soil, subsoil and substratum soil of the unaltered farmland than that of the reclaimed farmland, respectively, as shown in Table  1.

Transpiration was determined by a constant-water level device which recorded {{the amount of water}} used over a period of time. Photosynthesis and respiration were measured using an infra-red gas analyzer. The total nitrogen content of plants was measured by the micro-Kjeldahl method {{at the beginning and end}} of a ten-day experimental period. Leaf surface areas were determined with an air flow planimeter. In general with increasing soil temperature rates of transpiration, photosynthesis, and nitrogen fixation increased slowly at first and then rapidly until a certain optimum range was reached and decreased at higher temperatures. Maximum rates occurred around soil temperatures, of 30, 27 and 27 °C, respectively. The rate of respiration also increased with increasing soil temperature until an optimum range around 27 °C was reached and then dropped rapidly as the soil temperature further increased. Rates of photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and N-fixation decreased steadily with increasing soil <b>water</b> <b>suction.</b> The decrease in the rate of these metabolic processes with increased soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> was attributed to effects of changes in viscosity and root cell permeability, stomatal movement and translocation of metabolic substrates. At low soil temperatures the dry matter accumulation seemed to be controlled by the water supply. At higher than optimum soil temperatures the dry dry matter accumulation was very sensitive-to temperature changes and less soil water dependent. When the nitrogen supply from the soil is limiting, the nitrogen fixation may possibly be a most important factor in the metabolic processes and thus the growth of leguminous plants.

40|$|The montane {{rain forest}} belt on Mt Kilimanjaro forms an {{important}} water source for northern Tanzania that {{is threatened by}} both logging and fire. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the consequences of forest fragmentation on various aspects of the water cycle. Soil properties, rainfall, throughfall and soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> were analysed for mature forest, secondary forest patches and large clearings. A total of 10 plots located on the south-western slopes of the mountain between 2100 and 2300 m. a. s. l. were monitored from May 2000 to June 2002. Annual rainfall amounts ranged from 2000 to 2600 mm with high spatial and inter-annual variability. Rainfall interception ranged from 3 to 9 % of incident rainfall in clearings, to a maximum of 32 % in forests. In general, soils under mature forest were wettest and showed only minor moisture fluctuations throughout the year. Soils of secondary forest sites were driest and soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> exhibited the largest fluctuations. Additionally, the finer texture of soils under mature forest compared to secondary forest sites allowed higher amounts of soil water to be stored for similar soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> levels. Ventilation and radiation penetration, which influence the magnitude of interception, evaporation from the forest floor and transpiration, were probably higher in fragmented secondary than in closed mature forests. In clearings, higher throughfall and presumably lower transpiration rates led to moister conditions compared to adjacent secondary forest sites. Thus, soil conditions under mature forest were most suitable for optimum water storage on Mt Kilimanjaro. The transformation of closed mature forest to a mosaic of forests in different stages of regeneration led to increased spatio-temporal variability in soil moisture.

Most of the models used to estimate soil deformation during the passage of machines {{are based on the}} concept of total stress: then they have neglected an important stress variable for unsaturated soils, i. e. the matrix suction. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the validity of this hypothesis by studying suction variation during a static compression test.

Field experiments were conducted for 2 years (2006 and 2007) at Punjab Agricultural University Farm, Ludhiana on a deep alluvial loamy sand Typic Ustipsamment soils developed under hyper-thermic regime. Treatments included three dates of transplanting (25 May, 10 June and 25 June), two cultivars (PR 118 inbred and RH 257 hybrid) and two irrigation schedules (2 -days drainage period and at soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> of 16 kPa). The model used was CropSyst, which has already been calibrated for growth (periodic biomass and LAI) of rice and soil water content in two independent experiments. The main findings of the field and simulation studies conducted are compared to any individual, integrated management of transplanting date, cultivar and irrigation, sustained yield (6. 3 - 7. 5 tha- 1) and saved substantial amount of water in rice. For example, with two management interventions, i. e. shifting of transplanting date to lower evaporative demand (from 5 May to 25 June) concomitant with growing of short duration hybrid variety (90 days from transplanting to harvest), the total real water saving (wet saving) through reduction in evapotranspiration (ET) was 140 mm, which was almost double than managing the single, i. e. 66 mm by shifting transplanting or 71 mm by growing short duration hybrid variety. Shifting the transplanting date saved water through reduction in soil water evaporation component while growing of short duration variety through reduction in both evaporation and transpiration components of water balance. Managing irrigation water schedule based on soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> of 16 kPa at 15 - 20 cm soil depth, compared to 2 -day drainage, did not save water in real (wet saving), however, it resulted into apparent water saving (dry saving).
