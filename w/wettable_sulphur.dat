40|$|In a field {{experiment}} conducted over two growing seasons, the effectiveness and phytotoxicity of inorganic fungicides such as sulphur, lime sulphur, copper, silicon and Armicarb (a new formulation of potassium bicarbonate) was compared with {{water for the}} control of primary apple scab infections in Belgium on high, medium and low scab-susceptible cultivars (cvs. ‘Pinova’, ‘Pirouette’ and ‘Reinette des Capucins’, respectively). In order to drastically {{reduce the amount of}} fungicide applied in the orchard, two approaches were used: (i) a strategy involving spraying during the infection process, just before conditions for infection had been fulfilled according to the RIMpro software warning system; and (ii) a tunnel sprayer machine for treatment applications. Under field conditions that were highly favourable for disease, low rates of elemental sulphur (31. 8 and 38. 6 kg ha- 1 year- 1 in 2005 and 2006, respectively) combined with low rates of copper (2. 1 kg ha- 1 year- 1 in both years) provided the best scab control and reduced its severity on the fruits of cv. ‘Pinova’ by 97 and 98 % compared with water control in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Lime sulphur was much more effective than <b>wettable</b> <b>sulphur</b> and appeared to be efficient at temperatures below 10 °C, but its effectiveness against apple scab decreased if the treatments were applied 12 – 24 h later than in the ‘during-infection’ spray strategy. Armicarb used alone significantly reduced apple scab severity on the leaves and fruits of the three cultivars compared with water control. Its effectiveness was as good as <b>wettable</b> <b>sulphur</b> applied using the same timing and dosage. Silicon reduced apple scab on fruits very slightly, but not on leaves. The amounts of <b>wettable</b> <b>sulphur,</b> lime sulphur, copper, silicon and potassium bicarbonate used in this experiment to control apple scab were not phytotoxic, did not increase fruit russet, did increase the yield of each cultivar and did not affect summer density of the beneficial Typhlodromus pyri.

40|$|A {{replicated}} shadehouse experiment {{demonstrated that}} a canola oil derivative gave good {{control of the}} important grapevine disease, powdery mildew (caused by Uncinula necator). Repeated inoculation of potted vines with U. necator lead to severe foliar infection in the unsprayed control treatment. Repeated sprays of the canola oil derivative at rates of 2. 0 and 5. 0 mL (formulated product) per L prevented the development of foliar symptoms as effectively as either <b>wettable</b> <b>sulphur</b> 2 g (formulated product) per L or fenarimol 0. 2 mL (formulated product) per L at label rates. On the final assessment date, when the untreated control vines were very heavily diseased, the lowest rate (1 mL/L) of canola oil derivative gave significantly (P < 0. 05) poorer disease control than the other fungicide treatments though symptoms were significantly (P < 0. 05) less severe than in the control. No phytotoxicity was observed in any treatment...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{farming and}} {{horticulture}} {{require the use}} of more environmentally-friendly chemicals to reduce potentially harmful side-effects on producers and on consumer health. Sulphur {{is one of the most}} important natural fungicides used in organic farming to protect plants against attack by powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica). The use of natural elicitors to induce natural resistance against fungal diseases may provide an alternative to conventional treatments. In this work, we compared the effects of <b>wettable</b> <b>sulphur</b> and two elicitors (Chitoplant (R) and Milsana (R)) on the productivity and nutritional quality of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L cv. Belladonna). Both elicitors, and a conventional sulphur treatment resulted in a similar degree of protection against powdery mildew. One or more of these three treatments positively affected the concentrations of some natural phytochemicals in tomato fruit (e. g., ascorbic acid, quercetin trisaccharide, quercetin- 3 -O-rutinoside, beta-carotene, and potassium) compared with untreated control plants. The minimal environmental impact and absence of any negative side-effects on growers and consumer health may encourage the use of these elicitors in organic farming and horticulture...|$|E
40|$|Grapevine powdery mildew, {{caused by}} the fungus Uncinula necator Schweinitz Burrill, is a major disease {{affecting}} grape yield and quality worldwide. In conventional vineyards, the disease is controlled mainly by regular applications of sulphur and synthetic fungicides, such as demethylation inhibiting fungicides (DMIs), and in organic agriculture by sulphur and canola-based oils. The impending restrictions {{on the use of}} sulphur in organic viticulture, the development of resistance to DMls in Australia and elsewhere, and the demand for residue-free grapes create a need for effective alternatives to sulphur and synthetic chemicals. This research has identified potential replacements for synthetic fungicides and sulphur in the control of powdery mildew, such as milk, whey, bicarbonates and canola oil-based sprays. A series of greenhouse experiments was conducted to evaluate 34 potential novel materials and biological agents for efficacy in controlling powdery mildew. The most effective treatments applied were Bacillus subtilis (which reduced disease by 94 % compared to the untreated control), Synertrol Horti-Oil® (a canola oil-based product, 92 %), milk (70 %), whey (64 %) and Ecocarb® (potassium bicarbonate, 58 %). Milk and whey provided increased control of powdery mildew as the concentration increased. The efficacy of milk tended to decrease as the fat content of the milk was reduced. The materials that were most promising in the greenhouse were then assessed in field trials in commercial vineyards. Applications of milk, whey and mixtures of a canola oil-based product and potassium bicarbonate, applied at rates of 300 L/ha to 1000 L/ha depending on canopy development, reduced the severity of powdery mildew. The severity of powdery mildew on vines sprayed with a 1 : 10 dilution of milk, 45 g/L whey powder and mixed programs was not significantly different from that on vines sprayed with <b>sulphur</b> (<b>wettable</b> powder, 3 g/L). However, the relative control of powdery mildew by the test materials in field trials was highly dependent on the degree of coverage of the plant surface achieved. In vineyards where coverage was compromised, the degree of control of powdery mildew was reduced, often to commercially unacceptable levels. Electron spin resonance (ESR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to investigate the possible mode or modes of action of milk and whey in the control of powdery mildew. The ESR experiments showed that production of oxygen radicals by various components of milk in natural light was associated with reduced severity of powdery mildew. SEM images showed that milk and whey caused the hyphae of U necator to collapse and damaged conidia within 24 h of treatment. Hydrogen peroxide, applied as a source of free radicals, also caused collapse of the hyphae of U necator within 24 h but did not damage conidia, and appeared to stimulate germination. Lactoferrin (an antimicrobial component of milk) ruptured conidia, but damage to hyphae was not evident in lactoferrin-treated samples until 48 h after treatment. The results suggested that fats, free radical production along with the action of lactoferrin, and possibly other proteins, are associated with the control of powdery mildew by milk. Novel soft fungicides, such as milk and oil plus bicarbonate mixtures, were effective alternatives to sulphur and synthetic fungicides in certain South Australian conditions. Biological agents (including B. subtilis, which was highly effective in greenhouse experiments) did not provide acceptable control of powdery mildew in the vineyard. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|In small plot trials, {{performed}} by several institutes {{in the past}} years, potassium bicarbonate {{proved to be a}} promising alternative to the use of copper for the control of apple scab in organic orchards. Feasibility, effectiveness, consequences, and side effects of the replacement of copper by bicarbonate under practical conditions are largely unknown. In 2007 Five Dutch organic apple growers compared a bicarbonate based scab management strategy with their standard spray program. The use of 5 kg potassium bicarbonate + 2 kg. <b>wettable</b> <b>sulphur</b> shortly before rain or during infection development, was the core of the strategy. It was concluded that the control of apple scab with the potassium bicarbonate strategy was as effective as the standard spray plan, provided lime sulphur was available tot cover extreme situations. The applications did not lead to any phytotoxic damage on leafs or fruits. Potassium bicarbonate tank mixed with a Mn leaf fertilizer however resulted in severe leaf drop, and necrotic spots on the remaining leafs. The use of potassium bicarbonate did not increase the potassium content of the fruits...|$|E
40|$|Organic apple {{production}} in Europe depends {{to a great}} extent on the use of copper fungicides for scab control (Venturia inaequalis). The objective of this 6 -year study (2003 - 2008) conducted in Belgium was to determine measures for reducing the use of copper fungicides in organic apple production. The effectiveness of a 'during-infection' spray strategy using <b>wettable</b> <b>sulphur</b> (with or without copper), lime sulphur, potassium bicarbonate, silicon and five natural plant extracts (orange peel, soapbark, tea seed, quinoa seed and grapefruit seed) for controlling primary scab was investigated in a split-plot field experiment. Four apple cultivars that express a gradient of partial scab resistance were included: a high scab-susceptible cultivar (cv. 'Pinova'), a medium scab-susceptible cultivar (cv. 'Pirouette') and two old cultivars expressing low to very low scab susceptibility (cvs. 'Reinette Hernaut' and 'Reinette des Capucins'). Apart from these cultivars, four monogenic Vf scab-resistant cultivars (cvs. 'Initial', 'Topaz', 'Zvatava' and 'JN 20 / 33 / 58 ') were also included in the experimental orchard. In order {{to reduce the amount of}} fungicide required, two strategies were used: a specific spray timing involving spraying during the infection processes, before fungal penetration, determined by the RIMpro software warning system, and a tunnel sprayer machine for optimal treatment applications. Depending on the year, a total of 8 - 12 applications were made annually. Under field conditions that were highly conducive disease, low rates of elemental sulphur (≤ 40 kg. ha- 1 per year) combined with low rates of copper (≤ 2. 1 kg. ha- 1 per year) provided the best scab control and reduced scab severity on the leaves and fruits by 85 - 100 %, depending on the year and cultivar, compared with the untreated control. In most cases, the lime sulphur spray treatment, which used more elemental sulphur but did not use copper, provided a similar level of scab control to the combined <b>wettable</b> <b>sulphur</b> and copper spray treatment. Sulphur, potassium bicarbonate and all plant extracts significantly reduced scab severity on leaves and fruits. In general, the treatments increased the yield of the high and medium scab-susceptible cultivars as well as that of the low and very low scab-susceptible cultivars. Under these experimental conditions, none of the treatments caused phytotoxicity, increased fruit russet or led to undesirable soil and fruit residues at harvest. The potential and limitations of "during-infection" spraying as a protection strategy against apple scab in organic farming are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Curative and {{preventive}} efficacy and phytotoxicity of lime sulphur spray schedules, {{based on a}} warning system, were evaluated in the Netherlands during two growing seasons under field conditions. In most cases, lime sulphur treatments applied either curatively or preventively resulted in significantly lower scab damage on both the leaves and fruits compared to <b>wettable</b> <b>sulphur</b> treatments. However, all lime sulphur treatments showed high phytotoxicity values, reduced leaf size and {{had a tendency to}} a reduced yield quality compared to all other treatments. For curative schedules of lime sulphur on scab control, phytotoxicity and yield did not differ significantly from preventive schedules of lime sulphur. However, the use of a warning system combined with curative schedules of lime sulphur saved one and two lime sulphur sprays in 2000 and 2001, respectively, compared to the preventive treatments of lime sulphur. Our results demonstrated that a curative spray programme with lime sulphur at 0. 75 - 2 %, applied 35 - 45 h after predicted infection periods, can provide effective primary apple scab control, but no benefit in either yield or fruit quality was reached under organic growing conditions. Moreover, research herein clearly showed that organic growers are forced to find a balance between good efficacy and phytotoxic effects of lime sulphur...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{on the effectiveness}} of some fungicides such as <b>wettable</b> <b>sulphur,</b> copper hydroxide, potassium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate mixed with potassium silicate against apple scab and apple powdery mildew attack, in the environmental conditions of Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The following cultivars were analyzed ‘Jonathan’, ‘Gala’, ‘Jonagold’, ‘Jonica’, ‘Golden Delicious’, ‘Idared’, ‘Granny Smith ’ and ‘Starkrimson’, in an experiment conducted over two growing seasons (2009 - 2010), in five treatment variants. Potassium bicarbonate and a mixture between potassium bicarbonate and potassium silicate proved to be more effective in reducing the attack of apple scab and powdery mildew on leaves and fruit. Results were obtained for two years with favourable conditions of apple scab and powdery mildew development, when untreated variants exhibited an attack degree at a mean value of 49. 77 % for scab and 52. 13 % for powdery mildew. Potassium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate mixed with potassium silicate assured the best results {{in the case of the}} ‘Idared’, ‘Jonathan’, ‘Jonica ’ cultivars regarding apple scab, and ‘Golden Delicious’, ‘Starkrimson ’ and ‘Granny Smith’, regarding powdery mildew, where the mean value attack degree was reduced by about three times.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{north-western}} {{region of}} Venezuela, Phyllocoptruta oleivora, Tetranychus mexicanus and Brevipalpus phoenicis are common plant-feeding mites on leaves, fruits and branches of Tahiti lime, Citrus latifolia. The population dynamics of these herbivores {{are affected by}} many factors, such as weekly treatments with <b>wettable</b> <b>sulphur,</b> particularly during the wet season, maintenance pruning of plants, irrigation with microsprinklers, induction of water stress by withholding irrigation and biotic and abiotic environmental factors. During October 1994 –January 1995, 31 trees in a commercial orchard were sampled weekly in order to describe population fluctuations of plant-feeding mites (mean number of mites per leaf or fruit), before (4 weeks) and after (4 weeks) a period of 6 weeks of drought stress (no irrigation). The population density of P. oleivora increased progressively during the last 3 weeks of the irrigation period and reached a maximum of 24 mites per fruit. In contrast, the populations {{of the other two}} species, T. mexicanus and B. phoenicis, remained at the same low density as before the withholding-irrigation period. After 6 weeks without irrigation, only T. mexicanus increased, to a high mean value of 11 mites per leaf. The withholding-irrigation practice appears to affect the population size of P. oleivora towards the end of this period and that of T. mexicanus {{at the beginning of the}} re-establishment of the water supply. The highest proportion of trees (32 %) was infested by T. mexicanus after the withholding-irrigation period, when irrigation was resumed, whereas the highest levels of infestation of trees by P. oleivora and B. phoenicis were 16 and 10 %, respectively, during the last week of the water-stress period. Although factors affecting the dynamics of the mites in the orchard are likely to be complex, irrigation management apparently plays an important role...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{population}} densities {{of the apple}} sawfly Hoplocampa testudinea (Klug) and its parasitoid Lathrolestes ensator (Brauns) were monitored in 15 apple orchards {{for a period of}} up to 4 years. The parasitoid species was found in all orchards except one, and was more numerous in plantings on sandier soils. Post-bloom insecticide applications against other pests, and carbaryl for fruit thinning, often decimated both host and parasitoid in integrated pest management orchards. In organic orchards, where synthetic pesticides are banned, and Quassia is the only remedy against sawfly, the pest is more problematic. The low levels of parasitism in all organic orchards, except one, were possibly due to the application of <b>wettable</b> <b>sulphur</b> during the parasitoid flight period. The sawfly usually recovers more quickly than its parasitoid when chemical control is discontinued, because propagation of L. ensator is limited in various ways. The parasitoid is time limited, because suitable second instar host larvae are rarely available {{for more than a week}} on a single apple variety. Moreover, parasitism levels stay moderate because the parasitoid females do not avoid superparasitism. Finally, relatively more sawflies than parasitoids emerge after 10 months underground, because the incidence of prolonged diapause is more elevated in L. ensator than in the sawfly. It is suggested that both the high incidence of prolonged diapause and the inability to avoid superparasitism are useful in reducing the risk of local extinction. Elevated sawfly attack in a single early apple variety would reduce exploitation of suitable host larvae in other nearby varieties, in as far as the parasitoid is not able to distinguish fruitlets with accessible second instar host larvae from those with inaccessible older larvae. Although the former are available for a limited time, the latter may keep the parasitoids from moving to the less abundant second instar larvae in late(r) varieties. Reduction of elevated host density in such an early variety by a properly timed application of a short-lived pesticide, such as Quassia, increases parasitism levels proportionally, and is expected to promote parasitoid movement to host larvae in other varieties nearb...|$|E
40|$|Conclusions {{and further}} studies The {{significant}} reduction of T. pyri and of larvae of predaceous gall midges, {{the complete loss of}} mite-diversity {{and the possible}} enhancement of P. ulmi and other harmful mites (i. e. C. vitis) are clear disadvantages of lime sulphur. Densities of T. pyri between 0. 5 and 1 mite per leaf as mentioned to be necessary for controlling harmful mites (BOURQUIN 1989, FORTMANN 1993, HARZER 1993, KARG 1992, KOHLER ET AL. 1991), were never reached in lime sulphur treatment, while the untreated control always showed densities above this value. On the other hand low densities of predaceous mites are quite normal in intensively sulphur treated, biological orchards and are often replaced by other mite predators, like predatory bugs (Miriadae, Anthocoridae) or the coccinellid beetle Stethorus punctillum (HÄSELI & BOSSHARD 1994). Therefore further studies should include these arthropods, because lime sulphur may also have adverse effects on them (BORIANI 1994, BROWN 1978). Furthermore the lowest application strategy in terms of frequency and concentrations for scab control should be examined to minimise the quantity of applied lime sulphur (ZIMMER 2000). In addition the effects of different application methods, for example by sprayer or overhead irrigation on beneficial arthropod as well as on scab should be studied (KELDERER ET AL. 2000). The side effects of lime sulphur should not be considered separated from other used fungicides, moreover the whole spraying program should be included, because <b>wettable</b> <b>sulphur</b> (MILAIRE ET AL. 1974) and clay powder (HÄSELI & BOSSHARD 1994) also harm arthropods. For agronomic interests but also from the points of view of the registration of lime sulphur and the public image of organic apple growing, the question is: whether lots of preventive applications with copper, sulphur and clay powder have more adverse effects on beneficial arthropods than fewer curative applications of lime sulphur by using an infestion prediction model. Only by further studies under realistic farming conditions it is estimable, whether the use of lime sulphur in organic orchards can be accepted. In the common enthusiasm about this new curative fungicide, we should not forget the important role of beneficial arthropods. In this context the registration without any indication in the EU should be critically discussed...|$|E
