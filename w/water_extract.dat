5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a <b>water</b> <b>extract</b> of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E

Thinly sliced or pulverized lingzhi (either fresh or dried) {{is added to}} a pot of boiling water, the water is then reduced to a simmer, and the pot is covered; the lingzhi is then simmered for two hours. The resulting liquid is fairly bitter in taste and dark, with the more active red lingzhi more bitter than the black. The process is sometimes repeated for additional concentration. Alternatively, {{it can be used}} as an ingredient in a formula decoction or used to make an extract (in liquid, capsule, or powder form). The more active red forms of lingzhi are far too bitter to be consumed in a soup.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{phenolics}} and saponins in {{contributing to}} bitterness in marama beans, an underutilized legume, especially when roasted, was investigated. Marama beans were roasted at 150 C for 20, 25 or 30 min, then dehulled to separate cotyledons, and pastes were prepared from these. <b>Water</b> <b>extracts</b> were prepared from full fat and defatted flours from roasted and unroasted marama cotyledons.

Two hundred sixteen DOCs CP 707 strain were reared for four weeks in high stocking density of 15 birds/m 2.

Overall, three extracts from fruit bodies were more effective in antioxidant properties assayed than those from mycelia and filtrate.

The IC 50 Of WEUCT in liposome oxidation induced by the Fenton reaction was 0. 41 mg/mL, which was higher than that of alpha-tocopherol (IC 50 = 0. 55 mg/mL).

Using these techniques, the isotopic exchangeability of Cu species in <b>water</b> <b>extracts</b> was investigated.
