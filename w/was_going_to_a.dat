5|$|Of {{all these}} fragmentary pre-Hellenistic sources, {{the most is}} known of Sophocles Troilos. Even so, only 54 words have been {{identified}} as coming from the play. Fragment 619 refers to Troilus as an andropais, a man-boy. Fragment 621 indicates that Troilus <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> spring with a companion to fetch water or to water his horses. A scholion to the Iliad states that Sophocles has Troilus ambushed by Achilles while exercising his horses in the Thymbra. Fragment 623 indicates that Achilles mutilated Troilus' corpse by a method known as maschalismos. This involved preventing the ghost of a murder victim from returning to haunt their killer by cutting off the corpse's extremities and stringing them under its armpits. Sophocles is thought to have also referred to the maschalismos of Troilus in a fragment taken to be from an earlier play Polyxene.|$|E
500|$|Whitepages.com {{underwent}} a re-design in 2009. According to VentureBeat reporter Matt Marshall, the redesign made the advertising [...] "cleaner" [...] {{and made it}} more obvious when someone <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> third-party website like US Search. Marshall had previously criticized Whitepages, because website users that clicked on US Search ads and purchased data from US Search were sent through perpetual advertisements for other services that {{made it difficult to}} access the information they paid for. A local business lookup feature called [...] "Store Finder" [...] was added in June 2010. The following month, Whitepages.com launched a deal site, Dealpop.com, which differed from Groupon by offering short-term deals on nationally available products. Dealpop was sold to Tippr the following year.|$|E
500|$|The bombers stashed {{explosives}} weighing approximately [...] in {{the trunk}} of one of the cars, and set a timing device to trigger the bomb at 17:45, during the happy hour in the officers' bar at the hotel. The pair drove their vehicles into the hotel's grounds. Knowing from their intelligence that a certain American colonel had returned to the US, the [...] "major" [...] lied and told the hotel clerk that he had an appointment with the American officer, claiming that the colonel would be coming from Da Lat. The clerk correctly replied that the colonel had left the country, but the [...] "major" [...] insisted that the clerk was mistaken. The [...] "major" [...] then parked his vehicle in the car park beneath the hotel, before ordering his chauffeur to leave and fetch the American with the other vehicle. He then left the hotel grounds, asking the guard to tell the American colonel to wait for him. The [...] "major" [...] claimed that he had not eaten all day and <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nearby café.|$|E

2500|$|Discussing Pete's demise, Gillian Taylforth {{who played}} his ex-wife Kathy Beale, {{has stated that}} {{although}} she and actor Peter Dean had problems [...] "now and then", she found it really hard when he left, and that Pete's death was [...] "an {{end of an era}} for EastEnders." [...] The tankard that Pete was often seen drinking from in pub scenes was allegedly so popular that Peter Dean reported it was stolen twice by fans and he had to replace it on both occasions. Dean has suggested that during his time in the soap, the most letters he received were about a storyline that saw him cross-dressing as part of a practical joke: [...] "The episode I got the most letters about was when Pete <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Topsy Turvy party, where men dress as women and women as men. But he didn't get the message that the party was cancelled. He opened the door of the Queen Vic in this dress, singing a song, and then it was the duff, duff, duff ... People felt so sorry for Pete about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1966 Midwest Regional Finals, Kansas, {{the favored}} team to face Kentucky, played Texas Western. Texas Western got a {{controversial}} double overtime victory, 81–80. The would-be winning shot, a 35-footer, {{at the buzzer}} was made by All-American Jo Jo White {{at the end of}} the first overtime, but White was called for stepping on the sideline, ironically being penalized for being too far away from the basket and the shot was negated. [...] This has always been highly contested and a [...] of the play shows his heel over the line but not on the floor. [...] Being the only piece of impartial evidence, it is impossible to tell whether his heel came up from the line prior to the photo, or whether his heel dropped to the line following the photo. [...] Also noted in the photograph is the fact that the referee is not looking at his foot. [...] This supports Ted Owens' objection that the call was made late, if the ref did not see his foot until after the shot. [...] The Kansas players were celebrating when they were told the game <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 2nd overtime. Regardless of what actually happened, Texas Western was given the victory and advanced to the Final Four. [...] The game is immortalized in the 2006 film Glory Road which is based on that season's Texas Western team.|$|E
