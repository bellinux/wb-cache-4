5|$|Salma feels {{isolated}} {{given that}} her son has moved to Washington, D.C. and her daughters are now married. The local village elder Abu Kamal (Makram Khoury) advises her to give in, but Salma decides {{to work with the}} young lawyer Ziad Daud (Ali Suliman). They take their case all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court. Mira Navon (Rona Lipaz-Michael), the minister's wife, sympathizes with Salma. The court case receives notable media attention, and Mira gives a news interview that her husband regrets. Mira believes that the Israeli military overreacted, and she also shares Salma's sense of personal loneliness. Although they never speak, a complex human bond develops between the two women. As the Palestinian cause is dismissed, Mira decides to leave her husband and a concrete wall is built between Salma's land and the Defense Minister's house. A final camera shot reveals the lemon trees have been pruned.|$|E
5|$|Preckwinkle {{chairs the}} ward organization, the Fourth Ward Democratic Organization, {{which was one}} of sixteen Chicago Democratic ward {{organizations}} named in a complaint filed on August 31, 2005 with the Illinois State Board of Elections by the Cook County Republican Party charging that Democratic Party ward organizations are illegally housed in City-funded neighborhood ward offices. Taxpayers fund aldermanic service centers, which are open to the public. State law prohibits the use of public funds by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of nine that a Hearing Officer appointed by the Board recommended proceed to the next step of the hearing process, an Open Preliminary Hearing. On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Elections, the Board entered an executive session and voted, in a 4â€“4 tie, along strict party lines, failing to adopt the recommendation of the Hearing Officer, and ordered the complaints dismissed. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court of Illinois. On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals of the complaints.|$|E

25|$|Following white Democrats' regaining {{political}} power in the late 1870s, legislators gradually increased restrictions on voting, chiefly through statute. From 1890 to 1908, most of the Southern states, starting with Mississippi, created new constitutions with further provisions: poll taxes, literacy and understanding tests, and increased residency requirements, that effectively disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. Forcing them off voter registration lists also prevented them from serving on juries, whose members were limited to voters. Although challenges to such constitutions made their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court in Williams v. Mississippi (1898) and Giles v.

25|$|Much of Tobin's {{presidency}} was consumed by a long-running and sometimes physically violent jurisdictional {{battle with the}} National Union of United Brewery Workmen. The Teamsters had challenged the Brewery Workmen's right to organize beer wagon drivers in 1903 and 1905. At Tobin's insistence, in 1907 the AFL revoked the Brewery Workers' charter, but a firestorm of protest from local unions around the country led the AFL to reinstate the charter in 1909. In 1933, the AFL Executive Council agreed to strip the brewery workers' union, {{now known as the}} United Brewery Workers, of the beer drivers. The United Brewery Workers filed suit in federal court in 1936 seeking to bar their suspension and the transfer of workers to the Teamsters. As the case worked its <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court of the United States the AFL attempted to mediate the dispute to no avail. The Supreme Court found in the AFL's favor, and the United Brewery Workers were suspended from the AFL.|$|E
25|$|Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942), was a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} that dramatically increased the regulatory {{power of the}} federal government. It remains {{as one of the}} most important and far-reaching cases concerning the New Deal, and set a precedent for an expansive reading of the United States Constitution's Commerce Clause for decades to come. The goal of the business interests that financed the legal challenge all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court was to convince the court to declare the entire federal crop support program unconstitutional and thereby end it. Unfortunately for Filburn and his backers, by the time the case reached the high court, eight out of the nine justices had been appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the architect of the New Deal legislation. In addition, the case was heard during wartime, shortly after the United States had entered World War II. Not surprisingly, the Filburn decision supported the president's policy, holding that the Constitution allowed the federal government to regulate economic activity that was only indirectly related to interstate commerce.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, when a {{brokerage}} firm {{had tried to}} compel arbitration with an investor alleging his broker left him holding the bag in a pump and dump scheme, the case had gone all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court. In 1953 it had held in Wilko v. Swan that three provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (or, the 1933 Act), which regulates the primary market in which securities issuers sell directly to buyers, were controlling, allowing investors to take their claims to court regardless of what contracts and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) said. It found that the language in the 1933 Act voiding any waiver of any provision of the statute was broad enough to cover arbitration clauses, and deduced congressional preference for the courts in language that allowed a special cause of action where {{the burden of proof}} was on the seller of the security to show that they were unaware of the dubious nature of the security sold, and allowed buyers to sue in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction.|$|E

500|$|A formal {{indictment}} {{was brought}} forward on 5 March, charging the five with {{the killing of}} 50 civilians in GospiÄ‡ and Karlobag. The case was tried in Rijeka County Court, and included the testimony of 120 witnesses in the Rijeka court, 18 survivors of the 1991 attacks in GospiÄ‡ who testified in Belgrade, and two Croatian nationals who fled to Germany fearing for their own safety. One of these two, surnamed Ropac, refused to testify because he distrusted government assurances regarding his safety. In March 2003, the Court found the defendants guilty; OreÅ¡koviÄ‡ was sentenced to 15 years in prison, while Norac received a sentence of 12 years in prison. GrandiÄ‡ was imprisoned for a term of 10 years. RoÅ¾iÄ‡ and ÄŒaniÄ‡ were acquitted {{due to lack of}} evidence against them. The case was ultimately appealed all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court of Croatia in 2004, which upheld the first-instance convictions of OreÅ¡koviÄ‡, Norac and GrandiÄ‡, as well as the acquittals of RoÅ¾iÄ‡ and ÄŒaniÄ‡. A BBC News analysis claimed the trials indicated a willingness {{on the part of the}} Croatian government to deal with war crimes committed by its nationals, following a long period of inactivity described by Rijeka County Court judge Ika Å ariÄ‡ as a [...] "conspiracy of silence".|$|E
500|$|On 15 June, Aruban and Peruvian {{authorities}} {{announced that}} they would cooperate in their respective cases involving Van der Sloot. Aruban investigators expected {{to be able to}} interview Van der Sloot in Peru in August, after Peruvian authorities had completed their investigation.

Van der Sloot {{filed a complaint with the}} National Police of Peru, accusing chief detective Miguel Angel Canlla Ore of misconduct. He also claimed that his laptop had been improperly searched. Van der Sloot's defense counsel filed a motion of habeas corpus disputing the legality of his detention and to nullify statements he gave to police, but the motion was declared [...] "" [...] by Superior Court Judge Wilder Casique Alvizuri on 25 June. The judge upheld all three depositions given by Van der Sloot to police and stated that the defendant's laptop was sealed by the court.

500|$|At a {{time when}} women had trouble finding work and workers were often oppressed, Boyce felt their rights were important: his {{businesses}} employed many women and he supported labor unions. His newspapers often carried stories about the [...] "nobility of labor". His businesses were able to pay out wages and benefits during the Panic of 1893, {{a time when}} many businesses were laying off workers and cutting wages. During the Pullman Strike of the Pullman Palace Car Company in 1894, which spread to 20 companies in over half the states, Boyce called Eugene V. Debs, the socialist labor national leader of the American Railway Union, a [...] "great labor leader" [...] and industrialist George Pullman, inventor of the railroad passenger and sleeping car, the man [...] "who caused all the trouble" [...] (then current labor and social/political strife of the 1890s). In 1901 when the Boyce Paper Manufacturing Company in Marseilles, Illinois, burned down, he paid the workers immediately and then hired them back as construction workers to rebuild the paper mill so they would not lose income. Yet, he was also protective of his money. In late 1894, when two of his workers were injured by a fallen smokestack and won $2,000 each in a court judgment, Boyce appealed the case all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court of Illinois, and lost. He was also persistent in getting what he wanted; in 1902, he sued the Marseilles Land and Power Company for not supplying enough water power to his mills and won a $65,300 judgment. By 1903, the Marseilles Land and Power Company fell into receivership and Boyce bought the company up.|$|E
