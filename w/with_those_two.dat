5|$|As {{the freeway}} passes from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains, I-70 enters the Denver {{metropolitan}} area, {{part of a}} larger urban area called the Front Range Urban Corridor. The freeway arcs around the northern edge of the LoDo district, the common name of the lower downtown area of Denver. Through the downtown area, US40 is routed along Colfax Avenue, which served as the primary east–west artery through the Denver area before the construction of I-70. Through downtown, US6 is routed along 6th Avenue before departing the I-70 corridor to join Interstate76 on a northeast course toward Nebraska. The freeway meets Interstate25 in an interchange frequently called the Mousetrap. From I-25 on to I-225, I-70 serves—together <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> Interstates—as part of an inner beltway around Denver.|$|E
5|$|Aruba is a {{small island}} colony of 100,000 people {{that is part of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and has been under Dutch control since the 1630s. The island lies in the {{southern}} Caribbean Sea just to north of Venezuela, and is near to the Dutch colonies of Curaçao and Bonaire. The colony originally was part of an autonomous union <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> islands in what was known as the Netherlands Antilles, but Aruba seceded from that union in 1986. The Netherlands continues to regulate all its foreign affairs. While the first Dutch Antilean delegation to the Olympics was sent during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, the first uniquely Aruban delegation participated two years after the island's secession from the Netherlands Antilles at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Between then and the 2004 Athens Olympics, Aruba had sent a delegation to all five Summer Olympic games. The most substantial Aruban delegation was in 1988, when it included eight athletes. This delegation included more women and encompassed more sports than any Aruban delegation since then (including the Athens Olympics).|$|E

25|$|Compound {{heterozygosity}} {{in medical}} genetics is {{the condition of}} having two heterogeneous recessive alleles at a particular locus that can cause genetic disease in a heterozygous state. That is, an organism is a compound heterozygote when it has two recessive alleles for the same gene, but <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> alleles being {{different from each other}} (for example, both alleles might be mutated but at different locations). Compound heterozygosity reflects the diversity of the mutation base for many autosomal recessive genetic disorders; mutations in most disease-causing genes have arisen many times. This means that many cases of disease arise in individuals who have two unrelated alleles, who technically are heterozygotes, but both the alleles are defective.|$|E

500|$|Multi-color {{cards were}} {{introduced}} in the [...] set and typically use a gold frame to distinguish them from mono-color cards. These cards require mana from two or more different colors to be played and count as belonging {{to each of the}} colors used to play them. Multi-color cards typically combine the philosophy and mechanics of all the colors used in the spell's cost, and tend to be proportionally more powerful compared to single-color or hybrid cards, as requiring multiple colors of mana makes them harder to cast. More recently, two-color [...] "hybrid" [...] cards {{were introduced in}} the [...] set, and appeared extensively throughout the Shadowmoor and [...] sets. Hybrid cards are distinguished by a gradient frame <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> colors, and can be paid with either of the card's colors; for instance, a card with two hybrid-red/white icons can be cast using two red mana, two white mana, or one of each. Several sets have made multi-colored cards a theme, including Invasion, Shards of Alara, both Ravnica blocks and others. Core sets do not typically include multi-color cards in them, although the Core 2013 set was the first to do so.|$|E
