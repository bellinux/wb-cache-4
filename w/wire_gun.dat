5000|$|Dodds has prophetic dreams {{which come}} to him as cryptic, {{ambiguous}} visions of crimes. Originally of unexplained origin, these dreams were later ascribed to encounter between Dodds and the entity known as Dream via retcon. The visions haunt Wes, who uses his keen intellect and amateur detective skills to properly interpret them. He is also a talented chemist and inventor, creating the sand-like substance and the Silicoid Gun ultimately responsible for transforming Sandy the Golden Boy into a Silicon-based life-form. In {{the early years of}} his career, Wesley Dodds possesses the strength level of a man who engages in regular exercise, and was a fine hand-to-hand combatant. As he grows older, his strength level diminishes in relative proportion to his age. As hobbies, Wes enjoys reading, writing, poetry, origami and philosophy. Through an unknown process, Wes passes his power of prophetic visions on to his former ward, Sanderson Hawkins upon the moment of his own death. Wesley Dodds' costume consists of a basic green business suit, fedora, a World War I era gas mask, a gas gun, and a <b>wire</b> <b>gun.</b> The gas mask protects Dodds from the effects of the gas emitted from his gas gun. The gas gun, a handheld device fitted with cartridges containing concentrated sleeping gas, is Wesley Dodds' only known weapon. Pressing the trigger on the gun releases a cloud of green dust rendering all within the Sandman's immediate vicinity unconscious. An upgraded canister dispenser for the gun is provided for him by his close friend and confidante, Lee Travis. Wes is also known to conceal smaller knockout gas capsules in a hollow heel on his shoe. These prove ideal when placed in situations where his gas gun is not readily available. He also makes use of a specially designed [...] "wirepoon" [...] gun, which fires a length of thin, steel cable.|$|E

40|$|The sprayform tooling {{process is}} a new method for the economic, rapid {{manufacture}} of hard steel production tooling. A robot-manipulated cluster of electric arc spray guns is scanned over a disposable negative ceramic replica of the tool, depositing a molten steel droplet spray and forming a shell of several centimetres thickness. After spraying, the ceramic is removed and the remaining thick steel shell is trimmed, backed and then used in press forming and other production operations. The shell temperature during manufacture must be carefully controlled to produce shells of low or zero distortion. The shell temperature depends on the balance between {{the rate of heat}} input from the sprayed metal, the rate of heat output by convection to the N 2 atomising gas, and other heat transfer mechanisms. The sprayform process mass yield and the spray shell microstructure are further controlled by the angle at which the steel droplets deposit onto the growing shell surface. This paper describes the development of two new multiple arc <b>wire</b> <b>gun</b> cluster configurations, which are aimed to optimise the manufacture of: (i) relatively large shells and (ii) smaller shells but with severe topography. A mass deposition and subsequent heat flow model for the sprayform tool process have been combined with experimental measurements of critical process parameters, such as the shell surface heat transfer coefficient distribution, to investigate the effect of the electric arc spray gun cluster design on process yield and shell thermal distributions during the manufacture of thick sprayformed shells...|$|E
40|$|Marshall Space Flight Center s (MSFC) Impact Testing Facility (ITF) {{serves as}} an {{important}} installation for space and missile related materials science research. The ITF was established and began its research in spacecraft debris shielding in the early 1960 s, then {{played a major role}} in the International Space Station debris shield development. As NASA became more interested in launch debris and in-flight impact concerns, the ITF grew to include research in a variety of impact genres. Collaborative partnerships with the DoD led to a wider range of impact capabilities being relocated to MSFC as a result of the closure of Particle Impact Facilities in Santa Barbara, California. The Particle Impact Facility had a 30 year history in providing evaluations of aerospace materials and components during flights through rain, ice, and solid particle environments at subsonic through hypersonic velocities. The facility s unique capabilities were deemed a "National Asset" by the DoD. The ITF now has capabilities including environmental, ballistic, and hypervelocity impact testing utilizing an array of air, powder, and two-stage light gas guns to accommodate a variety of projectile and target types and sizes. Numerous upgrades including new instrumentation, triggering circuitry, high speed photography, and optimized sabot designs have been implemented.

40|$|The {{problem of}} spin-dependent {{transport}} of electrons through a finite array of quantum dots attached to 1 D quantum <b>wire</b> (spin <b>gun)</b> for various semiconductor materials is studied. Unlike the model considered in [1] a model proposed here {{is based on}} the extension theory model (ETM) and assumes the quantum dots to have an arbitrary internal structure, i. e. the internal energy levels. The presence of internal structure in quantum dots results in energy-dependent interaction between electrons and quantum dots. This interaction changes the transmission mode of the spin current through the spin gun. For the energy-dependent interaction it is shown in this article the difference of transmission probabilities for singlet and triplet channels for several quantum dots in the array due to interference effects can reach approximately 100 % percent for some energy intervals. For the same energy intervals the conductance of the device reaches the value in units. As a result a model of the spin-gun which transforms the spin unpolarized electron beam into completely polarized one is suggested. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
