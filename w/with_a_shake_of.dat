25|$|On 16 February 2009, J. D. Fortune told Entertainment Tonight Canada that INXS had {{let him go}} {{from the}} band <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the hand at an airport in Hong Kong.|$|E
2500|$|The umpire's {{response}} is either {{to raise his}} index finger above his head {{to indicate that the}} batsman is out, or to clearly say [...] "not out", which is usually accompanied <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head. (See [...] ). The 'out' signal is the only signal that if indicated by the striker's end umpire, does not require confirmation by the bowler's end umpire.|$|E
2500|$|Calling {{the game}} {{refers to the}} act of {{catchers}} to decide the type of pitch delivered to home plate. Catchers comprise {{a high percentage of}} baseball managers. [...] 15 of 30 Major League Baseball managers were former catchers. Because the catcher is considered a captain on the field (and some, such as Thurman Munson and Jason Varitek were in fact team captains), he is often in charge of planning defensive plays. The catcher will give signs to the pitcher for what pitch is to be thrown. The majority of the time it is done through a number system. Each number will represent a different pitch, and then the pitcher can either agree or disagree <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> his or her head. These signals get more complicated when a runner is on second base, because the runner's vantage point when he takes his lead gives him a direct view of the catcher's hand and a simple signal can be relayed by the runner to the batter. Signals are not always done by the number system. Varitek was known for giving signals by touching certain parts of his chest protector.|$|E
60|$|And that {{astonished}} mariner, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> helpless <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> his head, gave it up.|$|R
60|$|Katie {{looked at}} him anxiously. He {{returned}} the look <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sombre <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Osborne, when he {{was left}} alone, stood {{for a few moments}} on the spot, and then <b>with</b> <b>a</b> whistle, <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head, and a little low chuckle of laughter, rejoined the crowd.|$|R
60|$|And <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> his weather-beaten face, Tony Dibble {{started off}} for the Ridgerow House.|$|E
60|$|Dick got up quickly, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> head {{to shake}} the vision from his eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{smiled as}} she spoke, and glanced at his darkened skin <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head.|$|E
60|$|She resented his {{laughing}} at her, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> obstinate <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> her head, and an angry knitting of her pretty eyebrows.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a great}} {{breach of}} {{customary}} procedure," [...] said Mr. Thomas Bromley, the Solicitor-General, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dubious <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very far--very far," [...] the Baroness replied, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> graceful <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> her head--a <b>shake</b> {{that might}} have meant many {{different}} things.|$|R
60|$|Hennessy's arrival {{shut off}} further interrogation. His {{examination}} was scarcely less brief than Dick's. He looked up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Macklin {{tried to}} remove him once before," [...] {{returned}} Allen, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> his head. [...] "That boy beats all for shrewdness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The poet's granddaughter!" [...] Mrs. Seal repeated, half to herself, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> her head, {{as if that}} {{explained}} what was otherwise inexplicable.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Torkingham was slower in {{recognizing}} the astronomer, {{but in a}} moment had greeted him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> warm <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "That won't do, Mrs. Hubbard," [...] said Atherton, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{compassionate}} <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head. [...] "You can't go {{on living}} there alone." ...|$|R
60|$|The captain {{looked up}} at the thick stem <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{doubtful}} expression, and then turned to Hendrick <b>with</b> <b>a</b> nautical <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head.|$|R
6000|$|The boy {{showed his}} white teeth {{in a bright}} smile as he stood beside the children, while Becky croaked, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Chop this fella tree; chop that fella tree," [...] he {{told his}} blacks. [...] "No chop that other fella," [...] he said, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> head.|$|E
6000|$|... “You {{will have}} it to be Happar, I see, my dear fellow; pray Heaven, you may not find {{yourself}} deceived,” observed I, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> my head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Couldn't allow 'im burial in our ashpit," [...] {{replied the}} stoker, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> decided <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head; [...] "altogether {{out of the}} question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sandy," [...] said he, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disapproving <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head, [...] "you oughtn't to go an' speak {{like that}} of your hadopted nation." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>with</b> <b>a</b> courteous <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the hand, stately {{as though}} he were a bishop in canonicals, Arnold Jackson took leave of his guest.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know all}} that," [...] replied Fred, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> his head; [...] "but think of yon brig {{that we saw}} go down in about ten minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that depends," [...] said Sam, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head. [...] "Islands in the China seas are {{not always}} places of refuge--at least for honest people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That, {{for your}} impudence," [...] he snarled. [...] "You keep a civil tongue in your head. If you don't --" [...] He {{finished}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> his fist.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{foolish to}} carry it loose. Any one could take it from you," [...] said the cabin boy, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> knowing <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! ha! Ha! ha! ha!" [...] laughed Miss Todd, with terrible loudness, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>of</b> her sides, {{throwing}} herself {{backwards and}} forwards {{in the corner}} of her sofa. It was not civil, and so Sir Lionel felt. When you first call your lady-love by her Christian name, you do not like to have the little liberty made a subject of ridicule--you feel it by far less if the matter be taken up seriously against you as a crime on your part.|$|R
6000|$|... "Buggy-house," [...] he {{answered}} promptly, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disgusted <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head. [...] "Too much buggy-house. All crazy. You see. No good. Rotten. Down to hell." ...|$|R
60|$|With this courteous speech it {{extended}} a card toward the Scarecrow, who accepted it, {{turned it over}} and over, and handed it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> his head to Tip.|$|E
6000|$|Back to Paula, Graham {{stepped aside}} as Dick, on his knees, bent over her. His {{examination}} was brief. He {{looked up at}} Graham <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Devilish low trick!' {{repeated}} Lord Wetherby, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head. 'Laws of hospitality--eaten our {{bread and}} salt, what!--all {{that sort of}} thing--kill valuable monkey--not done, you know--low, very low!' ...|$|E
60|$|For a moment, Minty seemed {{struck with}} her father's {{original}} theory. But <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vigorous <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> her shoulders she threw it off. Her eyes darkened.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{not pretty}} to laugh in that way, Doctor Grim," [...] said little Elsie, looking into his face, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grave <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> her head.|$|R
6000|$|... "They couldn't {{have seen}} the firelight," [...] {{returned}} Dick, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sorry <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> his head. [...] "It beats all where they went to, doesn't it?" ...|$|R
