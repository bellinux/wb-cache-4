40|$|An alloy of {{cast iron}} and copper (Fe-Cu) has been {{developed}} using a stir cast process. The compo-sitional, microstructural characterization and wear property of the developed Fe-Cu alloy were carried out <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aids</b> <b>of</b> X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and pin on Disc machine. The mechanical properties such as hardness and impact energy were investigated. Wear linear equations were generated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aids</b> <b>of</b> MATLAB linear fitting. The results revealed {{that the presence of}} copper (99 % pure) in the melt of grey cast iron inhibited the formation of cementite. However, the impact energy of the grey cast iron increased with %weight (wt) of cop-per addition. Hence, the hardness and wear resistance of the developed Fe-Cu alloy were sacri-ficed. Hence, the developed Fe-Cu alloy is an excellent material which can be used in the vibration damping application especially in the shock absorber...|$|R
