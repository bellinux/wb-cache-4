40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Environmental Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Host {{recognition}} behaviour of two braconid larval parasitoids Cotesia sesamiae and Cotesia flavipes was studied using suitable stemborer hosts [i. e. Busseola fusca for C. sesamiae, and Chilo partellus for C. flavipes] and one non-host [Eldana saccharina]. The wasps displayed similar {{sequences of}} behavioural steps when locating their hosts largely {{depending on their}} antennae for host recognition and both antennae and tarsi for final host acceptance and oviposition. Tactile and contact chemoreception stimuli from the hosts seem {{to play a major}} role in oviposition decision by the parasitoids. In addition, the external morphology and distribution pattern of sensilla present on antennae, tarsi and ovipositor of the parasitoids were examined by scanning electron and optic microscopy after staining with silver nitrate. Three sensillar types were identified on the distal antennomeres: (i) non-porous sensilla trichoidea most probably involved in mechanoreception, (ii) uniporous sensilla chaetica likely to be gustatory and, (iii) multiporous sensilla placodea likely to be olfactory. The tarsi possess a few sensilla chaetica which could be gustatory while the manubrium is likely to be used in detection of vibrations. The distal end of the ovipositor bears numerous multiporous dome-shaped sensilla. Additionally, the ability of the wasps to discriminate between contact cues was studied. When host larvae were washed in distilled water the wasps did not insert their ovipositors. However, ovipositor insertion resumed when washed host or non-host larvae were painted with water extracts of their respective host larvae. The water extracts of the suitable hosts were more attractive to the wasps than those of non-hosts. Similarly, the frass is important in host recognition during short-range examination as those of respective hosts are more intensely antennated than of non-hosts. The parasitoids were able to discriminate the regurgitant of E. saccharina by not antennating the cotton <b>wool</b> <b>ball</b> of this host; while the regurgitant of B. fusca and C. partellus appeared not useful in discriminating between the two species for both parasitoid species. Further analysis suggests the presence of a protein(s) component(s) in the regurgitant possibly responsible for host recognition and oviposition by C. flavipes. Doctora...|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Mark II" [...] "microbombs" [...] had Casio digital {{watches as}} the timers, {{stabilizers}} that looked like cotton <b>wool</b> <b>balls,</b> and an undetectable quantity of nitroglycerin as the explosive. Other ingredients included glycerin, nitrate, sulfuric acid, and minute concentrations of nitrobenzene, silver azide (silver trinitride), and liquid acetone. Two 9-volt batteries in each bomb were used as a power source. The batteries would be connected to light bulb filaments that would detonate the bomb. Murad and Yousef wired an SCR (silicon controlled rectifier) as the switch to trigger the filaments to detonate the bomb. There was an external socket hidden when the wires were pushed under the watch base as the bomber would wear it. The alteration was so small that the watch could still be worn in a normal manner.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{metabolic}} profiling pipelines {{have been}} developed to characterize the composition of human biofluids and tissues, the vast majority of these being for studies in adults. To accommodate limited sample volume and {{to take into account the}} compositional differences between adult and infant biofluids, we developed and optimized sample handling and analytical procedures for studying urine from newborns. A robust pipeline for metabolic profiling using NMR spectroscopy was established, encompassing sample collection, preparation, spectroscopic measurement and computational analysis. Longitudinal samples were collected from five infants from birth until 14 months of age. Methods of extraction, effects of freezing and sample dilution were assessed and urinary contaminants from breakdown of polymers in a range of diapers and cotton <b>wool</b> <b>balls</b> were identified and compared, including propylene glycol, acrylic acid and tert-butanol. Finally, assessment of urinary profiles obtained over the first few weeks of life revealed a dramatic change in composition, with concentrations of phenols, amino acids and betaine altering systematically over the first few months of life. Therefore, neonatal samples require more stringent standardization of experimental design, sample handling and analysis compared to adult samples in order to accommodate the variability and limited sample volume...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} the congeneric braconid parasitoids Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron) and Cotesia flavipes Cameron to {{discriminate}} between stemborer larval cues upon contact was studied using their natural hosts, namely the noctuid Busseola fusca (Fuller) and the crambid Chilo partellus (Swinhoe), respectively, and the pyralid non-host Eldana saccharina (Walker). When the natural host larvae were washed in distilled water, parasitoid behavior {{was similar to that}} displayed when in contact with E. saccharina, characterized by the absence of ovipositor insertion. When washed host or non-host larvae were bathed with water extracts of their natural host, the parasitoids showed a significant increase in ovipositor insertions. However, the water extracts of host-larvae deposited on cotton <b>wool</b> <b>balls</b> did not induce ovipositor insertion in either C. sesamiae or C. flavipes. Nevertheless, the extracts enabled the parasitoids to discriminate between natural and non-hosts as indicated by the intensive antennating of the former. For both parasitoids, frass was found to be important in short-range host recognition as indicated by differences in the time spent on antennating between frass sources. In addition, the regurgitants of B. fusca and C. partellus induced ovipositor insertion in C. flavipes only. These results indicated that C. sesamiae and C. flavipes used different chemical cues for acceptation and oviposition in a stemborer larva, and that B. fusca and C. partellus shared the same chemical cues to induce oviposition in C. flavipes...|$|R
40|$|Fröbel's first gift is 6 cm's balls, and {{it makes}} by <b>wool.</b> The <b>ball</b> is {{situated}} the first of all gifts and at the first time of infancy. Fröbel arranged these conditions by his own observation of infants. But, Fröbel's first gift (ball) had been criticised by Dewey,J. that his gifts have own contradiction in his thought, that the systematic order of gifts disregard creative self-action of infants. This treatise aims to produce counterevidence the criticism by some experiments. I investigated term, weight, size, hardness of the first gift. And as a result, {{we understand that the}} term is 12 - 23 monthes, the weight do not have to stipulate, the size is fond of 6 cm, the hardness is selected the soft one. So, I have a disproof toward Dewey's criticism. Fröbel's gifts are based on the essence and the development of infants. The systematic order of gifts do not disregard the creative self-action of infants. Fröbel's gifts and his systematic order are showing us the eternal avail over the time and the nation...|$|R

5000|$|In 2005, Le Va's {{work was}} the subject of a major {{retrospective}} exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (ICA). The exhibition, [...] "Accumulated Vision, Barry Le Va," [...] was accompanied by the publication of a comprehensive monograph of the artist's work. The ICA described Le Va's work as: [...] "Since the late 1960s, the American artist Barry Le Va has used broken glass, meat cleavers, <b>wool</b> felt, <b>ball</b> bearings, powdered chalk, cast concrete, paper towels, linseed oil, a typewriter and a gun, among other things, to make his art. Part of a generation intent on knocking art off its pedestal, Le Va claimed the floor as his field of operations by scattering massive amounts of materials, or forms, to create works which he called [...] "distributions." [...] Apparently random, even chaotic, these installations are in fact premeditated and executed according to plan. Not surprisingly, drawing plays a significant role in the work of this artist whose formative training is in architecture. Le Va's distributions make him one of the leading practitioners of Post-minimalism and Process Art. But his own, preferred frame of reference comes not from recent art history, but from mystery novels. He has likened his installations to crime scenes and invites viewers to look for clues to reconstruct the, often violent, act or concept that underlies them." ...|$|R
