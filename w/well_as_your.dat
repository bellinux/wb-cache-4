[...] Ilene Strizver, {{founder of the}} Type Studio, says, [...] "Forget about tolerating differences of opinion: typographically speaking, typing two spaces {{before the start of}} a new sentence is absolutely, unequivocally wrong." [...] The Complete Manual on Typography (2003) states that [...] "The typewriter tradition of separating sentences with two word spaces after a period has no place in typesetting" [...] and the single space is [...] "standard typographic practice". [...] The Elements of Typographic Style (2004) advocates a single space between sentences, noting that [...] "your typing as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>your</b> typesetting will benefit from unlearning this quaint [...] Victorian habit".|$|E
500|$|... "Glassheart" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a dubstep, dance, house and grime song that runs for 3:56 (three minutes, 56 seconds). According to Jenna Hally Rubenstein for MTV Buzzworthy, the song consists of a [...] "grimy, hazy beat", which she compared to [...] "Too Close" [...] (The Lateness of the Hour, 2011), a song performed by Alex Clare. Lyrically, the song is about Lewis' fear that her lover will break her heart. According to Lewis, the song is about protecting yourself, your heart, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>your</b> emotions. She continued to describe the song as [...] "poignant". The singer went on to reveal that she decided to name the album after the song. Lewis' [...] "crisp" [...] vocals can be heard above the instrumentation as she [...] "croons about the fragility of her heart" [...] as she performs the chorus lines [...] "So baby if you love me/ Let me know/ 'Cause everything hurts just like before/ You're about to tear this heart apart/ I love you like a glass heart." [...] The chorus is built on a [...] "transcendent house beat" [...] as Lewis delicately sings the lines [...] "Promise that we'll never fall apart/ And I'll love you with my Glassheart". The chorus is then followed by a [...] "euphoric instrumentation [...] collapses into a grimy dubstep break." [...] Rubenstein likened the lyrics to those performed by Blondie on her song [...] "Heart of Glass" [...] (Parallel Lines, 1978).|$|E

500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>your</b> own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E

They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>your</b> own.

2500|$|The text of Henry's speech first {{appeared}} in print in Wirt's 1817 biography, published 18 years after Patrick Henry's death. Wirt corresponded with men who had heard the speech and others who were acquainted with {{people who were there}} at the time. All agreed that the speech had produced a profound effect, but it seems that only one person attempted to render an actual text. Judge St. George Tucker, who had been present for the speech, gave Wirt his recollections and Wirt wrote back stating that [...] "I have taken almost entirely Mr. Henry's speech in the Convention of '75 from you, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>your</b> description of its effect on your verbatim."

2500|$|Gardner depicts Mason as {{a lawyer}} who fights hard {{on behalf of his}} clients and who enjoys unusual, {{difficult}} or nearly-hopeless cases. [...] He frequently accepts clients on a whim based on his curiosity about their problem, for a minimal retainer, and finances the investigation of their cases himself if necessary. In The Case of the Caretaker's Cat (1935), his principal antagonist, District Attorney Hamilton Burger, says: [...] "You're a better detective than you are a lawyer. [...] When you turn your mind to the solution of a crime, you ferret out the truth." [...] And in The Case of the Moth-Eaten Mink (1952), a judge who has just witnessed one of the lawyer's unusual tactics says: [...] "Mr. Mason...from time to time you seem to find yourself in predicaments from which you extricate yourself by unusual methods which invariably turn out to be legally sound. [...] The Court feels you are fully capable of looking after your own as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>your</b> clients' interests." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other gifts {{were also}} given to his neighbours. Among these was one to Chartres, of which its bishop wrote: [...] "When {{we saw the}} gift that you sent us, we were amazed at your {{knowledge}} as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>your</b> faithâ€¦ since you, whom we had heard to be a pagan prince, we now know {{to be not only}} a Christian, but also a most generous donor to God's churches and servants". He is known to have sent a psalter and sacramentary made in Peterborough (famous for its illustrations) to Cologne, and a book written in gold, among other gifts, to William the Great of Aquitaine. This golden book was apparently to support Aquitanian claims of St Martial, patron saint of Aquitaine, as an apostle. Of some consequence, its recipient was an avid artisan, scholar and devout Christian, and the Abbey of Saint-Martial was a great library and scriptorium, second only to the one at Cluny. It is likely that Cnut's gifts were well beyond anything we can now know.|$|E

2500|$|In his Octavius, Marcus Minucius Felix(? â€” c. 250AD, Rome), {{responding}} to the pagan jibe that Christians worship wooden crosses â€“ {{an indication of how}} the cross symbol was already associated with Christians â€“ denies the charge and then retorts that the cross shape (a crossbeam placed on an upright) is honoured even by pagans in the form of their standards and trophies and is in any case found in nature: [...] "Crosses, moreover, we neither worship nor wish for. You, indeed, who consecrate gods of wood, adore wooden crosses perhaps as parts of your gods. For your very standards, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>your</b> banners; and flags of your camp, what else are they but crosses gilded and adorned? Your victorious trophies not only imitate the appearance of a simple cross, but also that of a man affixed to it. We assuredly see the sign of a cross, naturally, in the ship when it is carried along with swelling sails, when it glides forward with expanded oars; and when the military yoke is lifted up, it is the sign of a cross; and when a man adores God with a pure mind, with hands outstretched. Thus {{the sign of the cross}} either is sustained by a natural reason, or your own religion is formed with respect to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In her {{well-known}} article [...] "A Defense of Abortion", Judith Jarvis Thomson {{argues that}} abortion is in some circumstances permissible even if the embryo is a person and {{has a right to}} life, because the embryo's right to life is overtrumped by the woman's right to control her body and its life-support functions. [...] Her central argument involves a thought experiment. [...] Imagine, Thomson says, that you wake up in bed next to a famous violinist. [...] He is unconscious with a fatal kidney ailment; and because only you happen to have the right blood type to help, the Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you and plugged your circulatory system into his so that your kidneys can filter poisons from his blood as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>your</b> own. [...] If he is disconnected from you now, he will die; but in nine months he will recover and can be safely disconnected. [...] Thomson takes it that you may permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will kill him. [...] The right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of somethingthe use of your bodyto which he has no right. [...] Similarly, even if the fetus has a right to life, it does not have a right to use the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions against her will; and so aborting the pregnancy is permissible in at least some circumstances. [...] However, Thomson notes that the woman's right to abortion does not include the right to directly insist upon the death of the child, should the fetus happen to be viable, that is, capable of surviving outside the womb.|$|E
