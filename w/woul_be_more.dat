As an example of international cooperation and of the inter-occurencies of the discourse {{is the case of}} cellulose plants in Uruguay. Discourse analysis involves understanding of historical process, cultural and ideological context in which the analysed texts have been socially constructed. Orlandi(2002) stresses the importance of the contextualization of the political, {{as well as of the}} symbols indicating power relationships, the way meanings become history, and the way the discourses interfers upon actors, society and history. It <b>woul</b> <b>be,</b> for that author, an appropriate way to unveil the mechanisms of power and domination, for instance, within language...|$|R

The Wolverines would return the favor {{on their first}} drive on a Joe Callahan 66 yard touchdown pass to Jamar Baynard. Charlotte quarterback Lee McNeill would fumble on the next drive on a sack by Amir Petrose, which would be recovered by the Wolverines's Roderick Caine. This would set up a Joe Callahan 9 yard touchdown pass to Bryce Slade to give the Wolverines their first lead. Later in the quarter Joe Callahan's pass <b>woul</b> <b>be</b> intercepted by Charlotte's Desmond Cooper. This would lead four plays later to Kaliff Phillip's second rushing Touchdown of the quarter, from 10 yards away; the first quarter would end tied at 14 all.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a lightweight and low-power sensor to measure energetic ions from solar, galactic, and heliospheric sources. This sensor {{is based on}} the Low Energy Telescopes (LETs) carried by the Voyager spacecraft as part of the Cosmic Ray Subsystem. The energy range of the particles detected can be adjusted by altering the detector thicknesses, but the nominal Voyager LET responds to all nuclei from protons· through nickel (Z = l to 28) over energy ranges of 0. 5 to 8 Me V for protons and 5 to 30 Me V /nucleon for iron. We also discuss the characteristics of the electronics required to support the sensor. The analog electronics would consist of custom VLSI circuits of low mass and low power. The digital electronics would require an Actel gate array and a microprocessor. The detectors would require biases up to 100 V. Assuming that low voltages <b>woul</b> 4 <b>be</b> supplied from a common supply on the spacecraft that services all instruments, the total weight and power of such a system is 250 g and 400 mW...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{proposals}} for transforming {{the system of}} de velopment assistance and especially in relation to middle income countries are manifold. The idea of cutting assistance to middle income countries gained ground parallel with the ques tioning of the rationale to use only per capita income as an eligibility criterion for assis tance. LMICs 3 {{have much in common}} with LDCs but the operation and structure of their domestic ec onomy and politics may be significantly different. My proposal is not to disregard middle income countries as potential targets of development assistance as a whole; rather my study ar gues that focus should be placed on lower-middle-income economies. The LMIC strategy <b>woul</b> d <b>be</b> different from the one that targets the least developed countries. I tend to coi n this policy with the term of “convergence assistance” – an innovative allocation and spending m echanism. Convergence means the reduction of internal disparities and the elimination of the dual structure of these economies. Against this backdrop successful adaptation of develop ment banking models of developing and advanced economies can support the establishment of a n economic incentive system based on efficiency requirements coupled with concentration, expertise, the knowledge of the local market and people. By incorporating the best practic es of microfinance institutions from the developing world and those of the institutions with th e objective of economic inclusion in advanced countries, a development bank may be a good ch oice in LMICs. This institution ideally may function as a window for all development or conve rgence financing independently from their origin and nature. The proposal is not meant t o prefer LMICs to LDCs but a pilot project <b>is</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> feasible in their case...|$|R

40|$|There are {{two options}} for the {{management}} of crops in water l imi t ing environments: the agronomic and the genetic management. Wi t h the genetic management option droughttolerant varieties, once developed, would be a low economic input technology that <b>woul</b> d <b>be</b> readily acceptable to resource-poor, rainfed, small land holding farmers. Development of this genetic management technology requires robust, reproducible, simple, and rapid f ield, pot, and laboratory screening methods for identification of traits of drought tolerance in germplasm, and incorporation of the same in high-yielding varieties using conventional and biotechnological tools. Scientists working in various national and international crop drought research programs use different methods of screening appropriate to the crops on which they work, and keeping in view their target drought environment. This workshop focused on the methods used in different cereal (including rice) and legume crops. The rationale for the use of various methods and their advantages and disadvantages (if any) were discussed. Papers contributed by the participants, either as ful l papers or only abstracts of their paper, are included in this book. An overview and synthesis of the workshop and crop drought research in general is presented in the final chapter of the book...|$|R
