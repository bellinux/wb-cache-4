5000|$|One {{barrier to}} the {{production}} of ethanol from biomass is that the sugars necessary for fermentation are trapped inside the lignocellulose. Lignocellulose has evolved to resist degradation and to confer hydrolytic stability and structural robustness to the cell walls of the plants. This robustness or [...] "recalcitrance" [...] is attributable to the crosslinking between the polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose) and the lignin via ester and ether linkages. Ester linkages arise between oxidized sugars, the uronic acids, and the phenols and phenylpropanols functionalities of the lignin. To extract the fermentable sugars, one must first disconnect the celluloses from the lignin, and then use acid or enzymatic methods to hydrolyze the newly freed celluloses to break them down into simple monosaccharides. Another challenge to biomass fermentation is the high percentage of pentoses in the hemicellulose, such as xylose, or <b>wood</b> <b>sugar.</b> Unlike hexoses such as glucose, pentoses are difficult to ferment. The problems presented by the lignin and hemicellulose fractions are the foci of much contemporary research.|$|E

Here, we generated four Synechocystis strains that heterologously expressed XylAB enzymes, which mediate xylose catabolism, either in combination with or without one of three xylose transporters, namely XylE, GalP, or Glf. Except for glf, which is derived from the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis ZM 4, the heterologous genes were sourced from Escherichia coli K- 12. All of the recombinant strains were able to utilize xylose in the absence of catabolite repression. When xylose was the lone source of organic carbon, strains possessing the XylE and Glf transporters were most efficient in terms of dry biomass production and xylose consumption and the strain lacking a heterologous transporter was the least efficient. However, {{in the presence of a}} xylose-glucose mixed sugar source, the strains exhibited similar levels of growth and xylose consumption. This study demonstrates that various bacterial xylose transporters can boost xylose catabolism in transgenic Synechocystis strains, and paves the way for the sustainable production of bio-compounds and green fuels from lignocellulosic biomass...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 A {{series of}} log storage {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine whether leachates derived from water storage of logs are acutely toxic to fish. Log segments approximately 18 inches long and 16 inches in diameter were stored in tanks and held submerged {{for a period of}} 7 days. The holding water containing leached materials was made toxic with mercury to retard biological decomposition of the leached substances. Mercury was selectively removed from leachate samples by chelation prior to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and bioassay testing. Trout and salmon fry were subjected to the leachate water in short term acute bioassay tests. Results are reported as a median tolerance limit, (TLm), i. e., the concentration of leachate at which 50 percent of the test fish died for any given exposure time. Leachates were also tested for BOD₅, BOD k-rate, chemical oxygen demand (COD), <b>wood</b> <b>sugar</b> and Pearl Benson Index (PBI). Test results show that leachates from Douglas fir stored in fresh water exert a slight acute toxicity to fish. A TLm₉₆ of 20 percent leachate by volume, for a 50 year old Douglas fir log, was the most toxic leachate observed. Leachates from ponderosa pine, hemlock and an older fir log stored under identical conditions produced no measurable acute toxicity. Leachates contained a significant quantity of BOD and PBI exerting substances. The highest BOD₅, (1. 36 g/ft² of submerged surface area) was exerted by leachate from a ponderosa pine log segment stored with bark removed. The highest PBI valve (12. 5 g/ft²), was observed for leachate from a young Douglas fir log segment. BOD:COD ratios and BOD k-rate ranged widely for the various leachates, but were relatively low which indicated a significant fraction of non-biodegradable substances.

40|$|Abstract Background The BioEnergy Science Center (BESC) {{developed}} a high-throughput screening method to rapidly identify low-recalcitrance biomass variants. Because the customary separation {{and analysis of}} liquid and solids between pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis used in conventional analyses is slow, labor-intensive and very difficult to automate, a streamlined approach we term 'co-hydrolysis' was developed. In this method, the solids and liquid in the pretreated biomass slurry are not separated, but instead hydrolysis is performed by adding enzymes to the whole pretreated slurry. The effects of pretreatment method, severity and solids loading on co-hydrolysis performance were investigated. Results For hydrothermal pretreatment at solids concentrations of 0. 5 to 2 %, high enzyme protein loadings of about 100 mg/g of substrate (glucan plus xylan) in the original poplar wood achieved glucose and xylose yields for co-hydrolysis that were comparable with those for washed solids. In addition, although poplar <b>wood</b> <b>sugar</b> yields from co-hydrolysis at 2 % solids concentrations fell short of those from hydrolysis of washed solids after dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment even at high enzyme loadings, pretreatment at 0. 5 % solids concentrations resulted in similar yields {{for all but the}} lowest enzyme loading.

40|$|International audienceThe {{addition}} of biomass to coking blends {{has the potential}} benefits of reducing the amount of expensive coking coals and reducing carbon emissions. However, there is little research in the use of biomass as additive in coking blends. The easily available biomass samples pine <b>wood,</b> <b>sugar</b> beet, and miscanthus have been chosen to study the effect of these additives on the fluidity properties of coal. High-temperature small-amplitude oscillatory-shear (SAOS) rheometry was used to determine the fluidity of the samples as a function of temperature. TGA and solid-state C- 13 NMR were also used to determine the thermal stability and compositional changes in the samples during pyrolysis. Sugar beet can be added in coking blends up to 5 wt % without altering the viscoelastic properties of the coal, whereas pine wood and miscanthus reduce the fluidity even with 2 wt % additions. No solid solid interactions were observed in the blends, but there were differences in viscoelastic behavior that were attributed to gas solid interactions. Fast heating (i. e., 180 degrees C/min) can facilitate the incorporation of pine wood and miscanthus in coking blends. The use of fast heating increases the fluidity of the coal and preserves the fluid material in the biomass at higher temperatures. As a result, the biomass acts as a regulator of fluid material development in the coal, and the viscoelastic properties of the blend are identical to those of prime coking coals. Although fast heating could also be used to produce good coking blends by combining biomass with high volatile matter, high fluidity coals, the amount of biomass required (> 5 wt %) is expected to be detrimental for coke strength...|$|E
40|$|Irregular pagination: missing page 235 This thesis {{reports a}} study of the ethanolic {{fermentation}} of D-xylose and wood hydrolyzate to ethanol by the yeast Pachysolen tannophilus with a view to developing an effective use of renewable hemi-cellulose hydrolysis products from New Zealand forest biomass residues. Initial work briefly addressed the problem of finding a suitable yeast from natural habitats suitable for the fermentation. Soon after that work commenced literature reports suggested that preliminary conversion of pentoses by enzymatic means was a possibility. Consequently, this aspect of conversion was considered and rejected. One reason for this was that literature was drawing attention to the pentose fermenting characteristics of Pachysolen tannophilus. Laboratory scale studies demonstrated the yeast Pachysolen tannophilus to be capable of fermenting the hexose and pentose sugars present in the hydrolyzate. The yeast's specific growth rate in the hydrolyzate could be improved by neutralizing the inhibitory substances with 2 g/l of anhydrous sodium sulphite. Ethanol has an inhibitory effect on growth but can also be readily assimilated by the yeast. Fermentation studied with gyration speeds of 50, 100 and 200 r. p. m. showed that oxygen was a critical parameter affecting growth and ethanol production. Batch fermentation experiments were pursued to examine this oxygen phenomenon more closely. Cell growth, substrate uptake rate and culture pH responded strongly to the supply of oxygen. However, production of ethanol accompanied cell growth only in late "exponential" phase. Fermentation characteristics were established under continuous culture at an aeration rate of 0. 37 l/l. min and values obtained were as follows; maximum specific growth rate, 0. 046 h- 1; biomass yield, 0. 04 g/g; ethanol yield, 0. 17 g/g; Ks value, 13 g/l and Ki values, 0. 5 g/l. A redox potential controlled chemostat study revealed that steady-state culture poised at - 50 mV exhibited a 55 % increased ethanol concentration and 43 % decreased xylitol concentration over the value observed without redox control. With a knowledge or D-xylose fermentation as established in these batch and chemostat experiments, it was possible to consider more detailed aspects of the fermentation which would be applicable to process development. Questions addressed included which strain of Pachysolen tannophilus should be used, what quantity of inoculum was necessary, what interactions existed between fermentation variables. Statistically designed experiments were employed to answer these questions. Empirical models so developed revealed that ethanol yield has a linear relationship with initial substrate concentration. These models have given some insight into how environmental factors affect the ethanolic fermentation by this yeast and have also indicated the optimal conditions required for an effective fermentation of wood pentoses. These important fermentation process variables were established and are expected to be useful in moving the process from laboratory scale as carried out here to a pilot plant scale of operations. The values established were temperature, 28 ° or lower; initial medium pH for ethanol production, 5. 6 to 5. 8; substrate concentration used can be up to 80 g/l of pentoses; minimum inoculum density, 5. 5 g/l dry weight cells and NRRL Y- 2461 was recommended as the best strain to achieve the fermentation. The pre-treatment of the prehydrolyzate by 2 g/l of anhydrous sodium sulphite was highly desirable in order to enhance growth and fermentation rates. The research has shown that Pachysolen tannophilus is capable of fermenting pentose fraction of wood hydrolyzate and that the optimal conditions for this fermentation will lead to significant utilization of <b>wood</b> <b>sugar.</b> However, in the completely mixed reactor systems used in these experiments, the ethanol yields obtained were not as attractive as those observed for hexose fermentations under similar conditions. This, it is felt, points to the greater difficulty the yeast experiences in fermenting pentoses and it also suggests the need to investigate the value of other reactor formats at seme future date...|$|E
