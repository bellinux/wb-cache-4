2500|$|Much like Columbus Day, Thanksgiving is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} a [...] "national day of mourning", as a celebration of the cultural genocide and conquest of Native Americans by colonists. Thanksgiving has long carried a distinct resonance for Native Americans, who see the holiday as an embellished story of [...] "Pilgrims and Natives looking past their differences" [...] to break bread. Professor Dan Brook of the University of California, Berkeley condemns the [...] "cultural and political amnesia" [...] of Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving: [...] "We do not have to feel guilty, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> feel something." [...] Professor Robert Jensen of the University of Texas at Austin is somewhat harsher: [...] "One indication of moral progress in the United States would be the replacement of Thanksgiving Day and its self-indulgent family feasting with a National Day of Atonement accompanied by a self-reflective collective fasting." [...] Some of the controversy regarding Thanksgiving have been used to justify the Christmas creep (the act of putting up Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving).|$|E

5000|$|In September 2013, Pederick {{told the}} South Australian Parliament {{that he had}} been {{involved}} with fracking 'thirty years ago' in the Cooper Basin in South Australia. He said [...] "When I was involved and worked for Gearheart Australia and we were shooting wells in 1983 and 1984, we worked alongside Halliburton to complete those jobs." [...] He went on to describe the process of fracking as he had witnessed it at the time, before discussing water issues: [...] "There is a lot of concern, obviously, about possible contamination—whether it is groundwater contamination or freshwater contamination—and the last thing oil companies want (the last thing anyone wants) is shooting off site because when you are shooting oil and gas, {{you do not want to}} shoot water... There has been a lot of emotion, and I concur with the member for Waite's comments that, yes, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> get on with the job, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be careful, and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> make sure we have the appropriate environmental management and the appropriate water management. But I can assure you—and I know very much from experience—the last thing people want to do is make a mistake in these jobs."He concluded his presentation by supporting the expansion of the practise in South Australia by saying:"We do have to make sure that the process is operated effectively and we certainly cannot have a process where hydraulic fracturing is taken out of the equation, because it is certainly a big part of making sure that the economy of this state gets going."In June 2015, Pederick went on a fracking fact-finding trip to the USA with fellow South Australian politicians Troy Bell, Mark Parnell and John Darley, and farmer David Smith.|$|E

50|$|For {{integrals}} of vector fields {{things are}} more complicated, because the surface normal is involved. It can be proven that given two parametrizations {{of the same}} surface, whose surface normals point in the same direction, one obtains the same value for the surface integral with both parametrizations. If, however, the normals for these parametrizations point in opposite directions, {{the value of the}} surface integral obtained using one parametrization is the negative of the one obtained via the other parametrization. It follows that given a surface, we do not need to stick to any unique parametrization; but, when integrating vector fields, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> decide in advance which direction the normal will point to and then choose any parametrization consistent with that direction.|$|E

The petition argued for a reallocation of funding, stating that the investment would be smaller than recent government expenditures, including the 2008 Bank Bailout during the Financial crisis of 2007-2008. The White House issued an official response to the initial petition, entitled Doubling and Tripling What We Can Accomplish in Space, stating [...] "NASA and space are so important to our future that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be doubling and tripling what we can accomplish in this domain."

5000|$|Links {{sometimes}} link hubs {{to information}} that is not by itself enough to construct a hub. This occurs {{when one of the}} business keys associated by the link is not a real business key. As an example, take an order form with [...] "order number" [...] as key, and order lines that are keyed with a semi-random number to make them unique. Let's say, [...] "unique number". The latter key is not a real business key, so it is no hub. However, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> use it in order to guarantee the correct granularity for the link. In this case, we do not use a hub with surrogate key, but add the business key [...] "unique number" [...] itself to the link. This is done only when there is no possibility of ever using the business key for another link or as key for attributes in a satellite. This construct has been called a 'peg-legged link' by Dan Linstedt on his (now defunct) forum.|$|E

I think this will mean the destruction of European civilization in these countries." [...] In 1995, Lynn was quoted by the media watchdog group Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) saying, [...] "What is called for here is not genocide, the killing off of the population of incompetent cultures.

5000|$|Most people (philosophers and non-philosophers alike) {{assume that}} they have direct introspective access to their own propositional {{attitude}} events of judging, deciding, and so forth. We {{think of ourselves as}} knowing our own thought processes immediately, without having to interpret ourselves (in the way that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> interpret the behavior and circumstances of other people if we are to know what they are thinking). In a series of recent papers Peter Carruthers has argued that this introspective intuition is illusory. While allowing that we do have introspective access to our own experiences, including imagistic experiences of the sort that occur during [...] "inner speech", he draws on evidence from across the cognitive sciences to argue that our knowledge of our own judgments and decisions results from us turning our interpretative skills upon ourselves. He also argues that while inner speech plays important roles in human cognition, it never plays the right sort of role to constitute a judgment, or a decision. The latter processes always occur below the surface of consciousness, Carruthers claims.|$|E
5000|$|Member of Parliament for Waveney, Peter Aldous {{initiated}} {{a debate in}} the House of Commons of the United Kingdom to discuss what went well {{and what can be}} improved on a national level in regards to future flood defences/preparations, etc. Within his constituency is the town of Lowestoft, which was affected by the storm. [...] "There is a strong sense in these communities that Parliament has not yet considered properly this narrowly averted national crisis. We need to establish what went right and also what can be improved upon." [...] He also later stated [...] "It is wrong to dismiss these floods as a once in a 500-year occurrence. There were floods six years ago this context, note the floods in 2007 didn't affect Mr Aldous' home constituency, but Mr. Aldous is making the point that the risk of flooding is a national problem that needs addressing and not just a regional issue.

Shortly afterwards, in October 2003, HSBC {{announced that it}} would offshore the work done by its UK finance processing centres in Birmingham, Sheffield, Brentwood and Swansea to India, Malaysia and China within two years. The move, which represented the largest such offshoring in the financial services sector at that time and would lead to the loss of 4,000 British jobs, led the UK trade union UNIFI to warn Green that the [...] "gloves were off". He defended the decision, telling The Guardian’s Jill Treanor: “If you are a responsible company like us <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> think about this on a global basis. We have to approach this in a responsible and human way. I also have to bear in mind {{that people are going to}} get jobs in India (and elsewhere). It's wrong to pretend you can protect the existing jobs and wrong to pretend there isn't going to be change. It can't be the right response to say that emerging markets have no right to jobs." [...] He added: “Cost minimisation cannot be the only driver of this. There is no way we want to jeopardise the quality of customer service”. Green also oversaw HSBC’s acquisition of Household International, a US subprime lender, as well as its integration into the parent company. He later came to regret the deal, which was the largest acquisition in a series conducted by HSBC in the five years leading up to his {{appointment as}} its chief executive.|$|E
