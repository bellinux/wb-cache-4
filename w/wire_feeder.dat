50|$|Welding {{machines}} are usually classified as constant current (CC) or constant voltage (CV); a constant current machine varies its output voltage {{to maintain a}} steady current while a constant voltage machine will fluctuate its output current to maintain a set voltage.

[...] Most models provide the wire at a constant feed rate, but more advanced machines can vary the feed rate in response to the arc length and voltage. [...] Some <b>wire</b> <b>feeders</b> can reach feed rates as high as 30.5m/min (1200in/min), but feed rates for semiautomatic GMAW typically range from 2 to 10m/min (75 – 400in/min).|$|R

50|$|EGW uses a {{constant}} voltage, direct current welding power supply, and the electrode has positive polarity. The welding current {{can range from}} 100 to 800 A, and the voltage can range between 30 and 50 V. A <b>wire</b> <b>feeder</b> is used to supply the electrode, which is selected based on the material being welded. The electrode can be flux-cored to provide the weld with protection from atmospheric contamination, or a shielding gas—generally carbon dioxide—can be used with a solid wire electrode. The welding head is attached to an apparatus that elevates during the welding process. Also attached to the apparatus are backing shoes which restrain the weld to {{the width of the}} workpieces. To prevent them from melting, they are made of copper and are water-cooled. They must be fit tightly against the joint to prevent leaks.|$|E
50|$|These {{unpredictable}} circumstances may {{be prevented}} or counteracted {{at the beginning}} of the winding by forcing the wire, meaning, every single winding of the first layer on the inner coil diameter, into a predefined position. The wire places itself into a prefabricated groove geometry of the coil body and the wire guide does not need to follow it exactly but only approximately. Since the wire always loses in cross-sectional area due to the wire drawing to be used and the necessary deflections (mechanical stresses under tensile load) during winding, the distance between the grooves is designed only for the max. possible wire diameter. Effects of bends and tolerances of the wire and the coil body as well as changing surface qualities can be avoided that way. Especially wire bends that develop due to wire deflections caused by, e.g., pulleys, wire eyelets or even the wire guiding nozzle itself within the <b>wire</b> <b>feeder</b> of a winding machine can lead to deformations that remain on the winding of a coil. Applying grooves to the winding basis supports the layer-accurate position of the wire during the winding process. This behavior isparticularly beneficial for the winding processes where a plastic deformation of the wire is unavoidable immediately before the depositing of the wire onto the winding basis. This behavior can be observed especially in the needle winding technology. Due to physical reasons, it is unavoidable that the wire leaves the wire guiding nozzle at an angle of approx. 90°. Therefore, mechanical tensions remain inside the wire that are visible in the form of a bent winding on the winding basis. As a result, the following windings or also the following layers can change in their desired position.|$|E

40|$|A {{portable}} electron-beam free-form fabrication (EB F 3) system, now undergoing development, {{is intended}} to afford a capability for manufacturing metal parts in nearly net sizes and shapes. Although the development effort is oriented toward the eventual use of systems like this one to supply spare metal parts aboard spacecraft in flight, the basic system design could also be adapted to terrestrial applications {{in which there are}} requirements to supply spare parts on demand at locations remote from warehouses and conventional manufacturing facilities. Prior systems that have been considered for satisfying the same requirements (including prior free-form fabrication systems) are not easily portable because of their bulk and massive size. The mechanical properties of the components that such systems produce are often inferior to the mechanical properties of the corresponding original, conventionally fabricated components. In addition, the prior systems are not efficient in the utilization of energy and of feedstock. In contrast, the present developmental system is designed to be sufficiently compact and lightweight to be easily portable, to utilize both energy and material more efficiently, and to produce components that have mechanical properties approximating those of the corresponding original components. The developmental EB F 3 system will include a vacuum chamber and associated vacuum pumps, an electron-beam gun and an associated power supply, a multiaxis positioning subsystem, a precise <b>wire</b> <b>feeder,</b> and an instrumentation system for monitoring and control.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the methodology of}} the de-soldering process for rework of disk drive Head Stack Assembly (HSA) units. The auto <b>wire</b> <b>feeder</b> is a machine that generates Tin (Sn) on the product. This machine {{was determined to be}} one of the major sources of excess Sn on the HSA. The defect rate due to excess Sn is more than 30 %, which leads to increased processing time and cost to perform additional cleaning steps. From process analysis, the major causes of excess Sn are as follows: 1) The machine cannot cut the wire all the way into the flux core area; 2) The sizes and types of soldering irons are not appropriate for the unit parts; and, 3) There are variations introduced into the de-soldering process by the workforce. This paper proposes a methodology to address all three of these causes. First, the auto <b>wire</b> <b>feeder</b> machine in the de-solder process will be adjusted in order to cut wires into flux core. Second, the types of equipment and material used in de-soldering will be optimized. Finally, a new standard method for operators, which can be controlled more easily, will be developed in order to reduce defects due to workforce related variation. After these process controls and machine adjustments were implemented, the overall Sn related problems were significantly improved.

5000|$|The New York Connecting Railroad was {{electrified}} around 1927 as {{an extension}} of the New Haven's system. The NYCR system encompassed 20 route miles (32 km) of track, and was electrified, like the New Haven, using overhead catenary at 11 kV, 25 Hz. The system received power from the New Haven Cos Cob Power Station and Consolidated Edison 201st generating station via the West Farms substation. Additional power was supplied from a 5 MW, 7 kVA, 11 kV, three-phase to single-phase converter installed at East New York. This unit was also operated in synchronous condenser mode for reactive power support.
