5|$|In the {{animated}} adaptations of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Syaoran is voiced by Miyu Irino in Japanese, and by Jason Liebrecht in English. Irino said that {{ever since the}} introduction of the original Syaoranwho he also voicedhe sometimes had problems voicing both characters. Fellow voice actress Yui Makino also discussed Irino's role, saying that he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> character to cast because of the requirement to portray the two Syaorans.|$|E
5|$|Panzer Dragoon Saga was {{developed}} by Sega's Team Andromeda studio for the Saturn over approximately two years. Development began {{around the same time}} as development of the game's predecessor, Panzer Dragoon II Zwei, with a team of about 40, twice as many as the Zwei team. Director Yukio Futatsugi stated that Saga <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> Panzer Dragoon game to develop, as full 3D environments and voice acting were unusual for RPGs at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{became the}} most intense air/ground battle waged during the Cold War period; it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> such campaign fought by the United States since the aerial bombardment of Germany during World War II. Supported by communist allies, North Vietnam fielded a potent mixture of sophisticated air-to-air and surface-to-air weapons that created {{one of the most}} effective air defenses ever faced by American military aviators.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the casting}} director, Newt <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> role to cast: Schoolchildren were auditioned, {{but many of them}} had acted in {{commercials}} and were accustomed to smiling after saying their lines. Henn, from Atwater, California was chosen out of 500 children for the role, although she had no previous acting experience. She received a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, but chose not to pursue an acting career, and became a teacher.|$|E
5|$|LeMond had to {{keep his}} eye on his {{teammate}} and rival throughout the race. Hinault rode aggressively and repeatedly attacked, and the division created in the La Vie Claire team was unmistakable. LeMond would keep the yellow jersey {{to the end of}} the race and win his first Tour, but he felt betrayed by Hinault and the La Vie Claire team leadership. LeMond later stated the 1986 Tour <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> and stressful race of his career.|$|E
5|$|The {{other three}} songs on Desolate North one was {{recorded}} {{at the same}} place in early 2005, and the other two, the harp pieces, were recorded at Anderson's home. He has said how this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> part of the recording. As it happened, Anderson misplaced his microphone stand and so recorded those two songs with the microphone tucked under his chin. Despite the hindrance, Anderson claimed that the microphone picked up everything, and he was happy with the result.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E
5|$|Dual Destinies was {{the first}} game in the main series to be {{developed}} for the Nintendo 3DS; this move from the Nintendo DS to the Nintendo 3DS <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> part of the development, with the development team being unsure of whether to use 2D graphics like with previous games or to use 3D models. Eventually they decided to use 3D graphics, because of the stereoscopic 3D effect being a selling point for the Nintendo 3DS system. Because of the move to 3D, the in-house artist Takuro Fuse {{was in charge of}} the art direction, rather than the series regular Tatsuro Iwamoto, so that they could have meetings about the art more often. This was Fuse's first work on the main series, so he initially had problems with making character designs that fit the series, and had to get a lot of feedback from Eshiro. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, they put effort into the graphics, wanting to ensure that Dual Destinies graphics looked better than those of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{surfaces}} {{are decorated with}} scenes in basse-taille enamel with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the enamel and in the background have engraved and pointillé decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as rouge clair, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and {{the brilliance of the}} colour when it was done successfully. Scenes from the life of Saint Agnes run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. The symbols of the Four Evangelists run round the foot of the cup, and there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel Tudor roses on a diapered pointillé background; this was apparently added under HenryVIII. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a barrier of laurel branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from its beginning.|$|E

5|$|Melbourne's poor form {{throughout}} the 2007 season, when they won just five matches, saw the side finish 14th. White brought up his milestone 250th AFL-game in Round 19 {{with a win}} over the Western Bulldogs. His last season with Melbourne was 2008, {{in which he was}} dropped {{for the first time in}} his Melbourne career, despite returning to some of his best form. His average number of disposals per match (18.5) was the highest of any season in his career. His long-time understudy Mark Jamar assumed White's position as the premier ruckman at Melbourne, allowing Paul Johnson to play the second-ruckman role. It was the first time in 20 years that anyone other than White or Jim Stynes had been the first-choice ruckman at Melbourne for an extended run of matches. Coach Dean Bailey said that 2008 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> season that White and team-mate Adem Yze had experienced at the club—the side finished bottom and won just three games. Bailey praised both White and Yze on their professionalism and attitude at the end of the season—the pair's last at Melbourne. White played 15games in 2008—his lowest total in a season with Melbourne. He finished his career at Melbourne in Round 22 against Richmond, kicking two goals and having 17possessions. He received 53Brownlow votes throughout his career—47 with Melbourne and six with Fremantle. He reached double-figures in Brownlow votes on three occasions, with his highest being the 15 votes he received in 2004. He received his final Brownlow vote in Round 7, 2008, in Melbourne's win over Fremantle. He received Brownlow votes in nine of his 14AFL seasons.|$|E

25|$|The screenwriters did not {{originally}} script The Two Towers {{as its own}} film: instead, {{parts of}} it were the conclusion to The Fellowship of the Ring, {{the first of two}} planned films under Miramax. However, as the two films became a trilogy under New Line, Jackson, Walsh and Boyens shuffled their scripts. The Two Towers <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> of the Rings films to make, having neither a clear beginning nor end to focus the script. Nonetheless, they had a clear decision with making the Battle of Helm's Deep the climax, a decision affecting the whole story's moods and style.|$|E
