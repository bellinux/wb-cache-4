5|$|In 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency {{added the}} Basin mining {{area to the}} Superfund National Priorities List because of mining-waste {{problems}} in and near town.

5|$|Aquatic life ties North American river otters almost {{exclusively}} to permanent <b>watersheds.</b> The river otters favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of <b>watersheds</b> by river otters is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is positively associated {{with the number of}} beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, river otters prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to {{requirements}} of the natural and economic laws, the environmental management of <b>watershed</b> distinction is inevitable for improvement of <b>watershed</b> environmental management effect.

Under the guide of Nine-division principle, the idea on the environmental management of <b>watershed</b> distinction is reflected and implemented smoothly by dividing <b>watershed</b> environmental and economical function region, ways of optimizing the <b>watershed</b> environmental management, and creating conditions for implementation of environmental management of <b>watershed</b> distinction...|$|R
