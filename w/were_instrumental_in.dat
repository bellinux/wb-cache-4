5|$|By {{the time}} of the Korean War air power had been {{supplemented}} by the introduction of the jet engine, which allowed fighter and bomber aircraft to fly faster.

5|$|Also of {{historical}} importance were the Ndongo and Matamba kingdoms {{to the south}} of the Kongo Empire, in the Ambundu area. Additionally, the Lunda Empire, in the south-east of the present day DRC, occupied a portion of what today is north-eastern Angola. In the south of the territory, and the north of present-day Namibia, lay the Kwanyama kingdom, along with minor realms on the central highlands. All these political units were a reflection of ethnic cleavages that slowly developed among the Bantu populations, and <b>were</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> consolidating these cleavages and fostering the emergence of new and distinct social identities.|$|E

According to a popular tradition, Bodhidharma, a 5th/6th-century Buddhist monk and founder of Shaolin Kung Fu was the third son of a Pallava king from Kanchipuram. However, other traditions ascribe his origins to other places in Asia.Buddhists institutions from Kanchipuram <b>were</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> spreading Theravada Buddhism to the Mon people of Myanmar and Thailand who in return spread the religion to the incoming Burmese and Thai people.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the failure}} to deliver a winning season, Vanderlinden did oversee {{substantive}} improvement in the program. In 1998, the Terrapins {{were one of the}} most improved teams in defense, scoring defense, passing defense, and rushing. In 1999, Maryland allowed a conference low of 11 sacks compared with 56 in 1997. In that same period, Maryland also improved from last to first in the conference in rushing, {{due in large part to}} Heisman Trophy candidate and school career rushing leader LaMont Jordan. During Vanderlinden's tenure, Maryland also recruited several key players who <b>were</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> the team's later success.|$|E

5|$|During {{this time}} the Lithuanian army was {{expanding}} and modernizing. The Lithuanian Air Force was especially targeted for rapid development and service in this branch was prestigious. Some of its earlier members such as Jurgis Dobkevičius and Antanas Gustaitis <b>were</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> improving on aeronautical designs. While at the military school Marcinkus played for the KSK (Kauno sporto klubas) football club.

5|$|Flanders and his brother, Ernest, <b>were</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> {{developing}} {{screw thread}} grinding machines. These incorporated advances in thread technology (furthered by the Hartness optical comparator) and Flanders’s engineering calculations for gear-cutting machinery. In 1946, {{the two brothers}} received the Edward Longstreth Medal of the Franklin Institute as recognition of this accomplishment. They had improved the accurate manufacture of die-cut screws in soft metal and solved the problem of thread-grinding on hardened work.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1775, Colonel James Livingston {{raised and}} {{commanded}} a regiment of Canadians which fought at St. Jean, Quebec, {{in support of}} General Montgomery's 1775 invasion of Quebec.

5|$|On 29 August 1942, {{during the}} Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury {{was one of}} the few {{survivors}} of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his Bren gun from the hip, he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then seen to fall, shot by a Japanese sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, <b>were</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.|$|E
5|$|Rossier {{first arrived}} in Japan in 1859, {{at a time when}} early {{experiments}} in photography were being conducted in Kyūshū, particularly in Nagasaki. The city was the centre of rangaku, the study of Western science, and it was here that physicians Jan Karel van den Broek and J.L.C. Pompe van Meerdervoort <b>were</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> teaching their Japanese students not only medicine but also chemistry and photography. Neither Van den Broek nor Pompe van Meerdervoort was an experienced photographer, and their attempts to produce photographs were largely failures. Nevertheless, in turn they taught wet-collodion process photography to Keisai Yoshio, Furukawa Shumpei, Kawano Teizō, Maeda Genzō, Ueno Hikoma, and Horie Kuwajirō, among others.|$|E

During the occupation, many Filipino soldiers and guerrillas never lost hope of the United States. Their objective was to both continue {{the fight against the}} Japanese and prepare for the return of the Americans. They <b>were</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> helping the United States liberate the rest of the islands from the Japanese.|$|E

After the success of its first production, Kedok Ketawa (The Laughing Mask), the director Jo An Djan left for Populair's Film. Union hired new talent, including R Hu, Rd Ariffien, and Saeroen. All three <b>were</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> the production of Harta Berdarah; Hu and Ariffien served as co-directors, both in their debuts, and Saeroen– who had written the commercial successes Terang Boelan (Full Moon; 1937) and Fatima (1938) for other companies– wrote the story. Ariffien credited their hirings to Union's interest in attracting educated Native audiences.|$|E
5|$|Although {{best known}} for their joint {{work on behalf of}} women's suffrage, Stanton and Anthony first joined the temperance movement. Together, they <b>were</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> {{founding}} the short-lived Woman's State Temperance Society (1852–1853). During her presidency of the organization, Stanton scandalized many supporters by suggesting that drunkenness be made sufficient cause for divorce. But the relationship between the women's suffrage movement and the temperance movement was hardly accidental. The two movements had common interests, with women's suffrage filling the role of cause and prohibition becoming the effect. Later, in state after state, once women gained the right to vote, they could press for various political measures to reduce drunkenness, perceived to be largely a problem involving the male sex. Thus, the two movements became frequently allied.|$|E
5|$|As part of Operation Bowery, Eagle rendezvoused on {{the night}} of 7/8May with the American carrier , {{carrying}} 47 Spitfires, while Eagle had landed her entire aircraft complement to make room for 17 Spitfires of her own. Sixty of them arrived safely at Malta. For the next operation on 17May, the Swordfish and Sea Hurricanes of 813 Squadron flew back on board to join the 17 Spitfires and six Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers destined for Malta. The fighters flew off without incident, but engine problems forced all of the Albacores to return. After they had landed, the ship was attacked by a half-dozen SM.79 torpedo bombers which failed to score any hits.
