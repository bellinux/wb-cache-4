50|$|SR 527 officially {{opened on}} October 17, 1969, but {{eventually}} became overcrowded, with about 57,000 motorists using {{the road at}} the I-405 interchange as of 2004. To alleviate congestion, an expansion project began in 1991 that was completed in 2006. The first stage of <b>the</b> project involved <b>widening</b> <b>the</b> road between 228th Street SE and SR-524 to five - seven lanes, as well as minor improvements at its interchange with I-405. <b>The</b> second stage <b>widened</b> <b>the</b> roadway to five lanes between SR 524 and 164th Street, while <b>the</b> third <b>widened</b> <b>the</b> road between 164th Street SE and SR 96. The fourth and most complex stage <b>widened</b> <b>the</b> road between SR 96 and 112th Street SE. This stage involved expanding the SR 527/SR 96 intersection dramatically and raising the roadway near Silver Lake, along with numerous pedestrian and aesthetic improvements.|$|R

50|$|The rock-rimmed river gorges {{were more}} {{economically}} bridged with concrete arch bridges, since the footings could be formed {{directly from the}} exposed bedrock. The bridge is notable for its Classical Revival detailing. Usually, the Minnesota Highway Department devoted more detailing to urban bridges than rural bridges, but the scenic location on a popular tourist route lent itself to a more architecturally-detailed approach. As a result, the bridge was designed with open-balustrade railings, an emphatic archivolt, and monumental pilasters with recessed panels accented by contrasting concrete finishes. The original bridge was finished in 1924. By 1934, so many travelers were using the highway that the highway department proposed <b>widening</b> <b>the</b> bridge. Funds were not available until 1939, at which point <b>the</b> bridge was <b>widened.</b> <b>The</b> cost of <b>widening</b> <b>the</b> bridge was $12,793, and <b>the</b> <b>widening</b> respected <b>the</b> bridge's original design.|$|R
