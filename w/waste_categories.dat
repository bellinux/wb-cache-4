50|$|Uncontrolled {{waste is}} a group of waste types that do not fall into either the controlled, special or {{hazardous}} <b>waste</b> <b>categories,</b> such as specific mining wastes and agricultural wastes. This {{should not be confused with}} an alternative definition of uncontrolled waste that refers to improper waste disposal.|$|E
50|$|Each {{of the six}} special <b>waste</b> <b>categories</b> was {{the subject}} of {{separate}} EPA study. In July 1988, the EPA finished its study of oil, gas, and geothermal production wastes, in which it concluded that they did not warrant regulation under RCRA Subtitle C, but noted that they would continue to be regulated under Subtitle D (solid waste disposal). The EPA’s decision was based on its determinations that oil, gas, and geothermal production was already regulated by the states, that Subtitle C did not have the regulatory flexibility to deal effectively with the wastes, and that the permitting requirements of Subtitle C would impose unreasonable delays on oil, gas, and geothermal extraction. However, the EPA report identified regulatory gaps for oil and gas wastes, for which it recommended additional rules under existing EPA regulatory authority, under RCRA Subtitle D, the Clean Water Act, and the Safe Water Drinking Act.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} issues that {{surround}} reporting waste. It is most commonly measured by size or weight, {{and there is}} a stark difference between the two. For example, organic waste is much heavier when it is wet, and plastic or glass bottles can have different weights but be the same size. On a global scale it is difficult to report waste because countries have different definitions of waste and what falls into <b>waste</b> <b>categories,</b> as well as different ways of reporting. Based on incomplete reports from its parties, the Basel Convention estimated 338 million tonnes of waste was generated in 2001. For the same year, OECD estimated 4 billion tonnes from its member countries. Despite these inconsistencies, waste reporting is still useful on a small and large scale to determine key causes and locations, and to find ways of preventing, minimizing, recovering, treating, and disposing waste.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of {{interest}} in Industrial Internet of Things lately. Its applications and their benefits have generally been widely researched, but the internal applications that product management use have not been sufficiently studied. In this thesis I study how product management can use and benefit from Industrial Internet of Things. I explore the different needs of product management, as well as different Industrial Internet applications and their benefits, to find how the needs could be fulfilled with the applications. I also use lean wastes and value to measure their benefits. All of product management’s objectives require information to aid in decision making. Some of the most important available information include customer information and product usage information. Industrial Internet can be used to build monitoring level applications that produce that information. Some of the most important applications include usage based customer segmentation, product faults analysis and sales support applications. These applications have been used as case studies in this work. Lean <b>waste</b> <b>categories</b> are good way of quantifying and evaluating the benefits of Industrial Internet applications. When the traditional manufacturing type <b>waste</b> <b>categories</b> are combined with information management <b>waste</b> <b>categories,</b> the different efficiency gains are easy to categorize. By estimating the value of the wastes and additional value created by the applications, as well as the costs of building the application, it is possible to evaluate their profitability. In both literature and empirical part, it was found that some of the information needs of product management can be fulfilled more efficiently than before, leading to the application being beneficial.

The results showed that wood, drywall and concrete are the most frequent <b>waste</b> <b>categories</b> affecting the final cost in residential projects and waste of materials, over allocation of materials, rework, clarifications, unnecessary handling of materials, inefficient movement of workers, waste of space on site, and delays are the most dominant types of waste occurring in these categories...|$|E
40|$|Construction {{managers}} {{have for a}} long time focused their attention on conversion processes, with little attention given to flow activities, leading to uncertain flow processes, expansion of non value-adding activities, and reduction of output value. This paper investigates the incidence of non value-adding activities in construction projects in Indonesia and Australia, focusing on non-residential building and infrastructure projects. Data was collected via questionnaires and personal interviews targeting 99 respondents from Indonesia and 50 respondents from Australia. A quantitative approach was adopted for this research utilising the results of a questionnaire survey involving 53 variables that relate to non value-adding activities. The variables were then separated into two classifications: <b>waste</b> <b>categories</b> that contribute to a reduction in the value of construction productivity and waste cause variables that could be defined as factors producing waste. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the different perceptions amongst the respondents and to determine the key variables of non value-adding activities.

40|$|Radioactive waste {{arising from}} the {{operation}} and decommissioning of nuclear facilities {{as well as from}} the use of radioisotopes for medical, industrial or research purposes has to be managed responsibly, as the health risk as one aspect of the management of such materials could have an impact not only on today’s population but also on future generations. Therefore, decision-making and management of the various tasks involved need to be based on reliable data regarding amount, characteristics and history of the collected wastes. In addition, the disposal has to be documented thoroughly to guarantee provision of sufficient knowledge to future generations. Each Country has a strategy for the handling and storage of radioactive waste. Radioactive waste is categorized by its specific activity and the handling and storage of it has to be undertaken according to the respective requirements of each category. Currently, each Counties use its own definition of <b>waste</b> <b>categories.</b> This approach does not pose a problem as long as the country decides to manage the waste on its territory on a purely national level.

The composition of the garbage was determined by manual sorting into <b>waste</b> <b>categories</b> and weighing these categories. This report presents the results by location (sub-divided into areas where applicable) in <b>waste</b> <b>categories</b> by percentage of total weight. Results for the audit revealed some general trends regarding what is being thrown in the garbage and opportunities for waste diversion. In office areas of nine of the buildings audited, more than 15 per cent of the garbage by weight was recyclable paper. With increased awareness of the mandatory paper recycling program, this paper should be an easy target for waste diversion. Food waste made up over 20 per cent of the garbage in 10 locations. Two areas, the Main Dining Hall and the Campus Childcare Centre, have been identified as good potential locations to reduce waste through composting with over 40 per cent of garbage composed of food waste. In public areas with bathrooms, paper towel made up more than 20 per cent of the garbage by weight in nine buildings. In high use areas that generate a lot of garbage, such as the library and the University Centre, and in Burton’s Pond Apartments, there is a potential to increase refundable beverage container recycling.
