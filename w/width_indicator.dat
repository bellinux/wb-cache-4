40|$|Holland is a densely {{populated}} country with an important coastal zone that comprises {{most of the}} Dutch population. The dunes, the beach and the shoreface are a natural sandy protection for the Dutch coast. Natural processes, such as waves, winds and tides, coupled with human activity, may lead to shoreline erosion. Gradual recession of the coast can become a threat {{for the safety of}} the polders and consequently for the people that live behind the dikes and their properties. In The Netherlands the most sufficient method to counteract erosion is the application of nourishments. During the application of a shoreface nourishment, the sand is not placed on the beach or the dunes, but under water on the shoreface. In this study the effects of three shoreface nourishments applied on the areas of Ter Heijde, Katwijk and Noordwijk are studied and analyzed. To increase the insight into the effects of a shoreface nourishment to the natural system a number of research questions are introduced. How is the autonomous behaviour of the cross-shore profiles volume changing? How is the landward part of the profile affected? Does the shoreface nourishment result in beach widening? What is the behaviour of the longshore sediment transport? Does the nourishment result in downdrift erosion and updrift sedimentation? Onshore versus offshore sediment transport. Aim of this study is to find answers to the above mentioned research questions. A first analysis step is to study the volume evolution in each of the cross-shore profiles of the three study areas. The study is based on a transect by transect analysis. The total volume is divided in three horizontal subsections that represent the dune, the beach and the shoreface volume. To investigate the immediate effects that a shoreface nourishment has on the shoreface profiles, the shoreface profile volume is divided in sub sections. Two periods are introduced, the pre nourishment period and the post nourishment period. The volume changes during the pre nourishment and post nourishment period are compared. Finally, to investigate whether or not the shoreface nourishment results in beach widening, the concept of the beach <b>width</b> <b>indicator</b> (BWI) is developed, which is based on volumes per unit length. The nourishment volume, in the cases of Katwijk and Noordwijk, was placed outside the yearly measuring range. Thus, the main research question of the present study; how is the autonomous behaviour of the cross-shore profiles volume changing? cannot be answered. Below, the final conclusions are briefly mentioned. From the total volume analysis it can be concluded that in the area of Ter Heijde the shoreface nourishment did not affect the autonomous behaviour of the cross-shore profile of the transects located in the nourishment area. For Katwijk and Noordwijk it was observed a quick response of the nourishment. From the dune and beach volume analysis, it can be concluded that the nourishment resulted in the increment of the dune volume in the areas of Katwijk and Noordwijk. The beach volume was slightly increased in the area of Noordwijk. From the beach <b>width</b> <b>indicator</b> approach concluded that the shoreface nourishment in general, did not result in beach widening. From the longshore sediment transport analysis it can be concluded that only for the case of Ter Heijde the outgoing longshore sediment transport has been decreased. It is possible that the opposite effect of the salient effect occurred. For the cases of Katwijk and Noordwijk it is not possible to come up with conclusions. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Instream wood is {{a driver}} of geomorphic change in low-order streams, {{frequently}} altering morphodynamic processes. Instream wood is a frequently measured component of streams, {{yet it is}} a complex metric, responding to ecological and geomorphic forcings {{at a variety of}} scales. Here we seek to disentangle the relative importance of physical and biological processes that drive wood growth and delivery to streams across broad spatial extents. In so doing, we ask two primary questions: (1) is riparian vegetation a composite variable that captures the indirect effects of climate and disturbance on instream wood dynamics? (2) What are the direct and indirect relationships between geomorphic setting, vegetation, climate, disturbance, and instream wood dynamics? We measured riparian vegetation composition and wood frequency and volume at 720 headwater reaches within the American interior Pacific Northwest. We used ordination to identify relationships between vegetation and environmental attributes, and subsequently built a structural equation model to identify how climate and disturbance directly affect vegetation composition and how vegetation and geomorphic setting directly affect instream wood volume and frequency. We found that large wood volume and frequency are directly driven by vegetation composition and positively correlated to wildfire, elevation, stream gradient, and channel bankfull <b>width.</b> <b>Indicator</b> species at reaches with high volumes of wood were generally long-lived, conifer trees that persist for extended durations once delivered to stream habitats. Wood dynamics were also indirectly mediated by factors that shape vegetation: wildfire, precipitation, elevation, and temperature. We conclude that wood volume and frequency are driven by multiple interrelated climatic, geomorphic, and ecological variables. Vegetation composition and geomorphic setting directly mediate indirect relationships between landscape environmental processes and instream large wood. Where climate or geomorphic setting preclude tree establishment, reaches may remain naturally depauperate of instream wood unless wood is transported from elsewhere in the stream network...|$|E

We aimed {{to determine the effects of}} photoperiod and reproductive hormones on the seasonal cycles of reproduction and torpor use in a marsupial that commences reproduction in winter, the stripe-faced dunnart, Sminthopsis macroura. Males and females were placed under LD 14 : 10 and natural reproductive hormones blocked by either flutamide (males) or mifepristone (females) or tamoxifen (females). Reproductive parameters, metabolic rate and torpor variables were determined. The same animals were then placed under LD 10 : 14 and given testosterone (males) or progesterone (females) or oestrogen (females). Reproductive parameters, metabolic rate and torpor variables were measured. Body mass and tail <b>widths</b> (fattening <b>indicator)</b> in males were significantly affected by testosterone, and the effects were reversed by hormone blockers. Reproductive parameters were unaffected. Resting metabolic rate and ability to use torpor were not affected by treatment in males, however torpor characteristics, especially torpor bout duration, were affected by presence of testosterone in males. In females, body mass was unaffected by hormone presence, although tail widths were affected. Disruption of reproductive cycles occurred with hormone blockers in females, however, resting metabolic rate was not affected, and only presence of progesterone affected torpor characteristics in females. Our results differ from those found for rodents, where presence of testosterone abolishes the use of torpor in males, and oestrogen inhibits torpor use in females.

40|$|Abstract: Roughness is an {{important}} input parameter for modeling of natural hazards such as floods, rock falls and avalanches, where it is basically assumed that flow velocities decrease with increasing roughness. Seeing roughness as a multi-scale level concept (i. e., ranging from fine-scale soil characteristics to description of understory and lower tree layer) various roughness raster products were derived from the original full-waveform airborne laser scanning (FWF-ALS) point cloud using {{two different types of}} roughness parameters, the surface roughness (SR) and the terrain roughness (TR). For the calculation of the SR, ALS terrain points within a defined height range to the terrain surface are considered. For the parameterization of the SR, two approaches are investigated. In the first approach, a geometric description by calculating the standard deviation of plane fitting residuals of terrain points is used. In the second one, the potential of the derived echo widths are analyzed for the parameterization of SR. The echo <b>width</b> is an <b>indicator</b> for roughness and the slope of the target. To achieve a comparable spatial resolution of both SR layers, the calculation of the standard deviation of detrended terrain points requires a higher terrain point density than the SR parameterization using the echo widths.

More than 3, 700 km of road network were analyzed with 2, 242 crashes recorded from 2003 to 2010, of which 1, 597 were injury, and 645 resulted in property damage only.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which galaxies' star-formation histories and morphologies are determined by their clustocentric distance and their nearest cluster's richness. We look at three tracers of star-formation history (i-band absolute magnitude M_i, [g-r] color, and Halpha emission line equivalent <b>width)</b> and two <b>indicators</b> of galaxy morphology (surface brightness and radial concentration) for 52, 569 galaxies in the redshift range of 0. 015 <z< 0. 068. We find that our morphology indicators relate to the clustocentric distance only indirectly through their relationships with stellar population and starformation rate. Galaxies that are near the cluster center tend to be more luminous, redder and have lower Halpha EW (ie, lower star-formation rates) than those that lie near or outside the virial radius of the cluster. The detailed relationships between these galaxy properties and clustocentric distance depend on cluster richness. For richer clusters, we find that (i) the transition in color and Halpha EW from cluster center to field values is more abrupt and occurs closer to the cluster virial radius, and (ii) the color and Halpha EW distributions are overall narrower than in less rich clusters. We also find that the radial gradient seen in the luminosity distribution is strongest around the smaller clusters and decreases as cluster richness increases. We find there is a `characteristic distance' at around one virial radius (the infall region) where the change with radius of galaxy property distributions is most dramatic, but we find no evidence for infall-triggered star bursts. These results suggest that galaxies `know' the distance to, and the size of, their nearest cluster and they express this information in their star-formation histories. Comment: Submitted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|We {{find that}} {{variability}} {{of the iron}} K alpha line is common in Seyfert 1 galaxies. Using data from the ASCA archive for objects that have been observed more than once during the mission, we study the time-averaged spectra from individual observations, thereby probing variability on timescales that range from days to years. Since the statistics of the data do not warrant searches for line variability {{in terms of a}} complex physical model, we use a simple Gaussian to model the gross shape of the line and then use the centroid energy, intensity, and equivalent <b>width</b> as robust <b>indicators</b> of changes in the line profile. We find that approximately 70 % of Seyfert 1 galaxies (10 out of 15) show variability in {{at least one of these}} parameters: the centroid energy, intensity, and equivalent width vary in six, four, and eight sources, respectively. Because of the low signal-to-noise ratio, limited sampling, and time averaging, we consider these results to represent lower limits to the rate of incidence of variability. In most cases changes in the line do not appear to track changes in the continuum. In particular, we find no evidence for variability of the line intensity in NGC 4151, suggesting an origin in a region larger than the putative accretion disk, where most of the iron line has been thought to originate. Mrk 279 is investigated on short timescales. The time-averaged effective line energy (as measured by the Gaussian center energy, which is weighted by emission in the entire line profile) is 6. 5 keV in the galaxy rest frame. As the continuum flux increases by 20 % in a few hours, the Fe K line responds within approximately 10, 000 seconds with the effective line energy increasing by 0. 22 keV (approximately 10, 500 kilometers per second).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A number of quasi-binary homopolymer blends have been investigated {{with regard to their}} miscibility. The blends consisted of poly(epichlorohydrin) (PEPC) mixed with a range of poly(methacrylate) polymers:- poly(methyl methacrylate); poly(ethoxyethyl methacrylate); poly(tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate) and poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA). It was found that the state of mixing of the systems varied with the structure of the ester side chain, embracing a number of miscibility states. It has been postulated that the observed miscibility in the system PGMA/PEPC is due to the presence of a small specific interaction between the species. A second category of blend investigated comprised of a homopolymer (PEPC) and a random copolymer. In two cases the copolymers (styreneco- methacrylonitrile; methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylonitrile) were chosen such that the cohesive energy density of PEPC lay between those of the comonomers. This led to the observation of a number of miscibility states for the systems, depending upon the copolymer composition. Analysis of these systems and similar examples in the literature was conducted using the mean-field approach. A reasonable accord between theory and experiment was found when the role of both specific interactions and free-volume terms was negligible. A third type of copolymer (glycidyl methacrylate-co-methyl methacrylate) was found to be only partially miscible with PEPC. This was due to the small GMA/PEPC interaction and the tendency of the copolymer to diverge from the copolymerisation equation at high GMA concentrations. The experimental probe for miscibility has been the glass transition temperature. This was determined using Differential Thermal Analysis, Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis and to a lesser extent, Dielectric Relaxation. The phenomenon of partial miscibility, in which phase composition varies with overall blend composition, has been discussed. It has been postulated that this widely observed behaviour is due to a non-equilibrium phase separation process. The inadequacy of existing relationshi in describing the variation of the glass transition temperature of a miscible blend with composition has been highlighted. Furthermore, the importance of the transition <b>width</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of miscibility has been stressed...|$|R

We also searched for the associations between these parameters and physical performance in the study group. Methods and resultsThirty-two white Fontan patients with a mean age of 25 ± 4. 5 years and 30 healthy control subjects matched for age and sex were studied. Complete blood count together with iron-related parameters was determined in plasma of peripheral venous blood. The cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed. The Fontan patients had higher red blood cell counts (6. 0 ± 2. 1 × 109 /μl vs. 4. 8 ± 0. 4 × 109 /μl, p< 0. 001), hemoglobin (16. 7 ± 1. 4 g/dl vs. 14. 2 ± 1. 3 g/dl, p< 0. 001), hematocrit (49 ± 3. 4 % vs. 42. 1 ± 3. 1 %, p< 0. 001), red cell distribution width (RDW) (14. 3 ± 2. 4 % vs. 12. 8 ± 0. 5 %, p< 0. 001), while mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were similar in both the groups. Compared to the controls, the Fontan patients had higher unsaturated iron binding capacity (46. 1 ± 12. 6 μmol/l vs. 38. 4 ± 11. 9 μmol/l, p= 0. 02), total iron-binding capacity (62. 8 ± 9. 8 μmol/l vs. 57. 8 ± 8. 5 μmol/l, p= 0. 04), lower transferrin saturation (27. 4 ± 11. 4 % vs. 34. 6 ± 13. 4 %, p= 0. 03), and oxygen uptake, while iron and ferritin levels were comparable in both the groups. The multivariate model showed that SatO 2 and cystatin C were independent predictors of RDW, and alanine aminotransferase was an independent predictor of ferritin level. Interestingly RDW was an independent predictor of oxygen uptake.

40|$|Pavement edge {{drop-off}} is {{the vertical}} difference in elevation between the paved roadway and the adjacent ground. It {{is a serious}} safety concern for vehicles that goes off the track and encounters a drop-off. The errant vehicles, in order to restore their position back on the paved road, exert a greater amount of force which may result in loss of control for the driver. This may indicate {{an increase in the}} possibility of lane departure crashes, rollovers or head on collisions. According to an estimation by the Federal Highway Administration about 11, 000 people suffers from injuries and about 160 people lose their lives each year in crashes related to unsafe pavement edges in the United States. Safety Edge, on the other hand, is a design feature that creates a fillet {{along the edge of the}} pavement of the roadway that allows drivers, who drift off roadways, to return safely to the roads. This study intended to conduct a safety evaluation of road segments provided with Safety Edge in Iowa. Thus a before and after crash analysis was conducted to estimate any reduction in crashes in the after period of installation. This research also looked into the road and traffic characteristics that significantly affected the crashes on road segments provided with Safety Edge. A total length of 483 miles of roadway segments installed with Safety Edge was identified all over Iowa. Roadway, traffic, lane characteristics and crashes on the treatment segments for the study period of eleven years from 2004 to 2011 was obtained from Iowa Department of Transportation. A Preliminary before and after crash analysis for all types of crashes showed a 50 % reduction in all types of fatal crashes, 18. 5 % reduction in all types of property damage only (PDO) crashes and an overall decrease of 19 % for all types of total crashes. A preliminary before and after crash analysis for target crashes showed a 75 % reduction in Target fatal crashes, 1 % increase in target PDO crashes and overall 17 % reduction in total target crashes. The crash data which is a form of count data was analyzed using negative binomial regression. Positive safety impact of installation of Safety Edges was observed for almost all the statistical models (except for property damage only target crashes), as the crashes in the after period was observed to be less than that of the before period. Both scenarios of all types of crashes and target crashes were considered separately in the study. The variables that significantly affected the different crash models were average annual daily traffic (AADT), shoulder <b>width,</b> Rural/Urban <b>indicator,</b> and surface <b>width.</b> Negative Binomial Models for All types of KABCO crashes (all crash severity levels taken together) showed 21 % reduction in crashes in the after period. The percentage reduction of all types of injury (KABC) crashes was 20 %. For all types of PDO crashes the reduction was seen to be again 20 %. Negative Binomial Models for target crashes showed 16. 3 % reduction in target KABCO crashes and 2. 4 % increase in target PDO crashes, along with 21 % reduction in all types of KABCO crashes, and 20 % reduction in all types of PDO crashes. The results indicated that Safety Edge installation may also be able to reduce the severity of a crash...|$|R
40|$|Pulsar El 1929 + 10 is {{remarkable}} {{on a number}} of grounds. Its narrow primary components exhibit virtually complete and highly stable linear polarisation, which can be detected over most of its rotation cycle. Various workers have been lured by the unprecedented range over which its linear polarisation angle can be determined, and more {{attempts have been made to}} model its emission geometry than perhaps for any other pulsar. Paradoxically, there is compelling evidence to interpret the pulsar's emission geometry both in terms of an aligned configuration whereby its observed radiation comes from a single magnetic-polar emission region and in terms of a nearly orthogonal configuration in which we receive emission from regions near each of its two poles. Pulsar 1929 + 10 thus provides a fascinating context in which to probe the conflict between these lines of interpretation in an effort to deepen our understanding of pulsar radio emission. 	Least-squares fits to the polarisation-angle traverse fit poorly near the main pulse and interpulse and have an inflection point far from the centre of the main pulse. This and a number of other circumstances suggest that the position-angle traverse is an unreliable indicator of the geometry in this pulsar, possibly in part because its low level 'pedestal' emission makes it impossible to properly calibrate a polarimeter which correlates orthogonal circular polarisations. 	Taking the interpulse and main-pulse comp. I 1 <b>widths</b> as <b>indicators</b> of the magnetic latitude, it appears that pulsar 1929 + 10 has an α value near 90 ˚ and thus has a two-pole interpulse geometry. 'This line of interpretation leads to interesting and consistent results regarding the geometry of the conal components. Features corresponding to both an inner and outer cone are identified. In addition, it appears that pulsar 1929 + 10 -and a few other stars-have what we are forced to identify as a 'further-in' cone, with a conal emission radius of about 2. 3 ˚/P½ 	Secondarily, 1929 + 10 's nearly complete linear polarisation provides an ideal opportunity to study how mechanisms of depolarisation action on a pulse-to-pulse basis. Secondary-polarisation-mode emission appears in significant proportion only in some limited ranges of longitude, and the subsequent depolarization is studied using different mode-separation techniques. The characteristics of the two polarisation modes are particularly interesting, both because the primary mode usually dominates the secondary so completely and because the structure seen in the secondary mode appears to bear importantly on the question of the pulsar's basic emission geometry. New secondary-mode features are detected in the average profile of this pulsar which appears independent of the main-pulse component structure and which apparently constitute displaced modal emission. 	Individual pulses during which the secondary-mode dominates the primary one are found to be considerably more intense than the others and largely depolarised. Monte-Carlo modeling of the mode mixing in this region, near the boundary of comps. 11 and 111, indicates that the incoherent interference of two fully and orthogonally polarised modes can adequately account for the observed depolarisation. The amplitude distributions of the two polarisation modes are both quite steady: the primary polarisation mode is well fitted by a X 2 distribution with about nine degrees of freedom; whereas the secondary mode requires a more intense distribution which is constant, but sporadic...|$|R
40|$|Roughness is an {{important}} input parameter for modeling of natural hazards such as floods, rock falls and avalanches, where it is basically assumed that flow velocities decrease with increasing roughness. Seeing roughness as a multi-scale level concept (i. e., ranging from fine-scale soil characteristics to description of understory and lower tree layer) various roughness raster products were derived from the original full-waveform airborne laser scanning (FWF-ALS) point cloud using {{two different types of}} roughness parameters, the surface roughness (SR) and the terrain roughness (TR). For the calculation of the SR, ALS terrain points within a defined height range to the terrain surface are considered. For the parameterization of the SR, two approaches are investigated. In the first approach, a geometric description by calculating the standard deviation of plane fitting residuals of terrain points is used. In the second one, the potential of the derived echo widths are analyzed for the parameterization of SR. The echo <b>width</b> is an <b>indicator</b> for roughness and the slope of the target. To achieve a comparable spatial resolution of both SR layers, the calculation of the standard deviation of detrended terrain points requires a higher terrain point density than the SR parameterization using the echo widths. The TR describes objects (i. e., point clusters) close but explicitly above the terrain surface, with 20  cm defined as threshold height value for delineation of the surface layer (i. e., forest floor layer). Two different empirically defined vegetation layers below the canopy layer were analyzed (TR I: 0. 2  m to 1. 0  m; TR II: 0. 2  m to 3. 0  m). A 1  m output grid cell size was chosen for all roughness parameters in order to provide consistency for further integration of high-resolution optical imagery. The derived roughness parameters were then jointly classified, together with a normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) showing the height of objects (i. e., trees) above ground. The presented approach enables the classification of forested areas in patches of different vegetation structure (e. g., varying soil roughness, understory, density of natural cover). For validation purposes in situ reference data were collected and cross-checked with the classification results, positively confirming the general feasibility of the proposed vertical concept of integrated roughness mapping on various vertical levels. Results can provide valuable input for forest mapping and monitoring, in particular with regard to natural hazard modeling...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{research}} on novel, semiconductor-based, ultrafast and widely tunable wavelength-swept light sources {{with respect to}} different applications. The main focus was on the young technology of Fourier domain mode locked (FDML) lasers, where the insertion of a kilometer-long fiber delay line enables to tune a narrowband spectral filter synchronously to the roundtrip time {{of light in the}} resonator. In this way, very high sweep speeds become feasible. A very successful application in the field of biomedical imaging is optical coherence tomography (OCT), where FDML lasers allow for very large image acquisition rates. One important part of the research work was the development and characterization of novel concepts of wavelength-swept light sources improving performance and applicability in OCT. In this context, two novel modes of operation of FDML lasers have been demonstrated. On the one hand, an FDML laser with a highly linear time-frequency sweep characteristic was realized {{for the first time and}} allowed for OCT imaging at 1300 nm based on simplified numerical image processing. On the other hand, the first subharmonic FDML laser was implemented and successfully used for OCT imaging at 1300 nm. Here, light passes the same fiber delay line several times during each laser cavity roundtrip. In case of reduced sweep range, subharmonic FDML operation enabled an inherent multiplication of the effective sweep rate by a factor of ten, reaching 570 kHz. Another important achievement was the demonstration of a new type of ultrafast wavelength-swept light sources, where superluminescent light alternately passes a cascade of different gain elements and spectral filters which have to be tuned out of phase in order to compensate for the transit time of light. Different implementations operated at 1300 nm and at 1060 nm enabled effective sweep rates of up to 340 kHz. Ultrafast OCT imaging of the human retina was shown. The second part of the research work focused on the demonstration and investigation of a novel approach of short pulse generation, where light within the wavelength sweeps of an FDML laser is temporally compressed by a subsequent pass through 15 km of highly dispersive fiber. The achievable temporal pulse <b>width</b> was an <b>indicator</b> for the coherence properties and the quality of mode-locking of the FDML laser. This became evident in the very critical dependence on the FDML sweep frequency as well as due to the results of comparable pulse generation experiments based on using an incoherent wavelength-swept light source. With a dispersion compensated FDML laser, operated at 1560 nm, pulse durations of 60 - 70 ps at a repetition rate of 390 kHz were achieved. Although the generation of bandwidth-limited pulses was not feasible, it was shown that the electric field within the wavelength sweeps of the FDML laser must at least be partially coherent. Due to remaining uncompensated higher order chirp, the optical bandwidth was limited to 6 nm and the pulse energy was restricted. Pulse energies of 5. 6 nJ have been achieved using erbium-doped fiber amplification prior to temporal compression...|$|R
