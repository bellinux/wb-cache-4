6000|$|... *A little item {{may as well}} {{be related}} here. The strongest and most {{reliable}} hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a <b>wooden</b> <b>float</b> at its outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit management the <b>wooden</b> <b>float</b> is made to rise {{on the other side of}} the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes.|$|E
60|$|In {{his boat}} {{he had a}} hideous looking sucking fish, around the tail of which was tied a long cord with a <b>wooden</b> <b>float</b> at one end. While the boys were {{watching}} him he dropped the monster overboard, and in an instant it darted at a medium-sized Jew fish, attaching itself to the latter {{by means of the}} sucking valve on the top of its head. Having done this he remained motionless, his victim seeming to be literally paralyzed, and there was nothing for the boatman to do but pull in on the float, disengage his animated fishhook by a dextrous pressure on the sucker after both had been drawn aboard, and send the repulsive looking servant out again.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fuselage}} of the LeO H.10 was a simple, flat sided {{structure with}} a water cooled Lorraine 12D V-12 engine in the nose. Twin <b>wooden</b> <b>floats</b> provided its landing gear. [...] Only one was built, flying {{for the first}} time in April 1923.|$|R
50|$|By the {{experiments}} detailed in captain Kater's paper, read before the Royal Society in 1825, {{it appears that}} the error to be feared in the determination of the horizontal point by this instrument, can rarely amount to half a second, if a mean of four or five observations be taken. In 151 single trials, two only gave an error of two seconds, and one of these was made with a <b>wooden</b> <b>float.</b>|$|E
50|$|The castle {{functioned as}} a toll-collecting station that {{was not to be}} ignored. It worked in concert with Gutenfels Castle and the {{fortified}} town of Kaub {{on the right side of}} the river. Due to a dangerous cataract on the river's left, about a kilometer upstream, every vessel would have to use the fairway nearer to the right bank, thus floating downstream between the mighty fortress on the vessel's left and the town and castle on its right. A chain across the river drawn between those two fortifications forced ships to submit, and uncooperative traders could be kept in the dungeon until a ransom was delivered. The dungeon was a <b>wooden</b> <b>float</b> in the well.|$|E
50|$|On the wet walls {{on which}} Kaavi {{pictures}} {{are to be}} etched, a buttery smooth mixture of lime and uramunji is smeared with a steel trowel. To cover larger areas, a <b>wooden</b> <b>float</b> is also employed. After an hour, engraving work commences. A well-trained Kaavi art mason can etch a small mural without any aids. For geometrical designs he employs rulers and compasses. Large and complicated motifs are first drawn on paper, perforated with pinholes and then traced on the wall by dusting the pinholes with dry lime.Kanthas or the steel bodkins of different sizes and dimensions are used for etching. The ridges, platforms and niches are decorated with the rows of spirals, spades, semi-circles and curves. The V-shaped parallel bands are used for twin pseudo-pillars.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1946 by Minoru Yoneyama as a {{producer}} of <b>wooden</b> <b>floats</b> for fishing nets. The company was later forced out of this market because of the invention of plastic floats. This led to a commitment by Yoneyama to never again be left behind by technological advancements.|$|R

50|$|Darenth Paper Mill {{was working}} until 1931 {{when it was}} taken over by Messrs Portals Ltd, of Laverstoke, Hampshire. In 1910, it was in the {{occupation}} of Messrs T H Saunders & Co Ltd, also at Hawley Mills and Beech and Rye Mills, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. The breast shot waterwheel was of cast iron with <b>wooden</b> <b>floats.</b> It was12 ft by 10 ft.|$|R
50|$|The system entailed the {{provision}} of a floating chamber, or 'Tide gauge' (at NS 30369 37993) in this case made of timber, situated at {{some distance from the}} structure and calibrated in such a manner as to represent the tide depth at the harbour bar. In the case of Irvine, the bar and the flotation chamber are some distance apart. Within the chamber a <b>wooden</b> <b>float</b> like a raft rose and fell according to the tide. Attached to this float was a cable, which ran through a wooden trough to the building, named the 'Pilot House' by the locals (at NS 30386 37970) which housed the apparatus. Changes in direction, the difference between the actual tide heights and the distance between the balls/lights, was achieved by pulleys and gearing. Within the building the cable was attached to eclipsers, metal frames with wheels which ran on rails attached to the building. The eclipsers, two in number, rose and fell with the tide. As the eclipser rose, it covered apertures through which a gas light had been previously observed. This light, from the main gas supply, was automatically switched off as the eclipser continued up but a by-pass jet always remained alight to maintain a supply to the main jet when the eclipser descended. At night the tide depth was indicated by the use of lights which diminished in number as the tide went out and vice versa.A code of different colours controlled by the blinds was used. During the hours of daylight, the method of indication was a code of black balls which were fixed to ropes connected to the eclipsers. These ropes were passed over pulleys attached to a cross arm on a staff {{at the top of the}} building. The balls were connected at fixed intervals to the rope and, again as the eclipser rose, the rope and the balls fell and disappeared within the building. The distance between each ball was exactly calibrated to tie in with the switching on / off of the lights. To correspond with the change in colour of the lights different shape balls were proposed but never installed. The code of balls / lights indicated by the system involved more balls / lights being displayed as the depth increased, the maximum being twelve balls at 18 feet of depth during the day or four white lights by night.|$|E
40|$|Frescoes {{restoration}} inclueds {{the integration}} of missing plaster. Recent research shows that restored plasters have different thermo-hygrometrical behaviours at low temperature and high ambient humidity rate. The durability of plasters applied with different tools (trowel, <b>wooden</b> <b>float,</b> spatula), resulting in heterogeneous textures, can be shorter that that of homogeneous textures. Early detection of risk areas, by means of infrared thermography is very helpful {{for the preservation of}} historical buildings without a controlled heating/cooling plant, and it offers an improvement in restoration techniques of precious surfaces...|$|E
40|$|A wooden {{fishing float}} under {{immersion}} {{in water for}} long periods is liable to absorb water, the quantity of water absorbed possibly being dependent upon the physical factors like the specific gravity and the inherent property of the material, the time of soaking and the pressure acting on it. Consequently a <b>wooden</b> <b>float</b> {{is likely to become}} heavy and loss its original buoyancy. However, when the float is removed from water and dried, the lost buoyancy is regained on complete drying. The present paper is an attempt to elucidate these two important characteristics of some of the chief wooden floating materials used on the West Coast of India...|$|E

50|$|Demologos was {{the first}} warship to be {{propelled}} by a steam engine. She was a <b>wooden</b> <b>floating</b> battery built to defend New York Harbor from the Royal Navy during the War of 1812.

In the meantime he had, in 1894 , established Sandefjord Flytedokker A/S (Sandefjord Dry Docks A/S). They possessed two <b>wooden</b> <b>floating</b> docks, and had close ties with the yard in general.|$|R
25|$|The Sporting Type was {{designed}} to meet RAF specification number RAF XXXII. It was a four-seat, single-engined biplane with twin <b>wooden</b> <b>floats</b> mounted on wire-braced struts below the fuselage. It had two cockpits, the forward cockpit for the pilot and a passenger sitting in tandem, the other for two passengers sitting abreast; the rear cockpit could also function as cargo room, increasing the aircraft's operational flexibility. The fuselage was of semi-monocoque plywood construction with a fabric fairing.|$|R

50|$|Two years later, the Ishiyama Hongan-ji {{was still}} under siege, and Oda's fleet, {{commanded}} once again by Kuki Yoshitaka, made another attempt to break the Mōri supply lines. Going against convention, Yoshitaka fought with six very large ō-adakebune ships, rather than a combination of small (kobaya), medium (sekibune), and large (adakebune) craft. Normally, adakebune were essentially <b>wooden</b> <b>floating</b> fortresses, covered in gun and bow emplacements. According to some accounts, it may be believed that these six were the first ironclads, and were built such that guns could not penetrate them. However, rather than true ironclads, made primarily or entirely of metal, these craft probably simply had limited iron plating in key locations.|$|R
