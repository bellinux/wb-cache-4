5|$|In {{attempting}} {{to present the}} character as a figurative mirror to Batman, the costume worn by Anarky in Beware the Batman was radially redesigned as entirely white, in contrast to Batman's black Batsuit. It consists of a tightly worn jumpsuit, cape, hood, flexible mask with white-eye lenses, and a utility belt. Upon the chest is a small, stylized circle-A in black. The design <b>was</b> <b>negatively</b> compared by reviewers to the longstanding design for Moon Knight, a Marvel Comics superhero.|$|E
5|$|Larry Charles {{wrote the}} episode, which was {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, and was partly based on {{a friend of his}} who was pregnant but did not want to experience childbirth. All of the characters' storylines intersect in the final scenes, an element that the writing staff would continue to use in later episodes. The episode's first broadcast in the United States on May 16, 1991 gained a Nielsen rating of 12.4/21 and <b>was</b> <b>negatively</b> received by critics.|$|E

5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} Governor Chiles published {{a report in}} 1995 stating that South Florida was unable to sustain its growth, and {{the deterioration of the}} environment <b>was</b> <b>negatively</b> affecting daily life for residents in South Florida. The environmental decline was predicted to harm tourism and commercial interests if no actions were taken to halt current trends. Results of an eight-year study that evaluated the C were submitted to the United States Congress in 1999. The report warned that if no action was taken the region would rapidly deteriorate. A strategy called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was enacted to restore portions of the Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, and Florida Bay to undo the damage of the past 50years. It would take 30years and cost $7.8billion to complete. Though the plan was passed into law in 2000, it has been compromised by politics and funding problems.|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, Nader {{was let go}} from All My Children due to {{budgetary}} considerations, however, {{he later}} returned in May 2000. The following year, the actor's arrest brought him and the character {{to the center of}} a large fan campaign organized by a group called the Loyalists, as well as a highly publicized lawsuit catching the attention of People and Entertainment Tonight, among other media outlets. As a result, Nader was let go again by the soap opera, with an official statement saying they would be prepared to consider having him return once he had addressed the lawsuit issues. The role was temporarily recast with actor Anthony Addabbo, who <b>was</b> <b>negatively</b> received by viewers, and let go shortly after his debut. Nader later stated in an interview that ABC had informed him that they had no intention of ever bringing him or the character back {{due to a lack of}} storyline. In 2004, Nader's suit was subsequently thrown out. In May 2013, after a twelve-year absence from All My Children, Nader was announced to be reprising the role, with his return airing on June 12, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Trade in {{the region}} <b>was</b> <b>negatively</b> {{impacted}} {{by the development of}} an oceanic route from Europe around Africa to India, and in the tax registers of the late sixteenth century, Alanya failed to qualify as an urban center. In 1571 the Ottomans designated the city as part of the newly conquered province of Cyprus. The conquest further diminished the economic importance of Alanya's port. Traveler Evliya Çelebi visited the city in 1671/1672, and wrote on the preservation of Alanya Castle, but also on the dilapidation of Alanya's suburbs. The city was reassigned in 1864 under Konya, and in 1868 under Antalya, as it is today. During the 18th and 19th centuries numerous villas were built in the city by Ottoman nobility, and civil construction continued under the local dynastic Karamanid authorities. Bandits again became common across Antalya Province in the mid-nineteenth century.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Manga {{released}} the film on home video in the United States with a newly commissioned dub that adhered {{closer to the}} original script with the correct names restored. The DVD preserves the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 widescreen and is non-anamorphic. It additionally features remastered audio and picture, but contains no extras. The same company later released a new special edition DVD of Cagliostro in 2006. The disc is double-sided with the film on side A and the extras on side B. It includes a new digital transfer; Manga's English dub in 2.0 and 5.1 surround plus Japanese, Spanish, and French language tracks in mono; the complete film in storyboard format, accompanied by Japanese audio with English subtitles; an original Japanese trailer; a sketch and still gallery; a 26-minute interview with animation director Yasuo Ōtsuka, and animated menus. The film is presented in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen; however, the opening credits have been heavily re-edited to remove the Japanese credits, instead using selected still-frames of scenes that appear without Japanese writing. The English-translated names are superimposed over these stills. This change <b>was</b> <b>negatively</b> received by fans of the film. Both DVD releases are out-of-print, with Manga no longer owning the U.S. film rights.|$|E

40|$|Results: The {{quantile}} {{analysis on}} levels led to disparate results {{depending on the}} wave, which would question results previously published based on only one wave. However, we found that age tends to present an inverse U-shaped relationship with BMI and WC, smoking <b>is</b> <b>negatively</b> associated with BMI and positively with WC and WHR, alcohol consumption <b>is</b> <b>negatively</b> associated with BMI and WC levels, net total wealth <b>is</b> <b>negatively</b> related with the three anthropometric measures, educational attainment <b>is</b> <b>negatively</b> associated with each measure, and depression is positively associated with each measure. The multinomial analysis found that living in a larger household size {{increases the likelihood of}} becoming or remaining unhealthy irrespective of which classification we used. Furthermore, using the BMI-based categorisation, the initial category is highly relevant as a predictor of the category four years later and alcohol consumption would be positively associated with being or becoming obese. From the combined BMI-WC categorisation, we found that net total wealth would <b>be</b> <b>negatively</b> associated with becoming or remaining unhealthy whereas depression is a significant predictor of becoming or remaining unhealthy. |$|R

However criticism of this conclusion is that naturally there would be less bird species living on a smaller amount of land, that is, in the most contaminated areas, than the number one would find living in a larger body of land, that is, in the broader area.|$|E

Slowly the importance of protecting the area's natural values for the benefit of both wildlife and tourism were recognised and a large penguin reserve was established by the government.
