40|$|Abstract: This paper {{shows the}} process of the virtual {{production}} development of the mechanical connection between the top leaf of a dual composite leaf spring system to a shackle using finite element methods. The commercial FEA package MSC/MARC has been used for the analysis. In the original design the joint was based on a closed eye-end. Full scale testing results showed that this configuration achieved the vertical proof load of 150 kN and 1 million cycles of fatigue load. However, a problem with delamination occurred at the interface between the fibres going around the eye and the main leaf body. To overcome this problem, a second design was tried using transverse bandages of <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fibre reinforced <b>tape</b> to wrap the section that is prone to delaminate. In this case, the maximum interlaminar shear stress was reduced by a certain amount but it was still higher than the material’s shear strength. Based on the fact that, even with delamination, the top leaf spring still sustained the maximum static and fatigue loads required, the third design was proposed with an open eye-end, eliminating altogether the interface where the maximum shear stress occurs. The maximum shear stress predicted by FEA is reduced significantly and a safety factor of around 2 has been obtained. Thus, a successful and safe design has been achieved. 1...|$|R

This material could be directly used after synthesis without any subsequent purification treatment due to the high yield and totally selective carbon nanofiber production. This shape memory design results in the direct use of the carbon nanofiber–woven glass microfiber composite as support without any post-synthesis shaping. The presence of hydrophilic oxygenated groups located at the outer surface of the carbon nanofibers allowed the sol–gel preparation of a <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> microfiber–carbon nanofiber supported TiO 2 (20 wt. %) catalyst, using tetraisopropoxide as precursor.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, for {{the purpose}} of {{achieving}} enhanced mechanical properties of fiber reinforced composites, hybridized composites containing a combination of two or more types of fiber reinforcements have been explored. Perhaps the main parameter which controls the mechanical properties of the hybrid composites is the flexibility to arrange the hybrid fiber reinforcement layers {{in a variety of ways}} within the hybrid laminate. In this study, low velocity drop weight impact resistance of plain <b>weave</b> <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> and carbon hybrid composites has been investigated. The study explores the effects of intra-ply arrangement sequence on the impact resistance of 24 and 32 ply laminates in which glass and the carbon plies have been differently stacked. The results show that impact resistance of <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fiber composites can be enhanced by hybridizing <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fabrics with <b>woven</b> carbon fabrics. The results indicate that the impact resistance is a function of the positions of the glass and carbon layers in the hybridized inter ply laminates...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} the delamination resistance of <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fibre reinforced polymers (GFRP) {{and its influence}} on GFRP’s resistance to point impact. Two different types of laminates were fabricated by hand lay-up technique; (i) <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fibre epoxy matrix laminates and (ii) <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fibre epoxy matrix laminates with 3 % graphite particulate fillers. End Notch Flexure (ENF) test was adopted for the measurement of delamination resistance. The two GFRPs laminates show similar mode II delamination resistance. At impact velocities between 2. 215 and 4. 429 m/sec, the GFRP developed a smaller damage size than the graphite-based GFRP laminates, indicating higher impact toughness. Difference of the impact resistance between the two GFRPs is mainly on the impact damage size developed. The total energy absorbed during the impact remains the same, which is independent of mode II delamination resistance of the GFRP. The history of relevant dynamic and energetic quantities, both to synthesize the dependency of the energy parameters and force threshold values on the impact velocity are discussed...|$|R

The effect of realistic tow directional variability is investigated by generating blanks using VarifabGA and then simulating the biaxial bias extension test using the finite element software, Abaqus ExplicitTM. In order to assign the initial fiber orientation to each element in the mesh, a unique element set is assigned to each element. A MatlabTM code 'InitialAngle. m' has been written to produce two input files; the first 'Mat. inp' includes the material property parameters of each element and the second 'Sec. inp' includes the sections of those elements.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of new type of composite materials based on multilayer concept. The multilayer composites were mainly composed of waste fibre based nonwoven fabrics, <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fibres and wood layers. Each of these layers was designed to operate with different functionalities; but when these layers were combined into a single composite, these functionalities were expected to work together. This particular aspect allowed to develop a single structure for fire doors (fire resistance time of more than 90 min), as well as to get a better acoustic insulation behaviour (up to 47 dB). The multilayer structure was comprised of different layers such as MDF panels (2 mm), <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fibre layer (220 and 400 g/m 2), wood materials (10 mm), <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fibre (220 and 400 g/m 2) and waste fibre based no-woven fabrics (3 different types). Composite panels were produced using these combinations in a compression moulding machine using two types of thermosetting resin systems. Acoustic insulation behaviour of these composites was characterized using a method similar to the one applied in the EN ISO 140 - 3 standard. In this testing method, a white noise was applied in an insulated chamber and the noise level (in decibels, dB) for various frequencies was measured in the first and second compartments of the chamber. The difference between the noises measured in those two compartments, called the noise reduction coefficient (α), was used to assess the acoustic insulation behaviour. It was observed that a good noise reduction coefficient (up to 47 dB) was observed in case of developed composite materials at 500 Hz frequency. It was also observed that increasing the thickness of the panels was not found beneficial for sound reduction capacity and the use of non-woven fabrics in the panel increased the noise reduction coefficient significantly...|$|R
