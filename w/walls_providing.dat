500|$|There are {{plausible}} explanations {{based on}} human biology for how circumcision can decrease {{the likelihood of}} female-to-male HIV transmission. The superficial skin layers of the penis contain Langerhans cells, which are targeted by HIV; removing the foreskin reduces the number of these cells. [...] When an uncircumcised penis is erect during intercourse, any small tears on the inner surface of the foreskin come into {{direct contact with the}} vaginal <b>walls,</b> <b>providing</b> a pathway for transmission. When an uncircumcised penis is flaccid, the pocket between the inside of the foreskin {{and the head of the}} penis provides an environment conducive to pathogen survival; circumcision eliminates this pocket. Some experimental evidence has been provided to support these theories.|$|E

[...] The SMC bed has special guides built into its surface to help accommodate multiple off-road motorcycles. [...] The Ridgeline’s bed is also equipped with four bed lights that are integrated into its <b>walls</b> <b>providing</b> a minimum of ten lux of illuminance throughout the bed. [...] In addition to built in lights, the forward section (close to the cab) of the SUT's right bed wall has a hidden spare tire mount that can accommodate a compact or full-size spare tire for times when access to the spare tire service tray, via the In-Bed Trunk, is impractical.

50|$|The {{architectural}} {{aspects of}} this former royal castle are known from contemporary images, including the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry.

Both the animals and occupants shared the same door, living at different ends of the same space. Several long ranges, or rooms, were usually built alongside each other, each one having its own ridgeline giving them the very distinctive look of the Lewis blackhouse.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the most}} {{significant}} awnings {{in the ancient world}} was the velarium, the massive complex of retractable shade structures that could be deployed above the seating areas of the Roman Colosseum. Made of linen shadecloths, timber framing, iron sockets and rope, the system could effectively shade about one-third of the arena and seating; another third could be shaded by the high surrounding <b>walls,</b> <b>providing</b> a majority of seats some shade on a blinding afternoon. It is believed that sailors, with their background in sailmaking and rigging were employed to build, maintain and operate the velarium.|$|E

50|$|Aguinaldo {{and his men}} braced {{themselves}} for {{the assault on the}} estate house with its fortification-like <b>walls</b> <b>providing</b> the friars and civil guards the protection against rebel attack. The Spaniards, led by Fray Eduarte were waiting for the rebel assault intending to wait out the reinforcements from Manila. Some rebels fired by their number, tried to rush the estate house. But an intense volley of gunfire sent them back crippled by a number of casualties. Aguinaldo saw the folly and futility of a direct attack. He decided on another tack. Accompanied by Guillermo Samoy, he crept towards the gate of the estate house intent on prying it open or breaking it down. The gate, however, was securely bolted from the inside that the efforts of two proved puny and worthless. Samoy died helping Aguinaldo make the break through.|$|E
50|$|An {{arch-gravity dam}} or arched dam is a dam with the {{characteristics}} of both an arch dam and a gravity dam. It is a dam that curves upstream in a narrowing curve that directs most of the water against the canyon rock <b>walls,</b> <b>providing</b> the force to compress the dam. It combines the strengths of two common dam forms and is considered a compromise between the two. They are made of conventional concrete, Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC), or masonry. Arch-gravity dams are not reinforced except at the spillway. A typical example of the conventional concrete dam is the Hoover Dam. Changuinola Dam {{is an example of}} the RCC arch-gravity dam. A gravity dam requires a large volume of internal fill. An arch-gravity dam can be thinner than the pure gravity dam and requires less internal fill.|$|E

5000|$|Cagayancillo Fort {{is one of}} the {{surviving}} defense forts in Palawan built during the Spanish Colonial Period. Work on the fort was started in the late 16th century by Father Nicolas Melo and Father Alonso Colosa, but it was not completed till the early 18th century by Father Hipolito Casiano, spanning almost 130 years. [...] The 162-sq. meter (1,740-sq. foot) diamond-shaped fort was built on the coast on a high point on the island and made from sea rocks mixed with lime. Like some of the other Spanish forts in this area, inside is a church surrounded by its massive 12 m high and 3 m thick <b>walls,</b> <b>providing</b> a safe place for the residents during marauding pirate attacks. [...] The other Spanish Colonial fortifications in Palawan are Fort Santa Isabel in Taytay and Cuyo Fort in Cuyo.|$|E
50|$|Anna Heringer worked {{together}} with her colleague Eike Roswag, developing a design based on regional construction methods and local materials but introducing new approaches for efficiency and structural integrity. As a result of improvements to the bamboo structures and lashing, {{it was possible to}} add a second storey to the building. Brick foundations were used to minimize the effects of moisture on the earthen walls. The bricks were made by local craftsmen while the remaining construction work was a collaborative effort by the architects, teachers, students and locals. In addition to the classrooms required, there are also spaces where the children can interact. The classrooms on the ground floor are enclosed by a mud wall while those on the first floor have slatted bamboo <b>walls</b> <b>providing</b> diffused light and natural ventilation. The regularly spaced vertical bamboo support connected to horizontal slats create a powerful decorative effect enhanced by the sunlight.|$|E

The William Street frontage features a random pattered wall at the main entrance under a low-pitched copper-sheathed roof. The western wall is decorated with a large glass mosaic mural, 20.7 metres by 4.4 metres, the design suggesting primitive organic forms indicative of growth and development. On the river side is an aluminium sculpture approximately 6 metres high. Entitled [...] "Enlightenment", it depicts three figures reaching towards the sun, symbolising the dissemination of enlightenment to mankind. To the south the extension was designed as a series of concrete fin <b>walls</b> <b>providing</b> views of the river, private work areas and shade from the sun.|$|E
