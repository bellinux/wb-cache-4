My own interpretation of spirituality isn't important, because {{we all have our}} own. <b>What</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I have something greater than me as an individual that helps bring me peace." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover art of Black Ice {{was drawn}} by Joshua Marc Levy, art {{director}} for Columbia {{and a longtime}} fan of the band who volunteered for the project among [...] "many people at Sony who desired to work on it". There are four different covers, the standard edition has a red logo, the deluxe edition has a blue logo and two variants to the regular design include yellow or white logos. Angus said the options were not to deliver the message that fans would need to purchase all covers. He said, [...] "We know most people will only purchase the record once, in their colour of choice. For me, it's not relevant. <b>What</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> fans enjoy it. Music is the essence." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1986, Dawkins and {{biologist}} John Maynard Smith {{participated in}} an Oxford Union debate against A. E. Wilder-Smith (a Young Earth creationist) and Edgar Andrews (president of the Biblical Creation Society). In general, however, Dawkins has followed {{the advice of his}} late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because [...] "what they seek is the oxygen of respectability", and doing so would [...] "give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all". He suggests that creationists [...] "don't mind being beaten in an argument. <b>What</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public." [...] In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that [...] "among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know." [...] When Moyers questioned him {{on the use of the}} word theory, Dawkins stated that [...] "evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening." [...] He added that [...] "it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English." ...|$|E

The {{rights and}} wrongs of the case, and {{who might be}} the guilty parties, <b>were</b> <b>matters</b> of very {{secondary}} importance. <b>What</b> <b>mattered</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the firm should recover the 14,000,000 livres for which the necklace had been sold; and Bassenge was quick to attach full value {{to the words of}} Madame de la Motte.|$|R
50|$|The Court made {{it clear}} that the issue of {{obscenity}} did not factor into its decision. <b>What</b> <b>mattered</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the ordinance made booksellers criminally liable for the mere possession of obscene books in their stores, without having proof that the bookseller had knowledge of the contents. This was found to be in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|R
2500|$|Touching {{specifically}} on {{the difference between the}} Beach Boys' album Surfin' U.S.A. (1963) and others' exploitation of California themes, Luis Sanchez writes: [...] "You could call The Beach Boys' version of Southern California cutesy or callow or whatever, but <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it captured a lack of self-consciousness—a genuineness—that set them apart from their peers. And it was this quality that came to define Brian’s oeuvre as he moved beyond and into bigger pop productions that would culminate in Smile." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to New York state law, confessions and confidences {{made to a}} clergyman {{or other}} {{minister}} are privileged and cannot be used as evidence. This privilege {{is not limited to}} communications with a particular kind of priest or congregant, and it is not confined to statements made [...] "under the cloak of confession". <b>What</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the conversations were of a spiritual nature, were confidential enough to indicate that the penitent intended that they be kept secret, and that the penitent did not waive the privilege subsequently.|$|E
2500|$|Bhakti, {{literally}} [...] "devotion to God", is {{the practice}} of devotion and humility. Jivamukti Yoga holds that [...] "God-realization" [...] {{is the goal of}} yoga practice, and that it does not matter to what form of God one's love and devotion is directed; <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the devotion should be directed to something higher than one's own self or ego. Inter-religious understanding and tolerance are significant corollaries to this practice, and altars in Jivamukti centers are typically adorned with images of multiple religious and moral authorities: Gandhi, Martin Luther King and Ingrid Newkirk intermingle with Jesus, Buddha, and Krishna.|$|E

2500|$|Stevens {{believed}} {{there was no real}} factual dispute as to the basis of Churchill's termination—the dinner-break conversation. The Court had to assume it was protected speech, per procedure, but the plurality had concluded <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>mattered</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the hospital reasonably believed it was not.

Life had treated him so kindly {{that he had}} almost forgotten that there existed a class which had not {{as much money as}} himself. Sympathy welled up beneath his perfectly fitting waistcoat. It was a purely disinterested sympathy. The fact <b>that</b> Nelly <b>was</b> a girl and in many respects a dashed pretty girl did not affect him. <b>What</b> <b>mattered</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> hard up. The thought hurt Freddie like a blow. He hated the idea of anyone being hard up.|$|R
2500|$|Actress Meryl Streep, {{who played}} Katherina in 1978 at the Shakespeare in the Park festival, {{says of the}} play, [...] "really <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they have an {{incredible}} passion and love; it's not something that Katherina admits to right away, but it does provide the source of her change." [...] Similarly, John C. Bean sees the speech as the final stage {{in the process of}} Katherina's change of heart towards Petruchio; [...] "if we can appreciate the liberal element in Kate's last speech – the speech that strikes modern sensibilities as advocating male tyranny – we can perhaps see that Kate is tamed not in the automatic manner of behavioural psychology but in the spontaneous manner of the later romantic comedies where characters lose themselves and emerge, as if from a dream, liberated into the bonds of love." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{several years}} Truffaut had become {{increasingly}} interested in people {{from his life}} who had died, beginning with his mentor and father-figure André Bazin, who had died the day before Truffaut began shooting his first feature, The 400 Blows. Truffaut told a reporter for L'Express: [...] "I'm faithful to the dead, I live with them. I'm forty-five and already beginning {{to be surrounded by}} dead people." [...] In 1977 Truffaut lost two other important father-figures: Cinémathèque Française director Henri Langlois and Roberto Rossellini, whom Truffaut called [...] "the most intelligent man, with André Bazin" [...] during an interview with Le Matin de Paris. Around this time Truffaut had watched Shoot the Piano Player and noticed that half the actors had since died. In an interview with [...] magazine Truffaut asked [...] "Why not have the same range of feelings for the dead as for the living, the same aggressive or affectionate relationship?" [...] and added that he wanted to film [...] "what {{it would be like to}} show on screen a man who refuses to forget the dead." [...] According to him, The Green Room is not the worshipping of death, but an extension of the love for the people that we have met and who are no longer alive, and the idea that they have a permanency. <b>What</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Davenne refuses to forget, and this refusal is important for Truffaut.|$|E

He realized his calling {{at a young age}} {{and by the time he}} turned 11 his father had granted him his first decorating job at the tailoring shop, for which Angelo Donghia would recall “The result was perhaps liked by some and hated by others, but that didn’t bother me. <b>What</b> <b>mattered</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I had made something which was really the way I saw it and felt it.” ...|$|R

60|$|It {{was that}} idea of waste that {{dominated}} my mind {{in a strange}} interview I had with Justin. For it became necessary {{for me to see}} Justin in order that we should stamp out the whispers against her that followed her death. He had made it seem an accidental death due to an overdose of the narcotic she employed, but he {{had not been able to}} obliterate altogether the beginnings of his divorce proceedings. There had been talk on the part of clerks and possible witnesses. But of all that I need not tell you here; <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Justin and I could meet without hatred or violence. I met a Justin grey-haired and it seemed to me physically shrunken, more than ever slow-speaking, with his habit of attentive silences more marked and that dark scar spread beyond his brows.|$|E

You held a hand on which to have won a fortune if you had played it as I bade you. Well, you've played it, and where's the fortune? We can whistle for that as a sailor {{whistles}} for wind. And, by Heaven, we'll need to whistle presently if the weather in the troupe continues as it's set in. That scoundrel Scaramouche has been at his ape's tricks with them. They've suddenly turned moral. They won't sit at table with me any more." [...] He was spluttering between anger and sardonic mirth. [...] "It was your friend Scaramouche set them the example of that. He threatened my life actually. Threatened my life! Called me... Oh, but what does that matter? <b>What</b> <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the next thing to happen to us will be that the Binet Troupe will discover it can manage without M.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, one {{researcher}} stated that, {{regardless of whether}} unit cohesion was an actual motivator or merely a stabilizer, <b>what</b> <b>mattered</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> unit cohesion [...] "enhanced fighting power", because it reduced [...] "combat inhibitors (stress, fear, isolation)" [...] and promoted [...] "esprit de corps, morale and teamwork". Other research has, however, concluded <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> value in distinguishing the components of social cohesion and [...] "task cohesion ... the commitment to working together on a shared goal", since some studies conclude that unit effectiveness correlates strongly with task cohesion, not with social cohesion. This debate about the relative importance, or even need for, the concepts of social cohesion and task cohesion is exemplified by an exchange between Anthony King and Guy Siebold in the journal Armed Forces & Society in 2006-2007.|$|R
