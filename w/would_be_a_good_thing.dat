Because he's done that, and it’s not working out for him, it’s driving him crazy. So we really wanted to show that he’s a tragic figure much more than a villainous figure. It’s just a series of unfortunate {{situations}} that have led to him slowly losing himself in this world. Popping back in time and showing his concern for Rick and how he cares for Lori and Carl, I thought that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> to do." ...|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Adults Only" [...] (AO) rating has {{attracted}} a negative stigma among the video game industry—one which {{has been criticized for}} stifling the ability for developers to have creative freedom in their portrayal of certain themes in a game, at the risk of being commercially unviable due to publishers' objections to AO-rated content. AO-rated games cannot be published for major video game console platforms, and most retailers do not stock AO-rated games. ESRB President Patricia Vance argued that applying self-censorship to ensure marketability was a compromise that is [...] "true in every entertainment medium", but still believed that the idea of the AO rating eventually becoming acceptable <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for the ESRB system. The stigma is primarily affected by a perception by the industry and other activists that video games are generally considered children's products; for example, the availability of a Wii version of Manhunt 2 was condemned by Senator Hillary Clinton over fears that children could use the game's motion controls to act out the game's [...] "many graphic torture scenes and murders".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} anti-US sentiments {{would affect the}} film's box office, Feige said, [...] "Marvel is {{perceived}} pretty well around the world right now, and I think putting another uber-Marvel hero into the worldwide box office <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing....</b> We {{have to deal with}} {{much the same way that}} Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize," [...] similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s. Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis it will be very successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E

I hope he will make a good fist of his answer to Butt, though I have never been persuaded that he shines as a letter-writer. Dan Crilly told me Parnell's first contribution to the Liverpool Argus (mentioned in my London letter) was not worth much, and though he promised to insert it, he has failed me." ...|$|E

In contrast to the shy Queen, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, [...] "Duchess Lotta" [...] was lively, witty and flirtatious and {{was in many ways}} the female center of the court. It was said of her: [...] "One can not imagine anything more lively and cheerful. She is joy itself. Her greatest pleasure is to make up jokes and foolishness.

2500|$|On 23 August 2012, it was {{announced}} that the BBC had commissioned the six-part comedy Heading Out, which was created and written by Perkins. The BBC's Executive editor of Comedy Commissioning, Kristian Smith, called the show [...] "a warm, intelligent and brilliantly funny sitcom." [...] While Perkins stated that Heading Out [...] "might well be the thing that I'm most proud of. It's been a joy to work on, and I hope that joy proves to be infectious." [...] Perkins revealed that she had had the idea for Heading Out for ten years, before she developed the confidence to write it. She knew that she wanted to write about someone who was stuck and whose friends decided to take drastic action to [...] "save her from her own inertia." [...] The idea slowly began to take shape and developed into the narrative of a woman who struggled to tell her parents that she was gay, until her friends drove her to parent's house on her birthday, so she could come out to them. The comedian revealed that she is a fan of thrillers and wanted to have a ticking clock element to the show, so she thought Sara's coming out <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> to do.|$|E
2500|$|Grey was Governor of Cape Colony from 5 December 1854 to 15 August 1861. He founded Grey College, Bloemfontein in 1855 and Grey High School in Port Elizabeth in 1856. in 1859 he {{laid the}} {{foundation}} stone of the New Somerset Hospital, Cape Town. When he left the Cape in 1861 he presented the National Library of South Africa with a remarkable personal collection of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and rare books. In South Africa Grey dealt firmly with the natives, endeavouring to [...] "protect" [...] them from white settlement while simultaneously using reservations to coercively demilitarize them, using natives, in his own words, [...] "as real though unavowed hostages for the tranquillity of their kindred and connections." [...] On more than one occasion, Grey acted as arbitrator between {{the government of the}} Orange Free State and the natives, eventually drawing the conclusion that a federated South Africa <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for everyone. [...] The Orange Free State would have been willing to join the federation, and it is probable that the Transvaal would also have agreed. [...] However, Grey was 50years before his time: the colonial office would not agree to his proposals. In spite of their instructions, Grey continued to advocate union, and, in connection with other matters, such as the attempt to settle soldiers in South Africa after the Crimean War, instructions were ignored.|$|E
