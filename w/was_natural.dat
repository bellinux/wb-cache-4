5|$|String theory extends {{ordinary}} {{particle physics}} by replacing zero-dimensional point particles by one-dimensional objects called strings. In the late 1980s, it <b>was</b> <b>natural</b> for theorists {{to attempt to}} formulate other extensions in which particles are replaced by two-dimensional supermembranes or by higher-dimensional objects called branes. Such objects had been considered as early as 1962 by Paul Dirac, and they were reconsidered by a small but enthusiastic group of physicists in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|In early 1396, {{following}} {{the peace treaty}} with England, the French army mobilised against another pressing threat; that of the Turks to the east {{as part of a}} new crusade. As a leader of the original party to investigate events in Hungary, it <b>was</b> <b>natural</b> that Jean de Carrouges would return with his followers in the service of his old commander, Admiral Jean de Vienne. The army crossed Central Europe, united with the Hungarians and marched south, burning the city of Vidin and massacring the inhabitants before {{following the}} course of the Danube southeast, cutting a swathe of destruction through Ottoman territory. On the 12 September, the army arrived at the city of Nicopolis but were repulsed from its walls and settled into a siege.|$|E
5|$|The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory deep inelastic {{scattering}} experiments {{of the late}} 1960s showed that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It <b>was</b> <b>natural</b> to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data {{in a way that}} did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks, and their three-valued color quantum number solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.|$|E
5|$|Fighting the Veleti {{from the}} {{beginning}} of Mieszko's rule led to an alliance of his state with Germany. The alliance <b>was</b> <b>natural</b> at this point, because the German state was expanding eastbound as the Polish state was expanding westbound, with the Veleti common target in between. A victory was achieved in September of 967, when Wichmann, this time leading forces of the Volinians, was killed, and Mieszko, helped by additional mounted units provided by his father-in-law Boleslaus, had his revenge. Mieszko's victory was recognized by the Emperor Otto I as the turning point in the struggle to contain the Polabian Slavs, which had distracted him from pursuing his Italian policies. This new status allowed Mieszko to pursue his efforts to obtain for his country an independent bishopric. The Poles thus had their own bishopric before the Czechs, whose tradition of Christianity was much older. The victory of 967, as well as the successful fighting with Margrave Hodo that followed in the Battle of Cedynia of 972, allowed Mieszko to conquer further parts of Pomerania. Wolin however remained autonomous and pagan. Kołobrzeg, where a strong gord was built around 985, was probably the actual center of Piast power in Pomerania. Before, a Scandinavian colony in Bardy-Świelubie near Kołobrzeg functioned as the center of this area. The western part of Mieszko controlled Pomerania (the region referred to by Polish historians as Western Pomerania, roughly within the current Polish borders, as opposed to Gdańsk Pomerania or Pomerelia), which became independent of Poland during the Pomeranian uprising of 1005, when Poland was ruled by Mieszko's son Bolesław.|$|E

A <b>natural</b> number <b>is</b> an element of N. For simplicity, we use the following convention: x is a real number, k, l, m, n <b>are</b> <b>natural</b> numbers, h, i, j <b>are</b> <b>natural</b> numbers, and X is a subset of R. The following proposition is true (2) 1 For every X such that 0 ∈ X and for every x such that x ∈ X holds x+ 1 ∈ X and for every k holds k ∈ X. Let n, k <b>be</b> <b>natural</b> numbers. Then n+k <b>is</b> a <b>natural</b> number. Let n, k <b>be</b> <b>natural</b> numbers. Note that n+k <b>is</b> <b>natural.</b> In this article we present several logical schemes. The scheme Ind concerns a unary predicate P, and states that: For every natural number k holdsP[k] provided the parameters satisfy the following conditions: • P[0], and • For every natural number k such thatP[k] holdsP[k+ 1].

25|$|Once the electron's spin was discovered, it {{was clear}} that the {{magnetism}} should be due to a large number of electrons spinning in the same direction. It <b>was</b> <b>natural</b> to ask how the electrons all know which direction to spin, because the electrons on one side of a magnet don't directly interact with the electrons on the other side. They can only influence their neighbors. The Ising model was designed to investigate whether a large fraction of the electrons could be made to spin in the same direction using only local forces.|$|E
