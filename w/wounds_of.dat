5|$|In Catholicism, {{there has}} been a long {{tradition}} of veneration of the heart, stemming from worship of the <b>wounds</b> <b>of</b> Jesus Christ which gained prominence from the mid sixteenth century. This tradition influenced the development of the medieval Christian devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the parallel worship of Immaculate Heart of Mary, made popular by John Eudes.|$|E
5|$|Not {{required}} for {{service in the}} Pacific theatre of operations, the regiment was disbanded in December 1945. During the war, the 18th Battalion and its successor, the 18th Armoured Regiment, lost nearly 320 officers and men either killed in action or who later died of their <b>wounds.</b> <b>Of</b> the exactly 350 personnel made prisoners of war, a further 21 men died while in captivity.|$|E
40|$|Management of {{patients}} with full thickness <b>wound</b> <b>of</b> skin continues to challenge physicians and surgeons in area of cosmetic dermatologic surgery. At the present time, there are some medications and procedures {{that can be used}} to accelerate the healing <b>of</b> full thickness <b>wound</b> <b>of</b> skin. Based on studies that have demonstrated improved upper eyelid wound healing with OCA (octyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate tissue glue) treatment, we anticipated that OCA will accelerate healing <b>of</b> full thickness <b>wound</b> <b>of</b> skin. The aim of research is to evaluate the efficacy of OCA in accelerating healing <b>of</b> full thickness <b>wound</b> <b>of</b> skin in mice. Materials and Methods Design: experimental study, Animals: Male N. mRi mice, Sample size: 6 per study group.

Aquinas writes [...] "Therefore in so far as the reason is deprived of its order to the true, there is the <b>wound</b> <b>of</b> ignorance; in so far as the will is deprived of its order of good, there is the <b>wound</b> <b>of</b> malice; in so far as the irascible is deprived of its order to the arduous, there is the <b>wound</b> <b>of</b> weakness; and in so far as the concupiscible is deprived of its order to the delectable, moderated by reason, there is the <b>wound</b> <b>of</b> concupiscence." ...|$|R
5|$|Three Taliban {{fighters were}} in the courtyard, which had a chicken coop within it. The Taliban fired on Petry and Robinson; Petry was wounded by one round that went through both his legs, and Robinson was wounded, being hit on the armor plate {{protecting}} his side. Petry led Robinson to {{the cover of the}} chicken coop, and reported the contact and their wounded condition. Petry threw a thermobaric grenade from cover. At the chicken coop, the two men were joined by Sergeant Daniel Higgins, who assessed the <b>wounds</b> <b>of</b> the two soldiers.|$|E
5|$|A few British leaders, {{particularly}} Lord Mountbatten, {{the last}} British viceroy of India, were also uncomfortable with breaking links between independent India and the princely states. The development of trade, commerce and communications during the 19th and 20th centuries had bound the princely {{states to the}} British India through a complex network of interests. Agreements relating to railways, customs, irrigation, use of ports, and other similar agreements would get terminated, posing {{a serious threat to}} the economic life of the subcontinent. Mountbatten was also persuaded by the argument of Indian officials such as V. P. Menon that the integration of the princely states into independent India would, to some extent, assuage the <b>wounds</b> <b>of</b> partition. The result was that Mountbatten personally favoured and worked towards the accession of princely states to India following the transfer of power, as proposed by the Congress.|$|E
5|$|Daedaleopsis confragosa is a lignicolous fungus that {{produces}} a decay of sapwood. It causes white rot, a type of wood decay in which lignin is degraded and cellulose remains as a light-colored residue. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups, sometimes in tiers, in the <b>wounds</b> <b>of</b> living trees. Its preferred host is willow, {{but it has also}} been found on birch and other hardwoods. Fruiting usually occurs from June to December, but the hard shelves can persist year-round. In North America, the species is most common in eastern locales, but rare in western regions. It is common in Europe, {{and is one of the}} 100 most common fungi in the United Kingdom. Its European range extends east to the Urals. In Asia it is widely distributed, having been recorded from China, western Maharashtra (India), Iran, and Japan.|$|E

5|$|The {{instruments}} of the Passion were sometimes split between a shield and crest {{in the form}} of an achievement of arms (Neubecker, 222). The Hyghalmen Roll (c. 1447–1455) shows Christ holding an azure shield charged with Veronica's Veil proper. The heraldry continues with the 15th century jousting helmet, which is covered by the seamless robe as a form of mantling, and the Cross, scepter (of mockery) and flagellum (whip) as crest. The banner's long red schwenkel is a mark of eminence in German heraldry, but it was omitted when this image was copied into Randle Holme's Book (c. 1464–1480). The image on the opposing page (shown above) includes a shield quartered with the five <b>Wounds</b> <b>of</b> Christ, three jars of ointment, two rods, and the head of Judas Iscariot with a bag of money (Dennys, 97–98).|$|E
5|$|The Erpingham Gate is {{the primary}} {{entrance}} to the north section of the Close, directly opposite the west door of the cathedral. It was commissioned by Sir Thomas Erpingham, a commander in the Battle of Agincourt and was constructed between 1416 and 1425. The top of the arch contains a canopied niche which is thought originally to have been dedicated to the Five Holy <b>Wounds</b> <b>of</b> Christ, flanked by the Four Evangelists and with the Holy Trinity above, but was replaced in the 18th century with a kneeling statue of Erpingham wearing armour and surcoat with a collar of Esses and the Order of the Garter below his left knee. The rest of the gateway is decorated with the coat of arms of Erpingham and members of his family, together with his motto yenk (think) on small scrolls. It has been restored several times: first in the 18th century, then by E. W. Tristram in 1938 and again by Feilden and Mawson in 1989. It is a scheduled monument and adjoins School House and the Music School, which occupy 70 and 71 The Close respectively.|$|E
