25|$|The younger {{generation}} and commoners, with minimal education still address each other using ty with no connotation of disrespect, however. Certain Russians <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to vy-address may perceive {{the ones who}} don’t differentiate between ty and vy forms as uneducated, offensive and uncultured. This leads {{to the conclusion that}} this honorific was not a Russian innovation. Instead, the use of vy in both the singular and plural form is due to the exposure to the Latin historical and political developments. The usage of vy did not spread throughout the Russian population quickly; as a result, the usage was inconsistent until the eighteenth century, when Vy became more prominent in secular literature.|$|E

The video's inspiration stemmed from {{a piece of art}} created by the sculptor Allen Jones in the 1960s, involving the use of female mannequins as everyday pieces of furniture. Shortly before its release, pictures of the group's members with men in tight underpants surfaced online; according to Alison Maloney of The Sun, this [...] " [...] little to the imagination". The Sugababes wore glamorous gowns and had large hair and long eyelashes for the video, which features twenty muscly men <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> as pieces of furniture.|$|E
500|$|Murray {{plays an}} all-court game with an {{emphasis}} on defensive baseline play, and professional tennis coach Paul Annacone stated that Murray [...] "may be the best counterpuncher on tour today." [...] His strengths include groundstrokes with low error rate, the ability to anticipate and react, and his transition from defence to offence with speed, which enables him to hit winners from defensive positions. His playing style has been likened to that of Miloslav Mečíř. Murray also has one of the best two-handed backhands on the tour, with dynamic stroke execution while he primarily uses his forehand, which is more passive, and a sliced backhand to let opponents play into his defensive game before playing more offensively. Tim Henman has stated that Murray may now have the best lob in the game, succeeding Lleyton Hewitt. Murray's tactics often involve passive exchanges from the baseline. He is capable of injecting sudden pace into his groundstrokes to surprise his opponents <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to the slow rally. Murray {{is also one of the}} top returners in the game, often able to block back fast serves with his excellent reach and ability to anticipate. For this reason, Murray is rarely aced.|$|E

2500|$|Amos {{released}} {{two more}} albums with the label, The Beekeeper (2005) and American Doll Posse (2007). Both albums received generally favorable reviews. The Beekeeper was conceptually {{influenced by the}} ancient art of beekeeping, which she considered a source of female inspiration and empowerment. Through extensive study, Amos also wove in {{the stories of the}} Gnostic gospels and the removal of women from a position of power within the Christian church to create an album based largely on religion and politics. The album debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200, placing her in an elite group of women who have secured five or more US Top 10 album debuts. While the newly merged label was present throughout the production process of The Beekeeper, Amos and her crew nearly completed her next project, American Doll Posse, before inviting the label to listen to it. American Doll Posse, another concept album, is fashioned around a group of girls (the [...] "posse") <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> as a theme of alter-egos of Amos's. Musically and stylistically, the album saw Amos return to a more confrontational nature. Like its predecessor, American Doll Posse debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the years}} EastEnders has {{typically}} featured {{a number of}} elderly residents, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to show vulnerability, nostalgia, stalwart-like attributes and are sometimes used for comedic purposes. The original elderly residents included Lou Beale, Ethel Skinner and Dot Cotton.

Focus on elderly characters has decreased since the show's inception. The programme has more recently included a higher number of teenagers and successful young adults in a bid to capture the younger television audience. This has spurred criticism, most notably from the actress Anna Wing, who played Lou Beale in the show. She commented, [...] "I don't want to be disloyal, but I think you need a few mature people in a soap because they give it backbone and body... if all the main people are young it gets a bit thin and inexperienced.
