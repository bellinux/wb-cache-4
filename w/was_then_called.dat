5|$|Arthur Holmes (1890–1965) {{was born}} in England and became Regius Professor of Geology at the University of Edinburgh in 1943. His magnum opus was Principles of Physical Geology, first {{published}} in 1944, in which he proposed the idea that slow moving convection currents in the Earth's mantle created 'continental drift' as it <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>called.</b> He also pioneered the discipline of geochronology.

5|$|During spring {{training}} {{in a game}} against the Boston Red Sox, Kershaw gained much attention for throwing a curveball to Sean Casey that started behind Casey but at the end looped into the strike zone and struck him out looking. Kershaw was 0–3 and had a 2.28 ERA with 47 strikeouts through 43 innings pitched in his first stint of the year with the Suns. He <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>called</b> up to the majors on May 28, 2008, but optioned back to Jacksonville on July 2.|$|E
5|$|During the 193233 {{season that}} saw England tour Australia under Douglas Jardine with their Bodyline tactics, which {{involved}} bowling high speed deliveries at the batsmen's body, rumours circulated that Halcombe could be {{selected for the}} Tests. Halcombe's pace saw him touted as a possible retaliatory outlet against the English. At {{the beginning of the}} season, Halcombe played for Western Australia in a tour match against England. He took 3/48 and 1/38 in a drawn match, including the Bodyline mastermind and captain Douglas Jardine, Bob Wyatt, Les Ames and the Nawab of Pataudi. He <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>called</b> into the Australian XI in a subsequent tour match. He was less successful on this occasion, taking 1/81 as England scored 7/583. Halcombe was not selected for any other first-class matches during the season.|$|E

5|$|Harrison Park {{lies on the}} {{outskirts}} of Leek and has been the team's home since 1948, when the club purchased what <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>called</b> Hamil Park for £1,250. Changing rooms were constructed in the 1950s (previously the players had been obliged to change in a nearby pub), along with the first covered accommodation for spectators, and floodlights (which had previously belonged to the defunct Rugby Town) were erected in 1972, soon after which the stadium was renamed Harrison Park after former club chairman Geoff Harrison.|$|E

5|$|Several sources {{reported}} that Friedrich, his father, and his aunt were all named Trump, thus placing the name change before the 18th century. Genealogy organization FamilySearch provided information on Friedrich Trump, listing {{his father as}} Johann Ii Trump. A genealogist at Dotdash, which <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>called</b> About.com, listed Donald Trump's grandfather as Friederich Trump and great-grandfather as Christian Johannes Trump. In his 2013 book America's Obsessives: The Compulsive Energy That Built a Nation, Joshua Kendall wrote that Frederick's father and aunt, and by extension Donald Trump's great-grandfather and great-grandaunt, were called John Trump and Charlotte Luise Trump, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Tack's {{column was}} {{reinforced}} by the garrison of Semarang and marched southward to the Pajang district, where it fought the followers of Trunajaya's ally Raden Kajoran. Hurdt and Amangkurat's column re-assembled in Godong on the Serang River and stayed there for six days. Their artillery and supplies were brought there by river, but now had to join the southward march overland through enemy territory. This column then joined Tack's column in the Solo River valley (the river <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>called</b> the Semanggi River). Meanwhile, van Renesse and Mulder's column passed Pati, was joined by the VOC troops there, and marched through a different route towards Kediri.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge was}} the final link in what <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>called</b> the Pacific Highway (later known as U.S. Route 99), which ran from Canada to Mexico. The bridge crosses the Lake Union section of the Lake Washington Ship Canal and, unlike earlier bridges across the canal, {{the height of the}} Aurora Bridge {{eliminated}} the need for a drawbridge. The Seattle City Council voted to build connecting portions of the highway through the Woodland Park Zoo, a decision which generated considerable controversy at the time.|$|E
5|$|The torch-bearing arm was {{displayed}} at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar. The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>called</b> Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.|$|E
