A split-tuned analog phase-locked loop (PLL) provides eight equally spaced phases needed for quarter-rate data recovery and the digital CDR loop adjusts the phase of the PLL output clocks in a precise manner to facilitate plesiochronous clocking. The CDR employs a second-order digital loop filter and combines delta-sigma modulation with the analog PLL to achieve sub-picosecond phase resolution and better than 2 ppm frequency resolution. A test chip fabricated in a 0. 18 m CMOS process achieves BER 10 and consumes 14 mW power while operating at 2 Gb/s. The tracking range is greater than 5000 ppm and 2500 ppm at 10 kHz and 20 kHz modulation frequencies, respectively, making this CDR suitable for systems employing spread-spectrum clocking.

50|$|The P.150 was {{designed}} and built to compete as an Italian Air Force T-6 replacement against the Fiat G.49 and Macchi MB.323. The P.150 was an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane with a <b>wide-track</b> retractable tailwheel landing gear. The pilot and instructor were seated in tandem under one glazed canopy. It was originally powered by a Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial engine and later an Alvis Leonides engine. The aircraft was not chosen and did not go into production.|$|R
50|$|The Latécoère 26 was {{designed}} in the 1920s as a mail carrier, based on the earlier Latécoère 25 with a longer fuselage, and first flew in 1926. It had a parasol wing with a fixed tailskid landing gear. The main landing gear was both robust and <b>wide-track,</b> to enable the aircraft to land on unprepared the surfaces. It was powered by a single nose-mounted Renault 12Ja piston engine, and had room for only two passengers and an open cockpit for the pilot.|$|R
2500|$|The DH.77 {{was a small}} low-winged {{lightweight}} monoplane, {{of mixed}} metal-and-wood construction, powered by a 300hp (224kW) Napier Rapier air-cooled H-engine, which offered very low frontal area to minimise drag. [...] The wing was braced with distinctive bracing struts above the wing, while the aircraft had a <b>wide-track</b> fixed tailwheel undercarriage. It was fitted with large span ailerons and a stabilator to give good control characteristics and spin recovery. Armament was the normal pair of synchronised Vickers machine guns, mounted {{on each side of}} the cockpit.|$|R
5000|$|The Mitsubishi K3M was {{designed}} by British aeronautical engineer and aircraft designer Herbert Smith, from Sopwith working in Japan for Mitsubishi. The prototype, designated Mitsubishi 4MS1, made its maiden flight in 1930. The aircraft was strut-braced high-wing cabin monoplane, with fixed <b>wide-track</b> landing gear, and was powered by a single [...] water-cooled radial piston engine. Pilot and gunner were located in separate open cockpits, with an instructor and two pupils in the enclosed cabin in the fuselage. Later passenger variants seated five passengers in the cabin.|$|R
50|$|The I-17 was a {{lightweight}} single-seat low-wing cantilever monoplane. Developed under the design bureau designation TsKB-15 it first flew on 1 September 1934 {{powered by a}} 567 kW (760 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12 Ybrs engine. The second prototype designated the TsKB-19 had a revised inward retracting <b>wide-track</b> main landing gear and a Soviet M-100 engine. This second prototype was displayed at the 1936 Salon de l'Aeronautique in Paris. The third prototype designated the TsKB-33 had reduced armament to save weight and a revised engine cooling system, but the further development was abandoned in 1936.|$|R
2500|$|Though the Nie 31 (it {{had been}} flown and {{subsequently}} abandoned {{well before the}} company {{changed its name to}} Nieuport-Delage) was technically a sesquiplane, it could equally well be described as a shoulder-wing monoplane with a small foreplane. Its immediate predecessor was the Nieuport Madon, which had an ancillary lifting surface built around the axle of its <b>wide-track</b> undercarriage. [...] The Nie 31 had a narrower-track undercarriage, but the second wing extended outwards beyond the wheels, which were faired into its upper surface; this wing and the axle were joined to the lower fuselage by a pair of near vertical N-form struts.|$|R
