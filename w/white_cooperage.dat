5000|$|The word [...] "cooper" [...] {{is derived}} from Middle Dutch or Middle Low German kūper 'cooper' from kūpe 'cask', in turn from Latin cupa 'tun, barrel'. Everything a cooper {{produces}} is referred to collectively as cooperage. A cask is any piece of cooperage containing a bouge, bilge, or bulge {{in the middle of}} the container. A barrel is a type of cask, so the terms [...] "barrel-maker" [...] and [...] "barrel-making" [...] refer to just one aspect of a cooper's work. The facility in which casks are made is also referred to as a cooperage. [...] There were four divisions in the cooper's craft. The [...] "dry" [...] or [...] "slack" [...] cooper made containers that would be used to ship dry goods such as cereals, nails, tobacco, fruits, and vegetables. The [...] "dry-tight" [...] cooper made casks designed to keep dry goods in and moisture out. Gunpowder and flour casks are examples of a dry-tight cooper's work. The [...] "white" [...] cooper made straight-staved containers like washtubs, buckets, and butter churns, which would hold water and other liquids but did not allow shipping of the liquids. Usually there was no bending of wood involved in <b>white</b> <b>cooperage.</b> The [...] "wet" [...] or [...] "tight" [...] cooper made casks for long-term storage and transportation of liquids that could even be under pressure, as with beer. The [...] "general" [...] cooper worked on ships, on the docks, and in warehouses, and was responsible for cargo while in storage or transit. With a specialized skill, the general cooper could repair a broken stave without losing the contents of a cask.|$|E
