This work analyses the possible explanations for this increase in CO formation. A combustion model is used to investigate the impact of critical combustion parameters on the CO formation routes within a gaseous and lignite fired oxy-fuel flame. In gas-fired oxy-fuel flames the CO formation is promoted by a homogenous reaction between hydrogen radicals and CO 2. However, in lignite-fired oxy-fuel combustion, the gaseous reaction route is of less importance to inflame CO formation. Instead CO 2 gasification is the largest contributor to the increased CO formation compared to air firing.

Amostras de TFSA foram trituradas em almofariz, passadas em peneira de malha de 0, 2 mm e submetidas aos três métodos de determinação de C. Os teores de C obtidos correlacionaram-se positiva e significativamente entre si.

The distinguishing features of this power plant are: direct combustion of wood, indirect-fired gas turbine, and combined cycle with a gas turbine cycle and a Rankine steam cycle.

The effect of piston bowl geometry on the performance and exhaust emissions from a modern, high speed direct-injection (HSDI) diesel engine was investigated. Four piston bowl geometry’s (shape) were designed, manufactured and tested in a pre-production HSDI diesel engine installed on an eddy-current dynamometer. A series of experimental tests were performed to determined the optimum injector configuration for each piston bowl shape, the best bowl shape for minimum drive-cycle simulated emissions, {{and the effect of}} in-cylinder swirl ratio at various engine operating conditions. Results from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) combustion simulation of extreme injector configurations, correlated well with the experimental trends observed. Full-load testing to determine the optimum injector configuration for each piston bowl shape, indicated that exhaust emissions were very sensitive to the point of fuel impingement on the piston bowl walls. In particular, the trend in the emission of particulates and NOx was explained in relation to the point of fuel impingement, and supported by CFD combustion simulation. The emission of smoke and particulates was found to be dependent on wall <b>wetting</b> and late <b>combustion.</b> Key features for the successful design of future HSDI piston bowl shapes were identified, based on the results form piston bowl comparison tests at a selection of the European drive cycle simulation conditions.

An increase in the rate of mixing and heat release from higher swirl generally raised the emissions of NOx, but reduced smoke formation at low engine speeds. Benefits of an increase in swirl on emissions were negated at high engine speeds due to throttling of the intake charge. This work was financially supported by Ford Motor Company...|$|R

Millsp.) plus maize, and lablab (Lablab purpureum L. Sweet) plus maize]. A close correlation (R² > 0. 96) was observed between the C results of the Walkley-Black and dry combustion methods, but a correction was suggested {{to be applied to}} C results of Walkley-Black (C = 1. 05 C W. Black + 0. 47). A close correlation (R² > 0. 96) was also found between results of Kjeldahl-N and dry combustion-N, but no correction was necessary to be applied. The relationships between results of Walkley-Black and dry combustion and between results of Kjeldahl and dry combustion did not change among soil samples from different management systems, in disagreement to findings of a previous study where results of analytical C recovery were influenced by samples from different managements, supposedly because changes in lability or recalcitrance of organic matter might have affected the <b>wet</b> <b>combustion</b> reactions. A poor correlation (R² = 0. 42) was found between the C:N ratios based on Walkley-Black and Kjeldahl analysis and the C:N ratios based on dry combustion analysis. The methods for C and N determination did not affect the interpretation of the effects of management systems on soil C and N stocks...|$|E

The estimates area 296520 acres (1200 km 2) could possibly contain 5 billion barrels of original hydrocarbon in place. It should be noted here that {{the main purpose of}} this study has been the evaluation of the hydrocarbon potential of the Ghareb and upper Amman formations. A suitable recovery technique is proposing a pilot project for in –situ combustion underground and horizontal producer wells to increase the productivity, reduce the viscosity of the residual hydrocarbons, and should prove to be an economically viable means of heavy oil and asphaltic extraction. The study of a pilot project of in-situ combustion to drill one vertical well for injecting air into the top reservoir, the other horizontal well for injection in the middle reservoir and the third horizontal producing well in the line of the reservoir. If the project proves to be profitable producing 124. 43 bbl per day at least which means the recovery of capital expenditure in around 999. 9 days (2. 732 years) and the recovery efficiency proves to be high which makes the horizontal producer wells technology to increase the productivity. The project could be expanded in the Azraq region area. The possible method is proposed for thermal recovery of this reservoir, a dry forward combustion and <b>wet</b> <b>combustion</b> underground project is the preferred one or alternatively a combination of steam soaking and steam drive...|$|E
40|$|When it must {{be decided}} to develop a field with an {{enhanced}} oil recovery method, first it is needed to have a reservoir characterization model of high quality. Then {{the choice of the}} best suited method has to be carried out. For any method, a preliminary study has to be performed in order to help to decide. In the case of an in-situ combustion field development, various patterns are considered; at the same time, duration for the combustion front to move from the injector to a producer is analyzed. Field examples of various patterns are presented. The amount of air to inject in case of dry combustion and of air and water in case of <b>wet</b> <b>combustion</b> has to be determined in order to design air compressors and water pumps. The amount of air {{is a function of the}} volumetric sweep efficiency and of the oil and the matrix from the reservoir. Lab experiments must be performed in the reservoir matrix with the reservoir oil to determine the air requirement, which is the amount of air needed to burn a unit volume of reservoir. The amount of water is also determined by lab tests. Then the flows of air and of water are determined, which allows the design of compressors and pumps. The amount of oil produced is calculated taking into account the sweep efficiency in the different zones in front of the combustion. Production of oil, water and gas and their compositions obtained at the lab scale are presented. A scheme of the production, treatment and storage for a pilot field test is shown. In conclusion, a diagram shows the general guidelines for the preparation and implementation of field experiments using in-situ combustion...|$|E
40|$|THAI-"Toe-to-Heel" Air Injection, {{is a new}} EOR process, which {{integrates}} {{advanced technology}} and horizontal well concepts, to achieve a potentially very high recovery of heavy oil. It can also realize very substantial in situ upgrading by thermal cracking, producing upgraded oil to the surface. The process operates in a gravity stabilized manner by restricting drainage to a narrow mobile zone. This causes the flow of mobilized fluids to enter directly into the exposed section of a horizontal production well. The process can be operated on primary production, as new technology, as a follow-up to existing technologies, or as a co-process where the advantages of high thermal efficiency are equired. This is achieved by concentrating the energy required for oil mobilization, recovery and thermal upgrading in the reservoir. Combined with clean technology design, THAI offers pathway, to future economic success for the heavy oil industry. Three-dimensional, semi-scaled experimental tests on light "Forties Mix" oil (30. 7 °CDATA[API), Clair, West of Shetlands medium heavy oil (20. 8 °CDATA[API), and heavy Wolf Lake oil (10. 95 °CDATA[API) show that a well-controlled, narrow mobile oil zone is created {{just ahead of the}} combustion front. The width of this narrow zone depends on the characteristics of the heavy oil at reservoir conditions {{and the degree to which}} the very high viscosity of the cold oil seals the horizontal producer well. Well sealing can be augmented by a novel sleeve-back technique, which allows perforated downstream sections of the well to be shut-in. The application of this technique enabled the light oil test to mimic the operation of a heavy oil reservoir using THAI. Very high oil recoveries were achieved in the tests, up to 85 % OOIP. During <b>wet</b> in situ <b>combustion</b> (ISC), Wolf Lake oil was upgraded to 20 °CDATA[API, achieving a reduction in the cold oil viscosity from 100, 000 mPas to around 50 mPas...|$|R
40|$|Prescribed fire is {{a common}} {{management}} practice for reducing excessive forest fuel loading {{to minimize the risk}} of wildfire. Prescribed fire may however adversely impact air and water quality by releasing nutrients from soils and vegetation upon combustion. The quantity and quality of nutrients released is dependent on fuel characteristics and environmental conditions. Fuel moisture is an important variable that can impact nutrient release since it affects combustion conditions. This study assesses the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) release as affected by fuel moisture during a prescribed fire near Incline Village (NV) following mechanical thinning. The field component of this study involved a pre- and post-fire fuel inventory to estimate C and N losses under fall fuel moisture conditions. The laboratory component of the study further investigated effects of moisture on nutrient release and speciation. The laboratory study focused on the main gaseous and particulate C and N species that can affect air quality. Different fuel types were <b>wetted</b> followed by <b>combustion</b> in a custom designed combustion chamber that allowed for direct measurement of amounts and composition of nutrients released into the air. The moisture levels for soil, litter and duff ranged from 3 (air-dry) to 25 % while moisture contents for vegetative materials ranged from 5 (air-dry) to 85 %. Results from the field study showed that total fuel reductions were close to 90 % and C and N losses closely followed patterns in fuel mass reductions. Soil extractable ammonium (NH 4 +) increased immediately following fire, but we no clear trends were observed for extractable nitrate (NO 3 -). The laboratory combustion experiment showed that increasing fuel moisture caused increases in total particulates, including PM 2. 5 and C and N species, and gaseous ammonia (NH 3) emissions for several fuel types. Nutrient emission factors were highest for litter and leaves. We calculated atmospheric emissions for a hypothetical moist burn combinin...|$|R
40|$|Though {{metals and}} {{metalloids}} {{have been widely}} considered as reactive fuels, the ability to tune their ignition and combustion characteristics remains challenging. One means to accomplish this may be through low-level inclusion of secondary materials into the metallized fuel. While there are several potential methods to stably introduce secondary inclusion materials, this work focuses {{on the use of}} mechanical activation (MA) and metal alloys. ^ Recent work has shown that low-level inclusion of fluoropolymers into aluminum particles can have a substantial effect on their combustion characteristics. The reflected shock ignition of mechanically activated aluminum/polytetrafluoroethylene (MA Al/PTFE) is compared to a physical mixture (PM) of Al/PTFE, neat spherical aluminum, and flake aluminum. It was found that the powders with higher specific surface areas ignited faster than the spherical particles of the same size, and had ignition delay times comparable to agglomerates of aluminum particles that were two orders of magnitude smaller in size. Flake aluminum powder had the same ignition delay as MA Al/PTFE, indicating that any initial aluminum/fluoropolymer reactions did not yield an earlier onset of aluminum oxidation. However, MA Al/PTFE did have a shorter total burn time. The PM of Al/PTFE powder had a shorter ignition delay than neat spherical aluminum due to the rapid decomposition of PTFE into reactive fluorocarbon compounds, but the subsequent fluorocarbon reactions also created a secondary luminosity profile that significantly increased the total burn time of the system. ^ The explosive shock ignition of aluminum and aluminum-silicon eutectic alloy compacts was evaluated with and without polymer inclusions. A statistical analysis was completed, investigating the effects of: detonation train orientation (into or not into a hard surface); the high explosive driver; whether the metal/polymer system is mechanically activated; particle size; particle morphology (spherical or flake); metal type (Al or Al-Si); and whether the inclusion material is interacting or non-interacting with the parent metal. It was found that mechanically activated particles with an interacting inclusion material (polytetrafluoroethylene) and smaller particle sizes yielded increased blast wave strength, and more complete metal combustion. It was also found that orientation of the detonation train has a substantial effect on the completeness of combustion. ^ While aluminum alloys are generally employed for their structural and mechanical properties, the low-level inclusion of secondary metals and metalloids may make such materials advantageous in propellant formulations and have not been fully considered. The aluminum-silicon (Al-Si) eutectic alloy was evaluated as a potential solid composite propellant fuel. Equilibrium calculations showed that Al-Si based propellants had comparable theoretical performance to equivalent aluminum based propellants, though at a typical specific impulse (ISP) reduction of roughly 2. 5 seconds for most mixture ratios of interest. Interacting (polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE) and non-interacting inclusion materials were mechanically activated (MA) with Al-Si (70 / 30 wt. % Al-Si/PTFE and 90 / 10 wt. % Al-Si/LDPE), which were shown to increase the powder reactivity. Neat and MA Al-Si powders were used in 15 / 71 / 14 wt. % (fuel additive) /(ammonium perchlorate) /binder propellant formulations. ^ Environmentally cleaner solid composite propellants have been widely investigated as a means to reduce hydrochloric acid (HCl) formation. Past efforts to scavenge the chlorine ion have focused on replacing a portion of the chorine-containing oxidant (i. e., ammonium perchlorate) with an alkali metal nitrate. The alkali metal (e. g., Li or Na) in the nitrate reacts with the chlorine ion to form an alkali metal chloride (i. e., salt). While this technique can potentially reduce HCl formation, it also results in reduced theoretical specific impulse. Thermochemical calculations show that using aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) binary alloy can reduce HCl formation to less than 5 % and increase the theoretical ISP by roughly 7 seconds compared to neat aluminum. Two solid propellants were made using 80 / 20 Al-Li alloy and neat aluminum as fuel additives. It was observed that the propellant combustion with neat aluminum formed large molten droplets at the surface, which is a well-known problem with aluminized propellants. In contrast, the Al-Li propellant formed an Al-Li melt-layer on the propellant surface during combustion. Droplets that were ejected from the melt-layer would typically undergo dispersive boiling or a shattering microexplosion, due to the large disparity in volatility (i. e., boiling points) between the aluminum and the lithium in the molten alloy. The halide scavenging effect of Al-Li propellants was verified using <b>wet</b> bomb <b>combustion</b> experiments. Additionally, no HCl evolution was detected using differential scanning calorimetry coupled with thermogravimetric analysis, mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared absorption.
