25|$|Campbell {{attended}} the Portway Primary School in Plaistow, London and had secondary education at Lister Community School in Plaistow, London. He was a prodigious schoolboy talent and was part-educated at the FA's School of Excellence at Lilleshall, {{where he met}} table tennis player and later football agent Sky Andrew. Campbell had a short spell at West Ham United, beginning {{his career as a}} striker. He left the Youth programme at Upton Park after a coach joked to him that Campbell <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> to hear that the West Indies were beating England at cricket; Campbell took this to be a racial slur.|$|E
25|$|Consistently {{with its}} silence before the election, the PRC {{government}} refrained from commenting {{directly on the}} election results, and PRC media, which follows instructions on reporting from the government, has been very quiet as to {{the result of the}} elections. Also consistently with its behaviour before the election, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China commented on the failure of the two United Nations-related referenda held concurrently with the election, stating that the results showed the lack of popular support for independence in Taiwan. The Bureau also expressed optimism for the two governments to work together to maintain cross-strait peace and aid development in future. It is speculated that the mainland government <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> with the result.|$|E
25|$|The Rev. Raymond Davis was {{installed}} as rector of Truro in 1948. He {{said that he}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> if he could, just once, fill all one hundred seats of the little brick church. Not only were all the seats filled, but the growing congregation began to burst at the seams as the great suburban expansion of Northern Virginia began in the 1950s. In 1959, a new and larger church was completed with a seating capacity of 500. The congregation first worshiped in the new church on Palm Sunday, 1959, and when the mortgage was paid off in 1974, a new Truro Church building was consecrated. The old church building {{is now known as}} the Chapel. Numerous services are still held throughout the week in the historic chapel, including contemporary worship services.|$|E

25|$|In September 1988, Matthew {{moves into}} Carmel's flat {{and the two}} are soon engaged. Matthew is well liked in the community, even convincing Carmel's skeptical father that he is genuine and Carmel begins {{planning}} their wedding. She wants to invite Matthew's mother, Lynna, but he is opposed to this as Lynna abandoned him at 15 and has had no subsequent contact. Carmel and Matthew marry in January 1989, but the day is ruined when Matthew sees his mother there. Carmel contacted her regardlesss, thinking Matthew <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pleased,</b> but he is furious. After shunning their reception party, Matthew threatens to leave Carmel and when she tries to stop him, he grabs her by the throat, holds her {{up against a wall}} and berates her for her interference. Carmel is petrified and upon seeing her fear, Matthew releases her and begins apologising profusely. Carmel is shaken, but Matthew convinces her that his apology is sincere, so she drops the matter.|$|E
25|$|The Australian captain Ricky Ponting {{brought on}} {{part-time}} spinner Michael Clarke to bowl the 11th over, and got immediate success, when Pietersen launched him to Matthew Hayden {{on the fifth}} ball, but England were still 101 for 3 after 11 overs. In the next over, the new batsman Michael Vaughan edged Andrew Symonds' ball to midwicket, and the pressure was suddenly on the English. With Trescothick out for 41 a bit later to an attempted sweep off Symonds, England were suddenly looking down a hole after a fine start, and Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood slowed the scoring, to see England 111 for 5 with six overs to play. However, a slog sweep from Collingwood to end the 15th over turned the match again, as it went away for six and England moved to 124 for 5. With Jason Gillespie being brought back, Collingwood led the charge, as England stole 17 runs off the 17th over and wrought control of the game again. Despite Andrew Strauss being bowled by Gillespie for 18, Collingwood hit another two boundaries {{towards the end of}} the over, to move onto 42 not out and the team score to 167 for 6. Vikram Solanki was out in the next over for 9, caught by Hussey off McGrath, and on the last ball, Collingwood was caught by for 46. Still, England <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> with 179 for 8, the highest score on the Rose Bowl in Twenty20 matches.|$|E
500|$|Many UFA MLAs {{came to see}} the government's {{reliance}} on Brownlee as embarrassing, and Greenfield's abilities as too limited to continue to lead. [...] In 1924, they pressured Greenfield to resign so Brownlee could replace him; Brownlee scuppered the plot by warning that Greenfield's resignation would be accompanied by his own. [...] A second attempt in 1925 was successful when Wood intervened to convince Brownlee to accept the premiership and Greenfield assured him that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> to be rid of it. [...] Brownlee became Premier of Alberta November 23, 1925.|$|E

500|$|On Tuesday morning, November 5, Mary Celeste left Pier 50 {{and moved}} into New York Harbor. The weather was uncertain, and Briggs decided to wait for better conditions. He {{anchored}} the ship just off Staten Island, where Sarah used the delay to send a final letter to her mother-in-law, in which she wrote: [...] "Tell Arthur I make great dependence on the letters I shall get from him, and will try to remember anything that happens on the voyage which he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> to hear." [...] On November 7, when the weather eased, Mary Celeste left the harbor and {{went out into the}} Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|Dungeon Keeper 2 was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows by Electronic Arts in late June 1999. Goldsworthy believed Peter Molyneux, {{producer of the}} original game, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> with the sequel. Indeed, Molyneux stated that he [...] "liked what they did with it", but also {{said that it was}} not precisely what he would have done and that his focus would have been [...] "expanding that sense of creating the greatest dungeon". A PlayStation version was in development, but cancelled. The first patch, which added levels, fixed bugs, and tweaked gameplay, {{was released}} in August. Ideas such as the merging of the underworld and overworld were planned for Dungeon Keeper 3, but Electronic Arts began focusing on other franchises such as Harry Potter. In August 2000, Bullfrog announced that the development of Dungeon Keeper 3 had been cancelled. Dungeon Keeper 2 is available on gog.com and Origin.|$|E
500|$|The pair {{continued}} {{to work on the}} preliminary ideas for a Liliom adaptation while pursuing other projects in late 1943 and early 1944—writing the film musical State Fair and producing I Remember Mama on Broadway. [...] Meanwhile, the Theatre Guild took Molnár to see Oklahoma! [...] Molnár stated that if Rodgers and Hammerstein could adapt Liliom as beautifully as they had modified Green Grow the Lilacs into Oklahoma!, he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> to have them do it. [...] The Guild obtained the rights from Molnár in October 1943. [...] The playwright received one percent of the gross and $2,500 for [...] "personal services". [...] The duo insisted, as part of the contract, that Molnár permit them to make changes in the plot. [...] At first, the playwright refused, but eventually yielded. [...] Hammerstein later stated that if this point had not been won, [...] "we could never have made Carousel." ...|$|E

500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, [...] "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry... is alive and wandering the earth" [...] and that this knowledge should encourage people to act {{in such a way}} that their future spouses <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pleased.</b> The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well!" ...|$|E
500|$|The Rhodesian press {{reported}} {{extensively on}} the Lisbon controversy {{during the second half}} of August, generally predicting that neither Britain, Portugal nor Rhodesia would back down. While most reporters believed that Whitehall would take a strong line, few could see any way it could actually stop Reedman from taking office. On 20 August, Bottomley spoke at his final conference in Lagos, and repeated all he had previously said regarding Britain's stance on Rhodesia. Back in London three days later, he reaffirmed his previous stance regarding Lisbon, saying that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> to have a Rhodesian on the staff of the British Embassy there, but would allow no more. In the same interview, he expressed the belief that Wilson had averted a Rhodesian UDI in October the previous year by warning Salisbury of the economic consequences. Speaking in Gwelo on 27 August, Smith derided this statement, calling it [...] "incredible". His administration had not even considered a declaration of independence then, he said, but it was contemplated now, and he believed Anglo-Rhodesian relations were at their all-time lowest ebb. He urged Britain to return to the bargaining table quickly.|$|E
500|$|After the First World War, Crawford {{returned}} {{to live in}} England, and was demobilised from the New Zealand Army in April 1919. Looking for work, he wrote to Surrey offering to play for them if they found him some employment in turn, but the committee, while writing that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> if he played for the county again, could not [...] "see [...] way to find him employment". Crawford may have been contemplating playing professional cricket—unheard of for a former Public School cricketer—but instead found work at Repton, his old school. It is unclear what his position at Repton was at this time; {{he seems to have}} had no official cricketing role and it is possible he worked as a teacher simply to maintain his amateur status. In any case, Crawford only remained at Repton {{until the end of the}} academic year; his short stay may have been the result of poor results by the cricket team. However, Burns suggests: [...] "Another indication that the school was not entirely happy to be associated with the Surrey rebel, whose baggage also included an indifferent war record, was that when the Old Boys cricket team, the Repton Pilgrims, was formed in 1921, Crawford was alone among the school's former distinguished players not to be made a member. He was not invited to join the club until 1952." ...|$|E
