5|$|Says Kirby unto Wade, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> run.|$|E
5|$|Break {{not your}} heart, dear mother, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> meet on that Eternal Day.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>will</b> {{never accept}} any global deal {{that does not}} limit global warming to the minimum {{unavoidable}} level, no matter what levels of compensation and assistance are promised to us… While <b>we</b> <b>will</b> reason with everyone to achieve our objective, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> not rubber stamp an agreement by {{the powers that be}} as the best we could get for the moment. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> use our numbers to delegitimize any agreement that is not consistent with our minimal position. If needs be we are prepared to walk out of any negotiations that threaten to be another rape of our continent.|$|E
6000|$|... "There 's no use cooking one duck," [...] {{said his}} wife, [...] "so <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> have pork and beans {{for dinner and}} I 'll hang the little duck in the shed. Perhaps you 'll be able to shoot a drake to-morrow, and then <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> cook them both together." ...|$|R
50|$|What Christ <b>willed,</b> <b>we</b> also <b>will.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Safe! I {{should say}} so. It ain't {{much of a}} {{sheltered}} harbor for large vessels, but with this breeze <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> run right up {{the mouth of the}} San Lorenzo River. Then there 's a little lake like, and a boat-house. Water smooth as glass and hardly over your head. You see, I was down here once before, with Red Nelson. Come on. <b>We</b> <b>'ll</b> be in in time for breakfast." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>will</b> make compost from garbage.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>will</b> {{guard the}} districts against illegal dumping.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>will</b> use {{the first}} to obtain the {{predictions}} of Nordström's theory for the four classic solar system tests of relativistic gravitation theories (in the ambient field of an isolated spherically symmetric object), and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> use the second to compare gravitational radiation in Nordström's theory and in Einstein's general theory of relativity.|$|E
50|$|How {{long are}} <b>we</b> <b>willing</b> {{to wait for}} a child? The average time to {{pregnancy}} after vasectomy reversal ranges from 9-14 months.|$|R
6000|$|... "Goat Island. They 've got a naval {{training}} station for boys {{over on the}} other side, and a torpedo-magazine. There 's jolly good fishing, too--rock-cod. <b>We</b> <b>'ll</b> pass to the lee of it, and make across, and anchor in the shelter of Angel Island. There 's a quarantine station there. Then when French Pete gets sober <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> know {{where he wants to}} go. You can turn in now and get some sleep. I can manage all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That 's enough nonsense; now <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> {{return to}} business," [...] said Polly, {{descending}} breathless but {{satisfied with the}} effect of her fun.|$|R
25|$|The atomic bomb, of course, is {{quantitative}} easing by the Federal Reserve. America has in effect issued an ultimatum to China and G20: either you stop this predatory behaviour {{and agree to}} some formula for global rebalancing, or <b>we</b> <b>will</b> deploy QE2 `a l’outrance’ to flood your economies with excess liquidity. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> cause you to overheat and drive up your wage costs. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> impose a de facto currency revaluation by more brutal and disruptive means, {{and there is little}} you can do to stop it. Pick your poison.|$|E
25|$|Another, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> act in {{a righteous}} and truthful manner.|$|E
25|$|Fifth, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> {{guard the}} honor and {{maintain}} dignity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> all go!" [...] said Mrs. Vivian, who {{had been}} listening, and she invited the others to {{accompany}} her to the Kursaal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you come}} to tea, and <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> dress together, and go all {{comfortable}} with Tom, {{who is in a}} heavenly frame of mind to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bless you!' said Strickland. 'Here, Fleete, get up. You'll catch fever there. Come in {{to dinner}} and let's have the lamps lit. <b>We</b> <b>'ll</b> all dine at home.' ...|$|R
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>will</b> not pollute water {{resources}} and will preserve riverside scenery.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>will</b> {{reduce the}} amount of {{household}} garbage and try to recycle it.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>will</b> {{show that}} this leads to contradiction and thus prove the theorem.|$|E
6000|$|... "There, that 's the chap for me! Wish {{it was n't}} spoilt, then <b>we</b> <b>'d</b> {{have fun}} popping away at the cats in the yard. Now, then, grandma." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad of it. I felt so {{myself and}} thought <b>we</b> <b>'d</b> have a jolly little party {{all in the}} family," [...] said Tom, looking much gratified at her delight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind; keep bobbing, and <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> {{come right}} by and by," [...] muttered Tom, giving his unfortunate partner a sudden whisk, which nearly landed {{both on the}} floor.|$|R
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>will</b> {{use this}} {{information}} shortly to obtain an expression for the four-momentum.|$|E
25|$|Third, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> firmly unify on {{the basis}} of mutual trust.|$|E
25|$|For {{this reason}} <b>we</b> <b>will</b> {{identify}} L∞μ(X) {{with the image}} of φ.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> get a {{farm near}} your house; I {{should like to}} know Kitty," [...] said Maud, feeling a curious {{interest}} in a girl who made such peculiar patchwork.|$|R
60|$|MRS. HOPE. The idea! As if {{you could}} trust your {{judgment}} in a thing like that! You 'll just go at once and say there was a mistake; then <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> talk it over calmly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Fan {{told me to}} be elegant, so I tried to," [...] whispered Tom, adding, as he {{clutched}} his partner with a somewhat desperate air, [...] "Hold on tight, and <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> get through somehow." ...|$|R
25|$|Fourth, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> {{guard the}} {{preservation}} of public peace like our lives.|$|E
25|$|We {{can extend}} {{the notion of}} a {{harmonic}} oscillator to a one lattice of many particles. Consider a one-dimensional quantum mechanical harmonic chain of N identical atoms. This is the simplest quantum mechanical model of a lattice, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> see how phonons arise from it. The formalism that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> develop for this model is readily generalizable to two and three dimensions.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>will</b> {{preserve}} the waterfront, rivers and streamside forests, the habitats of fireflies and dragonflies.|$|E
6000|$|... "If we {{are going}} to the opera to-night, perhaps <b>we</b> <b>'d</b> better start, as the {{carriage}} has been waiting some time," [...] observed Fan coolly, and sailed out of the room in an unusually lofty manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Faix, then, that's no {{such bad}} news," [...] said the cross old man. [...] "The door's open, and you've my lave; may be <b>we</b> <b>'ll</b> {{do as well}} without you, as we're like to do with you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{are drawn}} to what <b>we</b> {{anticipate}} <b>will</b> {{be a source of}} pleasure and will look to avoid what <b>we</b> anticipate <b>will</b> be a source of pain. The emotion of love comes from the anticipation of pleasure." ...|$|R
