50|$|The area of {{the nipple}} around which the spoke <b>wrench,</b> or <b>key,</b> is fitted in use is square in cross-section. Spoke keys may be 3- or 4-sided; the latter type has a small cutout to enable it to be fitted over a spoke, after which it may be slid along to engage all four flats of the nipple. It {{is less likely to}} round off the nipple than the 3-sided type, but is slower to use.|$|R

Later he locates and pays a visit to Mr. Wrench, who is recovering in the hospital. When he awakens, Malvo taunts Wrench on the death of his partner Mr. Numbers. However, Malvo gives <b>Wrench</b> the <b>key</b> to his handcuffs, and tells him that he respects him for coming closer to killing him than anyone has.

50|$|Klein Tools {{was founded}} in 1857 in Chicago, Illinois by German {{immigrant}} Mathias Klein. The first tool Klein made {{was a pair of}} side-cutting pliers for a telegraph lineman.

From the 1960s-1980s, the company expanded their product line to include leather and canvas products, occupational safety equipment, hex <b>key</b> <b>wrenches,</b> screwdrivers, nut drivers, as well as electrical terminals and connectors.
