5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so {{woodpeckers}} face {{competition for the}} nesting sites they excavate {{from the moment the}} hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other strategies to reduce the chance of being usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the chance that a larger species <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> over and expand it.|$|E

However females spend more time brooding, since they alone incubate and brood at night. Males {{on the other hand}} contribute more to providing the chicks with food.

Over the transmitter the humans see as the Kid walks to the wreckage of the Pilgrim, levitates(?) to a distant canyon and proceeds into the planet's interior.

However, Komov takes the responsibility for the failure of the mission on himself.|$|E
25|$|The tramway {{alternative}} has {{the easiest}} and fastest access, being located at street level. This encourages passengers which <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> between stops on Fornebu and travelers heading to Lysaker. However, the long travel time by tram to the city centers means that most travelers will switch to trains at Lysaker. Estimates show {{that in the long}} run the tramway alternative may not have sufficient capacity to handle all the traffic to Fornebu. The tramway is in the process of ordering new trams. One of the goals is that they can be a shelf ware. Should the Fornebu Line be built as a tramway, it would feature the only tunnels on the network. This would result in the trams having to be built in a higher fire grade, resulting in significantly higher costs for all trams for the network. Alternatively special trams for the Fornebu Line would have to be built, eliminating possibility of economy of scale.|$|E

25|$|Network Externality {{positively}} {{affects the}} cultural commons in many ways. The reward for {{being part of}} a group, society, and even the world through a P2P network {{is one of the greatest}} benefits that a modern common-pool resource can provide.The ability to connect and create with people from different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs is something thought to be impossible 100 years ago. Without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there to see what would happen. To his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to use the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings. This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place the computer in a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum. Secondly, it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a chance to learn and they <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the P2P network and network externality that led individuals to the Ted talk.|$|E

It was initially scheduled to premiere in November 2007, but the release date was pushed back six weeks to evacuate the Afghan child stars from the country after they received death threats. Directed by Marc Forster and with a screenplay by David Benioff, the movie won numerous awards and was nominated for an Academy Award, the BAFTA Film Award, and the Critics Choice Award in 2008. While reviews were generally positive, with Entertainment Weekly deeming the final product [...] "pretty good", the depiction of ethnic tensions and the controversial rape scene drew outrage in Afghanistan.

500|$|In the 90-minute, one-act play, lawyer Amir Kapoor and {{his wife}} Emily host an Upper East Side dinner. Amir is an American-born, Muslim-raised Manhattan mergers and {{acquisitions}} lawyer, while Emily is an up-and-coming artist who focuses on Islamic themes in her art. Amir has cast aside his Muslim heritage {{for the sake of}} his career and serves as Emily's muse, who has an affinity for Islamic artistic traditions. Prior to the dinner, Amir, who is on the partner track, becomes involved in a controversial case. Amir's assimilated nephew, Abe (born Hussein Malik), has concerns regarding the propriety of the arrest of a local imam who is imprisoned on charges that may be trumped-up of financing terrorist-supporting groups, leading Amir to question whether it is religious persecution. Emily encourages the reluctant Amir to appear in court in support of the imam, in an unofficial capacity that gets mentioned in The New York Times. The case becomes dinner conversation when he hosts Jory, a colleague from work, and her husband, Isaac, who is Emily's Jewish art dealer. In all, the dinner table assembly includes an ex-Muslim, an African-American, a Jew and a WASP dining over the topic of religious faith. The conversation touches upon [...] "Islamic and Judaic tradition, the Quran and the Talmud, racial profiling and September 11 and the Taliban and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Benjamin Netanyahu" [...] as tensions mount. When Amir admits he felt a [...] "blush of pride" [...] on September 11th, and holds secret animosity toward Israel, his friends are disgusted. Jory and Amir leave the apartment to get a bottle of champagne. It is revealed that Isaac and Emily have had an affair in the past, and that he is secretly in love with her. Jory and Amir return just as Isaac is about to kiss Emily. It is revealed that Jory has been selected as partner in the law firm over Amir, in part because of his presence at the imam's trial, and in a rage he calls her [...] "nigger". Jory and Isaac depart, the status of their relationship uncertain after Isaac's infidelity has been revealed. Emily confesses her affair with Isaac and Amir beats her. Abe stumbles into the apartment and finds him standing over her. The play jumps ahead a period of time. Amir is packing his belongings and preparing to leave the apartment. Emily brings Abe over for legal advice. He was questioned by the FBI after his friend expressed a Jihadist sentiment at a Starbucks. Amir warns Abe to be more cautious, but Abe flies into a fit of rage, saying that the West has [...] "disgraced" [...] Islam, but that they <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> all back one day. He storms out. Amir tries to reconcile with Emily, but she leaves.|$|E
