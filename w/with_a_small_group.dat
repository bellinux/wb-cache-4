5|$|After Labor's defeats at {{the hands}} of the United Australia Party (UAP) at the 1932 and 1935 state elections, Heffron became {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> in caucus and in the NSW Labor Council who aimed to depose Lang as leader. However, while Heffron's movement was based on his personal stronghold in his BotanyMaroubra ALP branches and the left-wing trade unions, Lang maintained majority control of the caucus, party machine and the party newspaper, Labor Daily.|$|E
5|$|Lava Fork volcano is {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> of related volcanoes called the Iskut-Unuk River Cones. This forms {{part of the}} much larger Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, which extends from the Alaska–Yukon border to near {{the port city of}} Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Eruptive activity at The Volcano is relatively young compared to most other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Geologic studies have shown that The Volcano and its eruptive products were emplaced in the past 400years; this is well after the last glacial period, which ended about 10,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanx on {{the left}} flank engaged the Spartan phalanx and mercenaries. During the initial assault, the Macedonian phalanx gave a {{considerable}} amount of ground before its weight drove back the Spartan phalanx. The Spartans, overwhelmed by the deeper ranks of Macedonian phalanx, were routed, but Cleomenes managed to escape <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> of men. The battle was very costly for the Spartans; most of their army was routed with only 200 of the 6,000 Spartans that fought surviving the battle.|$|E

Beginning <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>group,</b> as of 2011, there were 40 voices backed by 8 musicians. The choir was originally conducted by founder Kevin Kelly, but as of 2015, the musical director was Orla Gargan.|$|R

The {{majority}} of the city's population are descended from Norwegian settlers, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>group</b> descended from German settlers. The city's Norwegian heritage is represented by annual lefse and lutefisk suppers at the churches and a love of polka music. A lefse company is located in Blair.|$|R

In April 2006, new talent finally arrived; {{reporter}} Shayna Seymour was hired away from ABC affiliate WGGB-TV in Springfield, Massachusetts. Seymour currently covers general interest stories, but has also garnered a producer credit.|$|R
5|$|Stead {{began writing}} the novel in 2002, but her first draft was {{confusing}} and unorganized. To help her, she met editor Wendy Lamb who advised her to meet <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> {{of people who}} would help critique the novel. After three years of work, Stead finished the second draft and met with Lamb who once again helped make improvements and later published the novel. Reviewers praised the description of Gracehope and main characters, as well as the performances of Coleen Marlo and David Ackroyd who voiced Thea and Peter in a subsequent audiobook publication of First Light.|$|E
5|$|Another Ottoman {{army was}} {{assembled}} in Manastir {{in the summer}} of 1434. Again under the command of Sinan Pasha, this Ottoman expedition was defeated by Gjergj Arianiti in south-central Albania in August 1434. After his defeat, all beys of the territories bordering Albania were ordered to gather their forces and attack the rebels. In December 1434 Ishak Bey, sanjakbey of Üsküb marched into south-central Albania but was defeated by Gjergj Arianiti. Contemporary sources from the senate of Ragusa mention that many Ottoman soldiers were captured, while Ishak Bey escaped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group.</b> In April 1435, Arianiti defeated another Ottoman campaign and hostilities virtually ceased until the beginning of 1436, as Murat II's military efforts were focused against Ibrahim of Karaman in Anatolia. At the end of 1435 reports of the Ragusan senate assessed the situation as calm and noted that the belligerents had retreated to their respective territories.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1271–1272 {{reinforcements}} arrived from Meissen, led by Count Dietrich II. The army invaded Natangia and besieged an unnamed Natangian castle. While the assault claimed 150 lives of the crusaders, most of Natangian resistance was broken and the region was decimated. Herkus Monte, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> of his followers, was forced to withdraw to the forests of southern Prussia. Within a year he was finally captured and hanged. The last Prussian leader, Glappe of Warmians, was also hanged when his siege campaign on Brandenburg (now Ushakovo) was attacked from the rear. The last tribe standing were the Pogesanians, who made a surprise raid into Elbing and ambushed its garrison. In 1274 the Knights made a great expedition to avenge this raid, capturing the rebel headquarters at Heilsberg (Lidzbark Warmiński) and ending the uprising.|$|E

Nonetheless, Karl decided to go on. He repeated the pyramid act in 1963 and 1977. Karl continued performing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>group,</b> and doing solo acts.|$|R
50|$|A British-produced MGM sequel, Children of the Damned, {{directed}} by Anton M. Leader, followed in 1963 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>group</b> {{of six children}} (each one from a different nation: China, India, Nigeria, the Soviet Union, the United States and the UK). Although their powers are similar, the theme and tone are nearly opposite, with {{the children in the}} sequel being portrayed as sympathetic characters.|$|R
5|$|On Hitler's orders, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Skorzeny of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) (the {{intelligence}} {{branch of}} the SS), who had commanded the operation to rescue Mussolini in September 1943, was independently involved in intelligence gathering in the lead-up to the raid. Skorzeny acted {{on behalf of the}} SD, and after obtaining information from a Partisan deserter that pinpointed Tito's headquarters at the cave, he proposed a plan to infiltrate Drvar <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> of soldiers to assassinate Tito. Skorzeny soon discovered that the plan to eliminate Tito had been compromised, and had nothing further to do with the operation. It appears that he did not pass on the useful intelligence he had gathered to SS-Hauptsturmführer Kurt Rybka, the commander of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion, who was responsible for planning the critical airborne aspects of the operation. Largely due to interservice rivalry and competition, the three organisations did not share the intelligence they gathered, which had a significant effect on the tactical planning and execution of the operation.|$|E
5|$|In June 1399, Louis, Duke of Orléans, {{gained control}} of the court of the insane Charles VI of France. The policy of {{rapprochement}} with the English crown did not suit Louis's political ambitions, {{and for this reason}} he found it opportune to allow Henry to leave for England. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> of followers, Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire towards the end of June 1399. Men {{from all over the country}} soon rallied around the duke. Meeting with Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, who had his own misgivings about the king, Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony. Percy took him at his word and declined to interfere. The king had taken most of his household knights and the loyal members of his nobility with him to Ireland, so Henry experienced little resistance as he moved south. Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, who was acting as Keeper of the Realm, had little choice but to side with Bolingbroke. Meanwhile, Richard was delayed in his return from Ireland and did not land in Wales until 24 July. He made his way to Conwy, where on 12 August he met with the Earl of Northumberland for negotiations. On 19 August, Richard II surrendered to Henry at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. Both men then returned to London, the indignant king riding all the way behind Henry. On arrival, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London on 1 September.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} cremation, {{which is a}} mock {{ceremonial}} burning, the king lights the cremation fire and lays the first —artificial flowers made of sandalwood and used ceremonially in cremations. The other guests then follow suit, laying flowers one by one. The ritual is repeated later in the night, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>group</b> of guests, when the actual cremation takes place. On the first lighting a 21-gun salute and a three-volley salute are fired in the Sanam Luang field.|$|R
