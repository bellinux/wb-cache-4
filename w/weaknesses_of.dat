40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to argue for libertarian freedom on the basis <b>of</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> will as a common {{possibility}} for human agents. The phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> will is widely acknowledged as a human possibility. Few contemporary philosophers, however, are proponents of libertarian freedom. I argue first that the possibility <b>of</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> will is implied by human agency. I then describe several sets of conditions philosophers have proposed to explain the apparent freedom necessary for <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> will and show that one proposal seems more adequate than the rest. The proposal I argue for is that the freedom needed for <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> will is the freedom to act on a resistible desire. Acting on a resistible desire is then defined and defended. I provide two ways of looking at acting on a resistible desire and show why one of these is more promising than the other. In conclusion I show that two contemporary compatibilist approaches to describing freedom conditions fail to work in the context <b>of</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> will and show that the freedom condition I have proposed works better. On the basis of these results I claim that all compatibilist freedom conditions will fail in similar ways. I claim, then, that libertarian freedom is the freedom necessary for <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> will. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{demands of}} the Punic Wars, {{in addition to a}} shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> the manipular legion, {{at least in the short}} term. In 217 BC, near the beginning of the Second Punic War, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners. During the 2nd century BC, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population, partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes. As a result, the Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, which it did not have to do in the past.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the story}} of Duke Karl Alexander and Joseph Süß Oppenheimer {{constituted}} a relatively obscure episode in German history, it {{became the subject of}} a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of more than a century; the earliest of these having been Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger's novel titled Jud Süß (1925) based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew. As a Jew, Feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of Süß to be antisemitic but rather as a study of the tragedy caused by the human <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> greed, pride, and ambition. With an interest in exploring the challenges confronting Jews in the Diaspora, Feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with the issues of conversion and antisemitism.

5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E
