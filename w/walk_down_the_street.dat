500|$|Following {{commercial}} success in Italy, the band did a six-week tour {{there at the}} start of 1972. The band were apprehensive about touring there, concerned they might be playing to half empty venues, but they were all shocked by the sheer volume of the crowds that came to see them. [...] "Pawn Hearts was seen as the ultimate album by the ultimate band," [...] said Jackson, who at times found it difficult to <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> in parts of Italy without being recognised. [...] "The tour was like the prophets have landed... you couldn't go anywhere without this lunatic 'Generator Mania' breaking out." [...] After the tour, the group was immediately offered another Italian tour, this time doing up to three shows a day. In between the tours, the band made an appearance on Belgian television performing [...] "Theme One" [...] and [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers". Since the studio recording of [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] was a collage of multiple recordings, impossible to reproduce live in one setting, the band simply filmed individual sections of the song and spliced them together in the editing suite. It was the only live performance of the song until 2013.|$|E
