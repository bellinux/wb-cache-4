5|$|In 'The Clearing of the Woodlands', Hoskins {{argues that}} before the 15th century England must have looked like one great forest, {{but most of the}} woods <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> for arable or pasture in the 12th and 13th centuries. Under Henry II perhaps a third of the country was royal forest.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{reservoirs}} for Liverpool Corporation in {{the mid-19th}} century led to {{a decrease in the}} population when farms <b>were</b> <b>cleared,</b> the valley flooded and property {{in the western part of}} the village demolished. William Lever bought the Rivington Hall estate at the turn of the 20th century and used his wealth to renovate the old barns and create a large public park.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{widespread}} power outages along the Florida Panhandle, electrical companies enlisted extra workers to repair downed lines. Officials {{had put a}} curfew in place for Tallahassee due to power outages created by the hurricane, and the curfew was lifted on November24 after power was gradually restored and roads <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> of debris. Police officers in the city arrested 20people for violating curfew or creating unrest.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, the 1950s and 1960s {{saw many}} large scale {{developments}} in the city. The Sheffield Tramway was closed, and {{a new system of}} roads, including the Inner Ring Road, were laid out. Also at this time many of the old slums <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> and replaced with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats, and the Gleadless Valley estate.|$|E

5|$|Haas and Creamer <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> of the {{plagiarism}} charge {{by their}} institutions. The Chicago Field Museum of Natural History’s science advisory council rebuked Haas for press releases and web pages that gave too little credit to Shady and inflated the couple’s role as discoverers.

5|$|Marcinkus {{arrived in}} France in mid-March 1940 and {{immediately}} requested acceptance into the French Air Force. Bureaucratic delays hindered his enlistment.

It is possible, however, that Marcinkus succeeded in shooting down several German military planes during his short career in the French air force.|$|E

5|$|Rum-runners {{used the}} Everglades as a hiding spot during Prohibition; {{it was so}} vast there were never enough law {{enforcement}} officers to patrol it. The arrival of the railroad, and the discovery that adding trace elements like copper was the remedy for crops sprouting and dying quickly, soon created a population boom. New towns such as Moore Haven, Clewiston, and Belle Glade sprouted like the crops. Sugarcane became the primary crop grown in South Florida. Miami experienced a second real estate boom that earned a developer in Coral Gables $150million. Undeveloped land north of Miami sold for $30,600 an acre. In 1925, Miami newspapers published editions weighing over , {{most of it in}} real estate advertising. Waterfront property was the most highly valued. Mangrove trees were cut down and replaced with palm trees to improve the view. Acres of South Florida slash pine <b>were</b> <b>cleared.</b> Some of the pine was for lumber, but most of the pine forests in Dade County <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> for development.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{increasingly}} rigorously maintained, {{and during the}} 1910s and 1920s the larger trees around the castle were cut down, and the animals <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> from {{the inner and outer}} baileys on the basis that they posed a health and safety risk to visitors. The 1930s saw a major effort to clear the remaining vegetation from the castle, the cellars <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> of debris by the government's Office of Works and the stable block was converted into a museum. Tourists continued to visit the castle, with the 1920s and 1930s seeing many day-trips by teams of workers in the region encouraged by the growth in motor transport. The open spaces inside the castle were used by the local townsfolk for football matches and similar events, and in 1934 Milton's Comus was restaged in the castle to mark the 300th anniversary of the first such event.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was removed}} from active service in January 1945 and reopened to the public the {{following}} year. The Second World War gun battery was finally closed in 1956 {{after several years of}} use as a training site. Between 1945 and 1970, much of the Victorian earthwork and concrete defences <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> from the Grand Sea Battery, and the 1941 battery was completely destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Warsaw {{and other}} ruined cities <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> of rubble — mainly by hand — and rebuilt with great speed (one of {{the successes of}} the Three-Year Plan) {{at the expense of}} former German cities like Wrocław, which often {{provided}} the needed construction material. Wrocław, Gdańsk, Szczecin and other formerly German cities were also completely rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|By 1964 over 20,000 {{new homes}} had been built, {{transforming}} the dense overcrowded and unsanitary slums of the pre-war city into a low density, dispersed suburbia. Most {{of the city}} centre shops had been destroyed and those that remained <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> to enable a zoned reconstruction according to his plan. In 1962 the modernist high rise of the Civic Centre was constructed, an architecturally significant example of mid-twentieth century civic slab-and-tower set piece. The Plymouth City Council allowed it to fall into disrepair but it was grade II listed in 2010 by English Heritage to prevent its demolition.|$|E
5|$|Captain Brown was court-martialed as {{a result}} of the incident, pleaded guilty, and was {{relieved}} of command of Missouri.

Four others were court-martialed, two <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> of all charges, one received a letter of reprimand, and one was reduced on the promotion list. Despite these setbacks, Missouri was repaired and returned to fleet. She stayed in commission throughout the Korean War, and—after the cease-fire agreement—was decommissioned into the United States Navy reserve fleets, where she remained until the 1980s. Despite proof to the contrary, rumors continue to circulate that Missouri suffered permanent damage {{as a result}} of the grounding incident.|$|E

5|$|Data on Kepler-40 was {{analyzed}} {{by a team}} of French and Swiss astronomers, who first tested for false positives. When all obvious false positives <b>were</b> <b>cleared,</b> the science team used the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France to gather radial velocity measurements on the star. Collected data was then checked to see if it corresponded with that of a closely orbiting binary star or that of a planet; it was found to be that of a planet, leading to the confirmation of Kepler-40b.|$|E
5|$|Despite Mashbir's dismissal, the {{outbreak}} of hostilities in World War II between Japan and the US, led to him being immediately sought after by the Signal Corps due to his military experience, wide technical skill {{and knowledge of the}} Japanese language. He was sworn in for active duty on 24 January 1942 and sent to Brisbane, Australia, and later Manila, Philippines to co-ordinate the inter-service joint Australian/American Allied Translator and Interpreter Section (ATIS), within the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). It was at this time that the suspicions which lingered about Mashbir's 1937 mission to Japan on behalf of Naval Intelligence <b>were</b> <b>cleared</b> up with the assistance of Admiral Zacharias, now Assistant Director of Naval Intelligence, interceding with the Assistant Chief of Staff of G2.|$|E
5|$|Echols {{recalled}} {{that the first}} scenes shot were those of Madonna walking down Lenox Avenue. While filming, the singer noticed a black leather coat with fur trim, worn by Fatima, the assistant director. Madonna asked for the coat from Fatima and ended up wearing it in the video. Echols also noted that Madonna had {{a close relationship with}} the cinematographer, and knew from which angle her shots would be the best and which lights to be used. After the misunderstandings regarding looks and the plot direction <b>were</b> <b>cleared,</b> the filming resumed and was finished within three days. The final scenes were with model Jason Olive in a Marlem house, with Madonna climbing steps and reaching him and their supposed child.|$|E
