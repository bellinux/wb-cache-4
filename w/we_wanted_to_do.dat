The first single La Belle Epoque was released on March 12 and the album Tigerdrottningen was released on April 30.

500|$|With Watchmen, Alan Moore's {{intention}} was to create four or five [...] "radically opposing ways" [...] to perceive {{the world and to}} give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible. Moore did not believe in the notion of [...] " [...] regurgitated morals" [...] down the readers' throats and instead sought to show heroes in an ambivalent light. Moore said, [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was show all of these people, warts and all. Show that even the worst of them had something going for them, and even the best of them had their flaws." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Scott {{made his}} first {{appearance}} as Jim Moriarty in [...] "The Great Game". Moffat said, [...] "We knew what <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Moriarty from the very beginning. Moriarty is usually a rather dull, rather posh villain so we thought someone who was genuinely properly frightening. Someone who's an absolute psycho." [...] Moffat and Gatiss were originally {{not going to put}} a confrontation between Moriarty and Holmes into these three episodes, but realised that they [...] "just had to do a confrontation scene. We had to do a version of the scene in 'The Final Problem' in which the two archenemies meet each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Glen Morgan {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Duchovny {{challenged}} us to do a [...] "Beyond the Sea" [...] for him. The {{show had}} been so dark and bleak, and Jim and I {{feel that there is}} a side to the paranormal that's very hopeful. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that side of it. I {{thought it would be a}} great opportunity for Duchovny, but then the situation came up with Gillian's pregnancy. We needed to get her off her feet anyway." [...] Consequently, Gillian Anderson, who had just given birth to her daughter Piper days before this episode spent the majority of the episode in a hospital bed.|$|E
500|$|According to Barrales, {{beyond the}} name, Bonded by Blood {{borrowed}} from Exodus for inspiration everything. [...] "From the guitars being razor-sharp to the drums, the speed. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something that resemble that. Something that is gonna be fast and in-your-face. And what better band than Exodus to be inspired by?" [...] Exodus' lead guitarist Gary Holt {{says that is}} a compliment that the band has named themselves after Bonded by Blood. [...] "Could I have imagined that {{all these years later}} a band was going to name themselves after our first album? Probably not. It is not like that convention—naming bands after songs—is something new, but I think it is great." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2008, EMI {{released}} a greatest hits album, [...] It was made without Radiohead's input and only contains songs released under their recording contract with EMI. Yorke {{was critical of}} the release, saying: [...] "There's {{nothing we can do}} about it. The work is really public property now anyway, in my head at least. It's a wasted opportunity in that if we'd been behind it, and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, then it might have been good." [...] In August 2008, EMI reissued [...] "special editions" [...] of Radiohead's back catalogue as part of its [...] "From the Capitol Vaults" [...] series. From mid-2008 to early 2009, Radiohead toured North America, Europe, Japan and South America to promote In Rainbows, and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2009.|$|E
500|$|Writer James Wong was {{disappointed}} with the episode, feeling that he [...] "didn't {{do a great job}} on the script. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a show that's all about paranoia and a conspiracy theory, but at the end I felt like we didn't really gain a lot of new ground or learn a lot of new things. I think we played a lot of texture instead of substance." [...] Series creator Chris Carter on the other hand claimed the episode {{was one of the most}} popular first-season episodes and thought the teaser and the scene with Mulder meeting Deep Throat at a shark tank were memorable. He also praised Jerry Hardin's performance in the episode, finding that he lent the show the [...] "believability" [...] that it needed.|$|E

500|$|Crew {{members have}} also reacted {{positively}} towards the episode. Carter {{said of the}} episode: The Erlenmeyer Flask' brings back nothing but good memories. It just has terrific images in it; it really brought the series {{in its first year}} full circle. It was successful in doing what <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> which was to close down the X-Files. It shocked a lot of people". Goodwin commented: [...] "Everything about that episode is absolutely first class. The acting, the art direction, the camera work. There's nothing in it that isn't the best you can get, and that's really a credit to a lot of very talented people". The episode introduced many concepts and themes that would appear in the mythology episodes for the show throughout the years including genetic experiments, alien-human hybrids, toxic alien blood, government conspiracies, alien fetuses and deadly assassins.|$|E
500|$|The film's climatic battle {{sequence}} {{takes place}} through the nine worlds {{by the use}} of portals. Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, [...] "We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was {{to make sure it was}} quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly. We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight. It was a way of making sure the audience weren't conscious there was an effect going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Folk metal {{has been}} {{associated}} with paganism ever since its inception, when Martin Walkyier left his former band Sabbat to form Skyclad, in part because the band [...] "wasn't going to go far enough down the pagan, British way that <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Consequently, the lyrics of Skyclad have been known to deal with pagan matters. The band Cruachan was also founded by a self-described pagan, Keith Fay. For Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow, the label [...] "pagan metal" [...] is preferred [...] "because that describes the ideological points in the music, but doesn’t say anything about the music itself." [...] Other bands that also prefer to use the term [...] "pagan metal" [...] as a self-description include Cruachan, Eluveitie, Obtest and Skyforger. In contrast to bands with pagan themes, some folk metal bands such as Orphaned Land have themes of Abrahamic religion.|$|E

500|$|Black Sabbath {{began work}} on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at Morgan Studios in Willesden, {{this time with a}} decisive vision to differ the sound from Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath. [...] "We could've {{continued}} and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn't particularly want to. We took a look at ourselves, and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a rock album – Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath wasn't a rock album, really." [...] Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher, Sabotage was released in July 1975. As with its precursor, the album initially saw favourable reviews, with Rolling Stone stating [...] "Sabotage is not only Black Sabbath's best record since Paranoid, it might be their best ever", although later reviewers such as AllMusic noted that [...] "the magical chemistry that made such albums as Paranoid and Volume 4 so special was beginning to disintegrate".|$|E
500|$|Krankel and Hines {{looked at}} other story-focused games, {{and felt that}} they either were linear stories driven by set pieces, or branching, player choice-influenced stories [...] told through cut scenes. [...] "We thought, why not let you move freely while communicating, interacting, and {{exploring}} a branching narrative?" [...] Krankel recalled. [...] "The first thing <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is make a game where communication is really sort of a key mechanic, but that people have more freedom than they do {{with all the other}} narrative-focused games. At its core, we wanted to never have a cut scene in the game, where you could walk and move freely and communicate with your friends, and even communicate with other beings and other kind of strange things." [...] Rather than developing the gameplay and attaching a story to it, Night School focused on developing gameplay that would support the story they wanted to tell.|$|E
500|$|... "Marilyn Monroe" [...] {{was first}} leaked in February 2012. On May 24, 2012, a poll was posted on Minaj's {{official}} website asking fans {{to choose the}} next single(s).

[...] "Marilyn Monroe" [...] had the most votes and won the poll; [...] "Young Forever" [...] came in second, [...] "Fire Burns" [...] came in third, and [...] "Gun Shot" [...] came in fourth. When asked whether [...] "Marilyn Monroe" [...] would become a single during an interview with The Guardian, Minaj replied: [...] "It has to be.

500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} the {{inspiration}} for the film, saying: [...] "I have always loved cars. In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there's motor oil. The notion of combining these two great passions in my life—cars and animation—was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, Dennings {{told reporters}} that the film was about to head into reshoots.

Taylor {{explained}} that it was all a part of the [...] "Marvel process" [...] saying, [...] "We're doing full scenes, scenes that were not in the movie before. We're adding scenes, creating scenes, writing scenes for the first time. The one [...] was a fun connective scene... We realised how well Loki was working in the movie, and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more with him. So {{it was that kind of}} thing, it was like, 'Oh, we could do this, we could jam this in here' because he's such a wonderful guy to watch do his stuff." [...] Also in August, IMAX Corporation and Marvel Entertainment announced that the film would be digitally re-mastered into the IMAX 3D format and released into IMAX 3D theatres internationally beginning October 30, 2013.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{have been}} {{critical}} of Hail to the Thief. In a 2006 interview with Spin, Yorke said: [...] "I'd maybe change the playlist. I think we had a meltdown when we put it together ... <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things quickly, and I think the songs suffered." [...] In 2008, O'Brien told Mojo he felt Radiohead should have cut the album to ten tracks and that its length had alienated some listeners. In the same interview, Colin Greenwood said he felt several songs were unfinished and that the album was [...] "more of a holding process". In 2013, Godrich told the NME: [...] "I think there's some great moments on there - but too many songs... As a whole I think it's charming {{because of the lack of}} editing. But personally it's probably my least favourite of all the albums ... It didn't really have its own direction. It was almost like a homogeny of previous work. Maybe that's its strength." ...|$|E
