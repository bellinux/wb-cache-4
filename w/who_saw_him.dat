5|$|Politically, Leopold {{disliked the}} Socialist party, preferring to {{negotiate}} with the Catholic Party, which held power for much of his reign. He was widely distrusted by politicians, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as meddling in state business and seeking to expand the power of the monarchy. Towards the end of his reign, public awareness of the atrocities committed under his colonial regime, as well as his marital infidelity, led to a significant fall the monarchy's popularity. Following his death in December 1909, his funeral cortege was booed.|$|E
5|$|Six months later, {{a second}} trial {{took place in}} Orlando for the {{abduction}} and murder of Kimberly Leach. Bundy was found guilty once again, after less than eight hours' deliberation, due principally to the testimony of an eyewitness <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> leading Leach from the schoolyard to his stolen van. Important material evidence included clothing fibers with an unusual manufacturing error, found in the van and on Leach's body, which matched fibers from the jacket Bundy was wearing when he was arrested.|$|E
5|$|Stricklett {{learned the}} spitball from minor league {{teammate}} George Hildebrand in 1902, who {{learned about it}} from Frank Corridon. Stricklett {{played an important role}} in popularizing the spitball. Stricklett taught the spitball to Jack Chesbro, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> use the pitch while pitching in minor league baseball. Though Chesbro had experimented with the pitch in the minor leagues, Stricklett showed him how to master it in 1904. Stricklett taught it to Ed Walsh while they roomed together with the White Sox.|$|E

5|$|Western {{attitudes towards}} killer whales have changed {{dramatically}} in recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness, {{starting with the}} first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as Moby Doll, a resident harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964. So little was known at the time, it was nearly {{two months before the}} whale's keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> Moby Doll was a docile, nonaggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans.|$|E
5|$|When King George IV died on 26 June 1830 without {{surviving}} legitimate issue, William succeeded him as King William IV. Aged 64, he was {{the oldest}} person yet to assume the British throne. Unlike his extravagant brother, William was unassuming, discouraging pomp and ceremony. In contrast to George IV, who tended {{to spend most of}} his time in Windsor Castle, William was known, especially early in his reign, to walk, unaccompanied, through London or Brighton. Until the Reform Crisis eroded his standing, he was very popular among the people, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as more approachable and down-to-earth than his brother.|$|E
5|$|At trial, crucial {{testimony}} {{came from}} Chi Omega sorority members Connie Hastings, who placed Bundy {{in the vicinity}} of the Chi Omega House that evening, and Nita Neary, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> leaving the sorority house clutching the oak murder weapon. Incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds Bundy had inflicted on Lisa Levy's left buttock, which forensic odontologists Richard Souviron and Lowell Levine matched to castings of Bundy's teeth. The jury deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting him on July 24, 1979 of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts of attempted first degree murder (for the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas) and two counts of burglary. Trial judge Edward Cowart imposed death sentences for the murder convictions.|$|E
50|$|Forslund's {{controversial}} preaching methods {{often made}} him an object of discussion. He was liked by many and hated by others. He raised debate and anger among many <b>who</b> only <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as a stubborn and provocative prophet of doom.|$|R
50|$|Lestaluhu {{was born}} to Abdul Latif Lestaluhu and Healthy Ohorella as the eighth child of eight. Nicknamed Dani by his friends Lestaluhu was {{discovered}} by Iwan Setiawan, a former U-17 national team coach, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> the <b>him</b> playing. Lestaluhu is Muslim.|$|R
50|$|He {{opened for}} the Everclear, <b>who</b> also <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> perform on the Promenade, when the {{alternative}} rock group {{appeared at the}} Roxy in Hollywood. His popularity at this three-day concert led to his participation of the Everclear's national tour (26 major cities) in 1996, receiving rave reviews.|$|R
5|$|Although Smith {{maintained}} his innocence, detectives quickly gathered evidence linking him to Corcoran's death {{and those of}} the other two women. Witnesses had seen him leaving the Rainbow with both Corcoran and Hyde, and he was the last person to see them both alive. CCTV footage from around Birmingham showed his distinctive car visiting key locations linked to the investigation, and even captured Hyde getting out at one point to visit a chemist. Smith was seen buying petrol from a filling station and driving near the area where Hyde's body was later discovered. Corcoran was seen on camera struggling with Smith outside Monte Carlo's. CCTV footage showed him driving around Bromsgrove, a town close to Droitwich, after killing Corcoran, and later film showed him returning to Birmingham. At least two witnesses recalled seeing Smith with blood on him: a motorist <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> buying petrol, and another who spoke with Smith about his appearance. Smith told the latter that he had been in a fight, although he had no visible signs of injury.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, Landis {{worked hard}} to protect Gresham's {{interests}} in the State Department, making friends with {{many members of the}} press. He was less popular among many of the Department's senior career officials, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as brash. When word leaked concerning President Cleveland's Hawaiian policy, the President was convinced Landis was the source of the information and demanded his dismissal. Gresham defended Landis, stating that Cleveland would have to fire both of them, and the President relented, later finding out that he was mistaken in accusing Landis. President Cleveland grew to like Landis, and when Gresham died in 1895, offered Landis the post of United States Ambassador to Venezuela. Landis declined the diplomatic post, preferring to return to Chicago to begin a law practice and to marry Winifred Reed, daughter of the Ottawa, Illinois postmaster. The two married July 25, 1895; they had two surviving children, a boy, Reed, and a girl, Susanne—a third child, Winifred, died almost immediately after being born.|$|E
5|$|Located in St John's Lodge in the Inner Circle of Regent's Park, the IOA {{was founded}} in 1937, largely by {{archaeologist}} Mortimer Wheeler, but until 1946 relied primarily upon volunteer lecturers. Childe's relationship with the conservative Wheeler was strained, the latter being intolerant of the shortcomings of others, something Childe made an effort never to be. He was popular among students, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as a kindly eccentric; they commissioned a bust of Childe from Marjorie Maitland Howard. His lecturing was nevertheless considered poor, as he often mumbled and walked into an adjacent room to find something while continuing to talk. He consistently referred to the socialist states of eastern Europe by their full official titles, and called towns by their Slavonic rather than Germanic names, further confusing his students. He was deemed better at giving tutorials and seminars, where he devoted more time to interacting with his students. As Director, Childe was not obliged to excavate, though he did undertake projects at the Orkney Neolithic burial tombs of Quoyness (1951) and Maes Howe (1954–55).|$|E

2500|$|Hogan's ball {{striking}} {{has also}} been described as being of near miraculous caliber by other very knowledgeable observers such as Jack Nicklaus, <b>who</b> only <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> play some years after his prime.

5|$|Nixon {{instructed}} Agnew {{to avoid}} personal {{attacks on the}} press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what might happen in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, the president renewed those instructions for the new candidate, Sargent Shriver.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, his {{character}} Cantinflas, whose identity became enmeshed with his own, was examined by media critics, philosophers, and linguists, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> variably as {{a danger to}} Mexican society, a bourgeois puppet, a kind philanthropist, a transgressor of gender roles, a pious Catholic, a verbal innovator, and a picaresque underdog.|$|E
25|$|His leg side keeping was on {{occasions}} as superlative as his nimble footed agility was amazing.

60|$|Fairy-than-a-Fairy, <b>who</b> now <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> for {{the first}} time in his real shape, hardly dared to gaze at him, fearing lest his {{appearance}} might not be in keeping with the voice and language which had won her heart.

50|$|Nonetheless, Duvalier enjoyed {{significant}} {{support among}} Haiti’s majority black rural population, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>him</b> {{a champion of}} their claims against the historically dominant mulatto elite. During his 14 years in power, he created a substantial black middle class, chiefly through government patronage. Duvalier also initiated the development of François Duvalier Airport, now known as Toussaint Louverture International Airport.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a safe}} boast, knowing as he {{did that}} Wilding would consent to no such thing; but it earned him a glance of greater kindliness from Ruth--who {{began to think that}} {{hitherto}} perhaps she had done him some injustice--and a look of greater admiration from Diana, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>him</b> her beau-ideal of the gallant lover.|$|R
25|$|Witnesses {{who came}} forward {{said that on}} the evening of 30 November, they had seen an {{individual}} resembling the dead man lying on his back in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> at around 7pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> from 7:30pm to 8pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did have the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man looking down at the sleeping man {{from the top of the}} steps that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.|$|E
25|$|The Senate's {{rejection}} of his nomination left Rutledge mentally ruined. On December 26, 1795, he attempted suicide by jumping off a wharf into Charleston Harbor. He was rescued by two slaves <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> drowning. Though the Senate remained in session through June 1, 1796, {{which would have}} been the automatic end of Rutledge's tenure following the rejection, Rutledge resigned from the Court two days later, on December 28, 1795, having served the briefest tenure of a Chief Justice of the United States.|$|E
25|$|On 5 August 2001, Minh fell at {{his home}} in Pasadena, California. He was taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, where he died the {{following}} night at the age of 85. He was buried in Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California. Minh's death was largely not mourned by overseas Vietnamese, who were still angry at him for ordering South Vietnamese soldiers to put their weapons down, and <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as the officer responsible for South Vietnam's fall.|$|E

Prescod served for eight months without being paid, before the job was taken away from him as {{it was felt that}} his ideas were too radical. Prescod moved on to another paper, The Liberal, which was where he found his voice. This paper was {{targeted}} at working- and middle-class people irrespective of colour. The paper got into financial difficulties and Prescod was able to buy it in partnership with a man called Thomas Harris. Harris allowed him editorial freedom and this led to problems with the establishment, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as challenging the plantocracy.|$|E
25|$|In Reformed theology, the Word of God {{takes several}} forms. Jesus Christ himself is the Word Incarnate. The prophecies about him {{said to be}} found in the Old Testament and the {{ministry}} of the apostles <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> and communicated his message are also the Word of God. Further, the preaching of ministers about God is the very Word of God because God is considered to be speaking through them. God also speaks through human writers in the Bible, which is composed of texts set apart by God for self-revelation. Reformed theologians emphasize the Bible as a uniquely important means by which God communicates with people. People gain knowledge of God from the Bible which cannot be gained in any other way.|$|E

2500|$|In this type, the {{position}} relativized {{is indicated by}} means of a personal pronoun in the same syntactic position as would ordinarily be occupied by a noun phrase of that type in the main clause—known as a resumptive pronoun. It is equivalent to saying [...] "The man <b>who</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> yesterday went home". Pronoun retention is very frequently used for relativization of inaccessible positions on the accessibility hierarchy. In Persian and Classical Arabic, for example, resumptive pronouns are required when the embedded role is other than the subject or direct object, and optional {{in the case of the}} direct object. Resumptive pronouns are common in non-verb-final languages of Africa and Asia, and also used by the Celtic languages of northwest Europe and Romanian ("Omul pe care l-am văzut ieri a mers acasă"/"The man <b>who</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> yesterday went home"). They also occur in deeply embedded positions in English, as in [...] "That's the girl that I don't know what she did", although this is sometimes considered non-standard.|$|R
