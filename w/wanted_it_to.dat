5|$|When I {{would look}} at the films as a whole, I would search for story reasons to use 3-D in {{different}} ways. In Toy Story, for instance, when the toys were alone in their world, I <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> feel consistent to a safer world. And when they went out to the human world, that's when I really blew out the 3-D to make it feel dangerous and deep and overwhelming.|$|E
5|$|When {{some of the}} behind-the-scenes footage {{was used}} in a BET Access Granted special, some of the scenes that Beyoncé was shown {{shooting}} did {{not appear in the}} finished video. Beyoncé said that the video did not turn out the way she <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be and she had to reshoot most of it. In post-production, she decided that it would be more artistic to play the events in reverse.|$|E
5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E

[...] "I {{would like to have}} a record out," [...] Hill told Billboard.com, [...] "but it hasn't been the right thing yet. I don't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be just another record. It's a lot of work to support a record, so I just <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be ... really great. I <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> represent where I am as a woman. I don't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be fake. I <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be authentic and real." [...] In mid-2011, Hill recorded a duet with George Strait on the song [...] "A Showman's Life" [...] which can be heard on Strait's album Here for a Good Time.|$|R

I <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> reflect my personality. I <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be in your face, I <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a beast. I <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be energetic and fun. When I record the ballads I want to cry. And if I go through a roller coaster recording this album then I want the listener {{to go through a}} roller coaster when they hear it." ...|$|R

5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be more than a mere continuation of the first.|$|E
5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} was handled {{by a team of}} seven people over the course of ten months. It was {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi, and was originally planned to be a Game Boy Color game about a private investigator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be easy enough for even his mother to play. While the original version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localization is set in the United States; this became an issue when localizing later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious.|$|E

5|$|Don Murphy was {{planning}} a , {{but when the}} United States launched the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Hasbro suggested adapting the Transformers franchise instead. Tom DeSanto joined Murphy {{because he was a}} fan of the series. They met with comic book writer Simon Furman, and cited the Generation 1 cartoon and comics as their main influence. They made the Creation Matrix their plot device, though Murphy had it renamed because of the film series The Matrix. DeSanto chose to write the treatment from a human point of view to engage the audience, while Murphy <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> have a realistic tone, reminiscent of a disaster film. The treatment featured the Autobots Optimus Prime, Ironhide, Jazz, Prowl, Arcee, Ratchet, Wheeljack, and Bumblebee, and the Decepticons Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Ravage, Laserbeak, Rumble, Skywarp and Shockwave.|$|E
5|$|I <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{be almost}} like a photo album, so every single scene {{is kind of like}} a picture that you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E
5|$|The Buzz on Maggie is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} created by Dave Polsky for Disney Channel. The series centers on an ambitious and expressive tween fly named Maggie Pesky {{and her family}} and friends. The show is set in Stickyfeet, a city for insects located in a dump. While conceptualizing the series, Polsky <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> contain a playful aspect at adolescence and director Dave Wasson formed the overall look of the characters, being heavily influenced by early Walt Disney cartoon shorts. The Buzz on Maggie was Disney's first series to be fully animated in Adobe Flash, a process done by Bardel Entertainment and Future Thought Productions.|$|E

5|$|The first area {{of major}} dispute was the manner {{by which the}} lower house would be apportioned. A {{minority}} <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be apportioned so that all states would have equal weight, though this was never seriously considered. Most wanted it apportioned in accordance with some mixture of property and population. Though there was discussion on how to calculate property for this purpose, the issue of property was later dropped because of its difficulty, and an assumption that property would closely correlate to population.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be the final entry in the series, as {{he felt he had}} explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice for All, he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi {{trying to come up with}} a way of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E
5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

5|$|Apollo Justice was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} 28 staff members. It was produced by Minae Matsukawa and directed by Mitsuru Endo, with character design and art by Kazuya Nuri, while series creator Shu Takumi wrote the game's scenario and took on a supervisory role. Takumi had wanted the series to end with the previous game, as he felt its main character, Phoenix Wright, had been fully explored and that his story had been told; he said {{that it is important to}} know when to end a story, that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it. When it was still decided that a fourth game would be made, Takumi <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> have a new main character and a new story; he did not plan to have Phoenix appear in the game, but his colleagues wanted him in the game in some form, which led to him being the accused in the first case in the game.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was planned to be {{released}} for the Game Boy Color, but after the development team were shown the Game Boy Advance system's screen and footage of Mega Man Battle Network, Takumi felt that the Game Boy Advance would be perfect for Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. The game {{was designed to be}} simple, as Takumi <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be easy enough for even his mother to play. As it was less common at the time to use professional voice actors, the game's voice clips were provided by the development team: each staff member recorded every sample that was needed for the game, and then the best ones were used. Takumi used his privilege as a director to cast himself as Phoenix, however, while Edgeworth was voiced by Iwamoto, and von Karma by Sugimori.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 2 April, a five-hour meeting of local political leaders took place in Kupres, {{at the request of}} JNA. The purpose of the meeting, attended by members of Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Biljana Plavšić and Franjo Boras, was to defuse the situation. While there was an agreement to establish an ethnically balanced police force in Kupres and remove the roadblocks, the opposing sides could not agree {{on the role of the}} JNA. The Bosnian Serbs wanted the JNA to deploy to Kupres itself to ensure their protection, while the Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> leave. During that same day, the 30th Partisan Division ordered the forces under its command, as well as the recent reinforcements, to capture Kupres and Kupreška Vrata and then hold their ground against anticipated Croatian counterattacks. Bosnian Croat authorities ordered the mobilisation of TO units in the nearby towns of Tomislavgrad and Posušje, with an armoured force at their disposal consisting of two T-55 tanks, two M36 tank destroyers, and one BVP M-80 infantry fighting vehicle.|$|E

5|$|Much of Sibelius's reputation, {{during his}} {{lifetime}} and subsequently, derived from {{his work as a}} symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time {{there was no reason to}} suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be even better than his Seventh.|$|E
5|$|The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is {{responsible}} for the scientific operation of the telescope and the delivery of data products to astronomers. STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) and is physically located in Baltimore, Maryland on the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University, one of the 39 US universities and seven international affiliates that make up the AURA consortium. STScI was established in 1981 after something of a power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large. NASA had wanted to keep this function in-house, but scientists <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be based in an academic establishment. The Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF), established at Garching bei München near Munich in 1984, provided similar support for European astronomers until 2011, when these activities were moved to the European Space Astronomy Centre.|$|E

Burke labelled her first album as [...] "very Americanised".|$|R
