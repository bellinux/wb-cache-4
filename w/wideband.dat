5|$|Konishi {{describes}} a <b>wideband</b> 12GHz band-pass filter, which uses 60° butterfly stubs {{and also has}} a low-pass response (short-circuit stubs are required to prevent such a response). As {{is often the case}} with distributed element filters, the bandform into which the filter is classified largely depends on which bands are desired and which are considered to be spurious.|$|E
25|$|Despite its {{reputation}} for poor audio quality, the mobile telephone industry {{has started to}} make some progress on <b>wideband</b> audio. The 3GPP standards group has designated G.722.2 as its <b>wideband</b> codec and calls it Adaptive Multirate – <b>Wideband</b> (AMR-WB). A few handsets have been produced supporting this codec (for example, HTC, Nokia , Samsung and Sony), and network demonstrations have been conducted.|$|E
25|$|Edwin Howard Armstrong (1890–1954) was an American {{electrical}} engineer who invented <b>wideband</b> frequency modulation (FM) radio.|$|E
25|$|Communications via Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) {{can readily}} employ <b>wideband</b> audio. When PC-to-PC calls are placed via VoIP services, such as Skype, and the {{participants}} use a high-quality headset, the resulting call quality can be noticeably superior to conventional PSTN calls. Some of the handsets manufactured by Nokia which run S60 and Series40 OS that support VoIP also support <b>wideband</b> audio. A number of audio codecs have emerged to support these services, supplementing G.722.|$|E
25|$|WDM, DWDM and CWDM {{are based}} on the same concept of using {{multiple}} wavelengths of light on a single fiber, but differ in the spacing of the wavelengths, number of channels, and the ability to amplify the multiplexed signals in the optical space. EDFA provide an efficient <b>wideband</b> amplification for the C-band, Raman amplification adds a mechanism for amplification in the L-band. For CWDM, <b>wideband</b> optical amplification is not available, limiting the optical spans to several tens of kilometres.|$|E
25|$|Optical receivers, in {{contrast}} to laser sources, tend to be <b>wideband</b> devices. Therefore, the demultiplexer must provide the wavelength selectivity of the receiver in the WDM system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wideband</b> audio {{has been}} broadly {{deployed}} {{in conjunction with}} videoconferencing. Providers of this technology quickly discovered that despite the explicit emphasis on video transmission, {{the quality of the}} participant experience was significantly influenced by the fidelity of the associated audio signal.|$|E
25|$|A <b>wideband</b> {{amplifier}} has {{a precise}} amplification factor {{over a wide}} frequency range, and {{is often used to}} boost signals for relay in communications systems. A narrowband amp amplifies a specific narrow range of frequencies, to the exclusion of other frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Frequency {{modulation}} can {{be classified}} as narrowband if {{the change in the}} carrier frequency is about the same as the signal frequency, or as <b>wideband</b> if the change in the carrier frequency is much higher (modulation indexnbsp&>nbsp&1) than the signal frequency.|$|E
25|$|Conference {{calls are}} a direct {{beneficiary}} of the enhancements offered by <b>wideband</b> audio. Participants often struggle {{to figure out who}} is talking, or to understand accented speakers. Misunderstandings are commonplace due primarily to generally poor audio quality and an accumulation of background noise.|$|E
25|$|Orthogonal {{frequency-division}} multiplexing (OFDM) {{is a method}} of encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies. OFDM has developed into a popular scheme for <b>wideband</b> digital communication, used in applications such as digital television and audio broadcasting, DSL Internet access, wireless networks, powerline networks, and 4G mobile communications.|$|E
25|$|PMC-Sierra offers {{communication}} ICs for metro access, metro transport, FTTH/PON, Ethernet over SONET/SDH, Optical Transport Network (OTN) {{and wireless}} base transceiver stations (BTS). PMC-Sierra sells products {{for what is}} known as Ethernet in the first mile, which generally uses a passive optical network to residential areas. PMC-Sierra semiconductor devices allow wireless service providers to deploy wireless mobile phone network equipment. This includes MIPS-based network processors for wireless back haul and radio frequency integrated circuits for <b>wideband</b> radio modules. The company's UniTRX chipsets are highly integrated, low-power RFICs for <b>wideband</b> radio modules that operate in the 400MHz to 4GHz frequency range. These solutions address the performance requirements of 3GPP and 3GPP2 macro base station radio transceivers and support multiple standards such as MC-GSM, cdma2000®, WCDMA, and LTE.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) {{standardized}} {{a version}} of <b>wideband</b> audio known as G.722. Radio broadcasters began using G.722 over Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) to provide high-quality audio for remote broadcasts, such as commentary from sports venues. AMR-WB (G.722.2) was developed by Nokia and VoiceAge and it was first specified by 3GPP.|$|E
25|$|The {{orthogonality}} {{allows for}} efficient modulator and demodulator implementation using the FFT algorithm on the receiver side, and inverse FFT on the sender side. Although {{the principles and}} some of the benefits have been known since the 1960s, OFDM is popular for <b>wideband</b> communications today by way of low-cost digital signal processing components that can efficiently calculate the FFT.|$|E
25|$|For {{indirect}} FM modulation, {{the message}} signal is integrated {{to generate a}} phase-modulated signal. This is used to modulate a crystal-controlled oscillator, {{and the result is}} passed through a frequency multiplier to produce an FM signal. In this modulation, narrowband FM is generated leading to <b>wideband</b> FM later and hence the modulation is known as indirect FM modulation.|$|E
25|$|The Vietnam War's {{requirement}} for high-quality telephone and message circuits {{led to the}} Signal Corps' deployment of tropospheric-scatter radio links that could provide many circuits between locations more than 200 miles apart. Other developments included the SYNCOM satellite communications service, and a commercial fixed-station system known as the Integrated <b>Wideband</b> Communications System, the Southeast Asia link in the Defense Communications System.|$|E
25|$|The delay, itself, {{comes from}} a special cable {{with a pair of}} {{conductors}} wound around a flexible, magnetically soft core. The coiling provides distributed inductance, while a conductive layer close to the wires provides distributed capacitance. The combination is a <b>wideband</b> transmission line with considerable delay per unit length. Both ends of the delay cable require matched impedances to avoid reflections.|$|E
25|$|The SETI Net station {{consists}} of off-the-shelf, consumer-grade electronics to minimize cost {{and to allow}} this design to be replicated as simply as possible. It has a 3-meter parabolic antenna that can be directed in azimuth and elevation, an LNA that covers the 1420MHz spectrum, a receiver to reproduce the <b>wideband</b> audio, and a standard personal computer as the control device and for deploying the detection algorithms.|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} used determine the substrate's dielectric constant. This constant is also dependent on frequency, usually decreasing with frequency. As this constant determines the signal propagation speed, frequency dependence introduces phase distortion in <b>wideband</b> applications; as flat dielectric constant vs frequency characteristics as achievable is important here. The impedance of transmission lines decreases with frequency, therefore faster edges of signals reflect more than slower ones.|$|E
25|$|Sony first {{demonstrated}} a <b>wideband</b> analog high-definition television system HDTV capable video camera, monitor and {{video tape recorder}} (VTR) in April 1981 at an international meeting of television engineers in Algiers. The HDVS range was launched in April 1984, with the HDC-100 camera, HDV-100 video recorder and HDS-100 video switcher all working in the 1125-line component video format with interlaced video and a 5:3 aspect ratio.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{carriers}} {{around the world have}} rolled out HD voice services based on the G.722 <b>wideband</b> standard. In North America, hosted service providers have recently deployed the Aastra Hi-Q upgrade to its installed user base and as of January 2010 claimed around 70,000 HD voice endpoints. Consumer service provider ooma has an estimated 25,000 HD voice endpoints deployed stemming from its roll out of its second-generation Telo hardware.|$|E
25|$|FM is {{commonly}} used at VHF radio frequencies for high-fidelity broadcasts of music and speech. Analog TV sound is also broadcast using FM. Narrowband FM is used for voice communications in commercial and amateur radio settings. In broadcast services, where audio fidelity is important, <b>wideband</b> FM is generally used. In two-way radio, narrowband FM (NBFM) is used to conserve bandwidth for land mobile, marine mobile and other radio services.|$|E
25|$|Being a {{very wide}} band in HF terms, many {{different}} transmission modes {{can be found on}} 10 meters. Morse code and other narrowband modes are found toward the bottom portion of the band, SSB from 28.300MHz up, and <b>wideband</b> modes (AM and FM) are found near {{the upper part of the}} bottom portion of the band. Digital modes, such as PSK-31, are also allowed in the upper portion of the band, with 28.120 being a popular PSK-31 frequency.|$|E
25|$|ATK {{produces}} Graphite Epoxy Motors {{and numerous}} other components for the Delta IV rocket. For example, for the Delta IV that carried the <b>Wideband</b> Global SATCOM satellite (WGS-6) into orbit for the U.S. Air Force, ATK supplied the interstage connector that linked the Common Booster Core and the cryogenic second stage, a centerbody that connects the liquid oxygen tank to liquid hydrogen tanks, a thermal shield for the RS-68 engine, the composite payload fairing, and numerous pieces of hardware for securing the payload.|$|E
25|$|DTTV is {{received}} either via a digital set-top box (STB), TV gateway or integrated tuner included with television sets, that decodes the signal received via a standard television antenna. Some set-top-boxes and TV gateways include {{digital video recorder}} (DVR) functionality. However, due to frequency planning issues, an aerial capable of receiving a different channel group (usually a <b>wideband)</b> may be required if the DTTV multiplexes lie outside the reception capabilities of the originally installed aerial. This is quite common in the UK; see external links.|$|E
25|$|In telecommunications, {{frequency}} modulation (FM) conveys information over a carrier wave by varying its frequency. While {{working in the}} basement laboratory of Columbia's Philosophy Hall, Edwin Armstrong invented wide-band {{frequency modulation}} radio in 1933. Rather than varying the amplitude of a radio wave to create sound, Armstrong's method varied {{the frequency of the}} wave instead. FM radio broadcasts delivered a much clearer sound, free of static, than the AM radio dominant at the time. Armstrong received a patent on <b>wideband</b> FM on December 26, 1933.|$|E
25|$|DAB {{has been}} under {{development}} since 1981 at the Institut für Rundfunktechnik (IRT). The first DAB demonstrations were held in 1985 at the WARC-ORB in Geneva, and in 1988 the first DAB transmissions were made in Germany. Later, DAB was developed as a research project for the European Union (EUREKA), which started in 1987 on initiative by a consortium formed in 1986. The MPEG-1 Audio Layer II ("MP2") codec was created {{as part of the}} EU147 project. DAB was the first standard based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique, which since then {{has become one of the}} most popular transmission schemes for modern <b>wideband</b> digital communication systems.|$|E
25|$|The November 2009 {{launch window}} of Atlantis, between November 16 and November 20, was {{complicated}} by {{the launch of the}} Mini-Russian Research Module 2 (MRM-2) aboard a Soyuz-U rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Further conflict was caused by Eastern Range constraints with two other satellite launches from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, one {{at the beginning of the}} shuttle's launch window and the other at the end. The Eastern Range had been reserved on November 14 and 15, 2009, for the launch of the communications satellite Intelsat 14 aboard an Atlas-V rocket. A Delta-IV rocket carrying a <b>Wideband</b> Global SATCOM satellite was also expected to lift off on November 19, 2009.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{advantage}} of OFDM over single-carrier schemes {{is its ability}} to cope with severe channel conditions (for example, attenuation of high frequencies in a long copper wire, narrowband interference and frequency-selective fading due to multipath) without complex equalization filters. Channel equalization is simplified because OFDM may be viewed as using many slowly modulated narrowband signals rather than one rapidly modulated <b>wideband</b> signal. The low symbol rate makes the use of a guard interval between symbols affordable, making it possible to eliminate intersymbol interference (ISI) and utilize echoes and time-spreading (on analogue TV these are visible as ghosting and blurring, respectively) to achieve a diversity gain, i.e. a signal-to-noise ratio improvement. This mechanism also facilitates the design of single frequency networks (SFNs), where several adjacent transmitters send the same signal simultaneously at the same frequency, as the signals from multiple distant transmitters may be combined constructively, rather than interfering as would typically occur in a traditional single-carrier system.|$|E

500|$|PIFAs are {{a variant}} of the patch antenna. [...] Many {{variants}} of this, and other forms of the inverted-F, exist that implement <b>wideband</b> or multi-band antennae. [...] Techniques include coupled resonators and the addition of slots.|$|E
500|$|Staggered tuning is of most {{benefit in}} <b>wideband</b> applications. [...] It was {{formerly}} {{commonly used in}} television receiver IF amplifiers. [...] However, SAW filters {{are more likely to}} be used in that role nowadays. [...] Staggered tuning has advantages in VLSI for radio applications such as wireless LAN. [...] The low spread of component values make it much easier to implement in integrated circuits than traditional ladder networks.|$|E
500|$|A {{diplexer}} is {{a device}} used to combine two signals occupying different frequency bands {{into a single}} signal. [...] This is usually to enable two signals to be transmitted simultaneously on the same communications channel, or to allow transmitting on one frequency while receiving on another. (This specific use of a diplexer is called a duplexer.) The same device {{can be used to}} separate the signals again {{at the far end of}} the channel. [...] The need for filtering to separate the signals while receiving is fairly self-evident but it is also required even when combining two transmitted signals. [...] Without filtering, some of the power from source A will be sent towards source B instead of the combined output. [...] This will have the detrimental effects of losing a portion of the input power and loading source A with the output impedance of source B thus causing mismatch. [...] These problems could be overcome with the use of a [...] directional coupler, but as explained in the previous section, a <b>wideband</b> design requires a filter design for directional couplers as well.|$|E
500|$|A simple form of {{directional}} coupler is two parallel transmission lines coupled together over a λ/4 length. [...] This design is limited because the electrical {{length of the}} coupler will only be λ/4 at one specific frequency. [...] Coupling will be a maximum at this frequency and fall away on either side. [...] Similar to the impedance matching case, this can be improved by using multiple elements, resulting in a filter-like structure. [...] A waveguide analogue of this coupled lines approach is the Bethe-hole {{directional coupler}} in which two parallel waveguides are stacked {{on top of each}} other and a hole provided for coupling. [...] To produce a <b>wideband</b> design, multiple holes are used along the guides [...] as shown in figure 14 and a filter design applied. [...] It is not only the coupled-line design that suffers from being narrow band, all simple designs of waveguide coupler depend on frequency in some way. [...] For instance the rat-race coupler (which can be implemented directly in waveguide) works on a completely different principle but still relies on certain lengths being exact in terms of λ.|$|E
