50|$|Steelyards of {{different}} sizes {{have been used to}} <b>weigh</b> <b>loads</b> ranging from ounces to tons. A small steelyard could be a foot or less in length and thus conveniently used as a portable device that merchants and traders could use to weigh small ounce-sized items of merchandise. In other cases a steelyard could be several feet long and used to weigh sacks of flour and other commodities. Even larger steelyards were three stories tall and used to weigh fully laden horse-drawn carts.|$|R

40|$|A pad is {{disclosed}} {{for use in}} a {{weighing system}} for <b>weighing</b> a <b>load.</b> The pad includes a <b>weighing</b> platform, <b>load</b> cells, and foot members. Improvements to the pad reduce or substantially eliminate rotation of {{one or more of the}} corner foot members. A flexible foot strap disposed between the corner foot members reduces rotation of the respective foot members about vertical axes through the corner foot members and couples the corner foot members such that rotation of one corner foot member results in substantially the same amount of rotation of the other comer foot member. In a strapless variant one or more fasteners prevents substantially all rotation of a foot member. In a diagonal variant, a foot strap extends between a corner foot member and the weighing platform to reduce rotation of the foot member about a vertical axis through the comer foot member...|$|R
