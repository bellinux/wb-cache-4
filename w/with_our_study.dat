These findings include: a higher death rate after the invasion; a 58-fold increase in death from violence, making it the main cause of death; and most violent deaths being caused by air-strikes from Coalition Forces. Whether the true death toll is 90000 or 150000, these three findings give ample guidance towards understanding what must happen to reduce civilian deaths.... Before publication, the article was critically reviewed by many leading authorities in statistics and public health and their suggestions were incorporated into the paper. The death toll estimated by our study is indeed imprecise, and those interested in international law and historical records should not be content <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>study.</b> We encourage Apfelroth and others to improve on our efforts. In the interim, we feel this study, as well as the only other published sample survey we know of on the subject, point to violence from the Coalition Forces as the main cause of death and remind us that the number of Iraqi deaths is certainly many times higher than reported by passive surveillance methods or in press accounts." ...|$|E

Secondly, in line <b>with</b> <b>our</b> observational <b>study</b> design, muscle strength or other functional outcomes were not assessed. Moreover, the protective effect of early mobilization has to be considered as an observation in <b>our</b> <b>study</b> cohort and must be confirmed by a randomized controlled trial.

40|$|In line <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>studies</b> on propafenone-type inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), we applied sev-eral {{methods to}} {{approach}} virtual screening tools for identification of new P-gp inhibitors {{on one hand}} and the molecular basis of ligand–protein interaction on the other hand. For virtual screen-ing, a combination of autocorrelation vectors and selforganising artificial neural networks proved extremely valuable in identifying P-gp inhibitors with structurally new scaffolds. For a closer view on the binding region for propafenone-type ligands we applied a combination of phar-macophore-driven photoaffinity labeling and protein homology modeling. On LmrA, a bacterial homologue of P-gp, we were able to identify distinct regions on transmembrane helices 3, 5 and 6 which show significant changes in the labeling pa�ern during different steps of the catalytic cycle...|$|R

Stable formulations of this highly functionalized Ru(III) complex have been obtained by co-aggregation with either the zwitterionic lipid POPC or the cationic DOTAP, which {{have been subjected to}} an in-depth microstructural characterization, including DLS, SANS and EPR measurements.

30|$|One of the {{strengths}} of <b>our</b> <b>study</b> was that breast cancer risk factors such as reproductive factors, BMI and alcohol drinking were controlled for in the analysis.

Some previous studies had not been considered the confounding effects of such risk factors (Palmer and Rosenberg 1993; Nagata et al. 2006; Johnson 2005). Another strength was the low rate of missing data (8.2 %) for hormone receptor status. Compared <b>with</b> <b>our</b> present <b>study,</b> the rates of missing data in some previous studies, including cohort studies, were relatively high (Yoo et al. 1997; London et al. 1989).|$|R
