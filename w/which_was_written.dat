5|$|That year, Bach {{presented}} 18 cantatas by his relative Johann Ludwig Bach who was court musician in Meiningen. Bach {{seems to}} have been impressed also by the texts of those cantatas and follows similar structures: seven movements, divided in two parts to be performed before and after the sermon, both parts opened by Bible words, Part I by a quotation from the Old Testament, Part II by one from the New Testament. Bach composes some texts that his relative set before, including this cantata, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>written</b> by Ernst Ludwig, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, according to Christoph Wolff. The cantata is regarded as part of Bach's third annual cycle.|$|E

Old English was also used for academic and courtly writing from the 9th century onwards, including translations of popular foreign works, including The Pastoral Care.|$|E

5|$|The song Yerushalayim Shel Zahav ("Jerusalem of Gold") is {{featured}} in the film's soundtrack and plays {{near the end of}} the film.
