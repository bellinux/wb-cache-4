5|$|The {{government}} {{took control of}} deciding how much the prices should rise in a year, {{as long as the}} subsidy cuts on gasoline and other refined products, natural gas, electricity, water, food (sugar, rice, cooking oil and bread), health and education are between $10 and 20 billion dollars annually. Estimates indicate that the government has to increase existing prices by an average of 2.5 times to achieve the lower target and by 4 times for the maximum target. According to the IMF, Iranians can expect the first price hike to lift energy product prices between four and 20 times previous levels, <b>with</b> <b>prices</b> surging even higher eventually.|$|E

The event is alternatively known as WrestleMania 30. On August 12, travel packages for WrestleMania XXX went on sale, which included tickets to WrestleMania, hotel room accommodation, and other activities including WrestleMania Axxess, the 2014 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, and the next Raw; the cheapest package cost $795 per person. On November 16, individual tickets went on sale through Ticketmaster, <b>with</b> <b>prices</b> ranging from $25 to $850. While ordering WrestleMania through pay-per-view television costs between $55 – $70, WWE has also made WrestleMania XXX available live through its new WWE Network online streaming service, which costs $9.99 per month with a six-month contract; WrestleMania was the first event available simultaneously on pay-per-view and on the WWE Network.|$|E
5|$|According to the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, after {{mephedrone}} {{was made}} illegal, a street {{trade in the}} drug emerged, <b>with</b> <b>prices</b> around double those prior to the ban, at £20–£25 per gram. In September 2010, Druglink reported the ban had had a mixed effect on mephedrone use, with it decreasing in some areas, remaining similar in others and becoming more prevalent in some areas. In an online survey of 150 users after the ban, 63% said they were continuing to use mephedrone, half of those used the same amount and half said they used less. Compared to previous surveys, more users purchased it from dealers, rather than the internet. The average price per gram was £16, compared to around £10 before the ban. The 2010 Mixmag survey of 2,500 nightclubbers found one quarter had used mephedrone in the previous month, the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, and it {{was more likely to}} be cut with other substances. Of those who had already used mephedrone prior to the ban, 75% had continued to use it after the ban. Of the various drugs used by the survey participants, users {{were more likely to have}} concerns about it. Interviews with users in Northern Ireland also found the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, to around £30 a gram. Rather than the price rising due to increased scarcity of the drug, it is thought to have risen for two other reasons. Firstly, dealers knew there was still demand for mephedrone, but were aware the supplies may be exhausted in the future. Secondly, the dealers perceived customers were likely to be willing to pay more for an illegal substance.|$|E

50|$|The new Keynesian {{explanation}} of price stickiness relied on introducing imperfect competition <b>with</b> <b>price</b> (and wage) setting agents. This started {{a shift in}} macroeconomics away from using the model of perfect competition <b>with</b> <b>price</b> taking agents to using imperfectly competitive equilibria <b>with</b> <b>price</b> and wage setting agents (mostly adopting monopolistic competition). Huw Dixon and Claus Hansen showed that even if menu costs applied to a small sector of the economy, this would influence {{the rest of the}} economy and lead to prices in {{the rest of the economy}} becoming less responsive to changes in demand.|$|R
