The proposed strategy also allows to avoid the undesired yaw moment in the vehicle which occurs when road conditions {{on either side of}} it are dierent. This improves the eciency and the control of the vehicle, avoiding possible losses of stability that can result in risks for its occupants. Both the proposed observer and the control strategy are designed based on a dynamic rotational model of the wheel and a brush force model.

To achieve its goals, such a robot continuously estimates its current position. To this end, it can use its dead reckoning system to localize itself, but due to <b>wheel</b> <b>slippages,</b> the data given by the wheel encoders don't accurately reflect the real position of the robot.

40|$|Tire {{pressure}} and wheel load are both easily managed parameters which {{play a significant}} role in tillage operations for limiting slip which involves energy loss. To a great extent, this aspect affects the fuel consumption and the time required for soil tillage. The study was focused on the tire {{pressure and}} extra weight variation effect on fuel consumption and work productivity for soil tillage at normal tractor <b>wheels</b> <b>slippage</b> (7 - 15 %). The experimental research unit composed of an 82. 3 kW 4 WD tractor and a reversible 4 -bodies plough is presented. Tests were carried out on a stubble loam, where slip of tractor driving wheels was 15 %, tractor front ballast mass was varied in the range from 0 to 520 kg and inflation pressure in the tires from 240 kPa to 100 kPa. Dependences of tractor performance indicators on ballast mass and tires inflation pressure are presented. When tractor tire slip varies in the range from 7 to 15 percent (which is normal slip in the soil), reducing the tires inflation pressure decreases the driving wheel slip and fuel consumption, while increases work productivity. Increasing the additional mass of the tractor (adding ballast weights) decreases the driving wheel slip, increases work productivity, but also increases fuel consumption and soil compaction...|$|R
50|$|In {{the design}} of wheeled or tracked vehicles, high {{traction}} between wheel and ground is more desirable than low traction, as it allows for higher acceleration (including cornering and braking) without <b>wheel</b> <b>slippage.</b> One notable exception is in the motorsport technique of drifting, in which rear-wheel traction is purposely lost during high speed cornering.|$|E

Recently, environmental issues {{led to the development}} of electrical ATVs, that are able to provide zero emissions, more silent and cheaper operations. Thus far, these vehicles have always been driven by humans, but the last technological developments allow the implementation of self-driving and autonomous vehicles. This is an attractive possibility to help off-road workers to gain more flexibility and autonomy in their activities and an help in rescue operations as well. A crucial part in the autonomous vehicles field is the braking performance, even more important if we consider the kind of surfaces on which these vehicles are meant to go. The problem of the <b>wheels</b> <b>slippage</b> has been deeply considered for road vehicles, but few solutions and application have been implemented for off-road ones. In this final project, an introduction study in this sense is made, focusing on the brake system modelling and evaluation of some ABS solution. The vehicle in use is a Polaris Ranger. Many slip and braking system controls have been investigated: the newest and most complex of them allow to get really high control performances and they can cope with the system modelling uncertainties. One the most promising is the sliding mode control (SMC) for its trade-off between complexity and ability to face the uncertainties.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the redesign {{of the second}} version of the Mantis hybrid leg-wheel mobile robot, conceived for surveillance and inspection tasks in unstructured indoor and outdoor environments. This small-scale ground mobile robot {{is characterized by a}} main body equipped with two front actuated wheels, a passive rear axle and two rotating legs. Motion on flat and even ground is purely wheeled in order to obtain high speed, high energetic efficiency and stable camera vision; only in case of obstacles or ground irregularities the front legs realize a mixed leg-wheel locomotion to increase the robot climbing ability; in particular, the outer profile of the legs, inspired by the praying mantis, is specially designed to climb square steps. Themultibody simulations and the experimental tests on the first prototype have shown the effectiveness of the mixed leg-wheel locomotion not only for step climbing, but also on uneven and yielding terrains. Nevertheless, extensive experimental tests have shown that the front wheels may slip in the last phase of step climbing in case of contact with some materials. In order to overcome this problem, the leg design has been modified with the introduction of auxiliary passive wheels, which reduce friction between legs and step upper surface; these wheels are connected to the legs by one-way bearings, in order to rotate only when they are pulled by the front wheels, and remaining locked when they have to push forward the robot. The influence of the auxiliary wheels on the front <b>wheels</b> <b>slippage</b> is investigated by means of theoretical analysis and multibody simulations...|$|R
