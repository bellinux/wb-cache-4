5|$|Many of the Green Mountain Boys {{objected to}} Arnold's wish to command, insisting that they <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> rather than serve under {{anyone other than}} Ethan Allen. Arnold and Allen worked out an agreement, but no {{documented}} evidence exists concerning the deal. According to Arnold, he was given joint command of the operation. Some historians have supported Arnold's contention, while others suggest he was merely given the right to march next to Allen.|$|E

500|$|However Lloyd Webber {{was still}} wary about Madonna's singing, so after {{securing}} the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader. Since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts, the training helped in increasing Madonna's {{confidence in the}} songs. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater— its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had." [...] She taught Madonna how to sing using her diaphragm rather than just her throat, enabling her to project her voice in a more cohesive manner. Madonna was thrilled to find the newly discovered nuances in her voice and <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> every night, practicing by telephoning her friends and singing to them.|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers {{were denied}} {{permission}} to film in North India and Amer Fort {{due to the}} government finding the script offensive. The government demanded many script changes, rewritings and final cut privilege. As a result, location work went to Kandy, Sri Lanka, with matte paintings and scale models applied for the village, temple, and Pankot Palace. Budgetary inflation also caused Temple of Doom to cost $28.17 million, $8 million more than Raiders of the Lost Ark. Filming began on April 18, 1983 in Kandy, and moved to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England on May 5. Producer Frank Marshall recalled, [...] "when filming the bug scenes, crew members <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and find bugs in their hair, clothes and shoes." [...] Eight out of the nine sound stages at Elstree housed the filming of Temple of Doom. Lucas biographer Marcus Hearn observed, [...] "Douglas Slocombe's skillful lighting helped disguise the fact that about 80 percent of the film was shot with sound stages." ...|$|E
500|$|The Theater Round {{was held}} between August 1 and August 3, 2006 at the Cultural Center of the Philippines. A total of 169competitors {{received}} the Gold Pass {{from the three}} main judges, 119 from Luzon and Metro Manila, 17 from Davao, and 33 from Cebu. However, only 157 showed up for the Theater Round as other Gold Passers either backed out or were allegedly [...] "pirated" [...] to join rival talent search Pinoy Dream Academy. [...] They were billeted at the Bayview Park Hotel, where Gold Passers from outside Luzon arrived after a first-class trip in Super Ferry, while the Luzon contenders were picked up in selected SM Malls. [...] The contestants were divided into 11groups with 15members. [...] Each contestant performed an a cappella, after which the judges selected who <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and advance to the next round. [...] From 157contestants, 84 were chosen to proceed to the group performance, with each group having three members. The list was trimmed down further to 40contestants, each of which sang solo with a piano accompaniment. [...] Eventually the judges selected the 24contestants who would compete in the Semi-Final Round. [...] The Top 24 was officially announced on August 27, 2006.|$|E
2500|$|In general, the {{recently}} arrived Spanish colonists, who settled in villages, and Apache bands developed {{a pattern of}} interaction over a few centuries. Both raided and traded with each other. Records of the period {{seem to indicate that}} relationships depended upon the specific villages and specific bands that were involved with each other. For example, one band might be friends with one village and raid another. When war happened between the two, the Spanish would send troops, after a battle both sides would [...] "sign a treaty," [...] and both sides <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Herb Rogoff, {{an editor}} at Hillman and at Ziff-Davis, {{recalled}} in a 2004 interview that Schroeder [...] "wrote {{a lot of his}} own stories on 'Airboy' and 'The Heap'. His spelling was atrocious and we had to straighten out some of his sentence structures, but he was very imaginative. He was just natively bright, and was a marvelous conceptualist. Ernie and [...] Ed Cronin plotted stories together at lunch, and then Ernie <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and write them. He and I worked the same way on G.I. Joe at Ziff-Davis." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{highlighted}} Davis's {{ability to}} shape her future artistic ventures, {{as not only}} did she have a significant role in influencing the decisions over her co-stars, the choice of director was predicated on a need to have a compliant individual at the helm. Davis previously had worked with Irving Rapper on films where he served as a dialogue director, but his gratitude for her support turned into a grudging realization that Davis could control the film. Although his approach was conciliatory, the to-and-fro with Davis slowed production and [...] "he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> evenings angry and exhausted". The dailies, however, showed a [...] "surprisingly effective" [...] Davis {{at the top of her}} form.|$|E
2500|$|In this season, {{maintaining}} the previous season's format, there are 12 {{weeks of the}} finals and 13 finalists, with one finalist eliminated per week based on the American public's votes (exceptions include Top 13-week, where the judges were able to decide who <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> based on the lowest votes between {{the male and female}} contestants, and Top 12-week, where Jermaine Jones was disqualified). Previous season's winner Scotty McCreery recorded the Tim McGraw song [...] "Please Remember Me" [...] as the send-off song played when a contestant is eliminated. Jimmy Iovine resumed duties as a weekly mentor to the contestants, frequently assisted by guest mentors. This season, the fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger and Soyon An were employed as image advisers for the Top 10 finalists.|$|E

2500|$|Neurath did {{not think}} the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was possible. So to {{discredit}} his rival, he appointed Ribbentrop head of the delegation sent to London to negotiate it. Once the talks began, Ribbentrop issued Sir John Simon an ultimatum. He informed Simon that if Germany's terms were not accepted in their entirety, the German delegation <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Simon was angry with this demand {{and walked out of}} the talks. But to everyone's surprise, the next day the British accepted Ribbentrop's demands and the A.G.N.A. was signed in London on 18 June 1935 by Ribbentrop and Sir Samuel Hoare, the new British Foreign Secretary. This diplomatic success did much to increase Ribbentrop's prestige with Hitler, who called the day the A.G.N.A. was signed [...] "the happiest day in my life". He believed it marked the beginning of an Anglo-German alliance and ordered celebrations throughout Germany to mark the event.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 June 1935, Ribbentrop {{arrived in}} London. The talks began on Tuesday, 4 June 1935, at the Admiralty office with Ribbentrop heading the German {{delegation}} and Simon the British delegation. Ribbentrop, who {{was determined to}} succeed at his mission, no matter what, began his talks by stating the British could either accept the 35:100 ratio as [...] "fixed and unalterable" [...] by the weekend, or the German delegation <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> and the Germans would build their navy up to any size they wished. Simon was visibly angry with Ribbentrop's behaviour: [...] "It is not usual to make such conditions {{at the beginning of}} negotiations". Simon walked out of the talks. On 5 June 1935, a change of opinion came over the British delegation. In a report to the British Cabinet, it was [...] "definitely of the opinion that, in our own interest, we should accept this offer of Herr Hitler's while it is still open.... If we now refuse to accept the offer for the purposes of these discussions, Herr Hitler will withdraw the offer and Germany will seek to build to a higher level than 35 per cent.... Having regard to past history and to Germany's known capacity to become a serious naval rival of this country, we may have cause to regret it if we fail to take this chance...". Also, on 5 June, during talks between Sir Robert Craigie, the British Foreign Office's naval expert and chief of the Foreign Office's American Department and Ribbentrop's deputy, Admiral Karl-Georg Schuster, the Germans conceded that the 35:100 ratio would take the form of tonnage ratios, and the Germans would more or less build their tonnage up to whatever the British tonnage was in various warship categories. On the afternoon of that same day, the British Cabinet voted to accept the 35:100 ratio, and Ribbentrop was informed of the Cabinet's acceptance in the evening.|$|E
