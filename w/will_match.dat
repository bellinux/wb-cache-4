25|$|The {{justification}} for this definition {{is to preserve}} {{the sign of the}} result in case of arithmetic underflow. For example, in the single-precision computation 1/(x/2), where x = ±2−149, the computation x/2 underflows and produces ±0 with sign matching x, and the result will be ±∞ with sign matching x. The sign <b>will</b> <b>match</b> that of the exact result ±2150, but the magnitude of the exact result is too large to represent, so infinity is used to indicate overflow.|$|E

25|$|Walrasi{{an auction}} or Walrasian tâtonnement is an auction {{in which the}} {{auctioneer}} takes bids from both buyers and sellers in a market of multiple goods. The auctioneer progressively either raises or drops the current proposed price depending on the bids of both buyers and sellers, the auction concluding when supply and demand exactly balance. As a high price tends to dampen demand while a low price tends to increase demand, in theory there is a particular price {{somewhere in the middle}} where supply and demand <b>will</b> <b>match.</b>|$|E
25|$|Transsexual self-identified people {{sometimes}} wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both, {{because they feel}} {{they will be more}} comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex <b>will</b> <b>match</b> their gender identity.|$|E

The Adelson Family Foundation has contributed many millions of US dollars annually to Birthright Israel since 2007. In 2011, he pledged an additional $5 million toward the effort. In 2013, Adelson doubled his past annual commitment to Birthright Israel, announcing a $20 million challenge grant that <b>will</b> <b>match</b> new and increased gifts or pledges through 2015.

The Bx6 SBS supplements the existing Bx6 local service, making stops at select high-ridership locations and all transfers points to Metro-North and subways.

25|$|Before {{their meeting}} in {{the final of the}} 2013 World Championship, Taylor said that van Gerwen's talent was better than himself at his peak and it was {{suggested}} that a win for the Dutchman would be a changing of the guard for the sport. However, Taylor fought back from 4–2 down in sets to win 7–4. A few months later, van Gerwen became the first player other than Taylor to finish top of the table of the Premier League with the two {{meeting in the}} final which van Gerwen won 10–8. Afterwards Taylor stated that he would reinvent himself and make himself better as the pair would have many battles in the future and that his next target in his career would be to beat van Gerwen. Van Gerwen himself called Taylor the greatest and said that no one <b>will</b> <b>match</b> his achievements in darts.|$|E
25|$|Publishers often funded {{trade-in}} {{deals to}} encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed {{about a third}} of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was {{about a third of}} the size of its new games business. They figured that sites such as eBay, which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market, but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers <b>will</b> <b>match</b> the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.|$|E

500|$|Puppies of all colours can {{potentially}} {{occur in the}} same litter. Colour is determined primarily by three genes. The first gene (the B locus) determines {{the density of the}} coat's eumelanin pigment granules, if that pigment is allowed: dense granules result in a black coat, sparse ones give a chocolate coat. The second (E) locus determines whether the eumelanin is produced at all. A dog with the recessive e allele will produce only phaeomelanin pigment and will be yellow regardless of its genotype at the B locus. The genes known about previously have had their number increased by the introduction of the K locus, where the dominant [...] "black" [...] allele KB is now known to reside. Black or chocolate Labradors therefore must have the KB allele. Yellow Labradors are determined at the E locus, so the K locus is irrelevant in determining their colour. Variations in numerous other genes control the subtler details of the coat's colouration, which in yellow Labradors varies from white to light gold to a fox red. Chocolate and black Labradors' noses <b>will</b> <b>match</b> the coat colour.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Guardian, the {{journalist}} and broadcaster Lesley Riddoch {{took a different}} view, suggesting that the launch of a pro-independence newspaper {{in a country where}} 45% of the population had recently voted for independence [...] "may be a large but calculated risk and a very sound business move", and that [...] "Perhaps the novelty and sheer boldness of the National newspaper <b>will</b> <b>match</b> the national mood". Kirkpatrick, although critical of its online shortfalls, was positive about the paper's content, describing it as [...] "a lively mix of briefs and longer pieces". Douglas Beattie of the New Statesman said The National [...] "has a clear raison d’etre and will be welcomed by a large number of the 1.6 million Scots who voted Yes". Stephen Daisley of STV News wrote that it was [...] "both frustratingly light [...] stodgily worthy", but drew favourable comparisons with the Scottish Standard, a weekly pro-independence paper launched in 2005 that ceased publication after just seven issues, suggesting The National would succeed because it had more financial backing, and as there was a latent demand for a news sheet supporting independence. Writing in The Guardian, {{the journalist}} and author Peter Preston said there were [...] "many good things to say about the National" [...] including its editor, who was leading a newspaper that [...] "helps to reflect public opinion better".|$|E
