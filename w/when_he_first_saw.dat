5|$|The {{idea for}} Mask of the Lunar Eclipse came to series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> the Wii hardware. Kikuchi and series co-creator Makoto Shibata {{returned}} as respective producer and director, while Grasshopper Manufacture's Goichi Suda acted as co-director, co-writer and designer. The gameplay concept {{was making the}} player literally feel the fear evoked in the game. The addition of further developers to the project enabled the team to reconsider the standard formula, although {{it proved to be}} a chaotic experience. As with previous games, the theme songs were sung by Tsuki Amano. When released, it became the best-selling entry in the series to that date, and received mixed to positive from Japanese and Western critics.|$|E
5|$|Peter Jackson {{was nine}} years old <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> the 1933 film, and was in tears in front of the TV when Kong slipped off the Empire State Building. At age 12, he {{attempted}} to recreate the film using his parents' Super 8 mm film camera and a model of Kong made of wire and rubber with his mother's fur coat for the hair, but eventually gave up on the project. King Kong eventually became his favorite film and was the primary inspiration for his decision to become a filmmaker as a teenager. He read books about the making of King Kong and collected memorabilia, as well as articles from Famous Monsters of Filmland. Jackson paid tribute to the 1933 film by including Skull Island as the origin of the zombie plague in his 1992 film Braindead.|$|E

This environment supported both the flora and fauna of wild grassland. In 1859, Greenwich Natural History Society recorded a wide list of animal species, including natterjack toads, hares, common lizards, bats, quail, ring ouzel and nightingale. Today, bats are still found on Blackheath and migrating ring ouzel may occasionally be seen in spring.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, Longo {{obtained}} {{as a gift}} {{a painting}} portraying Our Lady of the Rosary, with Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Siena. Sister M. Concetta de Litala of the Monastery of the Rosary at Porta Medina had been holding it for the Dominican priest Alberto Radente. Radente had acquired it from a junk-shop dealer in Naples for a very small sum. The painting was in bad condition and Longo wrote of his immediate distaste of the poor artistic quality <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> it. However, he accepted the gift to conserve funds and to not insult the Sister Concetta. Longo raised funds to restore the image {{and placed it in}} the church in an effort to encourage pilgrimages.|$|E
25|$|A {{currently}} familiar depiction {{is that on}} the Shroud of Turin, whose records go back to 1353. Controversy {{surrounds the}} shroud and its exact origin remains subject to debate. The Shroud of Turin is respected by Christians of several traditions, including Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Orthodox, Pentecostals, and Presbyterians. It {{is one of the}} Catholic devotions approved by the Holy See, that to the Holy Face of Jesus, now uses the image of the face on the shroud as it appeared in the negative of the photograph taken by amateur photographer Secondo Pia in 1898.

25|$|Thiago's first {{introduction}} to tennis happened <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> his brother watching Gustavo Kuerten on TV, being eight years old. Monteiro trained football at an Academy near where his brother {{used to play}} tennis.

Thiago soon started training and disputing local tournaments: in early 2004 he won his first tournament, being only nine years old. Thiago would leave his hometown, Fortaleza, in late 2008 to enter the Larri Passos Academy in Balneário Camboriú to improve his game. Thiago says that if he didn't made that change, he would probably be a football player. Now as a professional player, Thiago uses his spare time to enjoy movies and spend it with friends and family. He attends college online and has been dating fellow brazilian tennis player, Beatriz Haddad Maia since March 2016.|$|E
25|$|Rusk first climbed Mount Stuart in 1920. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> it in 1894, Rusk {{desired to}} climb it; however, other matters, {{including}} the McKinley expedition, {{prevented him from}} climbing it. That same year, 1920, the Cascadians mountaineering club was formed and with Rusk as a leading member, they decided that a record box {{should be taken to}} the summit. Rusk climbed Stuart with Rolfe Morse Whitnall in July and although Whitnall was unable to make the summit, Rusk was successful and placed the record box on the summit. Their success inspired the club to send another party later that year on Labor Day. This party consisted of Clarence Truitt, Harold Carey, Vern Mason, Joseph R. Vincent, Rolland Whitmore, Wayne E. and Fern Richardson, Rolfe and Alice Whitnall, and Rusk. The whole party made the summit, even though they had some close calls and were forced to bivouac part of the way down the mountain. Rusk climbed Stuart again the next year with Wayne Richardson, Truitt, Rolfe Whitnall, Max Hiscock, and Jimmie Frisque. That year, they climbed earlier in the season, the 29th of May, than any party before and many thought that there was still too much snow to climb at that time in the season. All but Whitnall made the summit. Rusk led another much larger party up Stuart on May 29, 1922.|$|E

Richard Butler says that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> the replacement cover, he [...] "actually burst into tears".

To begin with, Maurice Anscombe, {{generally}} the most cheerful and nonchalant of mortals with a jest for every woe, {{was in a}} most depressed condition, and informed me of it several times, while I {{was getting ready to}} turn in. He said he thought the place hateful and felt as if people he could not see were looking at him (I had the same sensation but did not mention the fact to him). When I told him he was talking stuff, he only replied that he could not help it, and pointed out that it was not his general habit to be downcast in any danger, which was quite true.

60|$|Somewhere out there, Sheldon reflected, was Joan Lackland, {{the girl}} who had not grown up, the woman good to look upon, with only a boy's mind and a boy's desires, leaving Berande amid storm and {{conflict}} {{in much the same}} manner that she had first arrived, in the stern-sheets of her whale-boat, Adamu Adam steering, her savage crew bending to the oars. And she was taking her Stetson hat with her, along with the cartridge-belt and the long-barrelled revolver. He suddenly discovered an immense affection for those fripperies of hers at which he had secretly laughed <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them. He became aware of the sentimental direction in which his fancy was leading him, and felt inclined to laugh. But he did not laugh. The next moment he was busy visioning the hat, and belt, and revolver. Undoubtedly this was love, he thought, and he felt a tiny glow of pride in him in that the Solomons had not succeeded in killing all his sentiment.|$|R
60|$|Princhester was {{industrial}} and unashamed. It was a countryside savagely invaded by forges and mine shafts and gaunt black things. It was scarred and impeded and discoloured. Even before that invasion, when the heather {{was not in}} flower {{it must have been}} a black country. Its people were dour uncandid individuals, who slanted their heads and knitted their brows to look at you. Occasionally one saw woods brown and blistered by the gases from chemical works. Here and there remained old rectories, closely reminiscent of the dear old home at Otteringham, jostled and elbowed and overshadowed by horrible iron cylinders belching smoke and flame. The fine old abbey church of Princhester, which was the cathedral of the new diocese, looked <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it like a lady Abbess who had taken to drink and slept in a coal truck. She minced apologetically upon the market-place; the parvenu Town Hall patronized and protected her as if she were a poor relation....|$|R

The nearest well was a long hundred miles down the track. At any rate the frontier post of Kurkur could not afford to receive casual visitors. Hilary Joyce whisked round his horse, galloped into camp, and gave the alarm. Then, with twenty horsemen at his back, he rode out again to reconnoitre.

500|$|Edgardo {{returned}} to the Catechumens on 22 October, and was visited by his parents often over the next month. As with Momolo's first round of visits, two different versions emerged of what happened. According to Edgardo's parents, the boy was obviously intimidated by the clergymen around him and threw himself into his mother's arms <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> her. Marianna later said: [...] "He had lost weight and had turned pale; his eyes were filled with terror... I {{told him that he}} was born a Jew like us and like us he must always remain one, and he replied: Si, mia cara mamma, I will never forget to say the Shema every day.'" [...] One report in the Jewish press described the priests telling Edgardo's parents that God had chosen their son to be [...] "the apostle of Christianity to his family, dedicated to converting his parents and his siblings", and that they could have him back if they also became Christians. The clerics and nuns then knelt and prayed for the conversion of the Mortara household, prompting Edgardo's parents to leave in terror.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Yoshiaki Fujisawa, who {{was famous for}} his work on the Japanese multimedia project Love Live!. Fujisawa was contacted in late 2013 by George Aburai, an in-house composer who also worked with multiple well-known entertainers at Avex Group. Fujisawa found the composition difficult as he was more used to composing for television series rather than video games. To help him, Atlus' sound team gave him advice about aspects such as the timing, feel, and emotive elements of tracks. Ultimately, he found the working environment fun, and was pleased <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> a test video featuring one of his songs. As a central story theme was the entertainment industry, the soundtrack was filled with vocal tunes and [...] "groovy" [...] tracks. The game features stage performances involving the main characters, which were produced and choreographed by Aburai for Avex Group. The performances made use of full motion capture, and the 3D animation for the choreographed performances was handled by Studio Anima. Aburai formed a group from various areas of Avex Group to work on production. After forming his team, Aburai worked to analyze the personalities and traits of the main cast to determine how their performances would play out, in addition to other factors such as their professions' impact on their portrayal.|$|E

In {{his early years}} while still a television director, Robert Altman stated that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> Rashomon he was so impressed by its cinematographer's achievement of shooting several shots with the camera aimed directly at the sun—allegedly {{it was the first}} film in which this was done successfully—that he claims he was inspired the very next day to begin incorporating shots of the sun into his television work. It was Coppola who said of Kurosawa, [...] "One thing that distinguishes [...] is that he didn't make one masterpiece or two masterpieces. He made, you know, eight masterpieces." [...] Both Spielberg and Scorsese have praised the older man's role as teacher and role model, and Scorsese called him his [...] "sensei," [...] using the Japanese term. Spielberg has declared, [...] "I have learned more from him than from almost any other filmmaker {{on the face of the}} earth", while Scorsese remarked, [...] "Let me say it simply: Akira Kurosawa was my master, and... the master of so many other filmmakers over the years." [...] Several of these moviemakers were also instrumental in helping Kurosawa obtain financing for his late films: Lucas and Coppola served as co-producers on Kagemusha, while the Spielberg name, lent to the 1990 production, Dreams, helped bring that picture to fruition.|$|E

I {{do not know what}} urged him to go, for Ethel was obviously irritated by his presence; perhaps it was because in that spot he hoped to regain the clean rapture which had filled his heart <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her; perhaps only, with the madness of those who love them that love them not, from the feeling that his obstinacy could force love. One day he strolled down there with a feeling that was rare with him now. He felt suddenly at peace with the world.

A crescent moon hung just over their tops. He {{made his way to the}} bank. He saw Ethel in the water floating on her back. Her hair streamed out all round her, and she was holding in her hand a large hibiscus. He stopped a moment to admire her; she was like Ophelia.|$|R

When they called to him to surrender himself he was silent, but he knew that his silence was of no avail. To them who were so eager to be his captors the matter seemed to be still one of considerable difficulty; but, to his thinking, there was no difficulty. There were there some score of men, fully armed, within twenty yards of him. If he but showed a trace of his limbs he would become a mark for their bullets. And then if he were wounded, and no one would come to him! If they allowed him to lie there without food till he perished! Would it not be well for him to yield himself? Then they called again and he was still silent. That idea of yielding is very terrible to the heart of a man.

6000|$|There is {{one thought}} still, the saddest of all, bearing on this {{withholding}} of early help. It is possible, in some noble natures, that {{the warmth and}} the affections of childhood may remain unchilled, though unanswered; and that the old man's heart may still be capable of gladness, when the long-withheld sympathy is given at last. But in these noble natures it nearly always happens, that the chief motive of earthly ambition has not been to give delight to themselves, but to their parents. Every noble youth looks back, as to the chiefest joy which this world's honour ever gave him, to the moment <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> his father's eyes flash with pride, and his mother turn away her head lest he should take her tears for tears of sorrow. Even the lover's joy, when some worthiness of his is acknowledged before his mistress, is not so great as that, for {{it is not so}} pure--the desire to exalt himself in her eyes mixes with that of giving her delight; but he does not need to exalt himself in his parents' eyes: it is with the pure hope of giving them pleasure that he comes to tell them what he has done, or what has been said of him; and therefore he has a purer pleasure of his own. And this purest and best of rewards you keep from him if you can: you feed him in his tender youth with ashes and dishonour; and then you come to him, obsequious, but too late, with your sharp laurel crown, the dew all dried from off its leaves; and you thrust it into his languid hand, and he looks at you wistfully. What shall he do with it? What can he do, but go and lay it on his mother's grave? ...|$|R
