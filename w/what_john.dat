5|$|Æthelstan {{became the}} first king of all the Anglo-Saxon peoples, and in effect {{overlord}} of Britain. His successes inaugurated <b>what</b> <b>John</b> Maddicott, in his history {{of the origins of}} the English Parliament, calls the imperial phase of English kingship between about 925 and 975, when rulers from Wales and Scotland attended the assemblies of English kings and witnessed their charters. Æthelstan tried to reconcile the aristocracy in his new territory of Northumbria to his rule. He lavished gifts on the minsters of Beverley, Chester-le-Street, and York, emphasising his Christianity. He also purchased the vast territory of Amounderness in Lancashire, and gave it to the Archbishop of York, his most important lieutenant in the region. But he remained a resented outsider, and the northern British kingdoms preferred to ally with the pagan Norse of Dublin. In contrast to his strong control over southern Britain, his position in the north was far more tenuous.|$|E
25|$|As {{many modern}} thinkers will, Plato ascribes relativism to Protagoras and uses his predecessor's teachings as a foil {{for his own}} {{commitment}} to objective and transcendent realities and values.

That being an assertion that something that is, or appears for a single individual, is true or real for that individual.|$|E
25|$|Driscoll {{adheres to}} Reformed or Calvinist theology, {{although}} he characterizes his position specifically as New Calvinism to differentiate {{himself from the}} more cessationist and non-missional aspects associated historically with Calvinism. Driscoll denies the orthodox Calvinist view of limited atonement and believes instead that Jesus died for all people in some sense, and for some people (the elect) in another sense. He thinks this position was <b>what</b> <b>John</b> Calvin believed, saying in a humorous tone: 'Calvinism came after Calvin... I {{will argue that the}} Calvinists are not very Calvin. I will argue against Calvinism with Calvin... What kind of Calvinist are you? I'm a Calvin, not a Calvinist, that came later'. Driscoll also believes that this position (or slight variations thereof) was held by men like Charles Spurgeon, John Bunyan, Martin Luther, and Richard Baxter.|$|E

500|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five movements, {{beginning with}} <b>what</b> <b>John</b> Eliot Gardiner {{describes as a}} [...] "curtain raiser", {{a line from the}} gospel set as a recitative. This is followed by a sequence aria–recitative–aria, and the cantata is concluded by a four-part chorale. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir only in the closing chorale, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble in an unusual combination of instruments, two oboes d'amore (Oa), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), a violoncello piccolo (Vp) and basso continuo.|$|E

He characterizes these views as [...] "speculative", but adds that it is nevertheless possible that there are echoes of Shaiva iconographic themes, such as half-moon shapes resembling the horns of a bull. John Keay writes that [...] "he may indeed be an early manifestation of Lord Shiva as Pashu-pati", but a couple of his specialties of this figure does not match with Rudra.

500|$|A [...] "painted vulture" [...] ("Sarcoramphus sacra" [...] or [...] "S. papa sacra") is {{described}} in William Bartram's notes of his travels in Florida during the 1770s.

Bartram describes the bird as being relatively common and even claimed to have collected one. However, no other naturalists record the painted vulture in Florida and sixty years after the sighting its validity began to be questioned, leading to <b>what</b> <b>John</b> Cassin described as the most inviting problem in North American ornithology. An independent account and painting was made of a similar bird by Eleazar Albin in 1734.|$|E

500|$|Sir Charles Somerset was {{politically}} successful under both Henry VII and Henry VIII, being made the Earl of Worcester. His son, Henry Somerset, died shortly after inheriting Raglan, {{but not before}} using lead reclaimed from Tintern Abbey to help the building work at Raglan Castle during {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries. His son and grandson, William Somerset and Edward Somerset, proved to be <b>what</b> <b>John</b> Kenyon describes as [...] "wealthy, brilliant and cultured men". William rebuilt much of the Pitched Stone Court, including the hall, adding the Long Gallery and developing the gardens into the new Renaissance style. The Somerset family owned two key castles in the region, Raglan and Chepstow, and these appeared to have figured prominently as important status symbols in paintings owned by the family.|$|E
500|$|As free jazz {{spread in}} the 1960s, so did the use of tone clusters. In {{comparison}} with <b>what</b> <b>John</b> Litweiler describes as Taylor's [...] "endless forms and contrasts," [...] the solos of Muhal Richard Abrams employ tone clusters in a similarly free, but more lyrical, flowing context. Guitarist Sonny Sharrock made them {{a central part of}} his improvisations; in Palmer's description, he executed [...] "glass-shattering tone clusters that sounded like someone was ripping the pickups out of the guitar without having bothered to unplug it from its overdriven amplifier." [...] Pianist Marilyn Crispell has been another major free jazz proponent of the tone cluster, frequently in collaboration with Anthony Braxton, who played with Abrams early in his career. Since the 1990s, Matthew Shipp has built on Taylor's innovations with the form. European free jazz pianists who have contributed {{to the development of the}} tone cluster palette include Gunter Hampel and Alexander von Schlippenbach.|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} {{years of the}} 20th century the opera was a regular feature in many European cities, and was still {{breaking}} new ground; in 1990 it made its debut at the Slovak National Theatre in Bratislava. Vienna saw {{it for the first}} time in 1994, at the Vienna Volksoper, in <b>what</b> <b>John</b> Rockwell in the New York Times described as [...] "an awkwardly updated production", though well performed. The opera had not so far proved particularly popular in the United States, where since the Met premiere of 1916, performances had been rare compared with Europe. Lyric Opera of Chicago staged it in 1966, but waited until 1998 before reviving it. In 1980 the New York City Opera mounted a production based on the 1863 edition, and staged it again in 1983 and 1986. Reviewing the 1986 production, Henahan wrote that despite the inept libretto the work was saved by the [...] "melodic suppleness and warmth" [...] of Bizet's score.|$|E

500|$|In 1906, Queene Ferry Coonley, wife {{of wealthy}} Riverside {{industrialist}} and publisher Avery Coonley, {{decided to start}} a kindergarten program to allow children younger than five years old to attend. Queene Coonley was trained {{as a social worker}} and kindergarten teacher at the Detroit Normal School (now Wayne State University) and was impressed by the theories of Friedrich Fröbel, who believed children's early education should be an extension of their lives at home. Fröbel's theories captured the three main principles of <b>what</b> <b>John</b> Dewey would later call the [...] "kindergarten attitude", which applied not just to kindergartners but to children of all ages. Dewey wrote that the primary role of the school is to train children in cooperative living, the root of all learning is the activity of the child and not external material, and directing children's spontaneous impulses towards maintaining the collective life of the school is how they become prepared for adult life. Convinced of these principles, Coonley sought to enroll her four-year-old daughter in the Riverside School, one of the few public kindergartens in the area, but was disappointed when the child was not eligible because she had not yet turned five.|$|E
500|$|Along with [...] "Brand New Day", [...] "Everyone" [...] and [...] "Glad Tidings" [...] form {{a closing}} trio of songs {{permeated}} by <b>what</b> <b>John</b> Tobler called [...] "a celebratory air, bordering on spiritual joy". Labes opened [...] "Everyone" [...] by playing a clavinet figure in [...] time. A flute comes in, playing the melody after Morrison has sung four lines, with Schroer playing the harmony underneath on soprano saxophone. Although Morrison says {{the song is}} just a song of hope, Hinton says its lyrics suggest a more troubled meaning, as [...] 1969 was {{the year in which}} The Troubles broke out in Belfast. The final track, [...] "Glad Tidings", has a bouncy beat but the lyrics, like [...] "Into the Mystic", remain largely impenetrable, according to Hinton. In his opinion, [...] "the opening line and closing line, 'and they'll lay you down low and easy', could be either about murder or an act of love." [...] In Hage's opinion, [...] "'Glad Tidings' was a premonition of the future, as for the next four decades, Morrison would continue to use a song here and there to vent about the evils of the music industry and the world of celebrity." ...|$|E

500|$|Out of {{the entire}} first series, [...] "Cyberwoman" [...] is the biggest nod to Doctor Who, {{there was little to}} no mention of the series, despite being a spin-off, which was made {{deliberate}} to send out [...] "confusing signals" [...] to the audience about what the series is. Chibnall wanted to include a base description of what a Cyberman is for any viewer who had not seen Doctor Who. The episode was the first to centre on Ianto, who in the first three episodes was more or less a background character, and <b>what</b> <b>John</b> Barrowman described as like Torchwoods version of Alfred Pennyworth in Batman. Chibnall originally intended for the episode to become the sixth or seventh in the series, but was brought forward to the fourth because some of the other scripts were not yet completed. It also became one of Chibnall's harder episodes to write. Before settling on the current title, Chibnall went through numerous working titles, including [...] "The Trouble with Lisa" [...] and [...] "The Long Night of Ianto". [...] "Cyberwoman" [...] was ultimately chosen because the title [...] "says it all." ...|$|E

The real victory is in the character's refusal to give up against long odds. [...] "My heroes are the losers" [...] he once said. [...] "All my books have been in that vein. Every book I've ever written."

500|$|During this time, {{the women}} in the WWF were known more for their {{physical}} appearances and [...] "sex appeal" [...] rather than their wrestling abilities, and featuring women in strip matches or farcical [...] "slop matches", a match that takes place in a pool of slop, were common. Ivory, who was a trained wrestler, won the Women's Championship on June 14, by defeating Debra and defended her title against Tori at SummerSlam on August 22. Her feud with Tori turned Ivory into a villainous character. Ivory continued to feud with Tori in the weeks following SummerSlam, defeating her in the first ever WWF women's hardcore match on September 6. Ivory was then challenged by Luna Vachon, who Ivory defeated in a farcical hardcore match at Unforgiven on September 26. SLAM! Wrestling called the match [...] "pointless and senseless".
