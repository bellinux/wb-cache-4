5000|$|Pilot - A {{qualified}} pilot {{flew the}} aircraft {{and in the}} Royal Air Force was usually the captain (function not rank) of the crew, making the key operational decisions even if his rank was junior to {{other members of the}} crew. The pilot was often a commissioned officer but he could hold any rank from Sergeant up to Group Captain. Officers of higher rank did occasionally fly operationally but were discouraged from doing so due to concerns of <b>them</b> <b>being</b> <b>taken</b> prisoner. Captains were often informally referred to by their crews as Skipper or Skip. A pilot wore the traditional double-winged brevet [...] "pilot's wings" [...] on his tunic above his left breast pocket.|$|R
50|$|He gave amusing {{illustrations}} of the absurdity and poverty {{of the current}} pulpit oratory of his day, some of <b>them</b> <b>being</b> <b>taken</b> from the sermons of his own father. He attacked the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes in his Mr. Hobbs State of Nature considered; in a dialogue between Philautus and Timothy (1672), and in his Some Opinions of Mr.. Hobbs considered in a second dialogue (1673). These were written in their author's chosen vein of light satire, and John Dryden praised them as highly effective within their own range. Eachard's own sermons, however, were not superior to those he satirized. Jonathan Swift alludes {{to him as a}} signal instance of a successful humorist who entirely failed as a serious writer.|$|R

30|$|Problems {{occur when}} the first {{reference}} partial belongs to the instrument whose F 0 was correctly estimated. In this case, several false potential partials will {{be considered in the}} process to determine the second reference partial, which is chosen based on the lowest correlation. Since those false partials are expected to have very low correlations with respect to all other partials, the chance of one of <b>them</b> <b>being</b> <b>taken</b> as reference is high. In this case, all the process is disrupted and the amplitude estimates are likely to be wrong. This explains the deterioration of the results shown in Table 8. Those observations can be extended to mixtures with any number of instruments, and the higher is the number of F 0 misestimates, the worse will be the results.|$|R
50|$|In {{the modern}} era, sharia-based laws were widely {{replaced}} by statutes based on European models, and its classical rules were largely retained only in personal status (family) laws. Different explanations {{have been proposed}} for this phenomenon. Several scholars have argued that because these laws are more extensively specified in the Quran and hadith than others, it has been difficult for believers to accept deviating from these rules. In contrast, Wael Hallaq {{sees it as a}} legacy of colonialism: changing family laws would have provided no benefit in colonial administration, and colonial powers promoted the theory that these laws were sacred to the population, advertising their preservation as a mark of respect, which in turn led to <b>them</b> <b>being</b> <b>taken</b> up as a point of reference in modern Muslim identity politics.|$|R
50|$|There {{were other}} {{landings}} at Pandeli Bay (where the Italian Lago battery fired {{on the landing}} convoys), near Leros town, that were heavily contested by the Royal Irish Fusiliers.

[...] Unbeknownst to the Southerners, their route had taken them straight toward the withdrawing Federal column under Brigadier General Alexander Asboth, which was returning to their main base at Pensacola after their victory at Marianna.

A witness stated that their abductors were wearing trench coats over Free State Army officers uniforms. <b>Witnesses</b> saw <b>them</b> <b>being</b> shot dead at The Thatch, Pucks Lane, (now Yellow Road), Whitehall.

60|$|At {{three o'clock}} a {{tremendous}} roar of {{fire in the}} direction of Fort Dupres burst out, as some seven or eight thousand of the insurgents, among whom were a number of Arabs, poured out from the nearest gate to endeavour to carry the battery, while at the same moment a tremendous musketry fire from the minarets and roof of the Mosque of Hassan, and from the houses near the wall, was poured at the French artillerymen, to prevent them from working their guns upon their assailants. Gonmartin, however, had with him three battalions of infantry and 300 cavalry, and with these he charged the advancing crowd. The Arabs fought bravely, but were, for the most part, slain, and the insurgents, unable to stand the heavy volleys, followed by a bayonet charge of the infantry, fled back to the gate from which they had sallied out, 400 of <b>them</b> <b>being</b> <b>taken</b> prisoners and sent to the citadel.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{secondary}} explosions {{were generated}} by the first, and killed more miners and ponies before dissipating. In total, 20 miners {{were killed in the}} three explosions showing signs of burning, with a further 4 killed by the force of the explosion. Of the 81 men in the pit who survived the explosions, only 42 managed to reach the surface alive, as many miners were trapped by roof falls and succumbed to after-damp poisoning. Rescuers retrieving the bodies described how the miners’ footprints in the dust could be traced showing the roads they had travelled along in an endeavour to escape before they were overwhelmed. [...] All 11 miners who were in the Black Bed seam escaped. However, they heard and felt the force of the explosion in the Beeston Bed and were knocked off their feet or struck by trap doors. They were very quickly rendered unconscious for an hour by after-damp, and upon waking, the Deputy, Robert Henry Nevins, was asked by the young teenage miners to pray for them. With the cages out of operation, they had to scramble up a stone drift to reach the Beeston Bed and were overcome by afterdamp again, 600 yards from shaft. Barely able to walk, they were forced to leave behind one of their party, Fred Atkinson, and upon reaching the No.2 shaft, another party of survivors gathered there <b>witnessed</b> <b>them</b> <b>being</b> violently ill and in distress. The sick and injured were the first to be sent up to the surface two hours later once repairs had been made to the cage.|$|R
25|$|Middlesbrough's FA Cup run was {{significantly}} longer than their League Cup run - {{partly due to}} <b>them</b> <b>being</b> <b>taken</b> to a replay in every round they played. They drew 11 at Hull in the FA Cup, with the replay resulting in an exciting 43 win. A 22 draw with Bristol City followed, setting up another replay. It was a nerve-wrecking 22 draw, with Boro winning 54 on penalties, presenting them with a tie at the Riverside with former player Tony Mowbray's West Brom. That game also ended 22, and the replay resulted in a Middlesbrough victory via penalties, after a 11 draw in normal time. Middlesbrough were eventually knocked out by champions-elect and eventual FA Cup runners-up Manchester United at Old Trafford in the quarter finals. The 22 result at the Riverside set up another replay, as Middlesbrough came from behind to lead 21, before George Boateng conceded a penalty for handball. Cristiano Ronaldo struck from the spot to force a replay, won by Manchester United 10 and ending Boro's run.|$|R
50|$|Five {{of the six}} {{lifeboats}} {{were destroyed}} by the heavy seas and on the sixth, four crew members went to look for assistance. They reached Nasilai village at dawn but their inability {{to communicate with the}} natives resulted in <b>them</b> <b>being</b> <b>taken</b> to Levuka instead of Suva. On reaching Levuka at 5 pm a rescue party was organised and they reached the stricken ship at 9 pm Dr William MacGregor, the Chief Medical Officer and Acting Colonial Secretary, took charge of the rescue operations on the morning of Tuesday 13 May. When the first rescue boats reached the scene, the majority of the passengers were in the water on the reef, making as far towards the land as they could, but a considerable number were still in the wrecked vessel, chiefly women and children. The ship lay on her port side. The masts were all broken into fragments, and sails, ropes, and debris of all kinds were mixed up and thrown about in the breakers in wild confusion.|$|R

She announces that it is 11 September, {{and that they will}} thus be celebrating the Tet festival in three days' time. Spending long hours alone in the forest as he hikes between lookout spots, Richard begins to experience hallucinations in which Daffy appears: they converse and patrol the part of the island which Richard refers to as the DMZ together. Richard comes to appreciate that Daffy killed himself because he could neither endure the unravelling of his elitist vision of the beach as the group grew in size, nor bear the thought of a return to backpacking or settled life, and notes that he himself is falling prey to that way of thinking. Richard also realizes that Daffy gave him the map — as well as spreading rumors of the island all over Thailand — so many travelers would come looking for the beach, inevitably leading to it becoming a tourist destination. Daffy describes this act as [...] "euthanizing" [...] the community, and Richard realizes he was merely a pawn in Daffy's revenge plan. This comes to a head following the arrival of the American/German group by raft. Unlike Richard, Étienne, and Françoise who managed to overcome all obstacles in getting to the beach, the newcomers never make it past the most dangerous hurdle: the cannabis farmers. Richard <b>witnesses</b> <b>them</b> <b>being</b> first beaten violently and then dragged away. The sound of gunshots implies the farmers have murdered the intruders.|$|R
