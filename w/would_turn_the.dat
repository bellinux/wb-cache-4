5|$|Lord Harald Karstark {{arrives at}} Winterfell, bearing {{news of the}} death of the hunters sent after Sansa Stark and Theon Greyjoy. Ramsay Bolton deduces that Sansa would have gone to Castle Black where, as the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and her brother, Jon would offer both her and Theon his protection. Ramsay proposes to Roose Bolton that they storm the castle from the {{unprotected}} southern side. Roose warns Ramsay that these actions <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> entire North against them. Maester Wolkan then enters and announces that Roose's wife Walda Frey has given birth to a son, prompting Ramsay to stab Roose, killing him. He then lures Walda and his baby half-brother into the kennels, where he has them mauled to death by his hounds.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Saraiva, Ouro Preto was {{a staunch}} monarchist who was {{determined}} to save the regime at any cost. His program of reforms was highly ambitious and aimed at resolving festering issues about which politicians had long been complaining. An item notably missing from his agenda was any move to address the military indiscipline and the urgent necessity of restoration of government authority over the corps. This {{would prove to be}} a fatal mistake. Among the reforms proposed were the expanding of voting rights by abolishing the income requisite, the end of lifelong senate tenures and, most important of all, increased decentralization which <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> country into a full federation by allowing the election of town mayors and provincial presidents (governors).|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of May19 there were further discussions at Rodríguez Peña's house. Saavedra, called by Viamonte, joined the meeting, which {{involved}} military and civilian leaders. They arranged that Belgrano and Saavedra would meet with Juan José de Lezica, the senior alcalde (municipal magistrate), while Castelli would meet with the procurator Julián de Leiva, to ask for their support. They asked the Viceroy to allow an open cabildo, and said {{that if it was}} not freely granted the people and the criollo troops would march to the Plaza, force the Viceroy to resign by any means necessary, and replace him with a patriot government. Saavedra commented to Lezica that he was suspected of betrayal because of his constant requests for cautious and measured steps. This comment was designed to pressure Lezica into speeding up the legal system to allow the people to express themselves, or otherwise risk a major rebellion. Lezica asked for patience and time to persuade the Viceroy, and leave a massive demonstration as a last resort. He argued that if the Viceroy was deposed in that way, it would constitute a rebellion, which <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> revolutionaries into outlaws. Manuel Belgrano gave the following Monday as the deadline to confirm the open cabildo before taking direct action. Leiva would later act as a mediator, being both a confidante of Cisneros and a trusted negotiator for the more moderate revolutionaries.|$|E

5|$|On April 23, 2003, in {{the lead}} up to the 2003 Indy 500, Andretti took to the track {{for the first time}} in ten years in a major open wheel car at the age of 63. He participated in a test session for son Michael's AGR IndyCar team. One of the team's regular drivers, Tony Kanaan, {{suffered}} a radial fracture of his arm a week earlier in an April 15 crash at Motegi. If Kanaan was not cleared to drive in enough time, tentative plans were being prepared for Andretti to qualify the car for him. He <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> car over to Kanaan on race day, though no plans had been made for Andretti to actually drive in the race. During the test, Andretti ran at competitive speeds, but running over debris saw his car becoming airborne and the attempt ended with a spectacular crash. Andretti was able to walk away from the wreck with just a minor cut on his chin. This was Andretti's last significant on-track activity at Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|Kakashi's {{background}} is explored in Kakashi Gaiden, a six chapter series that divides {{the gap between}} Part I and II of the manga. Following his father's suicide, Sakumo Hatake aka the White Fang, Kakashi adopted the philosophy {{that the success of}} a mission must always come first rather than comrades in contrast to his father. Kakashi is assigned by his teacher, Minato Namikaze, to lead a mission that <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> current war in Konoha's favor. When his teammate, Rin Nohara, is captured by enemy ninja, his other teammate, Obito Uchiha, convinces him to rescue her despite the mission's ending. After finding Rin, an enemy-induced cave-in crushed Obito's right half. With his dying wish and the possibility of enemy reinforcements, Obito has Rin implant his newly acquired Sharingan into Kakashi's recently damaged eye socket as a parting gift. His new eye in place, Kakashi flees with Rin as the cave collapsed, eventually completing their mission. Shortly after this event, Kakashi has to rescue Rin again who is kidnapped by Kirigakure; however, he learns that the Kiri, under the influence of Madara Uchiha, has made Rin as the host of the Three Tails, Isobu. Rin requests Kakashi to kill her so she may not be used by the Hidden Mist ninja as part of a Trojan Horse scheme against Konoha, but Kakashi is reluctant. She eventually forces herself on the way of Kakashi's Lightning Blade that he originally directed at the pursuing Hidden Mist ninja, killing her. An anime exclusive flashback arc in Naruto Shippuden covered Kakashi coping with what he endured during the war as he becomes an ANBU operative during Minato's time as Hokage and influences Yamato into becoming a member of the ANBU as well. Once relieved of duty in the ANBU, Kakashi becomes a Genin instructor prior to the events of Part I.|$|E
25|$|All that {{remained}} of the Luftwaffe were scattered wrecks over airfields that were virtually aircraft 'graveyards'. Many examples of the revolutionary aircraft that the Luftwaffe hoped <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> tide fell into Allied hands, examples like the Me 262 and Heinkel He 162 greatly impressed the Allies.|$|E

25|$|In 1887 {{the company}} {{purchased}} a {{car from the}} Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company, this being a double-decker with a single ended body pivoted on the truck. This device removed the need to detach the horses at the terminus, as the horses <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> car round {{and be ready to}} start off in the opposite direction again. This design was not particularly successful and the vehicle was later rebuilt as a standard rigid car with two ends.|$|E
25|$|To make a range measurement, the {{operator}} <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> potentiometer dial {{in an effort}} to get the leading edge of the target blip to line up with a vertical line on the CRT. The range was not read off the CRT, but the dial. The dial also turned a magslip, or selsyn as it is more commonly known today. The output of the magslip was used to directly turn the controls on the predictor, allowing the radar to continually update the range measurement.|$|E
25|$|In October 2017, Hanwha {{unveiled}} an internally-funded upgrade {{project that}} <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> K200 into a modular, multi-purpose vehicle. The design involves stretching the chassis and adding a road wheel for six pairs and removing the back section {{to create a}} flat cargo bed to fit various modules that can be swapped out for different missions; initial configurations include modules {{to act as an}} ambulance, fuel tanker, minelayer, and communications platform. With ROK Army approval, the company could fully mature the project in two years.|$|E

25|$|Naval Air Station Alameda (NAS), at Alameda Point, {{which was}} {{decommissioned}} in 1997, {{has been turned}} over to the City of Alameda for civilian development. The area of the former NAS is now known as Alameda Point. In late July 2006, the City of Alameda announced a deal with the Navy that <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> land over to the city for $108M. The transfer process was initially slowed down by disputes between the Navy and the city regarding payment for environmental cleanup of the land.|$|E
25|$|Princess Elizabeth {{recognized}} {{early the}} dangerous signs that <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> former Yugoslavia {{upside down in}} a bloodbath of historic religious and ethnic rivalries long suppressed by Communist rule. She spoke out in Europe and America on behalf of bridging the gap between ethnic hatreds. Working behind the scenes through United Nations programs, she also journeyed to the Vatican in 1989 to ask Monsignor Tauran, then Holy See Secretary for Relations with States, to help improve relations between Catholic and Orthodox communities in Yugoslavia.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{then began}} a {{campaign}} of his own to bring peace—that is, an amicable reduction of profit-destroying competition—between the two trunk lines. In the working out of this peace, Gowen's erstwhile syndicate for constructing the South Penn line that <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> Reading into a viably competitive trunk line was undermined entirely, leaving little prospect of completing that project. Ultimately, significant portions of the South Penn's right of way and partly completed gradings lay fallow until they were eventually utilized in the 1930s for construction of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.|$|E

25|$|Hectored by the {{political}} representatives, Brunet launched a new assault on the Massif de l'Authion and Col de Raus {{at the end of}} July. This effort failed though the connection with the Army of the Alps improved. Brunet announced that he <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> left flank of the Saorgio position by marching across Republic of Genoa territory. Nothing came of this plan. Representative Paul Barras did not care for the generals, but Sérurier's actions had pleased him so he nominated him for promotion on 25 June. Both Masséna and Sérurier were appointed generals of brigade on 22 August 1793.|$|E
25|$|Following a brief move to Salt Lake City, Utah, Underwood {{returned}} to Los Angeles, where she found {{work as a}} waitress at the Pig ‘n Whistle restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. One day in April 1920, she was lamenting to Harry Underwood, a co-worker, that her Hollywood relative had resurfaced and demanded that Underwood live with her again and relinquish her paychecks to her, or she <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> underage girl over to the authorities. Harry {{told her that the}} relative could not do that if he and Underwood were married. The couple married three weeks later on April 28, 1920.|$|E
25|$|On April 29, 1869, {{a meeting}} was held {{concerning}} {{the future of}} the West Chester Academy. At a second meeting that was held at the courthouse on August 23 of that year, a resolution was adopted that <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> academy into a normal school. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed an act on March 4, 1870, concerning the foundation of a normal school, and on September 14, the cornerstone at the main building was laid. On June 20, 1871, the board of trustees chose Ezekiel Cook to be the first principal. The school opened on September 25 of that year to an inaugural class of 130 students.|$|E

25|$|Kalif Phillips {{started a}} {{dominating}} Charlotte {{performance in the}} second quarter with a 1-yard rushing touchdown on the first drive of the quarter to tie the game. Charlotte <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> ball over on an interception early in their next drive, but Presbyterian would be unable to convert the first down. Charlotte's next drive included 16 plays and resulted in an Alan Barnwell 1-yard touchdown to give Charlotte its first lead of the game. Charlotte would take a 14-point lead into the half after a Matt Johnson 53 yard pass to Mikel Hunter resulted in 7 more points. The halftime score was Charlotte up 28 to 14.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte would {{score on}} the opening play of the fourth quarter on a Kalif Phillips 1 yard rushing {{touchdown}}. Three series later Joe Callahan would connect with Bryce Shade for a 17-yard passing touchdown to tie the score {{for the third time}} in the day. With 2 and a half minutes left on the clock Wesley would retake the lead on a Joe Callahan 1 yard rushing touchdown. Charlotte would put together a 12 play drive to get to the Wesley 28 yard line, but Charlotte Quarterback Matt Johnson would be unable to connect on three subsequent passing plays and <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> ball over on downs. Wesley would then take a knee to win 35 to 28.|$|E
25|$|The {{passage from}} Ukraine to China {{was even more}} {{problematic}} than the purchase. In June 2000, Varyag was taken under tow. As the tugboat approached the Bosphorus, Turkey denied permission for the ship to pass through, citing the risk that {{a gust of wind}} <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> ship widthwise and block the entire strait. Varyag spent the next 16 months being towed counterclockwise around the Black Sea, accruing towing charges of $8,500 a day as Chong Lot stopped paying its bills. The tugboat operator compared its fate to the Yellow Fleet that was stuck in the Suez Canal for eight years, and French thrillseekers even landed a helicopter on the ship. Meanwhile, Chinese officials negotiated with Turkey, offering trade and tourism concessions.|$|E
