5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort <b>was</b> <b>shocking,</b> and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of Europe lay the Byzantine Empire, {{composed}} of Christians who had long followed a separate Orthodox rite; the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches had been in schism since 1054. Historians {{have argued that the}} desire to impose Roman church authority in the east may {{have been one of the}} goals of the crusade, although Urban II, who launched the First Crusade, never refers to such a goal in his letters on crusading. The Seljuq Turks had taken over almost all of Anatolia after the Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071; however, their conquests were piecemeal and led by semi-independent warlords, rather than by the sultan. A dramatic collapse of the empire's position on the eve of the Council of Clermont brought Byzantium to the brink of disaster. By the mid-1090s, the Byzantine Empire was largely confined to Balkan Europe and the northwestern fringe of Anatolia, and faced Norman enemies in the west as well as Turks in the east. In response to the defeat at Manzikert and subsequent Byzantine losses in Anatolia in 1074, Pope Gregory VII had called for the milites Christi ("soldiers of Christ") to go to Byzantium's aid. This call was largely ignored and even opposed. The reason for this was that while the defeat at Manzikert <b>was</b> <b>shocking,</b> it had limited significance and did not lead to major difficulties for the Byzantine empire, at least in the short term.|$|E

25|$|He {{found the}} capital run down and dirtythe streets, the markets, the promenades. Most {{of the people}} {{appeared}} in public wearing nothing but thin robes and battered straw hats. Houses were badly made and badly cared for. Public education had deteriorated. There were no free primary schools and other public schools were deficient. Most streets had not been maintained, and were fit for travel only by foot or by mule. The state of the army <b>was</b> <b>shocking.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Cannes Film Festival has {{its origins}} in 1932 when Jean Zay, the French Minister of National Education, on the {{proposal}} of historian Philippe Erlanger and {{with the support of}} the British and Americans, set up an international cinematographic festival. Its origins may be attributed in part to the French desire to compete with the Venice Film Festival, which at the time <b>was</b> <b>shocking</b> the democratic world by its fascist bias. The first festival was planned for 1939, Cannes was selected as the location for it, but the funding and organization were too slow and finally the beginning of World War II put an end to this plan.|$|E
25|$|The next step, wrote Kahn, was {{to impart}} unity and {{cohesion}} {{by means of}} a union of related consonants, or the repetition of similar vowel sounds (assonance). Poets were thus free to create novel and complex rhythms, with, if so desired, inversions that destroyed the beat of the strophe. As Kahn noted, this <b>was</b> <b>shocking</b> because traditionally it was the regularity of the strophe that gave the reader meaning. Symbolist concepts vacated the metronome-like symmetry and introduced liberty, flexibility and elasticity. Each was to find her own rhythmic force. The classicists feared that the dismantling of meter by the decadent Symbolist 'barbarians' would undermine the French language, and thus attack the very foundations of social order.|$|E

500|$|Critics previewed {{the first}} four episodes of the season under {{non-disclosure}} agreements that they not reveal any spoilers. Reviews began appearing as early as January 31.

Willa Paskin of Slate broke the embargo nearly a day early revealing several spoilers. Whereas [...] critics had been somewhat split on the propriety of binge-watching the first season, they were more supportive of the practice for season two.|$|E

[...] Rado remembers that long hair [...] "was a visible form of awareness in the consciousness expansion. The longer the hair got, the more expansive the mind was.

It <b>was</b> <b>shocking</b> to find myself in that situation, where I was that celebrity person." [...] At the 2013 Social Star Awards, PewDiePie greeted his fans personally despite security warning him against doing so.

500|$|The end of {{the film}} <b>was</b> <b>shocking</b> to black viewers who had {{expected}} that Sweetback would perish {{at the hands of the}} police [...] a common, even inevitable, fate of black men [...] "on the run" [...] in prior films. Film critic Roger Ebert cited the ending as a reason for the film not to be labeled as an exploitation film. Critical response was mixed. Kevin Thomas in the Los Angeles Times described the film as [...] "a series of stark, earthy vignettes, Van Peebles evokes the vitality, humor, pain, despair and omnipresent fear that is life for so many African-Americans". Stephen Holden in The New York Times called it [...] "an innovative, yet politically inflammatory film." [...] The film website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 73% [...] "Fresh".|$|E
500|$|Staci Krause of IGN {{had mixed}} {{perspectives}} on the episode's story arcs, comparing the advanced development in the personal story lines {{to the introduction of}} disappointing medical cases.

I'm really not sure why Cristina didn't just say yes, since two minutes before had said she was in it for the long haul. It seems like they are dragging this out for the sake of dragging it out." [...] Bailey's evolution in the episode, mainly her interactions with four competing attending physicians, were described as [...] "a reminder of why they called her the Nazi, something that was easy to forget with recent events." ...|$|E

Carabott wrote that Frank's return in the fifth season episode [...] "316" [...] <b>was</b> <b>shocking,</b> but seemed {{as though it was}} meant to be. He opined that: [...] "The chances of Frank being on that plane are astronomical {{and the fact that he}} was supposed to be the pilot of Flight 815 just makes the situation all the more unusual. His appearance in this episode is absurd but after four and a half seasons of Lost it makes perfect sense." [...] James Yates of the Staten Island Advance wrote that it was [...] "great" [...] to see Frank again, as he had missed the character's presence, and hoped he would play a major part upon returning to the island.|$|E

500|$|Previously, {{pressure}} {{had come}} from UKIP for the party to change its name and official tagline, 'UK Independence Now', believing it was a strategy to split their vote. This, {{in addition to the}} use of 'An' {{at the beginning of the}} party name, placing them highest alphabetically on the ballot paper, prompted an investigation by the Electoral Commission at the request of UKIP. Nattrass remarked [...] "UKIP does not have sole right to the word independence" [...] and the Commission soon dismissed the complaint. Notwithstanding, UKIP claimed the party's similar name unfairly cost them a seat in South West England to the benefit of the Green Party, with Nattrass' group acquiring around 23,000 votes in the region. UKIP's then-leader Nigel Farage later complained [...] "llowing Nattrass to launch a party with that name <b>was</b> <b>shocking</b> and showed the absolute contempt that the establishment have for us... they were given the green light to dupe voters." [...] Political scientists Matthew Goodwin and Caitlin Milazzo concur, calling it [...] "a deliberate attempt to confuse voters and damage Nattrass's old party." ...|$|E

500|$|Spotnitz wanted [...] "Deadalive" [...] {{to open in}} a {{way that}} would shock viewers and make them watch the entire episode. He {{concluded}} that the best way to do this was to show Mulder's funeral. He felt that [...] "the death of the hero [...] <b>was</b> <b>shocking</b> enough", but that no one expected [...] "Deadalive" [...] to blatantly open with a funeral. He elaborated, [...] "But here we are actually burying the man ... just pushing something as far as you possibly can because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it." [...] The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, [...] "It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, so we did all that." [...] Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under [...] "huge financial pressure", real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in post-production. Spotnitz later called the sequence [...] "a fun scene to write and stage" [...] and [...] "a great tease".|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} {{attracted}} controversy for its second episode, which saw {{the demise of}} a main character after her hand and head were forced into a deep fryer. The scene attracted over 250 complaints, 154 {{of them to the}} television watchdog, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the highest number of complaints for a television programme in 2002. Following the complaints, the BBC admitted that the scene [...] "clearly disturbed" [...] several viewers, but defended it as it was showing the audience [...] "the kind of threat which might be faced by agents engaged in the fight against terrorism." [...] The Broadcasting Standards Commission stated the scene <b>was</b> <b>shocking,</b> but [...] "in the context was acceptable and important for the later narrative". However the watchdog still criticised the BBC for failing to warn viewers of the violence to come in the scene. The controversy sparked a response from comedian Charlie Brooker in his Guardian column, stating: [...] "The moment her head was forced into the deep-fat-fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it'll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas like Casualty and Merseybeat sat up and blinked in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually had the nerve to confound expectation." ...|$|E
