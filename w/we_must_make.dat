2500|$|The phenomenalist {{phase of}} post-Humean {{empiricism}} ended by the 1940s, for {{by that time}} it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data.

But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement. Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal.
