500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears said to MTV News {{that she}} had thought of a [...] "really cool concept for the video, just to make it interesting. You'll have to see." [...] She then {{contacted}} Chris Marrs Piliero, who directed the music video for her previous single [...] "I Wanna Go", to work with her. She told him the basic story she had planned, which he described as a [...] "fairy-tale, sweet, knight-in-shining-armor feel to it. I said let's take that and make the fairy tale badass." [...] Spears also wanted her real-life boyfriend Jason Trawick to play the criminal. Marrs Piliero was initially hesitant to cast Trawick feeling that a professional actor would do a better job, but did not talk to Spears about it. He told USA Today, [...] "When you're doing nudity, I don't think {{it was at the}} top of Britney's list to bring in some random guy while her boyfriend watches. [...] We definitely wanted to make some passionate, steamy scenes, but we also wanted it to be intensely beautiful. We didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> raunchy. We wanted it to be sensual and steamy." [...] On September 6, 2011, Spears announced through her Twitter account {{that she had}} decided to shoot the video [...] "in the streets of merry old England when I get there." [...] In an interview with AOL, she explained, [...] "I've never shot on location out of the country of America for a video. So, it should be very interesting. It was partly my idea ... to see if it could to happen, and they were like, 'Yeah, it's a great idea,' so we did it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Back to December"'s {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Yoann Lemoine, who directed the video for Katy Perry's [...] "Teenage Dream", and was filmed in late December 2010 before Christmas Day. In an interview with Country Music Television, Lemoine explained that he developed {{the idea for the}} video after being inspired from the film, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. He also told MTV News that he wanted the video to be simple yet metaphorical. He added, [...] "I wanted to work on the coldness of feelings in a very visual way, playing with the snow, the distance and sadness." [...] He wanted to focus on Swift's look in the video so that she would come off as accessible, saying [...] "I wanted her to perform a very natural way, to make her look very European. This was the main challenge to me. All of Taylor's world is very far away from my culture, but I saw something in her that could be very rough and heartbreaking; far from the princess glittery outfits and glam that she often goes for." [...] Lemoine was allowed {{to take control of the}} whole production of the video, although it was Swift's idea to have her character leave the letter for her beloved. Swift's love interest in the video was played by male model, Guntars Asmanis. Lemoine commented that Asmanis was the perfect fit for Swift's love interest, saying [...] "I wanted a boy that was fragile and beautiful. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> a hunk or a perfect cheesy boy that would have killed the sincerity of the video." [...] The music video premiered on January 13, 2011, on CMT and Great American Country. Footages of the school and baseball stadium in the video were filmed in Binghamton, New York, in MacArthur Park while scenes with Swift were shot in an old country mansion outside of Nashville.|$|E

Assistant coach John Spencer was also let go, {{and was replaced by}} Covelo. The timing of the firing came as somewhat of a surprise, as it was announced hours after San Jose defeated Real Salt Lake 2–1 at home. Fioranelli said of the firing that, coming off of a win, it was not reactionary, and rather he had [...] "in the last two to three months...matured a gut feeling as to where [...] ", and that his respect for Kinnear [...] "would not have allowed [...] to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> another three months knowing [...] would have parted ways {{at the end of the}} season". In his first interview as head coach, Leitch reiterated Fioranelli's previously stated goals, saying that [...] "the goal of the team...is [...] make the playoffs". His first outing as head coach on June 28, 2017, was successful, seeing the Earthquakes achieve their first-ever victory over an MLS side in the U.S. Open Cup with a 2–1 victory against Seattle Sounders FC that would advance them to the USOC quarter finals for the first time since 2012.|$|E
