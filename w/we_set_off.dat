60|$|And <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> {{at a great}} pace, {{sometimes}} plunging {{through the}} bushes to the chest.|$|E
60|$|The {{others in}} their turn laughed at him, despising his ideal, and then <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> once more.|$|E
6000|$|I {{thought this}} odd; however, I said nothing, and <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off.</b> We went towards Camberwell Green, {{and when we}} were thereabouts, Wemmick said suddenly,-- ...|$|E
3000|$|<b>We</b> now <b>set</b> <b>off</b> to {{establish}} some new integral inequalities of Hermite-Hadamard type for n-time differentiable [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{no reason}} why <b>we</b> shouldn't <b>set</b> <b>off</b> at once," [...] Jacob said, quickly. [...] "We are not women, to be tired out by a bit of marchin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humbugged, you mean," [...] said Jack, laughing. [...] "You're right, Mak; <b>we</b> must <b>set</b> <b>off</b> at once. But {{what are}} we to do with poor Okandaga, now that we have got her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Not till near {{dawn was}} Eustacie startled from her rest by {{approaching}} steps. 'Nurse, is all ready?' she cried. 'Can <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off?</b> Are the horses there?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{not try to}} move," [...] he said to Percy. [...] "We sent a man for a vehicle, and a few necessaries, before <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> ourselves." ...|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} we were well off Barton's point, having sailed around the easterly end of the town, and the tempest was yet as fierce as when <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "And you'll {{have to get}} him and {{yourself}} ready as fast as possible," [...] said the youth in conclusion, [...] "for <b>we</b> shall <b>set</b> <b>off</b> {{as soon as my}} mother's trunks are packed." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1987, once more, Wes {{started to}} enjoy musical {{night of the}} Wouri riverbanks. He was {{impatient}} {{to get back in}} touch with the Mouataba spirit, to promote bafoun-bantou tradition and returned to the home of his ancestors. He revived the Kwa Kwassi orchestra and embarked on a tour in Bafoun country. A group of tourists turned up, and were all bewitched by the music, including a young woman from Lille, France. And so <b>Wes</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> for Europe, with his kalimba under his arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{our task}} {{to find that}} out," [...] replied Holmes; [...] "so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, <b>we</b> will <b>set</b> <b>off</b> for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details." ...|$|R
60|$|Neither of us {{was worse}} for his experience, so after shaking the snow from our clothing, <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> at a great rate down toward the warmth and comfort of the forest and the jungle.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will take}} but {{a minute to}} pick up {{something}}, if it's around, Sam. Besides, {{we have got to}} have something in our stomachs before <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> to hunt up Dick and Mr. Barrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I think I can. Well, {{you shall}} {{hear from me}} to-morrow." [...] He turned upon his heel, {{disregarding}} the trembling hand which the other held out to him, and <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> for King's Pyland.|$|E
6000|$|Every {{evening before}} the party {{separate}} for the night, Mrs. Gray [...] shall decide at what hour <b>we</b> shall <b>set</b> <b>off</b> the next morning, and [...] also at what hour we shall breakfast, after first hearing what [...] Vittorio's opinion is {{as to the}} best time for setting out.|$|R
6000|$|Then Pierre and I {{set about}} {{discussing}} {{the best course}} to pursue while leaving the town of York, as if <b>we</b> would <b>set</b> <b>off</b> that very night, when Uncle 'Rasmus {{put an end to}} the hoping and planning, at least so far as the present was concerned, by saying dreamily: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will be a}} ticklish job to {{make our}} way into Boston town now while the enemy is so keenly on the alert," [...] Archie said, {{as if there was}} no {{question}} in his mind but that <b>we</b> would <b>set</b> <b>off</b> without delay to do whatsoever we might to help our unfortunate comrade.|$|R
60|$|There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and {{the morning}} broke bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR FATHER: We are all well, and, on the whole, {{have enjoyed}} our {{residence}} in Rome very much. We are now, however, {{about ready to}} leave. <b>We</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> this afternoon for Florence and the north of Italy.|$|E
60|$|With {{a rueful}} smile, I {{directed}} that our original course be resumed, {{and once again}} <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> toward merry England. That was three months ago, and we haven't arrived yet; {{nor is there any}} likelihood that we ever shall.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right, Captain Trench. <b>We</b> must <b>set</b> <b>off</b> {{with the}} least {{possible}} delay. Will you and your son start off in advance to get something fresh for breakfast while Master Paul and I remain {{to pack up and}} bring on our camp equipage? Hunters, you know, should travel light--we will do the heavy work for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As soon as {{we heard}} of it <b>we</b> all <b>set</b> <b>off</b> on a bear-hunt. It was jolly fun, {{although}} I did {{not so much as}} catch a sight of him. Father shot him at a three-hundred-foot range. It was a Winchester rifle with a thirty-two cartridge. It was a beautiful shot, Walter said, and I wish I had made it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my father, {{that is no}} difficulty; for I {{will ride}} and you shall walk. You will bring the horse here instead of {{starting}} straight from the palace. Then <b>we</b> will <b>set</b> <b>off</b> together, and I will gallop on in advance. When you reach Gunrig's house in the evening, {{you will find the}} horse fed and rested, and ready for you to go on." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{impossible}} {{to be anything but}} delighted with the proposal, so <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> together in great good-humour. In the relief of his mind, he opened his heart, and gave up as much of Mantua as a Cicerone could.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did not hear, sir. In fact, <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> by daylight. But {{last night}} {{it was hoped that}} the squadron, which was acting independently, had lost their way, and would come in this morning. Where is the Boer force now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{we can go}} when we please, and {{the sooner}} <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> the better, for surely it would be folly to make any attempt at aiding Silas while he is so closely guarded," [...] I cried, and Hiram replied grimly: ...|$|E
6000|$|Beatrice {{could have}} answered, [...] "Not at all;" [...] but she said, [...] "O never mind, it can't be helped; {{we should be}} late even if <b>we</b> were to <b>set</b> <b>off</b> now, and besides we might be caught and stopped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Phew! what a {{noise that}} cannon cracker did make!" [...] murmured Phil. [...] "If <b>we</b> had <b>set</b> that <b>off</b> in the morning--as we intended--I reckon {{it would have}} woke up the {{neighborhood}} pretty well." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> three <b>set</b> <b>off,</b> {{the gossip}} leaning on her toes, {{tripping}} between us. She was much gratified by Lettie's {{information concerning the}} proposals for the new home. We left her in a glow of congratulatory smiles on the highway. But the clouds had upreared, and stretched in two great arms, reaching overhead. The little spinster hurried along, but the black hands of the clouds kept pace and clutched her. A sudden gust of wind shuddered in the trees, and rushed upon her cloak, blowing its bugles.|$|R
60|$|So, having marched {{orderly and}} speedily, while {{the banks of}} the roadway hid us, <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> to run, Randal and Robin {{gripping}} me when we were full in sight of the moat, of the drawbridge (which was down), and the gate.|$|E
6000|$|... "And do you {{remember}} the big cannon cracker <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> in the courtyard?" [...] Dave's eyes began to twinkle. [...] "I heard afterwards that Pop Swingly, the janitor, was scared almost to death. He thought somebody was trying to blow up the building." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those {{were the}} orders. Master Wright claimed {{that it would}} not be safe for us to make any try at leaving Boston save at night, and unless <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> at once four and twenty hours will be wasted just when time is most precious." ...|$|E
60|$|We now busied {{ourselves}} in collecting together the dying embers of our fire and in preparing breakfast, {{which consisted of}} tea, hard biscuit, and cold monkey. None of us liked the monkey; not that its flesh was bad--quite the contrary--but it looked so like a small roasted baby {{that we could not}} relish it at all. However, it was all we had; for <b>we</b> had <b>set</b> <b>off</b> on this hunting excursion intending to live by our rifles, but had been unfortunate, having seen nothing except a monkey or two.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's lucky {{white men}} don't walk much in this country," [...] Wyndham replied. [...] "A pasear round the plaza while the band plays is {{about all the}} {{exercise}} people take, and I don't imagine anybody above the rank of a peon has ever walked from the mission to the port. In fact, it's very possible Don Ramon hasn't calculated that <b>we</b> might <b>set</b> <b>off</b> on foot." [...] He paused {{and went to the}} window. [...] "The night's dark but very calm. A noise would carry; we must wait for some time." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{intelligent}} brute {{sniffed at}} it all over, then ran whining {{a little way}} down the avenue, came back to sniff the coat again, and finally elevating its stump of a tail in triumph, uttered a succession of sharp yelps {{to show that it}} was satisfied that it had struck the trail. Its owner tied a long cord to its collar to prevent it from going too fast for us, and <b>we</b> all <b>set</b> <b>off</b> upon our search, the dog tugging and training at its leash in its excitement as it followed in the general's footsteps.|$|R
