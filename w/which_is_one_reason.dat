The senior prom dress was a sexy black mini dress that was befitting of her more desirable date. The dresses presented an identity crisis to one character: [...] "Here's the thing – I've never really known for sure which {{of those two}} people I am – the girl who almost doesn't get asked to the prom at all or the girl who gets {{to go with the}} really cute guy.

500|$|Another {{hallmark}} {{of his writing}} {{was the use of}} capitalised dialogue without quotation marks, used to indicate the character of Death communicating telepathically into a character's mind. Other characters or types of characters were given similarly distinctive ways of speaking, such as the auditors of reality never having quotation marks, Ankh-Morpork grocers never using punctuation correctly, and golems capitalising each word in everything they say. Pratchett also made up a new colour, octarine, a 'fluorescent greenish-yellow-purple', which is the eighth colour in the Discworld spectrum—the colour of magic. Indeed, the number eight itself is regarded in the Discworld as being a magical number; for example, the eighth son of an eighth son will be a wizard, and his eighth son will be a [...] "sourcerer", extremely powerful users of magic with abilities far beyond what most wizards usually achieve (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why wizards are not allowed to have children).|$|E
500|$|The band began {{recording}} {{without much}} material {{and needed to}} compose songs on the spot, either by jamming or talking through ideas. Morrison enjoyed not having multiple takes, as on The Soft Parade, and showed up to the sessions on time and sober, unlike sessions for that album. The absence of Rothchild helped as he was a perfectionist who insisted on many takes. In 1994, guitarist Robby Krieger stated, [...] "Rothchild was gone, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why {{we had so much}} fun. The warden was gone." [...] Despite its troubled beginnings, L.A. Woman contains some of the Doors' most critically acclaimed songs, {{as well as some of}} their most blues-oriented. Lyrically, it deals with contemporary topics such as love, life in Los Angeles, and complex aspects of the human experience. Manzarek explained the band did not [...] "approach the album with one vision, but after we started working on the songs, we realized that they're talking about L.A. They're about men, women, boys, girls, love, loss, lovers-lost, and lovers-found in Los Angeles". The album, as a whole, demonstrated Morrison's songwriting abilities, combined with his poetic phrasing and enthusiasm for Los Angeles, and a desire to leave the city with his partner, Pamela Courson. Artistically, L.A. Woman saw the band mixing blues, psychedelia, and jazz, often within a single song. For the first time since [...] "The End" [...] and [...] "When the Music's Over", the group incorporated longer songs, including [...] "L.A. Woman" [...] and [...] "Riders on the Storm".|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the main}} psychoactive {{constituent}} of Cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), {{the plant is}} known to contain more than 500 compounds, among them at least 113 cannabinoids; however, most of these [...] "minor" [...] cannabinoids are only produced in trace amounts. Besides THC, another cannabinoid produced in high concentrations by some plants is cannabidiol (CBD), which is not psychoactive but has recently been shown to block the effect of THC in the nervous system. Differences in the chemical composition of Cannabis varieties may produce different effects in humans. Synthetic THC, called dronabinol, does not contain CBD, CBN, or other cannabinoids, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why its pharmacological effects may differ significantly from those of natural Cannabis preparations.|$|E
2500|$|Today LET {{is often}} treated {{as some sort}} of [...] "Lorentzian" [...] or [...] "neo-Lorentzian" [...] {{interpretation}} of special relativity. The introduction of length contraction and time dilation for all phenomena in a [...] "preferred" [...] frame of reference, which plays the role of Lorentz's immobile aether, leads to the complete Lorentz transformation (see the Robertson–Mansouri–Sexl test theory as an example). Because the same mathematical formalism occurs in both, {{it is not possible to}} distinguish between LET and SR by experiment. However, in LET the existence of an undetectable aether is assumed and the validity of the relativity principle seems to be only coincidental, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why SR is commonly preferred over LET.|$|E
2500|$|The word vagina is {{commonly}} avoided in conversation, {{and many people}} are confused about its anatomy, {{including the fact that}} the vagina is not used for urination. This is exacerbated by phrases such as [...] "boys have a penis, girls have a vagina", which causes children to think that girls have one orifice in the pelvic area. Author Hilda Hutcherson stated, [...] "Because many [...] have been conditioned since childhood through verbal and nonverbal cues to think of [...] genitals as ugly, smelly and unclean, [...] aren't able to fully enjoy intimate encounters" [...] because of fear that their partner will dislike the sight, smell, or taste of their genitals. She argued that women, unlike men, did not have locker room experiences in school where they compared each other's genitals, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> so many women wonder if their genitals are normal. Scholar Catherine Blackledge stated that having a vagina meant she would typically be treated less well than her vagina-less counterparts and subject to inequalities (such as job inequality), which she categorized as being treated like a second-class citizen.|$|E

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Parsons {{received}} a bachelor's degree from the University of Houston. He was prolific during this time, appearing in 17 plays in 3 years. He was {{a founding member of}} Infernal Bridegroom Productions and regularly appeared at the Stages Repertory Theatre. Parsons enrolled in graduate school at the University of San Diego in 1999. He was one of seven students accepted into a special two-year course in classical theater, taught in partnership with the Old Globe Theater. Program director Rick Seer recalled having reservations about admitting Parsons, saying, [...] "Jim is a very specific personality. He's thoroughly original, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> he's been so successful. But we worried, 'Does that adapt itself to classical theater, does that adapt itself to the kind of training that we're doing?' But we decided that he was so talented that we would give him a try and see how it worked out." [...] Parsons enjoyed school and told an interviewer that he would have pursued a doctorate in acting if possible: [...] "school was so safe!.....you frequently would surprise yourself by what you were capable of, and you were not surprised by some things." [...] Parsons graduated in 2001 and moved to New York.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{fatty acids}} are non-essential, meaning {{the body can}} produce them as needed, {{generally}} from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are essential and must {{be included in the}} diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these [...] "omega" [...] long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.|$|E

6000|$|The way I {{have taken}} {{is not so}} strait as metaphrase, nor so loose as paraphrase; some things, too, I have omitted, and {{sometimes}} have added of my own. Yet the omissions, I hope, are but of circumstances, and such as would have no grace in English; and the additions, I also hope, are easily deduced from Virgil's sense. They will seem (at least, I have the vanity to think so), not stuck into him, but growing out of him. He studies brevity {{more than any other}} poet; but he had the advantage of a language wherein much may be comprehended in a little space. We and all the modern tongues have more articles and pronouns, besides signs of tenses and cases, and other barbarities on which our speech is built, by the faults of our forefathers. The Romans founded theirs upon the Greek; and the Greeks, we know, were labouring many hundred years upon their language before they brought it to perfection. They rejected all those signs, and cut off as many articles as they could spare, comprehending in one word what we are constrained to express in two; <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why we cannot write so concisely as they have done. The word pater, for example, signifies not only [...] "a father," [...] but [...] "your father," [...] "my father," [...] "his or her father"--all included in a word.|$|E
6000|$|There is, therefore, {{about all}} {{complete}} conviction {{a kind of}} huge helplessness. The belief is so big {{that it takes a}} long time to get it into action. And this hesitation chiefly arises, oddly enough, from an indifference about where one should begin. All roads lead to Rome; <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why many people never get there. In the case of this defence of the Christian conviction I confess that I would as soon begin the argument with one thing as another; I would begin it with a turnip or a taximeter cab. But if I am to be at all careful about making my meaning clear, it will, I think, be wiser to continue the current arguments of the last chapter, which was concerned to urge the first of these mystical coincidences, or rather ratifications. All I had hitherto heard of Christian theology had alienated me from it. I was a pagan at the age of twelve, and a complete agnostic by the age of sixteen; and I cannot understand any one passing the age of seventeen without having asked himself so simple a question. I did, indeed, retain a cloudy reverence for a cosmic deity and a great historical interest in the Founder of Christianity. But I certainly regarded Him as a man; though perhaps I thought that, even in that point, He had an advantage over some of His modern critics. I read the scientific and sceptical literature of my time--all of it, at least, that I could find written in English and lying about; and I read nothing else; I mean I read nothing else on any other note of philosophy. The penny dreadfuls which I also read were indeed in a healthy and heroic tradition of Christianity; but I did not know this at the time. I never read a line of Christian apologetics. I read as little as I can of them now. It was Huxley and Herbert Spencer and Bradlaugh who brought me back to orthodox theology. They sowed in my mind my first wild doubts of doubt. Our grandmothers were quite right when they said that Tom Paine and the free-thinkers unsettled the mind. They do. They unsettled mine horribly. The rationalist made me question whether reason was of any use whatever; and when I had finished Herbert Spencer I had got as far as doubting (for the first time) whether evolution had occurred at all. As I laid down the last of Colonel Ingersoll's atheistic lectures the dreadful thought broke across my mind, [...] "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian." [...] I was in a desperate way.|$|E
