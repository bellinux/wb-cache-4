40|$|The {{claims of}} science and the claims of {{probability}} combine in two ways. In one, probability {{is part of the}} content of science, as in statistical mechanics and quantum theory and an enormous range of &quot;models &quot; developed in applied statistics. In the other, probability is the tool used to explain and to justify methods of inference from records of observations, as in every science from psychiatry to physics. These intimacies between science and probability are logical sports, for while we think science aims to say <b>what</b> <b>happens,</b> <b>what</b> has <b>happened,</b> <b>what</b> will <b>happen,</b> <b>what</b> would <b>happen</b> if other things were to <b>happen,</b> <b>what</b> could and could not <b>happen,</b> <b>what</b> will nearly <b>happen,</b> or <b>what</b> will approximate <b>what</b> will <b>happen,</b> probability claims say none of these things, or at least none of them about the phenomena with which science is concerned. On that, at least, almost all philosophical interpreters of probability since DeMoivre agree, with whatever reluctance. Consider some examples. According to Hume and to many moderns, probability is a measure of opinion, of credence or degree of belief. But measures of opinion are not statements about <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in nature or society, <b>what</b> has <b>happened,</b> <b>what</b> will <b>happen,</b> <b>what</b> would <b>happen</b> if other things were to happen, etc. They are, at most, statements about the mental state of the opinion-holder, or about what the opinion-holder will do if offered wagers.
