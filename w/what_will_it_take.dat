The Mexican police said the second massacre could have been an act of revenge by the Gulf Cartel to Los Zetas for the earlier killings. Along with the decapitated bodies was a message allegedly signed by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, where he demanded the municipality mayor of Nuevo Laredo, Benjamín Galván, along with other municipal and state leaders and public safety officials to recognize the Sinaloa cartel's presence in the area and stop insisting he is not in the city. The message read the following: [...] "You want credibility that I am in NL? <b>What</b> <b>will</b> <b>it</b> <b>take,</b> bringing the heads of Zeta leaders? Or yours? Mr. Galván, since you want to give us a sweet treat, with you coming out saying that nothing is happening here and all is well, continue with the same and I assure you that heads will keep rolling.

And you Olvera, Director of Public Security appointed entirely by Z-40, who is your buddy, keep declaring that my staff does not operate here in Nuevo Laredo. Or you, Almanza, stating that the dismembered were masons, traders, migrants or simple and humble workers (and not what they were Zetas).
