The trial was conducted during 2015 - 2016 season under Mediterranean conditions (Pisa, Italy). The results showed the success of the combination of roller/crimper and flaming in inhibiting the re-growth of the clover(Trifolium squarrosum L.) and preparing a dead mulch in no-till plots (NT). However, weeds were able to re-grow shortly after transplanting in these plots and no decrease in weed abundance, as total weed cover, by the dead mulch was registered further in the seasonal though the clover controlled initially 70 % of weed abundance. Among the weed species present, the dead mulch enhanced selectively the emergence of Artemisia vulgaris L. and Daucus carota L. When used as green manure in conventionally tilled plots (CT), the clover had no residual effect on weeds. Compared with CT, the soil cover of weeds in NT was 40 % higher. Likewise, weed biomass at harvest time in NT was much more than CT and the resulting competition was highly noticeable on tomato plant biomass. Regarding weed diversity, NT increased weed species richness and induced changes in the weed flora during the season. It was well shown that no-till practices are challenging in fields with high weed seed bank and perennial weed species. In some conditions, a dead mulch may offer also the ideal growth conditions mainly of nutrients and humidity for some weed species.

40|$|Keywords: Intercropping, narrow planting, precise {{fertilizer}} placement, radiation interception, leaf stripping, detasselling, Land Equivalent Ratio, maize, pumpkin, dry beans, reduced herbicide dosages In the tropics, weeds {{cause more}} crop losses and farmers spend {{more of their}} time weeding crops {{than in any other}} part of the world. Weeds form a major factor which contributes to the miserable quality of life of smallholder farmers, especially of women and children, in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa. The effects of maize-pumpkin and maize-bean intercropping and, narrow row planting and precise basal fertilizer placement in monocrop maize, on crop and weed radiation interception (RI), crop yields, weed emergence, growth and fecundity were investigated in this study. The effects of leaf stripping (removal of the lowest 2 - 6 leaves) and detasselling maize at anthesis on the radiant environment and crop yields in a maize monocrop and maize-pumpkin and maize-bean intercrops were also studied to determine the impact of these interventions on yield of component crops. The aim of the studies was to generate technologies that could be integrated into the production practices of smallholder farmers to suppress weeds and alleviate the severe weeding burden faced by these farmers while ensuring high crop productivity. Maize-pumpkin and maize-bean intercropping reduced weed biomass by 50 - 66 % when established at a density of 12, 300 plants ha - 1 for pumpkins equivalent to 33 % of the maize density (37, 000 plants ha - 1), and 222, 000 plants ha - 1 for beans. Lower densities of pumpkins than 33 % of the maize density failed to reduce weed biomass more than that achieved by sole maize. Sole maize crops were weeded twice or thrice to achieve the same weed biomass as intercrops weeded once showed that intercropping could reduce the weeding requirements of maize by 33 to 67 %. Maize grain yield was reduced by 20 % in one out of four seasons in the first study on maize-pumpkin intercropping. Maize grain yield was not reduced in three seasons when the maize-pumpkin intercropping treatments were leaf stripped and/or detasselled and the trend of leaf stripping and detasselling alleviating the effects of companion crop competition on maize grain was shown in the maize-bean intercrop experiments as well. Intercrop productivity increased with leaf stripping and detasselling as a result of greater penetration of radiation to the companion crop and their effects of increasing dry matter distributed to the maize cob (indicated by 1000 -grain weight, cob weight, and kernel weight cob - 1). Leaf stripping maize at anthesis focused on the removal of leaves that were beginning to senesce. If they would remain on the plant they would compete with the cob for assimilates as they senesce further, until necrosis. Detasselling is known to remove apical dominance and to increase radiation penetration to the middle leaves on the maize plant that produce most assimilates destined for the cob. Leaf stripping did not affect the ability of the intercrop to suppress weed growth and seed production. In maize monocrops more weed biomass and weed seeds were produced with leaf stripping and detasselling. Maize grain yield decreased with an increase in maize density from 30, 000 plants ha - 1 to 36, 000 and 42, 000 plants ha - 1 and <b>weed</b> growth <b>suppression</b> increased with an increase in maize density in a semi arid location in Zimbabwe. Planting maize using narrow row (60 cm × 45 cm) and (75 cm × 36 cm) spatial arrangements increased radiation interception by maize plants by 16 to 24 % and maize grain yields by 15 to 26 % compared to wide row (90 cm × 30 cm) spatial arrangement commonly used by smallholder farmers. Weed biomass was reduced by 20 to 80 %, dependent on weed species, in narrow row spatial arrangements compared to normal farmer planting patterns. The duration of the weed free period required to attain maximum yield increased from 6 weeks after emergence (WAE) in the 60 cm × 45 cm spatial arrangement to 9 WAE in the wider row spatial arrangements. It is, therefore, risky for smallholder farmers to increase maize density to suppress weeds as this will lead to maize grain yield reductions. The use of narrow rows proved to be a better option. Precise fertilizer placement (banding and spot placement) resulted in higher rates of early growth and by 4 WAE these treatments intercepted 20 % more of the incoming radiation than a broadcast placement method. Weed emergence, growth and seed production was higher in the broadcast placement treatment as a result of weeds intercepting more incoming radiation and greater access to applied fertilizer nutrients. High fertilizer rates of 225 kg ha - 1 of a compound fertilizer (8 % N, 14 % K 2 O, 7 % P 2 O 5), reduced maize grain yield by 15 % compared to 150 kg ha - 1 in a season characterized by drought. It was hypothesized that high concentrations of fertilizer around the root zone predisposed the maize plants to more severe effects of drought than lower fertilizer application rates. Reduced dosages of atrazine and nicosulfuron (25 % of the Label Recommended Dosages, LRDs) protected maize from weeds as well as the full LRDs of each herbicide. The reduced dosages suppressed weed competition during the critical period for weed control in maize. However, the tolerant weed species Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn., Setaria verticillata (L.) Beauv., Setaria homonyma (Stead.) Chiov. for atrazine and E. indica, Galinsoga parviflora Cav. and Portulaca oleracea L. for nicosulfuron, tended to escape the herbicide effects and survive as dosages were reduced. Reduced dosages of these herbicides have to be combined with hoe weeding or ox-cultivation to prevent the inadvertent selection of these species by the reduced dose strategy. Recalcitrant species recovering from tillage were shown to be more vulnerable to reduced herbicide toxicity in a greenhouse experiment. It was concluded that cultural weed management techniques that enhance radiation capture by the crop were effective in suppressing weed growth and seed production and increasing crop yields and should be incorporated into smallholder farmer's production practices in a systematic manner as part of Integrated Weed Management and cropping system design...|$|R

Specifically, T. candida was proven to successfully grow in conditions of high population density, yet further research into this growth option is required.To further investigate the genus Tephrosia and its effective growth in stressful habitats, researchers at the University of Zimbabwe studied carbon and nitrogen mineralization patterns of this legume. Mineralization, or the decomposition of organic matter, provides fixed nitrogen for other plants to use. They found that Tephrosia released nitrogen at a slow rate. This pattern {{could be due to}} nitrogen binding to polyphenols, or natural organic molecules. This prevents subsequent loss of nitrogen and promotes crop uptake along with nitrogen release. Polyphenol to nitrogen ratios within plants can give evidence toward the quality of biomass and can predict the nitrogen release pattern. While there exist several Tephrosia taxa that exhibit slow nitrogen release, many possess rapid rates of nitrogen release as well. Rapid release is not necessarily compatible with intercropping because it does not share this pattern with maize. However, the slow release of nitrogen in the T. candida species is able to synchronize with the nitrogen demand of maize, benefiting the remaining maize in the following season.Other benefits of T. candida include higher biomass production, nematode resistance, closed canopy growth and <b>weed</b> <b>suppression.</b>|$|E

Forage radish was compared to rye (Secale cereale L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and no cover crop treatments. Early and typical corn planting dates along with contrasting herbicide management strategies were compared over four site-years. Forage radish did not reduce population or yield in subsequent corn crops. Forage radish provided complete suppression of winter annual weeds {{in the fall and}} early spring but the suppression did not persist into the following cropping season. When forage radish cover crops were used in place of pre-plant burn down herbicide treatments to control weeds in early planted corn, some weeds were present at the time of corn emergence but corn yields were not reduced if emerged weeds were controlled with a postemergence herbicide. Controlled environment bioassays involving cover crop amended soil, aqueous plant extracts, and aqueous soil extracts along with a field experiment involving planted weed seeds did not provide evidence of allelopathy. In a residue moving experiment, no difference in spring <b>weed</b> <b>suppression</b> was observed if forage radish residues were removed prior to killing frost in November or left in place to decompose in three of four site-years. These results were supported by planting date experiments where fall ground cover and spring <b>weed</b> <b>suppression</b> was greatest for earlier planting dates of forage radish cover crops. Thus, rapid and competitive fall growth, rather than allelopathy, is the most likely mechanism of <b>weed</b> <b>suppression</b> by forage radish winter cover crop.

Correlation analysis showed that the competitive effect of clover on transplanted leek was strongly correlated with maximum canopy height, indicating that yield reduction was mainly caused by competition for light. Subterranean clover, being the shortest species, gave inadequate <b>weed</b> <b>suppression,</b> whereas all other species were found to provide at least reasonable <b>weed</b> <b>suppression.</b> Subterranean clover reduced individual leek plant dry weight more strongly (60 %) than expected based on its canopy height.

A, (2) evaluate the performance of legume-based mixtures, in terms of biomass production, N fixation and <b>weed</b> <b>suppression,</b> (3) evaluate the competitive ability of the different legume and non-legume species in mixtures by using a replacement series design and (4) evaluate different management strategies to effectively manage mixtures for N fixation and <b>weed</b> <b>suppression.</b> Experiments were conducted over two years, and mixtures were designed using a replacement series. In monoculture, Crimson Clover fixed the most N (111 kgN. Ha- 1 in 2008 and 71 kgN. Ha 1 in 2009) and it was the most weed suppressive legume (12 g. m- 2 in 2008 and 20 g. m- 2 in 2009). Cowpea fixed the lowest amount of N in both years (12 kg N. Ha- 1 in 2008 and 13 kg N. Ha- 1 in 2009), but accessed more soil N (50 kg N. Ha- 1 in 2008 and 58 kg N. Ha- 1) than any of the legumes and it was the least weed suppressive legume in 2009 (250 g. m- 2 in 2009). Regarding the non-legumes, Sorghum Sudan (938 g. m- 2 and 632 g. m- 2) had the greatest biomass production in monoculture at high and low seeding densities (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 0001), while Buckwheat was the most weed suppressive (15 and 30 g. m- 2) species in monoculture (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 0001). Buckwheat took up similar amounts of soil N than Sorghum Sudan, even though it had lower above ground biomass. In all the mixtures, except Buckwheat, the LER was generally greater than one. The legumes in all the mixtures, except in the Buckwheat mixture, relied slightly more on N fixation than in monoculture. For non-viny legumes, the total N fixed was significantly greater in monocultures than in all the mixtures (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 05). For the viny legumes, total N fixed in mixtures with C- 4 grass species was not significantly different from the monocultures, but in Buckwheat mixtures significantly less N than monoculture was fixed (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 05). The weed suppressive capacity of the mixtures depended on the species involved, and there was no consistent improvement in mixture <b>weed</b> <b>suppression</b> compared to the monocultures (Tukey's HSD, p less than 0. 05). The competitive ability of the non-legumes can be ranked as follows: Buckwheat to Sorghum Sudan to Japanese Millet to Flax. Within non-viny legumes, the Berseem Clover was more competitive than Crimson Clover, and within the viny species Cowpea was more competitive than Soybean Tyrone and Chickling Vetch. There was a functional trade-off between N fixation and weed suppression: mixtures that are effective at suppressing weeds (Buckwheat mixtures) also suppress legumes and legumes that are competitive (Cowpea) in mixture do not fix a lot of nitrogen. In mixtures containing species with complementary growth times (Clovers and Sorghum Sudan / Buckwheat), mowing the competitive non-legumes increased legume biomass five-fold in Buckwheat mixtures and two-fold in Sorghum Sudan mixtures, while <b>weed</b> <b>suppression</b> was maintained. Nitrogen fixation increased eight- to ten-fold in mowed Buckwheat mixtures and two-to four-fold in mowed Sorghum Sudan mixtures. Mowing competitive species in temporally complementary mixtures can avoid the trade-offs in N fixation and <b>weed</b> <b>suppression...</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{net effect}} of co-occurring {{competition}} and facilitation on growth is of practical interest. Positive density effects on <b>weed</b> <b>suppression</b> and stabilization may exceed negative effects of resource competition, so that finally trees growing in community may outperform their solitarily growing neighbours.|$|E
