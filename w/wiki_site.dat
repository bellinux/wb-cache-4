25|$|Wikipedia {{became the}} most famous <b>wiki</b> <b>site,</b> {{entering}} the top ten most popular websites in 2007. In the early 2000s (decade), wikis were increasingly adopted in enterprise as collaborative software. Common uses included project communication, intranets, and documentation, initially for technical users. Some companies use wikis as their only collaborative software and {{as a replacement for}} static intranets, and some schools and universities use wikis to enhance group learning. There may be greater use of wikis behind firewalls than on the public Internet. On March 15, 2007, the word wiki was listed in the online Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2006, {{independent}} publishers The Friday Project launched Sickipedia (a pun on [...] "Wikipedia"), {{a venture}} {{to publish a}} collection of [...] "sick jokes" [...] gathered from B3ta contributors. A public <b>wiki</b> <b>site</b> was established to collect user-submitted humour for a book. The site encouraged submission of jokes intended to be bad taste or taboo, and entries were organised under a categorisation system of topics which included racism, jokes about celebrities, current affairs and sexual humour. Similarly to the main B3ta site, Sickipedia site functionality offered an electronic voting system to subject user submissions {{to a form of}} peer review. Popular jokes were then included in lists of the [...] "best of the day", [...] "best of the week" [...] etc.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to articles about specific entries on the wiki, several papers {{speak of the}} website in general—usually in a section devoted to technology or the Internet. This was the case when Uncyclopedia was referenced in the Boston Herald and The Guardian. Although most articles mentioning Uncyclopedia are specific to the site, there are other articles about Wikia or Wikipedia that just mention its name briefly. These include the editorial in The Register discussing the Seigenthaler incident, in which Uncyclopedia was named only once. It has also been listed {{as one of the}} [...] "Top 100 Undiscovered Web Sites" [...] in PC Magazine, as well as among the [...] "101 most useful websites" [...] on the internet by The Sunday Telegraph. Seattle Post-Intelligencer considers Uncyclopedia to be the <b>wiki</b> <b>site</b> equivalent of The Onion.|$|E

40|$|Wikis, {{a form of}} website {{increasingly}} popular since the growth of Wikipedia, are breaking new ground. Little scholarly research has investigated wikis {{and the potential for}} public relations. This study investigates how two health wikis (wikihealth. com and health content on wikipedia. com) facilitate dialogic principles. The pilot study found that both <b>wiki</b> <b>sites</b> exhibited the principles of dialogic public relations. Additionally, correlations were found between dialogic content, website value, and commitment to future usage...|$|R

2500|$|The open {{philosophy}} of wiki– allowing anyone to edit content – does not ensure that every editor's intentions are well-mannered. For example, vandalism (changing wiki content to something offensive, adding nonsense or deliberately adding incorrect information, such as hoax information) {{can be a}} major problem. On larger <b>wiki</b> <b>sites,</b> such as those run by the Wikimedia Foundation, vandalism can go unnoticed for some period of time. Wikis, because of their open nature, are susceptible to intentional disruption, known as [...] "trolling".|$|R

The history and culture of the Supernatural fandom is documented, including the Argot peculiar to this fandom.|$|R
50|$|A {{practice}} {{that has grown}} with the MXlo concept is seeding. Once MXlo has been implemented for a given domain, {{and if there is}} no intention to use the domain anymore, some administrators seed spam lists by publishing fake e-mail addresses associated with the target domain in public forums—blogs, <b>wiki</b> <b>sites,</b> etc.—and entering them in web forms that spammers are known to harvest e-mail addresses from. This technique intentionally creates unnecessary traffic for high volume spam hosts and increases their operating costs—and, in some cases, assists the aforementioned self-inflicted DoS attacks.|$|R
50|$|Ward Cunningham {{has contributed}} to the {{practice}} of object-oriented programming, in particular the use of pattern languages and (with Kent Beck) the class-responsibility-collaboration cards.

50|$|Wiki spam {{is a form}} of link spam on wiki pages. The spammer {{uses the}} open editability of wiki systems to place links from the <b>wiki</b> <b>site</b> to the spam site. The subject of the spam site is often {{unrelated}} to the wiki page where the link is added.|$|E

5000|$|The WikiWikiWeb is {{the first}} ever wiki, or user-editable website. It was {{launched}} on 25 March 1995 by its inventor, programmer Ward Cunningham, to accompany the Portland Pattern Repository website discussing software design patterns. The name WikiWikiWeb originally also applied to the wiki software that operated the website, written in the Perl programming language and later renamed to [...] "WikiBase". The site is frequently referred to by its users as simply [...] "Wiki", and a convention established among users of the early network of <b>wiki</b> <b>sites</b> that followed was that using the word with a capitalized W referred exclusively to the original site.|$|R

It contains a short overview of wiki services that may be used in education, something about history of wikis, their characteristics and security. The applied questionnaires to teachers and students have permitted to elaborate conclusions about the utility of collaborative sites and to express {{the point of view of}} teachers referring to the possibilities to use wikis in the future...|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{opinion of}} the work has also been voiced, with contentions that the OCB perpetuates certain beer history myths, and other {{omissions}} published by writers and beer enthusiasts, some of whom OCB contributors themselves. Shortly after publication an unofficial <b>wiki</b> <b>site</b> was launched to [...] "make comments, add annotation, identify errata and suggest further sources to the text of The Oxford Companion to Beer".|$|E

25|$|Camel case {{is used in}} some wiki markup {{languages}} for {{terms that}} should be automatically linked to other wiki pages. This convention was originally used in Ward Cunningham's original wiki software, WikiWikiWeb, and can be activated in most other wikis. Some wiki engines such as TiddlyWiki, Trac and PmWiki make use {{of it in the}} default settings, but usually also provide a configuration mechanism or plugin to disable it. Wikipedia formerly used camel case linking as well, but switched to explicit link markup using square brackets and many other <b>wiki</b> <b>sites</b> have done the same. Some wikis that do not use camel case linking may still use the camel case as a naming convention, such as AboutUs.|$|R
40|$|Informal {{learning}} in blended and online settings plays {{an increasingly important}} role in the continuous professional development of individuals. Yet, how do individuals engage into these types of activities? We argue that social capital theory can provide valuable insights into how people behave and decide to take part in (in) formal learning. Using social network analysis, we provide empirical evidence on an informal learning activity, where participants collaboratively created knowledge on <b>wiki</b> <b>sites</b> on a predefined set of topics. Our results show that there are three types of active participants in these type of informal learning activities, namely leaders, collaborators and lone editors. These findings provide valuable insights for other, similar activities that aim at enhancing the professional development of individuals...|$|R
