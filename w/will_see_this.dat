25|$|A similar issue arises for {{passengers}} arriving at Wimbledon by tram. Normally tram users {{do not touch}} out, but at Wimbledon they must do so to leave the station; touching out at the regular turnstile accomplishes this. If, however, a passenger touches their card at a standalone Oyster reader (such as the one by the manual gates), the system <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> as starting a new journey rather than ending one, and will deduct a maximum fare from the card.|$|E

When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement. If the customer is overdrawn, {{he will have a}} negative balance, reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement.|$|E

A few minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> through.|$|E
500|$|Historically, {{well over}} one million tonnes of Australian rice has been {{produced}} each year and exported to over 70 countries, generating A$500 million in export income and supporting 63 towns in the Riverina and northern Victoria. [...] More recently, drought has drastically reduced this quantity to less than 30,000 tonnes with resultant economic effects. [...] Recent rains however <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> volume increase. The headquarters of Ricegrowers Limited, who trade under the SunRice name, is located in Leeton, Australia's rice capital. Major rice mills are located in Leeton, Coleambally and the largest rice mill in the southern hemisphere in Deniliquin.|$|E
500|$|In another miracle {{described}} by Priyadas, the emperor of Delhi, Akbar summoned Tulsidas on hearing of his bringing back {{a dead man}} to life. Tulsidas declined to go as he was too engrossed in creating his verses but he was later forcibly brought before the Akbar and was asked to perform a miracle, which Tulsidas declined by saying [...] "It's a lie, all I know is Rama." [...] The emperor imprisoned Tulsidas at Fatehpur Sikri, [...] "We <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> Rama." [...] Tulsidas refused to bow to Akbar and created a verse in praise of Hanuman and chanted it (Hanuman Chalisa) for forty days and suddenly an army of monkeys descended upon the town and wreaked havoc in all corners of Fatehpur Sikri, entering each home and the emperor's harem, scratching people and throwing bricks from ramparts. An old Hafiz told the emperor {{that this was the}} miracle of the imprisoned Fakir. The emperor fell at Tulsidas' feet, released him and apologised. Tulsidas stopped the menace of monkeys and asked the emperor to abandon the place. The emperor agreed and moved back to Delhi. Ever since Akbar became a close friend of Tulsidas and he also ordered a firman that followers of lord Rama, lord Hanuman & other Hindus, should not be harassed in his kingdom.|$|E

500|$|Will & Grace producer, Tim Kaiser, in an {{interview}} with The New York Times, said that the doll's appearance was not any kind of [...] "forced" [...] product placement, as some speculated, explaining, [...] "It was just a natural fit, because Jack's affection for Cher is a thread that is running through the show already." [...] Kaiser continued saying that NBC [...] "saw the strength" [...] of the episode's storyline and understood that [...] "if a Cher doll is in the show that much, it's {{an integral part of the}} episode." [...] Kaiser said that [...] "Gypsies, Tramps and Weed" [...] writer Katie Palmer [...] "originally didn't know" [...] Mattel planned to market a Cher doll and learned about it after working on the script. Curt King, a spokesman for NBC, further commented that the doll's role in the episode was due to the producers thinking of [...] "a lot of humor [...] would come out of it." [...] Mark Malinowski, senior vice president and director at Ketchum Entertainment Marketing, revealed that Mattel was launching the Cher doll and in a [...] "brainstorming meeting" [...] they mentioned Will & Grace as the Jack character in love with Cher. [...] "We thought it would be great to try to include the doll in a plot line of an episode because it would be organic, playing off something that already exists. I don't think any viewer <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> and think 'product placement.' [...] It's strategic for the product and relevant for the audience, particularly the gay men who watch the show because the characters of Jack and Will are gay." [...] It was also noted that Mattel did not pay a fee to the show's producers or NBC to have the Cher doll appear in the episode.|$|E
2500|$|In Gutenberg's time, inks used by scribes {{to produce}} manuscripts were water-based. Gutenberg {{developed}} an oil-based ink that would better adhere to his metal type. His ink was primarily carbon, but {{also had a}} high metallic content, with copper, lead, and titanium predominating. Head of collections at the British Library, Dr Kristian Jensen, described it thus: [...] "if you look (at the pages of The Gutenberg Bible) closely you <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> is a very shiny surface. When you write you use a water based ink, [...] you put your pen into it and it runs off. [...] Now [...] if you print that's exactly what you don't want. One of Gutenberg's inventions was an ink which wasn't ink, it's a varnish. So what we call printer's ink is actually a varnish, and that means it sticks to its surface." ...|$|E
2500|$|Deadline.com's Dominic Patten called Luke Cage [...] "one of {{the most}} {{socially}} relevant and smartest shows {{on the small screen}} you <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> year... Linking to the Greater Marvel Universe with finesse, hip-hop’s alternating swagger and reserve, the zeitgeist, and the iconic legacy of Harlem, the series reaches both back and forward into the culture of heroes and an America looking for a true game-changer." [...] David Milner for Digital Spy also gave positive thoughts on the season, saying [...] "When it's not fulfilling its duties as a Marvel-licensed product, Luke Cage is basically a précis of the last 100 years of African-American history – especially in relation to Harlem itself." [...] Conversely, Milner felt Ali's Cottonmouth was not [...] "as imposing a figure as Daredevils Wilson Fisk and isn't nearly as darkly charismatic as David Tennant's Kilgrave from Jessica Jones." [...] Maureen Ryan of Variety felt Luke Cage [...] "has a more than adequate supply of pleasures", with the cast strong enough to [...] "power" [...] the season [...] "through its rough spots, which include a somewhat clunky pilot and a notable tendency to sprawl". She also felt that [...] "Where the drama tends to stumble is in meandering expositional scenes, which quite often go on too long and drain the show of momentum... when [...] can’t make a long dialogue scene work, the problem is in the writing, not the performances." [...] Merrill Barr, writing for Forbes, called the season [...] "another winner for Marvel and Netflix that shouldn’t be missed," [...] saying, [...] "Arcs are beautifully handled, often taking zigs when a zag is not only expected but often encouraged. Fans of the characters are going to rejoice at the level of quality they are getting with this one after waiting so long for Cage to be realized in live action, and fans of Marvel in general should really enjoy the 70s stylings that shake things up real well." ...|$|E
