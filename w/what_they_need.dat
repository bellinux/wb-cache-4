25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, one scientist, Sean Senechal, has been developing, studying, {{and using the}} learned visible, {{expressive}} language in dogs and horses. By teaching these animals a gestural (human made) American Sign Language-like language, the animals {{have been found to}} use the new signs on their own to get <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need.</b> The recent experiments on animal language are perhaps the most sophisticated attempt yet to establish human/animal communication, though their relation to natural animal communication is uncertain.|$|E

25|$|Customer horizon {{indicates}} the market orientation {{of a company}} {{in the case of}} netchains. In a chain and network environment it reflects the ability of companies to identify downstream customers and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need.</b> The phrase and two measurements of customer horizons, breadth and length, were introduced by Storer, Holman and Pedersen in 2010. The importance of market orientation becomes more complicated in a netchain environment, because it is harder to identify the customers of a specific unit. Therefore, it is even more important for companies to allocate resources for this purpose in netchains.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus on}} {{outcomes}} creates a clear expectation of {{what needs to}} be accomplished {{by the end of the}} course. Students will understand what is expected of them and teachers will know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to teach during the course. Clarity is important over years of schooling and when team teaching is involved. Each team member, or year in school, will have a clear understanding of {{what needs to be}} accomplished in each class, or at each level, allowing students to progress. Those designing and planning the curriculum are expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided upon; they must determine what knowledge and skills will be required to reach the outcome.|$|E
25|$|Simplicity to Friends has {{generally}} been a reference to material possessions. Friends have often limited their possessions to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to live their lives, rather than accumulating luxuries. The testimony {{is not just about}} the nature of one's material possessions, but rather also about one's attitude towards these material goods. Many Friends who have been considered exemplary have also been wealthy; their commitment to the testimony, however, led them to use their wealth for spiritual purposes, including aid to the poor and oppressed. On the other hand, some Friends, such as John Woolman, gave up much of their wealth and economic position when they felt it to be a spiritual burden.|$|E

25|$|As {{human beings}} (Dasein) {{navigate}} their world around them, {{they look for}} tools and ways to accomplish <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to do: food and water for survival, instruments to complete tasks, shelter for protection etc. Heidegger theorized that Dasein’s “quest” to exist, so to speak, can only be completed via his relationship with others and his world around him. This is what Slife termed radical relationality: human beings are fundamentally and inescapably relational beings. That human beings exist in-the-world as radically relational beings ultimately means that Dasein must seek out his existence through opportunities that present themselves in his world and through his relationships with others. In other words, what ontological hermeneutics is saying about what nature is that human beings cannot {{be thought of as}} merely “self-certain actants” capable of distancing themselves above and against their world effortly to determine rational courses of action, nor as little more than computers that have been programmed to react to stimuli. Instead, all understanding of how to exist comes from being-in-the-world and understanding one’s relation to, or place in, that world. Put another way, human beings conduct themselves within the context of their life-world (the world in which their lives take place) which provides Dasein with possibilities of how to act. It is this understanding of himself in that life-world that informs his choice.|$|E

Egoyan {{assembled}} many Canadian actors he had worked with in prior films, including Bruce Greenwood, Gabrielle Rose and Sarah Polley. Egoyan explained the benefit of working with a familiar cast, saying [...] "When you’re working on a limited production schedule, it’s a comfort {{to know that you}} know the personalities involved, you know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> as opposed to having to discover that and be surprised by that." ...|$|E

Williams complimented the group's cover of [...] "Show You the Way to Go" [...] as a [...] "nice effort" [...] but called [...] "House Keeper" [...] derivative. Ray Marcano of the Dayton Daily News wrote that the album's ballads - especially [...] "That's Alright" [...] and [...] "When You Need Someone" [...] - have [...] "terrific melodies and wonderful hooks that will easily keep listeners' attention". Marcano was, however, critical of the group's indistinct harmonies and said their vocals need to be [...] "a bit sharper".|$|E

500|$|.....We felt {{because it}} was 20 years earlier, these are much younger Spartans. They aren't quite as {{experienced}} as Master Chief, and we looked a lot at combat infantry going into actual wars, and typically {{at the beginning of}} a war, especially the Vietnam War, if you look at the infantry, they're all loaded up. They have all the backpacks on, they have all the belts on, every single bit of armor is there, and they're carrying around lots of armor. At the end of the war, they've lost it all and just carry <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need.</b> This is all they have. So if you look at our Spartans, they have more pieces of armor on going into the war. They have more markings on there, more pieces of armor. They've still got the belts on, they're still carrying around everything.|$|E

She elaborated on its theme during a radio interview, stating: [...] "The song is about that breaking point that every woman gets to when the excuses given by boys are no longer accepted.

500|$|Before the character's debut, de Matteo {{described}} Angie as [...] "brassy" [...] and a [...] "liberal New Yorker," [...] {{which she}} said contrasts with the more conservative nature of the other characters.

[...] However, de Matteo also noted that Angie is [...] "not just the brassy smart-talker" [...] and has a vulnerable side, which would be explored in the show. Cherry boosted Angie as [...] "a loving but tough Italian woman... who will do what she has to protect her family." [...] He also described her as [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "shielded," [...] which leaves her largely detached from the other women on the series. Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly described the character as [...] "icy." [...] Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky wrote that Angie was [...] "very real and very gritty," [...] noting that the character was capable [...] "of doing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to survive, no matter what the price."

500|$|William Luis {{argues that}} How the García Girls Lost Their Accents [...] "is {{an attempt to}} {{understand}} memory, the past and a time before the sisters lost their innocence and accents". Memory {{plays a significant role}} in the text, as a means by which the girls can return to the past of their childhood in the attempt to make sense of their present-day realities. The youngest child, Sofía carries with her only a single memory of her brief childhood on the island, in which the García's Haitian maid, Chucha, says a voodoo goodbye to the girls before they leave for the United States. Sofía feels segregated and deprived [...] "because she has only this one memory to help her reconstruct her bicultural, bilingual self. Though this lack of memory makes her the least divided of her sisters in many ways... the most disturbed, the most rebellious against her circumstances." [...] Ironically enough, Chucha’s voodoo prediction itself is largely concerned with the concept of memory, as she insists that after leaving the island the girls [...] "will be haunted by what they do and don't remember. But they have spirit in them. They will invent <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to survive". Julie Barak confirms this notion of memory as both a positive and negative force in the García girls’ constant struggle to unearth their true identities.|$|E
