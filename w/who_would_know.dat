5|$|The Mahabharata corroborates the Ramayana account. Vishvavasu tells Rama to {{seek the}} help of Sugriva, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> where Ravana stays. Kabandha also assured Rama that he would {{definitely}} meet Sita again. In the Mahavira-charita, the divine person that leaves the funeral pyre informs Rama that he is Danu and a curse had turned him in a demon, who was manipulated by Malyavan – Ravana's chief adviser – to create havoc in the region. He expresses his gratitude to Rama and cautions him that Malyavan has also set Vali against him.|$|E
25|$|On 29 March 2004 Rau {{arrived at}} the Hann River Roadhouse in North Queensland. She was hitchhiking and {{travelling}} alone. Since it was the wet season, {{and she did not}} have a consistent plan for travel, the locals were concerned for her safety. On 30 March, locals took her from the Roadhouse to the nearby town of Coen, on the Cape York Peninsula. She was taken to the Exchange Hotel in Coen, where locals called the Queensland Police. There Rau gave several versions of her story, identifying herself as Anna Brotmeyer and Anna Schmidt, and spoke both English and German. She said that she was a tourist from Munich, Germany, and that she was planning to continue north as far as Weipa. However, she could not provide any documentation and said there was no-one else in Australia <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> she was missing.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Ragtime was his first film in 20 years, Cagney was {{immediately}} at ease: Flubbed lines and miscues were committed by his co-stars, often simply through sheer awe. Howard Rollins, who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance, said, [...] "I was frightened to meet Mr. Cagney. I asked him how to die {{in front of the}} camera. He said 'Just die!' It worked. <b>Who</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> more about dying than him?" [...] Cagney also repeated the advice he had given to Pamela Tiffin, Joan Leslie, and Lemmon. As filming progressed, Cagney's sciatica worsened, but he finished the nine-week filming, and reportedly stayed on the set after completing his scenes to help the other actors with their dialogue.|$|E
