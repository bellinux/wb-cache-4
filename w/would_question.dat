5|$|Akane {{was created}} to be a {{relatable}} character who <b>would</b> <b>question</b> the setting and answer the viewer's questions. Early in the show's development, the production staff planned the way Akane would mature throughout the story. Early critical reception to Akane has been mixed. Some critics saw her as typical new cop often seen in dramas; others criticized her as uninteresting. However, her growth in the story earned praise for becoming a highly appealing protagonist.|$|E
5|$|Akane Tsunemori {{was created}} by the Production I.G staff to be the most {{relatable}} character in the series. She <b>would</b> <b>question</b> the setting from the audience's point of view and have it explained to them. She was written as the heroine, who would come between the main character, Shinya Kogami, and his main rival, Shogo Makishima, and see their conflict from her own viewpoint. One of the staff's main objectives was Akane's growth. Akane appears {{at the start of the}} first season as an innocent rookie who matures through her experiences. This was affirmed by Japanese female actor Kana Hanazawa, who voices Akane in Japanese. Hanazawa said one of the focal points of the series after the third episode was the changes Akane would undergo; she would be influenced by many unfamiliar, traumatic experience she must endure as part of her policing role.|$|E
5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans <b>would</b> <b>question</b> its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E

In close decisions Tony Barber would ask 'Professor Sam' to adjudicate.|$|R
5|$|The Watcher and {{his companions}} pursue Thaos {{to the city of}} Twin Elms, where they finally learn the truth behind Thaos' actions. The gods are {{synthetic}} beings created by ancient animancers to serve as a civilizing force for the world, which doesn't have any real gods. Thaos is the last survivor of their order, and has survived the centuries by transferring his soul from one body to the next. His eternal mission is to ensure that no one discovers the gods' secret, because then mortals <b>would</b> <b>question</b> their divine authority, and the world could then regress into sectarianism and barbarism. To this end, he works to discredit and suppress animancy wherever it flourishes, because modern animancers may eventually discover the truth through their science. He stole the souls of the Hollowborn to empower the goddess Woedica, who hates animancy and would see it destroyed. Though the other gods have an interest in protecting their secret, they do not want Woedica to dominate them, and so they help the Watcher reach Thaos.|$|E

25|$|Following U.S. Congressional hearings, the Condon Committee was {{established}} in 1966, ostensibly as a neutral scientific research body. However, the Committee became mired in controversy, with some members charging director Edward U. Condon with bias, and critics <b>would</b> <b>question</b> the validity and the scientific rigor of the Condon Report.|$|E

5000|$|Generally the bachelorette <b>would</b> ask <b>{{question}}s</b> {{written in}} advance on cards {{to each of}} the three hidden bachelors. The same question could be asked to multiple bachelors. This continued until time ran out. The bachelorette would make her choice based solely on the answers to her questions. Occasionally, the contestant was a bachelor who <b>would</b> ask <b>questions</b> to three bachelorettes. Certain kinds of questions were [...] "off-limits", such as name, age, occupation, and income.|$|R
25|$|There is a {{story that}} Constance, being 40 after a {{marriage}} of 9 years, knew that many <b>would</b> <b>question</b> whether the child was really hers. Thus she had the baby in a pavilion tent in the market square of the town, and invited the town matrons to witness the birth. A few days later she returned to the town square and publicly breast-fed the infant. Later she was crowned as queen of Sicily.|$|E
25|$|Vocal resonation is {{the process}} by which the basic product of {{phonation}} is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes {{on its way to the}} outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities <b>would</b> <b>question</b> most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.|$|E
25|$|A long-running {{conflict}} {{between the government and}} military of the Republic of the Fiji Islands (Fiji) reached crisis point in early December 2006. The catalysts for the unrest were three bills under consideration by the Fijian parliament, one of which <b>would</b> <b>question</b> the illegality of the Fiji coup of 2000 and offer pardons to some of the rebels who participated in it. Nine demands were handed down from Commodore Josaia Voreqe (Frank) Bainimarama to Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase largely pertaining to issues concerning these bills. Bainimarama gave an ultimatum to Qarase to concede to these demands or to resign from his post by Friday 1 December. This was then deferred to Monday 4 December.|$|E

25|$|Vocal resonation is {{the process}} by which the basic product of {{phonation}} is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes {{on its way to the}} outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities <b>would</b> <b>question</b> most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound. There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the chest, the tracheal tree, the larynx itself, the pharynx, the oral cavity, the nasal cavity, and the sinuses.|$|E
25|$|Eighth Anniversary of Negro Freedom—New Year's Day, 1871: On this {{occasion}} the Boston papers related that “...seldom {{is there an}} occasion of more attraction or greater general interest. Every available space of sitting and standing room was crowded". She starts off her speech by giving a little background about her own life. Sojourner recounts how her mother told her to pray to God {{that she may have}} good masters and mistresses. She goes on to retell how her masters were not good to her, about how she was whipped for not understanding English, and how she <b>would</b> <b>question</b> God why he had not made her masters be good to her. Sojourner admits to the audience that she had once hated white people, but she says once she met her final master, Jesus, she was filled with love for everyone. Once enslaved folks were emancipated, she tells the crowd she knew her prayers had been answered.|$|E
25|$|While Assad did {{not rule}} alone, he {{increasingly}} had the last word; those with whom he worked eventually became lieutenants, rather than colleagues. None of the political elite <b>would</b> <b>question</b> a decision of his, {{and those who did}} were dismissed. General Naji Jamil is an example, being dismissed after he disagreed with Assad's handling of the Islamic uprising. The two highest decision-making bodies were the Regional Command and the National Command, both part of the Ba'ath Party. Joint sessions of these bodies resembled politburos in socialist states which espoused communism. Assad headed the National Command and the Regional Command as Secretary General and Regional Secretary, respectively. The Regional Command was the highest decision-making body in Syria, appointing the president and (through him) the cabinet. As presidential authority strengthened, the power of the Regional Command and its members evaporated. The Regional and National Commands were nominally responsible to the Regional Congress and the National Congress—with the National Congress the de jure superior body—but the Regional Congress had de facto authority. The National Congress, which included delegates from Ba'athist Regional Branches in other countries, has been compared to the Comintern. It functioned as a session of the Regional Congress focusing on Syria's foreign policy and party ideology. The Regional Congress had limited accountability until the 1985 Eighth Regional Congress, the last under Assad. In 1985, responsibility for leadership accountability was transferred from the Regional Congress to the weaker National Progressive Front.|$|E

These screenings were held in Bradford, Hull, Liverpool, Cheltenham Ladies College, Eton College, Bristol, Aberystwyth, Glastonbury Tor and Brick Lane, London.|$|R
25|$|Rushmore {{continued}} {{as a reporter}} for the Mexico Intelligencer. On January 12, 1931, Rushmore witnessed the lynching of Raymond Gunn in Maryville, Missouri. The African American suspect was seized from the local sheriff and doused with gasoline atop a roof and set aflame, while several thousands watched. The event made an indelible mark on the 17-year-old, who, even {{at the height of his}} anti-communist career, would maintain Gunn's complete innocence. The Communist Party USA in Kansas City organized an anti-lynch committee led by Abner Berry, a party organizer in Harlem during the 1940s. Rushmore was impressed by the bravery and anti-racist stance of the communists. Through the committee, Rushmore met Jack Conroy, editor of The Anvil, a communist literary magazine. Conroy encouraged Rushmore's literary ambitions by suggesting he submit short stories. By April 1935 Rushmore had become an associate editor of the magazine. Later that year, Rushmore joined the Young Communist League USA in St Louis, despite having neither a technical knowledge of Marxist philosophy nor its history. This lifelong ignorance would hamper his authority as a professional communist and anti-communist as critics <b>would</b> <b>question</b> his qualifications on the subject. He organized farmers in the Dakotas and Iowa, then Conroy sent him to New York City in May 1935, where he attended the American Writers Congress. There he was asked to join the editorial staff of the Young Worker, the organ of the Young Communist League. Taking advantage of his perceived all-American background, the CPUSA rapidly promoted Rushmore. All staff members of the Young Worker were assigned to a political unit of the Young Communist League. Rushmore belonged to the Harlem unit, where he met Ruby Bates, a recent recruit to the League. Bates was one of the two plaintiffs of the Scottsboro Boys case, who later tried to recant her original testimony during the Patterson trial.|$|E
500|$|... "Funky Crime" [...] was {{reflective}} {{of a conversation}} between the band and George Clinton while writing and recording Freaky Styley. Kiedis described the song as a lyrical description of the conversation, about how music itself is [...] "color-blind" [...] but is [...] "segregated {{by the media and}} radio based on their perceptions of the artists." [...] Kiedis wrote [...] "Me and My Friends", a song which [...] "came together nicely", while driving home from San Francisco with his childhood friend Joe Walters. [...] "Backwoods" [...] details the history of rock and roll. [...] Kiedis said that [...] "Love Trilogy" [...] became one of the group's all-time favorite songs; it is about [...] "loving the things that aren't necessarily perfect or always lovable". He explained that [...] "For years, whenever someone <b>would</b> <b>question</b> our lyrics, Flea would say, 'Read 'Love Trilogy' and you'll know what real lyrics are all about.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Contrasting her middle-class values against Burke's aristocratic ones, Wollstonecraft {{contends that}} people should be judged on their merits rather than on their birthrights. As Wollstonecraft scholar Janet Todd writes, [...] "the vision of society {{revealed}} [...] A Vindication of the Rights of Men was one of talents, where entrepreneurial, unprivileged children could compete on equal terms with the now wrongly privileged." [...] Wollstonecraft emphasizes the benefits of hard work, self-discipline, frugality, and morality, values she contrasts with the [...] "vices of the rich", such as [...] "insincerity" [...] and the [...] "want of natural affections". She endorses a commercial society that would help individuals discover their own potential as well as force them to realize their civic responsibilities. For her, commercialism would be the great equalizing force. However, several years later, in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), she <b>would</b> <b>question</b> the ultimate benefits of commercialism to society.|$|E

500|$|Bart King was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his contemporaries as an affable person. Ralph Barker called him the Bob Hope of cricket thanks to his quips and stories. King was also noted for making jabs at opponents, but leaving them laughing at themselves. The same held true when he <b>would</b> <b>question</b> umpires that turned down his appeals. He {{is said to have}} spoken for ninety minutes at a dinner during his last tour to England, punctuated every few seconds with laughs. The dinner guests were kept laughing even while King spoke with a dead-pan expression. One man who attended the dinner noted that King [...] "told his impossible tales with such an air of conviction ... that his audiences were always in doubt when to take him seriously. He made their task doubly difficult by sprinkling in a fair mixture of truth with his fiction." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{hearing the}} {{comments}} from Atsuko Ishizuka, director of [...] The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, {{about the way}} the characters were designed first, Shiotani realized it was the opposite for his team, who had to create the setting first and then the characters because they [...] "are almost being played by the world". As a result, the characters were designed by manga artist Akira Amano to balance them with the dark atmosphere by having them [...] "palatable and very relate-able". The staff avoided using bright colors that would stand out. Akane Tsunemori was created as the most relatable character, who <b>would</b> <b>question</b> the setting from the audience's point of view and as the heroine who would come between the main character, Shinya Kogami, and his main rival, and enemy, Shogo Makishima. Akane's progression from an innocent newcomer to a mature and haunted person was one of the staff's main objectives.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{restraint}} {{has generally}} been regarded by U.S. courts, particularly the U.S. Supreme Court, as being [...] "the most serious and least tolerable" [...] of restrictions on the First Amendment. The Blackstone Commentaries defined {{freedom of the press}} as [...] "laying no previous restraints upon publication, and not in freedom from censure for criminal matter when published." [...] The Supreme Court had however never held that prior restraint was unconstitutional. On the contrary, in Near v. Minnesota 283 U.S. 697 (1931), Chief Justice Charles E. Hughes remarked that in wartime, [...] "no one <b>would</b> <b>question</b> but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting service or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops." [...] He further suggested that obscenity or incitement to insurrection would be similar grounds for prior restraint. The court subsequently upheld free speech exceptions such as restrictions on demonstrations in Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569 (1941), and censorship of motion pictures in Times Film Corp. v. City of Chicago, 365 U.S. 43 (1961).|$|E
