5|$|The UK Singles Downloads Chart is {{a weekly}} music chart that ranks the most-downloaded singles in the United Kingdom.

The KCMG car had earlier caused the session to be red flagged when the car {{came to a stop}} at the first Mulsanne Straight chicane. The Murphy Prototypes Oreca-Nissan later caused a second stoppage when Mark Patterson spun in the Porsche Curves entry and heavily impacted the safety barrier. Patterson was unhurt. The LMGTE Pro category was again led by Aston Martin, Richie Stanaway's No. 99 car setting a three minutes and 55.895 seconds lap, followed by the No. 64 Corvette and the No. 97 Aston Martin.

25|$|How the Ben Seyr met {{her fate}} {{is a matter}} of conjecture. Having been seen at Rosslare, it may be presumed that having sailed for Cardiff on <b>Wednesday</b> <b>afternoon</b> she soon {{encountered}} heavy seas. Her cargo of loose oats may of ran forward in the hold, the weight putting her nose under the water, in which case she could have sunk in a matter of minutes. Conversely, she may have attempted to turn back and run for the shelter of the Irish Coast during the course of which she was swamped by the heavy seas - again her sinking would have followed quickly.|$|E
25|$|The Bride and the Butterfly Hunter (1974) is a quirky, surrealistic {{film version}} of a play by Nisim Aloni about a bride who flees her wedding and a clerk who flees his humdrum {{existence}} by escaping to the park every <b>Wednesday</b> <b>afternoon</b> to hunt—and release—butterflies. The encounter between the two {{takes place in a}} park, where political propaganda is broadcast over a loudspeaker system. Though this is not integral to the story, it indicates that even in the most whimsical encounters it is impossible to escape the overbearing presence of political forces exploiting the conflicts in Israel for their own advantage. This film was selected to represent Israel at the Prix Italia.|$|E

25|$|He was {{recognized}} as an inspiring speaker. In August 1924, he {{was transferred to the}} Saint Bonaventure convent in Detroit, where he worked until 1945. During this time, he mostly served as the simple porter (or receptionist and doorkeeper). Each <b>Wednesday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> he conducted well-attended services for the sick, and through these services, he became known for his great compassion and the amazing results of his consultations with visitors. People considered him instrumental in cures and other blessings. He loved to kneel before the Eucharist in the quiet of the night; Father Benedict Groeschel once recalled visiting the convent on a warm night and being unable to sleep. Around 3:00am, Groeschel took a walk and arrived at the chapel where he put on two lights and saw Casey kneeling on the top step of the altar. Groeschel observed him for several moments and noted that Casey didn't move – Groeschel simply flicked the lights off to leave Casey to his prayer.|$|E

500|$|Morgan and his {{associates}} examined the books of the Knickerbocker Trust, and decided it was insolvent so did not intervene to stop the run.

On the afternoon of Tuesday, October 22, the president of the Trust Company of America asked Morgan for assistance. That evening Morgan conferred with George F. Baker, the president of First National Bank, James Stillman of the National City Bank of New York (the ancestor of Citibank), and the United States Secretary of the Treasury, George B. Cortelyou. Cortelyou said that he was ready to deposit government money in the banks to help shore up their deposits.

500|$|Her Jewish {{upbringing}} {{was influenced}} by her devoutly Orthodox Jewish maternal grandmother. Barr's parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Barr has stated, [...] "Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning I was a Jew; Sunday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon, and <b>Wednesday</b> <b>afternoon</b> we were Mormons". [...] When Barr was three years old, she got Bell's palsy {{on the left side}} of her face. Barr said, [...] " [...] my mother called in a rabbi to pray for me, but nothing happened. Then my mother got a Mormon preacher, he prayed, and I was miraculously cured". Years later Barr learned that Bell's palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon preacher came [...] "exactly at the right time". [...] At six years old, Barr discovered her first public stage by lecturing at LDS churches around Utah and even was elected president of a Mormon youth group.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} the {{secondary}} school in 1920, Wigner enrolled at the Budapest University of Technical Sciences, known as the Műegyetem. He was {{not happy with the}} courses on offer, [...] and in 1921 enrolled at the Technische Hochschule Berlin (now Technical University of Berlin), where he studied chemical engineering. [...] He also attended the <b>Wednesday</b> <b>afternoon</b> colloquia of the German Physical Society. These colloquia featured such luminaries as Max Planck, Max von Laue, Rudolf Ladenburg, Werner Heisenberg, Walther Nernst, Wolfgang Pauli, and Albert Einstein. Wigner also met the physicist Leó Szilárd, who at once became Wigner's closest friend. A third experience in Berlin was formative. Wigner worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry (now the Fritz Haber Institute), and there he met Michael Polanyi, who became, after László Rátz, Wigner's greatest teacher. Polanyi supervised Wigner's DSc thesis, Bildung und Zerfall von Molekülen ("Formation and Decay of Molecules").|$|E
500|$|Bede {{died on the}} Feast of the Ascension, Thursday, 26 May 735, on {{the floor}} of his cell, singing [...] "Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit" [...] and was buried at Jarrow. Cuthbert, a disciple of Bede's, wrote a letter to a Cuthwin (of whom nothing else is known), {{describing}} Bede's last days and his death. According to Cuthbert, Bede fell ill, [...] "with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain", before Easter. On the Tuesday, two days before Bede died, his breathing became worse and his feet swelled. He continued to dictate to a scribe, however, and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day. At three o'clock, according to Cuthbert, he asked for a box of his to be brought, and distributed among the priests of the monastery [...] "a few treasures" [...] of his: [...] "some pepper, and napkins, and some incense". That night he dictated a final sentence to the scribe, a boy named Wilberht, and died soon afterwards. The account of Cuthbert does not make entirely clear whether Bede died before midnight or after. However, by the reckoning of Bede's time, passage from the old day to the new occurred at sunset, not midnight, and Cuthbert is clear that he died after sunset. Thus, while his box was brought at three o'clock <b>Wednesday</b> <b>afternoon</b> the 25th, {{by the time of the}} final dictation it might be considered already Thursday in that ecclesiastical sense, although the 25th in the ordinary sense.|$|E
