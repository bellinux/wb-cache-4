40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the assessment of the typology and the trophic relevant water quality parameters in two Mediterranean lakes (Lake Ziros and Lake Kastoria) under the view of the <b>WFD.</b> <b>Lake</b> types were identified based on characteristics specified in Annex II of the WFD, while trophic indexes (OECD, TSI Carlson) were used in order to assess their trophic status. A modified TSI index appropriate for warmer lakes was also applied. According to our results, Lake Kastoria is classified as eutrophic lake with a tendency to hypertrophication while Lake Ziros is a mesotrophic ecosystem with clear signals of eutrophication. Both ecosystems are considered "at risk" of not fulfilling the WFD environmental objectives due to the existence of certain anthropogenic pressures...|$|E
40|$|The European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) classifies {{ecological}} {{status of a}} waterbody by the determination of its natural reference state to provide a measure of perturbation by human impacts based on taxonomic composition and abundance of aquatic species. Ruse (2010; 2011) has provided methods of assessing anthropogenic perturbations to lake {{ecological status}}, in terms of nutrient enrichment and acidification, by analysing collections of floating pupal exuviae discarded by emerging adult Chironomidae. The previous nutrient assessment method was derived from chironomid and environmental data collected during 178 lake surveys of all WFD types found in Britain. Canonical Correspondence Analysis provided species optima in relation to phosphate and nitrogen concentrations. Species found {{in less than three}} surveys were excluded from analysis in case of spurious association with environmental values. Since Ruse (2010) an additional 72 lakes have been surveyed adding 31 more species for use in nutrient status assessment. These additional scoring species are reported here. The practical application of the Chironomid Pupal Exuvial Technique (CPET) to classify <b>WFD</b> <b>lake</b> nutrient status is demonstrated using CPET survey data from lakes in Poland...|$|E
