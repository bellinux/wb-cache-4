5|$|In October 1783, the Virginia Legislature {{authorized}} Scott {{to commission}} superintendents and surveyors {{to survey the}} lands given to soldiers for their service in the Revolutionary War.

Traveling with Peyton Short, one of Wilkinson's business partners, he came to Limestone (present-day Maysville, Kentucky) via the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers. Scott and Short then traveled overland to the Kentucky River to examine the land they would later claim.

5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E
