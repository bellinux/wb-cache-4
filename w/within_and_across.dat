5|$|Engelbart was Founder Emeritus of the Doug Engelbart Institute, {{which he}} founded in 1988 with his {{daughter}} Christina Engelbart, who is Executive Director. The Institute promotes Engelbart's philosophy for boosting Collective IQ—the concept of dramatically improving how we can solve important problems together—using a strategic bootstrapping approach for accelerating our progress toward that goal. In 2005, Engelbart received a National Science Foundation grant to fund the open source HyperScope project. The Hyperscope team built a browser component using Ajax and Dynamic HTML designed to replicate Augment's multiple viewing and jumping capabilities (linking <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>across</b> various documents).|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} with the major {{categories}} of metals, metalloids and nonmetals, there is some variation and overlapping of properties <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>across</b> each category of nonmetal. Among the polyatomic nonmetals, carbon, phosphorus and selenium—which border the metalloids—begin to show some metallic character. Sulfur (which borders the diatomic nonmetals), is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals but even here shows some discernible metal-like character (discussed below). Of the diatomic nonmetals, iodine is the most metallic. Its number of nearest neighbours is sometimes described as 1+2 hence it is almost a polyatomic nonmetal. Within the iodine molecule, significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom, and these interactions give rise, in bulk iodine, to a shiny appearance and semiconducting properties. Of the monatomic nonmetals, radon is the most metallic and begins to show some cationic behaviour, which is unusual for a nonmetal.|$|E

25|$|The {{economics}} {{of global warming}} concerns the economic aspects of global warming; this can inform policies that governments might consider in response. A number of factors make this a difficult problem from both economic and political perspectives: it is a long-term, intergenerational problem; benefits and costs are distributed unequally both <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>across</b> countries; and scientific and public opinions may diverge.|$|E

25|$|The 'dependent arisings' have {{a causal}} conditioning, and thus Pratityasamutpada is the Buddhist belief that {{causality}} {{is the basis}} of ontology, not a creator God nor the ontological Vedic concept called universal Self (Brahman) nor any other 'transcendent creative principle'. However, the Buddhist thought does not understand causality in terms of Newtonian mechanics, rather it understands it as conditioned arising. In Buddhism, dependent arising is referring to conditions created by a plurality of causes that necessarily co-originate a phenomenon <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>across</b> lifetimes, such as karma in one life creating conditions that lead to rebirth in one of the realms of existence for another lifetime.|$|E
25|$|WLP's {{mission is}} to advance {{communication}} and cooperation among and between {{the women of the}} world in order to protect human rights, facilitate sustainable development, and promote peace. WLP links those with access to resources, knowledge, and technologies to those without, and augments the voices and visions of the world's resource-poor majority. WLP believes that dialogue across boundaries of culture, class, gender, generation, and nation is essential for achieving socially equitable and environmentally sound development. To secure a healthy, safe, and democratic environment for all, WLP works to advance gender equity, involve men and boys in promoting gender parity, and facilitate the exchange of grassroots strategies <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>across</b> different cultures. By instituting a viable knowledge and learning framework, WLP's programs provide women and girls of the Global South with the technical knowledge and practical skills needed to participate in the global dialogue about rights, development, and peace.|$|E
25|$|Reconciliation {{methods can}} rely on a parsimonious or a {{probabilistic}} framework to infer the most likely scenario(s), where the relative cost/probability of D, T, L events can be fixed a priori or estimated from the data. The space of DTL reconciliations and their parsimony costs—which can be extremely vast for large multi-copy gene family trees—can be efficiently explored through dynamic programming algorithms. In some programs, the gene tree topology can be refined where it was uncertain to fit a better evolutionary scenario {{as well as the}} initial sequence alignment. More refined models account for the biased frequency of HGT between closely related lineages, reflecting the loss of efficiency of HR with phylogenetic distance, for ILS, or {{for the fact that the}} actual donor of most HGT belong to extinct or unsampled lineages. Further extensions of DTL models are being developed towards an integrated description of the genome evolution processes. In particular, some of them consider horizontal at multiple scalesmodelling independent evolution of gene fragments or recognising co-evolution of several genes (e.g., due to co-transfer) <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>across</b> genomes.|$|E

500|$|Knowledge of the {{breeding}} system of B.sphaerocarpa {{comes from a}} 2009 study of genetic structure <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>across</b> fragmented plant populations, which made {{a case study of}} B.sphaerocarpa var. caesia populations in the vicinity of Dongolocking, where the landscape has been severely fragmented by land clearing. Very little self-pollination was observed. Most mating was between plants in the same population, but inter-population mating accounted for 15–33% of seed, a [...] "very significant contribution... to overall reproductive dynamics". This figure was lowest in the smallest populations, which also exhibited lower rates of germination, smaller plants, and less genetic diversity than larger populations. One possible interpretation of this is that interpopulation mating confers a fitness advantage. There was also evidence of fine-scale genetic structure, with plants tending to be more closely related to nearby plants than to more distant plants. The authors suggest that gene flow was probably always limited in these populations, even before they were fragmented.|$|E
