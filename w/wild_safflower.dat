40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the drought tolerance of cultivated (Carthamus tinctorius L.) and <b>wild</b> <b>safflower</b> (C. oxyacanthus Bieb) populations at Research Farm of College of Agriculture, Isfahan University of Technology located at Lavark-Najafabad in 2008. A randomized complete block design with 3 replications was used in each of irrigation levels after 80, 130 and 180 mm evaporation from class A pan, respectively. Evaluation of genetic variation revealed a significant difference among cultivated and <b>wild</b> <b>safflower</b> genotypes for agro-morphological traits. For example <b>wild</b> <b>safflower</b> had significantly higher value {{for the number of}} heads per plant indicating that it can be used for improvement of cultivated species through intraspecies hybridization. Moisture stress also had a significant effect on all studied traits. Clear differences existed between the two species (cultivated and wild) for moisture stress tolerance with the wild species being more tolerant than the cultivated one. Increasing water stress level caused significant reduction in the seed yield of cultivated genotypes whereas the wild genotypes were not affected as much. Results indicated that <b>wild</b> <b>safflower</b> has a general stability under moisture stress which is useful source for improvement of drought tolerance in cultivated safflower...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) varieties, and sowing dates on weed {{interference}} were investigated in a 2 -year (2002 - 3, and 2003 - 4 growing season) field experiment in Agricultural Research Station of Kohdasht in Lorestan Province. The experimental design was a randomized complete block in factorial arrangement with 3 replications. The experiment had 3 factors: weed interference at 2 levels (weed free, and weed infested throughout the total growing season), planting date at 3 levels (autumn, winter, and spring) and Chickpea varieties at 3 levels (ILC 482, Hasham, and Greet). Weed density in autumn sowing plots {{was more than}} 3 and 7 times greater in autumn chickpea than in winter and spring sowing plots, respectively. Weed biomass in autumn sowing was 2. 5 {{times as much as}} winter or spring sowing. <b>Wild</b> <b>safflower</b> and volunteer barley were the most frequent among the weed species. Volunteer barley was mainly present in autumn and winter planting dates. <b>Wild</b> <b>safflower</b> was among the weed species that in addition to competition, caused much difficulty to chickpea harvesting. Based on the hyperbolic curve fitted to the data, Chickpea maximum biomass reduction due to weed competition was estimated to be 91. 8 %...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) is an oilseed grown globally. There is an {{interest}} in modifying safflower to cope with climate change and to adapt to new agronomic trends. While almost all cropped safflower are spring varieties, a number of <b>wild</b> <b>safflower</b> varieties are noted as ’winter hardy’. These display characteristics found in plants that respond to vernalisation (an extended period of non-freezing cold). Because flowering traits, including the vernalisation response, are linked to yield and adaptability to climate, this PhD project sought to understand the vernalisation response in safflower, {{as a component of}} flowering time. The vernalisation response in ’winter hardy’ and spring safflower was investigated. It was confirmed that winter safflower does respond to vernalisation conditions, similar to other plant species. The vernalisation response in winter safflower is saturated after approximately 2 weeks exposure to vernalisation conditions. It is inheritable, epigenetic and appears to be dependent on a single recessive allele, as shown by segregation ratios in a crossing population created from winter and spring parents. Two approaches were developed to characterise this vernalisation response. Firstly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on RNA extracted from winter and spring safflower before, during and after exposure to vernalisation conditions. Differential expression analyses on the resulting RNA-Seq datasets tentatively identified four genes as directing functional roles in the vernalisation response of safflower: APETALA 1 -LIKE (CtAP 1 -LIKE), MADS-BOX DOMAIN CONTAINING 1 (CtMADS 1), FLOWERING LOCUS T-LIKE (CtFT-LIKE) and VERNALISATION 1 -LIKE (CtVRN 1 -LIKE). This analysis also identified 33 additional gene products (annotated transcripts or transcripts of unknown function) as candidates for further experimental investigation. In addition to the transcriptomic data, genomic resources were developed to further characterise the molecular basis of the vernalisation response. A high quality de novo assembly was constructed using Illumina reads from spring safflower, covering approximately 80 % of the estimated 1, 400, 000, 000 base pair (1. 4 Gbp) spring safflower genome. Using this draft genome in combination with F 3 crossing families and a genetic marker approach, 27 genetic markers for vernalisation were identified. Furthermore, these markers were mapped to a recent genetic map of safflower (Bowers 2016), clustering in close proximity to one another on chromosome 8. A single differentially expressed transcript, identified in the transcriptomic analyses, was located on the same chromosome. However, the transcript of interest was mapped to a chromosome 8 position some distance away from the identified markers. These high quality transcriptomic and genomic resources were used to identify the molecular basis for vernalisation in safflower. The investigative approaches developed in this project can also be utilised to characterise the molecular mechanisms of other traits in safflower...|$|E
40|$|Vegetable oils high in {{oleic acid}} are {{considered}} to be advantageous because of their better nutritional value and potential industrial applications. The oleic acid content in the classic safflower oil is normally 10 - 15 % while a natural mutant (ol) accumulates elevated oleic acid up to 70 % in seed oil. As a part of our investigation into the molecular features of the high oleic (HO) trait in safflower we have profiled the microRNA (miRNA) populations in developing safflower seeds expressing the ol allele in comparison to the wild type high linoleic (HL) safflower using deep sequencing technology. The small RNA populations of the mid-maturity developing embryos of homozygous ol HO and <b>wild</b> type HL <b>safflower</b> had a very similar size distribution pattern, however, only ~ 16. 5 % of the unique small RNAs were overlapping in these two genotypes. From these two small RNA populations we have found 55 known miRNAs and identified two candidate novel miRNA families to be likely unique to the developing safflower seeds. Target genes with conserved as well as novel functions were predicted for the conserved miRNAs. We have also identified 13 miRNAs differentially expressed between the HO and HL safflower genotypes. The results may lay a foundation for unravelling the miRNA-mediated molecular processes that regulate oleic acid accumulation in the HO safflower mutant and developmental processes in safflower embryos in general...|$|R
40|$|In this study, Carthamus oxyacantha (the <b>wild</b> {{species of}} <b>safflower),</b> which grows {{naturally}} without any cost and care {{by the time}} it is harvested, and is resistant to dry climate and other hard environmental conditions, is analyzed and investigated as a proper feedstock in producing biodiesel for the first time. In order to prove its suitability, its seed and oil were experimented first. The results of the experiment showed that the yield of its seed was 833 - 939 (kg/ha) and the amount of its oil was 24 - 32 %. Other properties of its oil, such as its saponification value, iodine value, and the amount of its free fatty acid content were 183, 145, and 0. 18, respectively. Eventually, the methyl ester of its crude oil, which was produced through alkali transesterification reaction with methanol alcohol and NaOH as catalyst was experimented and its physicochemical properties were determined. All of the determined characteristics, namely, density (0. 8816 g/ml), kinematic viscosity (4. 13 mm 2 /s at 40 ºC), flash point (179 ºC), cloud point (- 3 ºC), pour point (- 9 ºC), sulfur content (0. 01 mass %), carbon residue (0. 005 mass %), vacuum distillation end point (352 ºC at 90 % volume recycle), gross calorific value 39. 255 (Mj/Kg) and calculated cetane index (48. 99) meet the two accepted biodiesel standards (i. e. ASTM D 6751 and EN 142140). Therefore, according to the results, Carthamus oxyacantha plant, which was not reporte...|$|R
40|$|Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), an Asteraceae member, yields {{high quality}} edible oil rich in {{unsaturated}} fatty acids and is resilient to dry conditions. The crop holds tremendous potential for improvement through concerted molecular breeding programs {{due to the}} availability of significant genetic and phenotypic diversity. Genomic resources that could facilitate such breeding programs remain largely underdeveloped in the crop. The present study was initiated to develop a large set of novel microsatellite markers for safflower using next generation sequencing. Low throughput genome sequencing of safflower was performed using Illumina paired end technology providing ~ 3. 5 X coverage of the genome. Analysis of sequencing data allowed identification of 23, 067 regions harboring perfect microsatellite loci. The safflower genome {{was found to be}} rich in dinucleotide repeats followed by tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotides. Primer pairs were designed for 5, 716 novel microsatellite sequences with repeat length ≥ 20 bases and optimal flanking regions. A subset of 325 microsatellite loci was tested for amplification, of which 294 loci produced robust amplification. The validated primers were used for assessment of 23 safflower accessions belonging to diverse agro-climatic zones of the world leading to identification of 93 polymorphic primers (31. 6 %). The numbers of observed alleles at each locus ranged from two to four and mean polymorphism information content was found to be 0. 3075. The polymorphic primers were tested for cross-species transferability on nine wild relatives of cultivated safflower. All primers except one showed amplification in at least two wild species while 25 primers amplified across all the nine species. The UPGMA dendrogram clustered C. tinctorius accessions and wild species separately into two major groups. The proposed progenitor species of safflower, C. oxyacantha and C. palaestinus were genetically closer to cultivated safflower and formed a distinct cluster. The cluster analysis also distinguished diploid and tetraploid <b>wild</b> species of <b>safflower.</b> Next generation sequencing of safflower genome generated a large set of microsatellite markers. The novel markers developed in this study will add to the existing repertoire of markers and can be used for diversity analysis, synteny studies, construction of linkage maps and marker-assisted selection...|$|R
