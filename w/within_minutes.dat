5|$|Rescue efforts began {{immediately}} after the crash. Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred within {{half an hour of}} the impact. Initially, rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees within the building. <b>Within</b> <b>minutes,</b> the first fire companies arrived and found these volunteers searching near the impact site. The firemen ordered them to leave as they were not properly equipped or trained to deal with the hazards. The Arlington County Fire Department (ACFD) assumed command of the immediate rescue operation within 10minutes of the crash. ACFD Assistant Chief James Schwartz implemented an incident command system (ICS) to coordinate response efforts among multiple agencies. It took about an hour for the ICS structure to become fully operational. Firefighters from Fort Myer and Reagan National Airport arrived <b>within</b> <b>minutes.</b> Rescue and firefighting efforts were impeded by rumors of additional incoming planes. Chief Schwartz ordered two evacuations during the day in response to these rumors.|$|E

5|$|Loss of cell {{viability}} in the jack jumper's venom was researched through cytometry, which measures {{the proportions of}} cells that glow {{in the presence of}} fluorescent dye and 7-Aminoactinomycin D. Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein–Barr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability <b>within</b> <b>minutes</b> when exposed to pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells were also found to alter easily when exposed to pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering {{cell viability}}; the residue 22 N-terminal plays a critical role in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people with}} TBI who die do so <b>within</b> <b>minutes</b> of the injury, due to {{complications}} such as pneumothorax and insufficient airway {{and to other}} injuries that occurred at the same time. Most late deaths that occur in TBI are attributed to sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). If the condition is not recognized and treated early, serious complications {{are more likely to}} occur; for example, pneumonia and bronchiectasis may occur as late complications. Years can pass before the condition is recognized. Some TBI are so small {{that they do not have}} significant clinical manifestations; they may never be noticed or diagnosed and may heal without intervention.|$|E
