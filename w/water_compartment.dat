50|$|The {{environment}} can be exposed directly {{due to the}} outdoor use of biocides or {{as the result of}} indoor use followed by release to the sewage system after e.g. wet cleaning of a room in which a biocide is used. Upon this release a biocidal substance can pass a sewage treatment plant (STP) and, based on its physical chemical properties, partition to sewage sludge, which in turn can be used for soil amendments thereby releasing the substance into the soil compartment. Alternatively, the substance can remain in the water phase in the STP and subsequently end up in the <b>water</b> <b>compartment</b> such as surface water etc. Risk assessment for the environment focuses on protecting the environmental compartments (air, water and soil) by performing hazard assessments on key species, which represent the food chain within the specific compartment. Of special concern is a well functioning STP, which is elemental in many removal processes. The large variety in biocidal applications leads to complicated exposure scenarios that need to reflect the intended use and possible degradation pathways, in order to perform an accurate risk assessment for the environment. Further areas of concern are endocrine disruption, PBT-properties, secondary poisoning, and mixture toxicity.|$|E

Changes in Total body water (TBW) that occur with variation {{of body weight}} (BW), indicating a relation between body water content and adipose tissue mass, because BW changes directly relate to changes in FM content in adults. The aim {{of the study was}} first to determine the relationship between TBW, extra- and intra cellular water (ECW and ICW) with some indexes of overall and central adiposity. Three hundred and forty eight young adult girls (18 - 24 yrs) volunteered to participate in this study. After fasting for at least 12 h, body water components (TBW, ECW, and ICW), indexes of overall obesity including body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (%BF) and fat mass (FM) and central obesity including waist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR) were measured by Body Composition Analyzer. There were significant positive correlations between WHR, FM and %BF with body <b>water</b> <b>compartments</b> including TBW (P< 0. 01), ECW (P< 0. 01) and ICW (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Background. We {{previously}} reported {{that differences in}} fat-free mass (FFM) estimated by isotope dilution of 18 O-labeled water could not fully account for lower resting metabolic rates (RMR) in old men and women compared to RMR in young men. Methods. Since age-related changes {{in the distribution of}} water between extracellular and intracellular spaces could lead to overestimation of FFM in the old, we reanalyzed our data using estimates for total body and intracellular water (TBW and ICW, respectively) derived from published equations and included data from adolescent boys and girls studied under similar conditions. Results. In both sexes, the age-related reduction in RMR remained significant after adjustment for estimated body <b>water</b> <b>compartments</b> (p <. 05). While adjusted RMR differed in boys and girls (p <. 0001), it did not in old men and women (p —. 15). Conclusion. We conclude that aging per se reduces RMR in lean tissue, a difference which cannot be fully explained by changes in body water or its distribution.

It has been shown that a large amount of the titanium dioxide nanoparticles may end up in the <b>water</b> <b>compartment.</b> These risk assessments constitute first estimates and several fate mechanisms are not taken into account. In this study, we propose a risk model that includes the two fate mechanisms sedimentation and aggregation. The sedimentation rate of titanium dioxide nanoparticles is determined using simple laws of motion. Still water is assumed, which gives optimal conditions for sedimentation. It is shown that despite the optimal conditions for sedimentation, the sedimentation rates of particles with a diameter of 100 nm and 1000 nm are about 8 years and 1 month, respectively. One month can be regarded as a long time from a risk perspective, and thus sedimentation is shown not to be an important factor for the removal of titanium dioxide nanoparticles from the <b>water</b> <b>compartment.</b> However, preliminary results show that aggregation can reduce the predicted environmental concentration significantly in a short time. Hence, equilibrium concentrations could be several orders of magnitude lower than what has been indicated in earlier studies. The aggregation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles is modeled using Smoluchowski kinetics and the DLVO theory, which are commonly used in colloid chemistry. The aggregation is shown to depend mainly on the pH of the <b>water</b> <b>compartment</b> and the zero point charge of the particles...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the relationship between impedance measurements and body <b>water</b> <b>compartments</b> in patients with advanced HN disease, and to investigate whether the newer approaches of multifrequency BIA, BIA spectroscopy, logarithmic transformation using a parallel circuit model, and direct calculation from electrical theory offer any advantage over traditional single-frequency BIA. We measured total body water (TBW) by deuterium dilution and extracellular water by bromide dilution in 33 patients with advanced HIV disease. Intracellular water and BCM were calculated from these results. Impedance was measured over a range of frequencies using a multifrequency analyzer. The relationship between impedance index at various frequencies and body <b>water</b> <b>compartments</b> was assessed by correlation and linear regression. We found that impedance index at higher frequencies had a closer relationship to TBW (r = 0. 86, standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 2. 96 at 1000 kHz) and at lower frequencies a closer relationship to extracellular water (ECW) (r = 0. 47, SEE = 3. 13 at 0 kHz) than the traditional 50 kHz measurement (r = 0. 84, SE = 3. 11 for TBW; r = 0. 44, SEE = 3. 19 for ECW), but the differences were marginal and not statistically significant.

40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{dynamics}} of pesticides in the different compartments of a river system, an intensive monitoring campaign was set up. An extensive dataset is useful when planning to model the fate of pesticides in river systems. In this study {{we focus on the}} Nil, a small, hilly basin situated in the central part of Belgium. Two automatic samplers were placed in the river basin, i. e., one at the mouth and one upstream, taking composite samples of water and suspended solids. Undisturbed sediment samples were taken by means of a macro-core and immediately frozen with CO 2 -ice. The samples were sliced and analysed for pesticides in pore water and on sediment. The results of the study revealed the dynamics of the different compartments of a river system. The <b>water</b> <b>compartment</b> showed hourly variations in pesticide peak concentrations, regularly exceeding the standards. The amount of pesticides transported by suspended solids increased after a rainfall event. The concentration of pesticides in pore water, measured on a monthly basis, followed the trends of the <b>water</b> <b>compartment</b> remarkably well, but in a significantly lower concentration. These observations may be explained by combined diffusion, biodegradation and chemical reactions occurring in the water column and the sediment.

40|$|Although the {{assessment}} of body <b>water</b> <b>compartments</b> is of great diagnostic value, appropriate methods are not readily available for routinely clinical application. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a safe, noninvasive, rapid and highly reproducible procedure that is strongly influenced by body water and intra-/extracellular distribution. Four-hundred-fifty-six adults (224 males and 232 females) were enrolled and divided in subgroups {{on the basis of}} the presence of obesity and diabetes (type 1 and type 2). The aim of the study was to investigate if different BIA measurements in terms of resistance (R), reactance (Xc) and phase angle (PA) were associated to these conditions. Plotting the average values of R and Xc normalized for height (h), a mean vector was obtained for each group. The vector displacement could be easily recognized on the basis of its length and of the angle described with the abscises axis (PA). When compared to the control groups, the vector resulted to be shorter in presence of obesity. The PA was slightly lower in the diabetic groups when compared to their body size matched non-diabetic groups. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was independently correlated to height normalized R (R/h) as in diabetic males (r= 0. 40; P< 0. 001) and in diabetic females (r= 0. 50; P< 0. 001). On the basis of BIA principles, these results are in agreement with the possibility that non diabetic obese patients have an increased body-water content but in average they maintain a distribution between intra- (ICW) and extra-cellular (ECW) <b>water</b> <b>compartments</b> similar to that of control subjects. Furthermore, diabetics have an increased ECW size and, as expected, with increasing FPG their body water content proportionally decreases. As a partial confirmation, the BIA vector of 9 diabetics with poor glycemic control was monitored during the course of rehydrating treatment. The BIA vector became progressively shorter but the PA remained unchanged. Therefore, the evolution of the BIA vector was in the sense of a progressive increase of total body water content, equally distributed between ICW and ECW compartments. In conclusion, BIA measurements could be considered as specific body characteristics that expressed in terms of BIA vector may be useful to diagnose and monitoring imbalances of body <b>water</b> <b>compartments...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{breathing}} cell is a {{new concept}} design that operates a reverse electrodialysis stack by varying in time the intermembrane distance. Reverse electrodialysis is used to harvest salinity gradient energy; a rather unknown renewable energy source from controlled mixing of river water and seawater. Traditionally, both river water and seawater compartments have a fixed intermembrane distance. Especially the river <b>water</b> <b>compartment</b> thickness contributes {{to a large extent}} to the resistance of the stack due to its low conductivity. In our cyclic approach, two stages define the principle of the breathing concept; the initial stage, where both compartments (seawater and river water) have the same thickness and the compressed stage, where river water compartments are compressed by expanding the seawater compartments. This movement at a tunable frequency allows reducing stack resistance by decreasing the thickness of the river <b>water</b> <b>compartment</b> without increasing permanently the pumping losses. The breathing stacks clearly benefit from the lower resistance values and low pumping power required, obtaining high net power densities over a much broader flow rate range. The high frequency breathing stack (15 cycles/min) shows a maximum net power density of 1. 3 W/m 2. Although the maximum gross and net power density ever registered (2. 9 W/m 2 and 1. 5 W/m 2, respectively) is achieved for a fixed 120 μm intermembrane distance stack (without movement of the membranes), it is only obtained at a very narrow flow rate range due to the high pressure drops at small intermembrane distance. The breathing cell concept offers a unique feature, namely physical movement of the membranes, and thus the ability to adapt to the operational conditions and water quality...|$|E

According to Mueller and Nowack (2008) it is also the nanoparticle that has the largest environmental concentration in the Swiss <b>water</b> <b>compartment,</b> 16 µg/l according to their high estimate. Further, Boxall et al. (2007) estimate a titanium dioxide nanoparticle environmental concentration of 24. 5 µg/l in the UK <b>water</b> <b>compartment</b> for a scenario that probably overestimates the current exposure levels. However, neither of these risk models take fate processes such as aggregation and sedimentation into account. Colloid chemistry deals with particles within the size range of 1 nm to 1 µm. Nanoparticles of a size between one nanometer and a few hundred nanometers are thus well within the colloid range. Theories of colloid chemistry suggest that sedimentation of nanoparticles depends mainly on the density and the viscosity of the water and the density and size of the particles. Sedimentation is shown not to be an important factor, since the sedimentation of particles smaller than ~ 300 nm is negligible. Aggregation is a more complex process which depends on factors such as temperature, salinity, ion valence, pH, point of zero charge, the Hamaker constant, particle size and particle concentration (Elimelech et al. 1995). These factors were estimated for a typical Swedish lake and calculations were performed in MATLAB. The aggregation is modeled by kinetics according to Smoluchowski (1917) but adjusted according to the DLVO theory (see Elimelech et al. 1995). Preliminary results show that aggregation can reduce the predicted environmental concentration significantly in a short time. It would take less than 4 minutes for the initial environmental concentrations predicted by both Mueller and Nowack (2008) and Boxall et al. (2007) to be reduced by 50 %.
