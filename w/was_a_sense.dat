5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E
5|$|His season's best {{came under}} unusual {{circumstances}} at the British Grand Prix – {{due to a}} system malfunction he was initially timed by hand at dead on ten seconds, which was amended to 9.96s after video evidence was consulted. He could not match that form at the World 100m final: Kim Collins, Darrel Brown, Darren Campbell, and Chambers all finished within a split second {{of each other and}} Chambers was adjudged to have finished fourth. Chambers squandered his anchoring lead in the 4×100m relay, allowing Joshua J. Johnson of the United States team to beat him to the finish line. In spite of his close fourth and a relay silver medal, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of disappointment in the press that Chambers' record breaking claims and gold medals had not materialised.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War the NUWSS spent its time in north Wales organising educational and propaganda campaigns. In south Wales friction was caused by a shift in political views pushed onto the country from the central office. 1912 saw the NUWSS switch its policy as a non-party organisation to set up the Election Fighting Fund (EFF) to support the newly burgeoning Labour Party. Wales had traditionally been a Liberal heartland and the South Wales Federation of Women’s Suffrage Societies was opposed to this new policy. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> that there was a disjoint between the central 'English feminist agenda' pushed by the militant headquarters and the needs of Welsh social, cultural and political views. The strains existed between the two organisation until the EFF was abandoned in 1914.|$|E

5|$|The 1920–21 {{campaign}} {{was the second}} season of competitive football in England after the First World War. Burnley's chairman, Harry Windle, had been elected to the position in 1909, and manager John Haworth was marking his 11th consecutive year in charge. After finishing as runners-up to West Bromwich Albion in the Football League First Division the previous season, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of eager anticipation within the club before the season began. Team captain Tommy Boyle claimed that his side was capable of building on its success of the previous season and winning the league championship, despite Burnley not having won a trophy since their FA Cup victory in 1914.|$|E
5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{of closure}} for Grove before the {{beginning}} of the 1945 season, as he was awarded $310 ($ today) in damages for the auto accident in 1941. He held out for a new contract in the off-season, and finally signed with the White Sox a couple weeks {{before the beginning}} of the season after becoming the last remaining holdout. Grove was the workhorse of the White Sox, leading the team in games pitched (33) and started (30), while remaining the youngest pitcher on the roster. He finished the season with 217 pitched innings, a career best four shutouts, a 14–12 record, and a 3.44 ERA.|$|E
5|$|The {{coal mining}} {{industry}} of the Rhondda was artificially buoyed {{throughout the war}} years, though there were expectations {{of a return to}} the pre-1939 industrial collapse {{after the end of the}} Second World War. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of salvation when the government announced the nationalisation of the British Coalmines in 1947; but the following decades saw a continual reduction in the output from the Rhondda mines. From 15,000 miners in 1947, Rhondda had just a single pit within the valleys producing coal in 1984, located at Maerdy. The decline in the mining of coal after World War II was a country wide issue, but South Wales and Rhondda were affected to a higher degree than other areas of Britain. Oil had superseded coal as the fuel of choice in many industries and there was political pressure influencing the supply of oil. Of the few industries that were still reliant on coal, the demand was for quality coals, especially coking coal which was required by the steel industry. Fifty percent of Glamorgan coal was now supplied to steelworks, with the second biggest market being domestic heating, which the 'smokeless' coal of the Rhondda became once again fashionable after the publication of the Clean Air Act. These two markets now controlled the fate of the mines in the Rhondda, and as demand fell from both sectors the knock-on effect on the mining industry was further contraction. In addition exports to other areas of Europe, traditionally France, Italy and the Low Countries, experienced a massive decline; from 33 per cent around the start of the 20th century to roughly 5 per cent by 1980.|$|E

25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{of irony}} to CBS' {{coverage}} of the assassination. On September 2, 1963, Kennedy gave an interview with Cronkite, helping CBS inaugurate network television's first half hour evening newscast.|$|E
25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> by the CFA, however, {{that work}} on the statue groups was {{proceeding}} so well that the commission might approve the work before the full-size models were complete. Consequently, the commission visited Fraser's Westport, Connecticut, studio on October 24, 1932, and approved his models.|$|E

25|$|Initially the {{population}} of these overseas territories were made to exploit resources (minerals, spices, wood or slaves), but later there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of evangelisation or lusotropolicalism, that facilitated the colonization of these lands. The first significant colony was Brazil whose history included a period as kingdom within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves (1815–1822), before a political schism would result in its independence in 1822.|$|E
25|$|Maeno's suicide flight {{inspired}} {{a variety of}} reactions in Japan. According to an Associated Press article, many Japanese felt some sympathy with Maeno's actions because of the shame associated with the Lockheed scandal. The scandal had shown an unsavory side of Japanese politics to the world, and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of frustration that the high-ranking politicians who had dealt with Kodama would never be revealed or brought to justice.|$|E
25|$|Extreme metal bands {{were rarely}} covered in {{mainstream}} media and rarely appeared on television. Part of what separated the British metal {{music of the}} 1990s <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of a humor and irony that was not as nearly widespread as the European and American metal groups of the era. Even among the more 'serious' British groups such as Carcass or Gorerotted have displayed a tongue-in-cheek attitude.|$|E

25|$|The {{proximate}} cause was the Dutch decision {{to build a}} road across a piece of Diponegoro's property that contained his parents' tomb. Amongst other causes <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of resentment felt {{by members of the}} Javanese aristocratic families at Dutch measures intended to restrict the renting out of land at high prices. Finally the succession of the throne in Yogyakarta was disputed: Diponegoro was the oldest son of Hamengkubuwono III, but as his mother was not the queen he was not considered {{to have the right to}} succeed his father. Diponegoro's rival to the throne, his younger half brother, Hamengkubuwono IV, and then his infant nephew Hamengkubuwono V, was supported by the Dutch.|$|E
25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of {{achievement}} when {{the agreement was}} finally signed and technicians employed by the CDF got down {{to the task of}} making the mechanism operational. In an interview, CDF Chief Executive Officer Ambassador Lorne McDonnough said “The CDF start-up team was always confident it would meet the projected launch date....” Despite this confidence he admitted that “...along the way there were always the glitches and frustrating delays that called for an extra dose of perseverance as well as the need to step back and revisit the problem with a fresh resolve”. Ambassador McDonnough noted that heightened expectations and the desire to see the CDF operational in the shortest possible time, meant that Member States sometimes underestimated the work which had to be done to make the CDF ready for full operations.|$|E
25|$|Llywelyn {{sought to}} avoid the pitfalls the Dinefwr example {{revealed}} and curried favor with his brother-in-law Henry III of England. Despite the occasional conflict between the Welsh prince and the English king, their personal relationship as brothers-in-law {{was not one of}} constant discord, and for the greater period between 1218 and 1240 there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of amenity between the two. Henry III fully endorsed Dafydd as Llywelyn's heir, and in 1226 Henry III had successfully petitioned the Papacy to free his sister Joan from any stigma of illegitimacy. In 1229, Dafydd traveled to London to do homage for the lands he would inherit, and Llywelyn arranged for the advantageous marriage between Dafydd and Isabella de Braose, daughter and co-heiress of Llywelyn's powerful ally the Marcher lord William de Breos.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the Liga Mayor, {{there was}} no {{national}} football league in Mexico, and football competitions were held within relatively small geographical regions. The winners of the Primera Fuerza, a local league consisting of teams near and around Mexico City, was considered the national competition. There were other regional leagues such as the Liga Amateur de Veracruz, the Liga Occidental De Jalisco and the Liga del Bajío that also had notable clubs. Many club owners were not keen {{on the idea of}} establishing a professional league, despite paying players under the table. With the increasing demand for football, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of urgency to unite all the local amateur leagues in Mexico to progress as a football nation. The professional national league was finally established in 1943.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{off their}} third NBA Championship in seven years, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> that the Spurs were {{the class of}} the NBA, and once again would be {{the team to beat}} in the NBA for the Championship. For the 2005–06 season, the Spurs {{acquired}} the two-time All-Star Michael Finley and one-time All Star Nick Van Exel. Not surprisingly, the Spurs would come flying out of the gate, winning 16 of their first 19 games. Once again, the Spurs would get challenged within their own division by the Dallas Mavericks as they held the two best records in the Western Conference all season, battling for first place. In the end, the experience of the Spurs would be the difference as they won the Southwest Division again with a new franchise best record of 63–19. The Spurs met the Mavericks {{in the second round of}} the playoffs, but it would be Dallas coming out on top 4–3, including a 119–111 overtime victory in Game 7.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in 1938, the PCP {{had been}} {{expelled}} from the Comintern. The reason for the expulsion <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of distrust in the Comintern caused by a sudden breakdown in the party's activity {{after a period of}} strong communist tumult in the country, accusations of alleged embezzlement of money carried out by some important members of the party and, mainly, the weak internal structure of the party, dominated by internal wars. The action against the PCP, signed by Georgi Dimitrov, was in part taken due to some persecution against Comintern member parties or persons (like the Communist Party of Poland or Béla Kun) led by Joseph Stalin. These series of events would, in part, lead {{to the end of the}} Comintern in 1943. The PCP would only reestablish its relations with the communist movement and the Soviet Union in 1947, after sporadic contacts made through the communist parties of Spain and France and later through Mikhail Suslov.|$|E
