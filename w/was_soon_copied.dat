5|$|Stanley {{produced}} a 'Panoptic Stereoscope' in 1855, which was financially successful. Stereoscopes had sold for five shillings each– Stanley discovered a simpler method to make them, which {{enable him to}} sell them for one shilling. He {{was able to take}} an additional shops at 3–4 Great Turnstile and 286 High Holborn, as well as a skilled assistant. He did not patent the Panoptic, so it <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> around the world, but he had sold enough to provide the capital required to manufacture scientific instruments. In 1861 he invented a straight line dividing machine for which he won first prize in the 1862 International Exhibition in London. Stanley brought out the first catalogue of his products in 1864. By the fifth edition, Stanley was able to list important customers such as several government departments, the Army, the Royal Navy, railways at home and abroad, and London University. From 1865, he worked on improving the elegance and stability of surveying instruments, especially the theodolite, whose construction he simplified. It had a rotating telescope for measuring horizontal and vertical angles and able to take sights on prominent objects at a distance. The component parts were reduced to fewer than half of the 226 used in the previous version, making it lighter, cheaper and more accurate.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} was introduced with the BMW 801 14-cylinder twin-row radial. Kurt Tank designed a new cooling system for this engine that used a high-speed fan to blow compressed air into channels that carry {{air to the}} middle of the banks, where a series of baffles directed the air over all of the cylinders. This allowed the cowling to be tightly fitted around the engine, reducing drag, while still providing (after a number of experiments and modifications) enough cooling air to the rear. This basic concept <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by many other manufacturers, and many late-WWII aircraft returned to the radial design as newer and much larger designs began to be introduced. Examples include the Bristol Centaurus in the Hawker Sea Fury, and the Shvetsov ASh-82 in the Lavochkin La-7.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} economic extraction from the colony, land was divided up under the so-called Domain System (régime domanial) in 1891. All vacant land, including forests and areas not under cultivation, was decreed to be [...] "uninhabited" [...] and thus the possession of the state, leaving many of the Congo's resources (especially rubber and ivory) under direct colonial ownership. Concessions were allocated to private companies. In the north, the Société Anversoise was given , while the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company (ABIR) was given a comparable territory in the south. The Compagnie du Katanga and Compagnie des Grands Lacs were given smaller concessions {{in the south and}} east respectively. Leopold kept a large proportion of territory under personal rule, known as the Crown Domain (Domaine de la Couronne), of [...] which was added to the territory he already controlled under the Private Domain (Domaine privé). [...] "The major economic exploitation of the Congolese interior, therefore, lay {{in the hands of the}} king and a few privileged concessionaries." [...] The system was extremely profitable and ABIR made a turnover of over 100 per cent on its initial stake in a single year. The King made 70 million Belgian francs' profit from the system between 1896 and 1905. The Free State's concession system <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by other colonial regimes, notably those in the neighbouring French Congo.|$|E
50|$|Baldwin's {{ideas on}} 4-4-2 tender {{locomotives}} <b>were</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> in the United Kingdom, initially by Henry Ivatt of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) with his GNR Class C1 Klondyke Atlantic of 1898. These were quickly followed by John Aspinall's Class 7, {{known as the}} High-Flyer, for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR).|$|R
2500|$|The Sino-Japanese War {{concluded}} with the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which elevated Japan to become another foreign power in Shanghai. Japan {{built the first}} factories in Shanghai, which <b>were</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by other foreign powers. Shanghai was then the most important financial center in the Far East. All this international activity gave Shanghai the nickname [...] "the Great Athens of China".|$|R
25|$|In the 1940 NFL Championship, Halas {{introduced}} his T-formation offense, with Sid Luckman at quarterback. This formation shocked and confused the Redskins all {{day as the}} Bears won 73–0, an NFL record that stands to this day. The T-formation <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> widely <b>copied</b> at the college and pro levels.|$|R
50|$|The {{power loom}} <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by many other New England area mills, and {{modified}} and perfected along the way. Francis Cabot Lowell died in 1817, at age 42.|$|E
5000|$|Renuzit {{was also}} the first to {{introduce}} an air freshener for the kitchen when they brought out [...] "Country Kitchen" [...] cinnamon fragrance in 1979. It proved to be highly popular and <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by competitors.|$|E
50|$|In June 1836, the French {{newspaper}} La Presse was {{the first}} to include paid advertising in its pages, allowing it to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its profitability and the formula <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by all titles.|$|E
2500|$|Under Chamberlain, some of Birmingham's worst slums were cleared. And {{through the}} city-centre a new {{thoroughfare}} was constructed, Corporation Street, which {{soon became a}} fashionable shopping street. He was instrumental in building of the Council House and the Victoria Law Courts in Corporation Street. [...] Numerous public parks were also created, central lending and reference libraries were opened in 1865–6, and the city's Museum and Art Gallery in 1885. The improvements introduced by Chamberlain and his colleagues were to prove the blueprint for municipal government, and <b>were</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by other cities. By 1890, a visiting American journalist could describe Birmingham as [...] "the best-governed city in the world". Although he resigned as mayor to become an MP, Chamberlain took close interest {{in the city for}} many years afterwards.|$|R
50|$|In West Germany May's {{heritage}} {{was less}} problematic; both {{the books and}} the festivals <b>were</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> and reprinted. The Karl May Festival in Bad Segeberg overtook its predecessor in Rathen, as the GDR officials discontinued the tradition there. The Federal Republic experienced some aspects of an idealized Indian image during the Protests of 1968 and the related generation and in the founding phase of Die Grünen and NGOs like Greenpeace, which have a strong influence in Germany. Cultural critics tended to depict Indians positively to criticize Western society while conflicts of and with actual Native Americans over issues such as fur hunting, slavery, forest fire triggering, non-sustainable practices such as buffalo jumps, seal clubbing and whaling were neglected. The positive image, however, also influenced the self-image of actual Indians.|$|R
5000|$|It was in late 1972 that Phase 2 {{first used}} {{an early version}} of the [...] "bubble letter" [...] or [...] "softie", a style of writing which would become {{extremely}} influential and is considered a [...] "giant leap" [...] in the art form. The puffed-out, marshmallow-like letters drawn by Phase 2 <b>were</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by other artists who added their own variations. Phase himself quickly embellished on his original form, creating and naming dozens of varieties of softies such as [...] "phasemagorical phantastic" [...] (bubble letters with stars), [...] "bubble cloud", and [...] "bubble drip." [...] He is also credited with pioneering the use of arrows in graf writing around this same time. Hip-hop journalist Jeff Chang has noted that Phase 2's canvasses from 1973 have [...] "been widely recognized as defining the early genre." ...|$|R
50|$|The first panty tree {{appeared}} {{under the}} Bell Mountain ski lift at Aspen Mountain in Colorado {{by at least}} the 1980s, perhaps {{as early as the}} 1950s. This panty tree <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> at nearby Vail Ski Resort and then numerous other ski areas across North America.|$|E
50|$|Richard Harold Naylor (9 September 1889 - 1952), {{better known}} as R. H. Naylor, was a British astrologer, and the first sun sign astrologer. His {{horoscope}} of the newly-born Princess Margaret for the Sunday Express, led to a regular column that <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by other British newspapers.|$|E
50|$|Red clinker mosaique <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> {{on another}} of Natus' {{well-known}} {{building on the}} corner of Pärnu and Roosikrantsi street, only a few hundred meters from the City Hall. This building was inspired by Johann Friedrich Höger's Chilehaus in Hamburg.Natus has also created several functionalistic apartment buildings and private dwellings.|$|E

50|$|Both letters <b>soon</b> <b>were</b> <b>copied,</b> {{and these}} copies {{were given to}} Colonel Altamonte {{in the summer of}} 1834, during his trip. Both the originals and these copies have since been lost. For his part, Altamonte {{forwarded}} translations of the letters to the Mexican government.|$|R
50|$|In 1939, Mr. Stein {{began writing}} a regular feature for Justice, the {{publication}} of the ILGWU, and <b>soon</b> <b>was</b> made <b>copy</b> editor and, later, assistant editor of the magazine; in 1952, he assumed responsibilities as editor, which he maintained until 1977.|$|R
50|$|The {{issue was}} counterstamped because a {{significant}} quantity of stamps {{was stolen from}} the San Salvador post office. Suggested by Jean-Baptiste Moens in the October 1874 issue of 'Le Timbre-Poste', this theory <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by other philatelic magazines of the period {{and it is the}} most known explanation now.|$|E
50|$|Among other inventions are the gas {{economizer}} {{which became}} the most famous and productive of his patents, and the intake horn, which <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> {{by the majority of}} countries. He held a demonstration of this invention by attaching it to a car and touring Spain on a promotional tour, to the astonishment of the inhabitants of towns and cities on seeing a set of ten note loudspeakers playing regional music.|$|E
50|$|Shaft collars saw few {{improvements}} until 1910 through 1911, when William G. Allen and Howard T. Hallowell, Sr, working independently, introduced {{commercially viable}} {{hex socket head}} set screws, and Hallowell patented a shaft collar with this safety-style set screw. His safety set collar <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by others and became an industry standard. The invention of the safety set collar {{was the beginning of}} the recessed-socket screw industry.|$|E
5000|$|His {{fame and}} {{popularity}} among artists and artisans {{led him to}} comply with a request to establish free Sunday lectures on mechanical objects. This was so widely popular that it <b>soon</b> <b>was</b> <b>copied</b> by millwrights, carpenters, and masons, and supported as early the principle of [...] "preparation courses" [...] (non-profit training schools).|$|R

25|$|The first decedent, twelve-year-old Caro Frances Chamberlin, {{was buried}} {{on the last}} day of 1858. Her grave is extant, atop the {{southern}} knoll in section B, Lot 16. Blodgett built the public vault into the hill near what is now the parkway leading to the Lathrop Chapel. Its limestone facade <b>was</b> <b>copied</b> <b>soon</b> after for a nearby family vault.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1860s the showman P. T. Barnum {{exhibited}} women whom {{he claimed}} were Circassian beauties. They wore a distinctive curly, big hair style, {{which had no}} precedent in earlier portrayals of Circassians, but which <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by other female performers in the United States, who became known as [...] "moss-haired girls". It is not clear why Barnum chose this hairstyle. It {{may have been a}} reference to the Circassian fur hat, rather than the hair.|$|E
5000|$|The first fern bar was the {{original}} T.G.I. Friday's {{on the corner of}} 63rd Street and First Avenue in a neighborhood on the Upper East Side of New York City, where many single young women lived. The founder, Alan Stillman, with a few thousand dollars borrowed from his mother, leased a saloon and remodeled it, converting the ambience to one attractive to young women. It opened March 15, 1965 and <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by other restaurants in the neighborhood.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after its}} {{building}} {{the architecture of}} Marble Hill House became widely known from published engravings, and was widely admired for its compact plan and tightly controlled elevations. Its design <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> elsewhere, rarely in the 1730s and 1740s but more commonly thereafter, and provided a standard model for the English villas built throughout the Thames Valley and further afield, for example New Place, King's Nympton, Devon, built between 1746 and 1749 {{to the design of}} Francis Cartwright of Blandford in Dorset.|$|E
50|$|His capital dwindling, Repton {{moved to}} a modest cottage at Hare Street near Romford in Essex. In 1788, aged 36 and with four {{children}} and no secure income, he hit {{on the idea of}} combining his sketching skills with his limited experience of laying out grounds at Sustead to become a 'landscape gardener' (a term he himself coined). Since the death of Capability Brown in 1783, no one figure dominated English garden design; Repton was ambitious to fill this gap and sent circulars round his contacts in the upper classes advertising his services. He was at first an avid defender of Brown's views, contrasted with those of Richard Payne Knight and Uvedale Price, but later adopted a moderate position. His first paid commission was Catton Park, to the north of Norwich, in 1788.That Repton, with no real experience of practical horticulture, became an overnight success, is a tribute to his undeniable talent, but also to the unique way he presented his work. To help clients visualise his designs, Repton produced 'Red Books' (so called for their binding) with explanatory text and watercolours with a system of overlays to show 'before' and 'after' views. In this he differed from Capability Brown, who worked almost exclusively with plans and rarely illustrated or wrote about his work. Repton's overlays <b>were</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by the Philadelphian Bernard M'Mahon in his 1806 American Gardener's Calendar.|$|R
50|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} not intended for distribution, but was {{made available to}} play on laptops in bars by promoters dressed up as hunters. It <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> illicitly <b>copied,</b> however, and became widely available for download on private websites. The publisher's initial irritation at this subsided after the game received favorable mentions in popular media and demand for it grew. From 2000 onwards the game was officially made available for download by Art Department. It became wildly popular in German-speaking Europe, {{to the point of}} being denounced in the media as a threat to the bottom line of businesses, on account of the number of hours wasted by employees playing the game.|$|R
5000|$|Luys Ycart (fl. 1396 - 1433), or Lluís Icart (...) {{in modern}} orthography, was a Catalan poet. He left behind {{fourteen}} lyric poems {{and a long}} poem called Consolació i Avís d'amor ("Consolation and Advice of Love"). All of his poetry was produced before {{the composition of the}} chansonnier Vega-Aguiló (1420 - 30), into which it <b>was</b> <b>copied</b> <b>soon</b> after it <b>was</b> written.|$|R
50|$|Williams {{laid the}} {{foundations}} for an excellent system of training apprentices at De Beers, a compulsory system which worked so well it <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> on the Witwatersrand. He had the miners’ welfare at heart and, in 1892, reduced the underground shift from 12 to 8 hours. He {{was one of the}} chief promoters of the South African School of Mines and was chairperson of its governing body for the years between 1896 and 1903, during which it functioned in Kimberley.|$|E
50|$|During {{that same}} time period, to support its own {{internal}} need for {{a large number of}} high quality, high resolution displays, Doremi built the first HDSDI to DVI converter, which allow users to have a low cost high definition monitoring system using computer displays. This innovative product was soon followed by a pattern generator. This product line <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by several other manufacturers and created a whole new line of converter/generator products, which Doremi continues to pursue in {{the high end of the}} market.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of C-Band satellites, Ted Turner {{came up with the}} idea of distributing his Atlanta, Georgia {{independent}} station WTCG (channel 17; later renamed WTBS, and now WPCH-TV) via C-Band to the entire country (and beyond). WTCG, which had already been distributed via microwave to cable systems in much of the Southeastern United States, became the first national superstation; Turner's idea <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by companies who applied for satellite uplinks to distribute other independent stations, including WGN-TV (channel 9) in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
50|$|The Cruyff Turn (also spelled Cruijff Turn in the Netherlands) is an evasive {{football}} {{move that}} {{was named after}} Dutch footballer Johan Cruyff. To do this move, Cruyff would look to pass or cross the ball. Instead of kicking it, he would drag the ball behind his planted foot with {{the inside of his}} crossing foot, turn through 180 degrees, and accelerate away from the defender. This feint was executed by Cruyff in the 1974 FIFA World Cup, first being seen in the Netherlands' match against Sweden where he outwitted Swedish defender Jan Olsson. The move <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> widely <b>copied</b> by other players around the world. It {{remains one of the most}} commonly used dribbling tricks in the modern game.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} season of post-war league football, Burnley gained {{promotion}} through {{second place in the}} Second Division. Additionally, there was a run to the FA Cup Final, with Aston Villa, Coventry City, Luton Town, Middlesbrough and Liverpool being defeated before Charlton Athletic beat Burnley 1-0 after extra time in the final at Wembley. Burnley immediately made an impact the top division, finishing third in 1947-48 as the club began to assemble a team capable of regularly aiming for honours. Between 1954 and 1957, manager Alan Brown introduced short corners and a huge array of free kick routines, which <b>were</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> across the land. In the 1956-57 season, Ian Lawson scored on his debut as a 17-year-old a record four goals versus Chesterfield in the FA Cup. That same season saw a club record 9-0 victory over New Brighton in the FA Cup—despite missing a penalty—and the following season former player Harry Potts became manager. The team of the 1950s revolved around the midfield duo of Jimmy Adamson and Jimmy McIlroy (a new stand was named after the latter in the 1990s) and these two were key to the championship-winning team of 1959-1960 managed by Potts (who now gives his name to the road which Turf Moor occupies). After a tense season in which Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers were the other protagonists in the chase for the league title, Burnley clinched the championship at Maine Road, Manchester with a 2-1 victory on 2 May 1960 with goals from Brian Pilkington and Trevor Meredith. Although they had been in contention all season, Burnley had never led the table until this last match was played out.|$|R
