40|$|An Emission Scenario Documents (ESD) {{describes}} the sources, production processes, pathways and use patterns of a chemical. Considering the whole {{life of the}} substance, an ESD aims to provide a method of estimating emission quantity {{in the absence of}} sufficient empirical data and to provide data on each parameter. In July 2009, OECD has developed an ESD about coating industry (ESD number 22). For this ESD, the industry category relevant is IC 14 and includes paints, lacquers and varnishes in industrial uses. In September 2009, Japan authorities provided an addendum intended as a complement to the method used in the ESD No. 22, it treats about solvent substances and focus on industrial coating processes but contains also wood products on document. It should be noted that ESD number 22 doesn't include specific uses such as in <b>wood</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>treatment.</b> However, an emission scenario dedicated to wood preservatives has been developed by the OECD Task Force on biocides (revised in 2012). In the context of REACh, Specific Environmental Release Categories (SpERCs) have been developed by the industry to comply with the REACH requirements for ERC (Environmental Release Categories) associated with paint application in certain industries. We propose to compare the different exposure scenarii quoted previously each other in a practical case. Pros and cons will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEvaluation of commercially {{available}} polyurethane resins used {{up to now}} for coating applications to develop non-biocidal <b>wood</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>treatments</b> has been conducted. A simple method of vacuum impregnation of these resins into beech wood (Fagus sylvatica L.) and pine wood (Pinus sylvestris L.) samples followed by varied curing processes at ambient temperature, 103, and 200 °C has been performed. Based on the analysis of weight percent gain before and after leaching, treatment resistance to leaching, anti-swelling efficiency, wettability and decay durability measured for treated and untreated blocks after leaching with the white-rot fungus Coriolus versicolor for both wood species and the brown-rot fungi Poria placenta and Gloeophyllum trabeum for pine wood, {{it can be concluded}} that such treatment can be considered as potential valuable non-biocidal treatments...|$|R
25|$|A main {{consideration}} regarding timber piles is {{that they}} should be protected from rotting above groundwater level. Timber will last for a long time below the groundwater level. For timber to rot, two elements are needed: water and oxygen. Below the groundwater level, dissolved oxygen is lacking even though there is ample water. Hence, timber tends to last for a long time below groundwater level. In 1648 the Royal Palace of Amsterdam was constructed on 13659 timber piles that still survive today since they were below groundwater level. Timber that is to be used above the water table can be protected from decay and insects by numerous forms of <b>wood</b> <b>preservation</b> using pressure <b>treatment</b> (alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ), chromated copper arsenate (CCA), creosote, etc.).|$|R
40|$|The heat {{treatment}} of wood is an environment-friendly method for <b>wood</b> <b>preservation.</b> The heat <b>treatment</b> process only uses steam and heat, and no chemicals or agents {{are applied to}} the material during the process. Tests have shown no harmful emissions are apparent when working with the material. This process improves wood’s resistance to decay and its dimensional stability. In this study, the density, compression strength and hardness of heat treated hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.) wood were investigated. Wood specimens that had been conditioned at 65 % relative humidity and 20 ºC were subjected to {{heat treatment}} at 170, 190, and 210 °C for 4, 8, and 12 hrs. After heat treatment, compression strength and hardness were determined according to TS 2595 and TS 2479. The {{results showed that the}} decreases of compression strength and hardness were related to the extent of density loss. Both compression strength and hardness decreased with the increasing temperatures and durations of the heat treatment. While the maximum density loss observed was 16. 12 % at 210 ºC and 12 hour, at these heat-treatment conditions, the compression strength approximately decreased 30 % and hardness values in tangential, radial, and longitudinal directions approximately decreased by 55 %, 54 %, and 38 %, respectively. Hence, it was concluded {{that there might be a}} relationship between changes of these wood properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to show a comprehensive literature review about <b>wood</b> <b>preservation</b> in Brazil, since the earliest years until 2011. Brazil is rich in natural resources and wood has always occurred in abundance. With the industrial growing, there was the necessity of using wood with low natural durability but with chemical preservative treatment. Wood chemical treatment began in late XIX century, mainly to attend the big demand of sleepers to railroads. Only during the 60 ’s, <b>wood</b> <b>preservation</b> gained market with the increase of scientific researches, elaboration of technical standards and building industrial plants for <b>wood</b> <b>preservation.</b> From this point on, few advances have been reached. In 2011, Eucalyptus and Pinus, were the main species used in <b>wood</b> <b>preservation</b> plants that adopts the vacuum-pressure process. In small production scale, diffusion process is adopted. Copper chromium arsenate (CCA) and Copper chromium borate (CCB) are the most preservatives utilised with some creosote utilisation. The treatedwood production is concentrated in fence posts, poles and sleepers. As a trend, the <b>wood</b> <b>preservation</b> must reach new markets, such as building constructions, wood packages and crossarms, and also to intensify the traditional uses. Although {{there are a lot of}} researches about chemicals for <b>wood</b> <b>preservation,</b> CCA must keep by the years, once alternative products do not present the same efficacy or clear effects about human health and environment...|$|R

50|$|As {{proposed}} by Richardson, treatment of wood has been practiced for {{almost as long}} as the use of wood itself. There are records of <b>wood</b> <b>preservation</b> reaching back to ancient Greece during Alexander the Great's rule, where bridge wood was soaked in olive oil. The Romans protected their ship hulls by brushing the wood with tar. During the Industrial Revolution <b>wood</b> <b>preservation</b> became a cornerstone of the wood processing industry. Inventors and scientists such as Bethell, Boucherie, Burnett and Kyan made historic developments in <b>wood</b> <b>preservation,</b> with the preservative solutions and processes. Commercial pressure treatment began {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century with the protection of railroad cross-ties using creosote. Treated wood was used primarily for industrial, agricultural, and utility applications, where it is still used, until its use grew considerably (at least in the United States) in the 1970's as homeowners began building decks and backyard projects. Innovation in treated timber products continues to this day, with consumers becoming more interested in less toxic materials.|$|R

40|$|Supplementary to {{the study}} on the {{emissions}} and concentrations of copper, arsenic and chromium in air near three <b>wood</b> <b>preservation</b> plants in the Netherlands, we measured concentrations of these elements in coarse dust particles near <b>wood</b> <b>preservation</b> plants. Measurements were taken near a stack of stored impregnated wood in a dry weather period when wind speeds were high. In addition, soil and grass samples, taken {{in the vicinity of}} two <b>wood</b> <b>preservation</b> plants, were analysed for copper, arsenic and chromium. Particle mass concentrations varied from 40 to 80 mug m- 3, while concentrations of copper, arsenic and chromium were in the range of 5 to 50 ng m- 3, which compares well with the results of the measurements in the previous study performed under wet weather and low wind-speed conditions. The concentrations in most of the soil and grass samples compared well with background levels in the Netherlands. This shows that dispersion and deposition of particles from the plants do not lead to detectable copper, arsenic and chromium contamination of the soil and grass near the plants, which is in agreement with the results of model calculations in the previous study. At one location, high copper, arsenic en chromium concentrations were found in the soil however, these appeared to result from earlier plant activity. The results of the additional air, soil and grass measurements confirm the conclusions of the previous study that both the health risks for residents in the surroundings and the contamination of the environment due to emissions from the <b>wood</b> <b>preservation</b> plants are low...|$|R
40|$|Classic {{engineering}} {{economic theory}} {{was developed to}} furnish the analyst with a tool to compare alternatives {{on the basis of}} life-cycle cost (LCC). However, tools used to apply theory to transportation focus on new construction projects with relatively long service lives. These tools do not accurately model the economic aspects of short-lived alternatives such as those that pavement managers must evaluate when seeking the most cost-effective pavement <b>preservation</b> <b>treatment.</b> The field of pavement preservation seeks to 2 ̆ 2 keep good roads good, 2 ̆ 2 and hence pavement <b>preservation</b> <b>treatments</b> are applied to extend the functional service life of the underlying pavement. No significant research has been done to quantify the actual service lives of the pavement <b>preservation</b> <b>treatments</b> themselves nor has a model been furnished to analyze their LCCs. The paper addresses those two gaps in the pavement economics body of knowledge by proposing a methodology for using field test data to quantify the service lives of pavement <b>preservation</b> <b>treatments</b> for both asphalt and concrete pavements. In addition, the paper concludes that an LCC model based on equivalent uniform annual cost, rather than net present value, specifically addresses the relatively short-term nature of pavement <b>preservation</b> <b>treatments</b> and allows the engineer to better relate treatment LCC output to annual maintenance budgets...|$|R
