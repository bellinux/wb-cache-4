Construction on a Catholic Cathedral designed by architect William Wardell, widely regarded as Australia's finest architect of the 19th century, was commenced in 1860, and was to be built {{on the site of}} the first Roman Catholic Church in Tasmania. In 1866, St Mary's Catholic Cathedral was opened, but without the originally designed tower. The magnificent St David's Anglican Cathedral, seat of the Bishop of Tasmania, and administrative centre of the Anglican Diocese of Tasmania, was completed in 1868 in high Gothic style, designed by George Frederick Bodley.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} demolitions was small prior to World War I but had become {{considerable}} by 1955, when one house was demolished every five days. As early as 1944, the trustees of Castle Howard, convinced {{there was no}} future for Britain's great houses, had begun selling the house's contents. Increasing taxation and a shortage of staff were already ensuring that {{the old way of}} life had ended. The wealth and status of the owner provided no protection to the building as even the more wealthy owners became keen to free themselves of not only the expense of a large house, but also the trappings of wealth and redundant privilege which the house represented. Thus, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> smaller country houses of the gentry which were wiped from their – often purposefully built – landscapes, but also the huge ducal palaces. Alfred Waterhouse's Gothic Eaton Hall, owned by Britain's wealthiest peer was razed to the ground in 1963, {{to be replaced by a}} smaller modern building. Sixteen years earlier the Duke of Bedford had reduced Woburn Abbey to half its original size, destroying façades and interiors by both Henry Flitcroft and Henry Holland. The Duke of Devonshire saved Hardwick Hall by surrendering it to H.M. Treasury in lieu of death duties, which were charged at the maximum rate of 80% of the total value of an estate, but this solution was rarely acceptable to the government. As late as 1975, the British Labour government refused to save Mentmore, thus causing the dispersal, and emigration, of one of the country's finest art collections.|$|E

The term first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas (middle times). The term la rinascita (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists, 1550, revised 1568). Vasari divides the age into three phases: the first phase contains Cimabue, Giotto, and Arnolfo di Cambio; the second phase contains Masaccio, Brunelleschi, and Donatello; the third centers on Leonardo da Vinci and culminates with Michelangelo. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> growing awareness of classical antiquity that drove this development, according to Vasari, but also the growing desire to study and imitate nature.|$|E

It is also the memory of Professor Bernard Quatermass grappling with the pulsating giant plant that threatened to destroy the world from its rooting place in the Abbey's nave… The Quatermass Experiment frightened the life out of a vast new generation of television viewers whose sets had been acquired in order to watch the Coronation… Quatermass {{was one of the first}} series on British television to make life seem potentially terrifying." ...|$|E
500|$|Damages {{is money}} claimed in {{compensation}} for some failure {{by the other}} party to a case. It is commonly believed that the Court of Chancery could not grant damages until the Chancery Amendment Act 1858, which gave it that right, but in some special cases it {{had been able to}} provide damages for over 600years. The idea of damages was first conceived in English law during the 13th century, when the Statutes of Merton and Gloucester provided for damages in certain circumstances. Despite what is normally assumed by academics, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> common law courts that could grant damages under these statutes; the Exchequer of Pleas and Court of Chancery both had the right to do so. In Cardinal Beaufort's case in 1453, for example, it is stated that [...] "I shall have a subpoena against my feoffee and recover damages for the value of the land". A statute passed during the reign of Richard II specifically gave the Chancery the right to award damages, stating: ...|$|E

Wendy Richard commented, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> memory of Arthur that stopped the marriage to Joe being a success. He was proven to be a weak and untruthful man.

500|$|Starting in 1971, Michael Jackson {{released}} {{a total of}} four solo studio albums with Motown, among them Got to Be There and Ben. These were {{released a}}s part of The Jackson 5 franchise, and produced successful singles such as [...] "Got to Be There", [...] "Ben" [...] and a remake of Bobby Day's [...] "Rockin' Robin". The Jackson 5's sales, however, began declining in 1973, and the band members chafed under Motown's strict refusal to allow them creative control or input. Although the group scored several top40 hits, including the top five disco single [...] "Dancing Machine" [...] and the top20 hit [...] "I Am Love", The Jackson 5 (minus Jermaine Jackson) left Motown in 1975. The Jackson 5 signed a new contract with CBS Records in June 1975, first joining the Philadelphia International Records division and then Epic Records. As a result of legal proceedings, the group was renamed The Jacksons. After the name change, the band continued to tour internationally, releasing six more albums between 1976 and 1984. During that period, Michael <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> lead singer, but also the chief songwriter for the group, writing or co-writing such hits as [...] "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)", [...] "This Place Hotel" [...] and [...] "Can You Feel It".|$|E
500|$|During these years, Carte <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> {{manager of}} the theatre.

According to Henry Lytton, [...] "Mr. Carte was a great stage manager. He could take in the details of a scene with one sweep of his eagle eye and say unerringly just what was wrong." [...] The quality of Carte's productions created a national and international taste for them, and he sent touring companies throughout the British provinces, to America (generally managed by Helen), Europe and elsewhere. Queen Victoria honoured the company by calling for a Royal Command Performance of The Gondoliers at Windsor Castle in 1891. Following the libretto closely, she noticed additions to the text made by some of the actors and asked Carte to explain why this was done. Carte replied that they [...] "are what we call 'gags'". The queen answered that she had always understood that [...] "gags were things that were put by authority into people's mouths." [...] Carte rejoined, [...] "These gags, Your Majesty, are things people put into their own mouths without authority." [...] George Bernard Shaw, writing in The World in October 1893, stated: ...|$|E

David Bradley of SFX awarded [...] "Blink" [...] five out of five stars, saying {{that it could have}} featured any of the previous Doctors and predicted that its [...] "timelessness" [...] would ensure that it would [...] " [...] down as one of the finest, scariest, cleverest Who episodes ever". IGN's Travis Fickett gave the episode 9.1 out of 10, praising the way the audience felt they had known Sally Sparrow for a while, as well as the strength of Mulligan's performance, although he noted that [...] "all of the performances in this episode are exceptional". He concluded that, [...] "it's difficult to believe that so much was accomplished in such a short amount of time. The story of not one, but two relationships was told, several time lines intersected and a new and rather frightening enemy was vanquished without The Doctor ever coming face to face with them". Ross Ruedinger of Slant Magazine believed that the episode <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> best Doctor Who episode, but also a great episode of the science fiction and horror genre that could allow it to stand alone. He also praised the fear-inducing concept of the Weeping Angels as well the [...] "tenderness of the story and the characters" [...] which were [...] "quite intricate given how much is going on in these 45 minutes". The Daily Telegraph named the episode one of the best of the show's entire run, noting that, while the Doctor [...] "is somewhat on the periphery here", it [...] "adds to the threat".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his earlier}} {{agreement}} with Hitler, Röhm still {{clung to his}} vision of a new German army with the SA at its core. By early 1934, this vision directly conflicted with Hitler's plan to consolidate power and expand the Reichswehr. Because their plans for the army conflicted, Röhm's success could only come at Hitler's expense. Moreover, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> Reichswehr that viewed the SA as a threat. Several of Hitler's lieutenants feared Röhm's growing power and restlessness, as did Hitler. As a result, a political struggle within the party grew, with those closest to Hitler, including Prussian premier Hermann Göring, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, and Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess, positioning themselves against Röhm. While all of these men were veterans of the Nazi movement, only Röhm continued to demonstrate his independence from, rather than his loyalty to, Adolf Hitler. Röhm's contempt for the party's bureaucracy angered Hess. SA violence in Prussia gravely concerned Göring, Minister-President of Prussia. Finally {{in the spring of}} 1934, the growing rift between Röhm and Hitler over the role of the SA in the Nazi state led the former Chancellor, General Kurt von Schleicher, to start playing politics again. Schleicher criticised the current Hitler cabinet while some of Schleicher's followers such as General Ferdinand von Bredow and Werner von Alvensleben started passing along lists of a new Hitler Cabinet in which Schleicher would become Vice-Chancellor, Röhm Minister of Defence, Heinrich Brüning Foreign Minister and Gregor Strasser Minister of National Economy. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, who knew Schleicher and his circle well, wrote that Bredow displayed a [...] "lack of discretion" [...] that was [...] "terrifying" [...] as he went about showing the list of the proposed cabinet to anyone who was interested. Although Schleicher was in fact unimportant by 1934, increasingly wild rumours that he was scheming with Röhm to reenter the corridors of power helped stoke the sense of crisis.|$|E
