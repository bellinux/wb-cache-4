VFS – are tools to prove properties of systems described as formal specifications (basic protocols), such as the completeness (the system behavior has a possible continuation at each of its stages) and consistency (the system behavior is deterministic at each stage), safety (something bad <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened),</b> or the correspondence of the specified behavior to given scenarios. Together these tools constitute a powerful environment for the formal verification of formal specifications expressed through message sequence charts...|$|R

500|$|The Queen {{reportedly}} felt a [...] "profound {{sense of}} disappointment" [...] in Blair for breaking with protocol by revealing {{in his memoirs}} sensitive details of private conversations he had with her during his time as Prime Minister. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace told a newspaper, [...] "No prime minister before has ever done this and {{we can only hope}} that it <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>happen</b> again." [...] The Sunday Express claimed, quoting [...] "renowned Royal biographer Hugo Vickers" [...] and other [...] "Royal insiders", that because of the book's contents, ElizabethII would withhold granting Blair the Order of the Thistle, an honour which is bestowed at the sovereign's personal prerogative and normally given almost automatically to leaders of Scottish descent after leaving office. Gordon Brown was said to be [...] "seething" [...] and [...] "dismayed" [...] over the criticism he received from Blair in the book, but had told aides not to criticise it. Ed Balls, a Brown ally who served in his government as Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said, [...] "It would have been much better if the memoirs had been a celebration of success rather than recriminations. In that sense I thought it was all a bit sad. It was so one-sided. I didn't think it was comradely." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{central theme}} of the movie is {{discussed}} in the film's fourth scene. Witwer discusses the PreCrime system with the division's staff. He believes that its main [...] "legalistic drawback" [...] is that it [...] "arrests individuals who have broken no laws." [...] Jad responds, [...] "But they will!" [...] When Anderton later arrives upon this discussion, he acknowledges the paradox Witwer raises; that the precogs' prevent an event accepted as fact, but one which <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>happen.</b> To show him that people regularly use predetermination, Anderton picks up a wooden ball and rolls it toward Witwer, who catches it before it lands on the ground. When asked why he caught the ball, Witwer says [...] "Because {{it was going to}} fall." [...] Anderton replies, [...] "But it didn't." [...] Then confidently tells him, [...] "The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change {{the fact that it was}} going to happen." [...] Kowalski feels this example is faulty in the sense that the ball has no free will; it merely acts according to the laws of physics, but he acknowledges that if an individual were to have freely chosen to commit murder, then it would hold. Film scholar Stephen Mulhall points out that unlike the laws of physics which have a series of scientifically testable causal laws, Anderton merely has the visions of the precogs', whose psychic abilities are not fully explained by science.|$|E

PETA says that instead of [...] "vainly defending himself", Peter Jackson should be giving a [...] "firm assurance that this <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>happen</b> again".

2500|$|In {{his second}} year, Green Bay won the NFL Western Conference {{for the first}} time since 1944. This victory, along with his {{well-known}} religious convictions led the Green Bay community to anointing him with the nickname [...] "The Pope". Lombardi led the Packers to the 1960 NFL Championship Game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Prior to the championship game, Lombardi met with Wellington Mara and advised him that he would not take the Giants' head coaching job, which was initially offered after the end of the 1959 season. In the final play of the game, in a drive that would have won it, the Packers were stopped a few yards from the goal line. Lombardi had suffered his first, and his only ever, championship game loss. After the game, and after the press corps had left the locker room, Lombardi told his team, [...] "This <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>happen</b> again. You will never lose another championship." [...] In later years as coach of the Packers, Lombardi made it a point to admonish his running backs if they failed to score from one yard out, then he would consider it a personal affront to him and he would seek retribution. He would coach the Packers to win their next nine post-season games, a record streak not matched or broken until Bill Belichick won 10 in a row from 2002 to 2006. The Packers would defeat the Giants for the NFL title in 1961 (37–0 in Green Bay) and 1962 (16–7 at Yankee Stadium), marking the first two of their five titles in Lombardi's seven years. After the 1962 championship win, President John F. Kennedy called Lombardi and asked him if he would, [...] "come back to Army and coach again"; Kennedy received Lombardi's tacit denial of the request. His only other post-season loss occurred to the St. Louis Cardinals in the Playoff Bowl (3rd place game) after the 1964 season (officially classified as an exhibition game).|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{reaching}} the initial Kickstarter funding goal, several stretch goals {{were set to}} encourage additional funding. The goals achieved included Linux and Mac support, an expanded storyline, several new locations, an improved soundtrack, an interactive comic book, French- and German-language versions, and director's commentary. The ultimate stretch goal, unlocked at $2 million, was the The Longest Journey Home, a traditional 2D point-and-click adventure game starring April Ryan, bridging the ten-year time gap between TLJ and Dreamfall, and extending to after Chapters to conclude her storyline. Had this goal been reached, Red Thread Games would have begun working on TLJH immediately after Chapters, but since it wasn't, {{the plans for the}} game have been put on indefinite hold. Shortly before the release of the last episode of Chapters, director Ragnar Tørnquist had stated that [...] "The Longest Journey Home <b>will</b> probably <b>never</b> <b>happen...</b> At least not for a long, long time." ...|$|R

It lost its next match at home to Valencia (1-2) while one week later {{neighbours}} Celta de Vigo inflicted final damage by winning (3-0). As had been the case during {{the whole of the}} season, the team proved to be too irregular in its performances. Losing 3-0, twice, in the final weeks of the Liga and being defeated at home is something that cannot be afforded. But it happened and in the end the team finished third, behind Real Sociedad and at six points of champions Real Madrid.|$|R
50|$|Four-of-a-kinds {{are almost}} {{impossible}} to extend. Having all four of three numbers in sequential order <b>will</b> just about <b>never</b> <b>happen</b> {{without the use of}} trading. However, just in case a player gets extremely lucky, extended four-of-a-kinds have a different property than the extended double sequence. An extended four-of-a-kind such as 8♥ 8♦ 8♠ 8♣ : 9♣ 9♥ 9♦ 9♠ ||3♥ 3♠ 3♦ 3♣ : 4♠ 4♥ 4♣ 4♦ : 5♦ 5♣ 5♥ 5♠ in some versions of the game can defeat as many as four 2s in just one extension. However, the four-of-a-kind extension is so rare, {{there has never been a}} rule to extend it. Therefore, only the players can decide just what are the guidelines to it, and how many 2s can be defeated by extending it.|$|R
2500|$|Responding to such {{criticism}} Popović said in early 1994: [...] "Well, I'm a lawyer, so technically yes, I am committing {{an act of}} treason under Serbian laws. But I distinguish between {{the interests of the}} Serbian state and the Serbian people and I think these interests are opposed at this moment. The military defeat of the Milošević government {{is in the best interest}} of the Serbian people. It is something that every good Serbian patriot should wish for. I don't think I betrayed my people". Pressed further to clarify his position on the ramifications of such an act such as an implication that a violent foreign intervention can solve certain political problems, like the problem of an armed Serb secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina, or from Croatia, as well as his position on the inevitable civilian death toll if such an action is to occur, Popović said: [...] "I think that's an unfair question. If I see somebody trying to murder somebody else, of course my duty is to try to stop him. I'm not saying that by doing so and applying violence to the situation, I'm actually trying to help those people lead a good life. I don't know what they will do once they leave the scene. What I see Serbs doing in Bosnia is committing an act of aggression against a state that has been recognized by United Nations, and I see them committing genocide. I think that both of these things should be stopped. Of course, stopping it would not solve the problem of how these people will live next to each other in the future, but first you have to stop the crimes. The international community has an obligation to do so, under the Genocide Convention and the United Nations Charter. They have an obligation to use force to stop aggression, and to stop genocide. In any armed conflict there will be civilian casualties. Unfortunately, that's something that can't be avoided. But I don't think that this fact should prevent the international community from doing what they are obliged to do under the international law: stopping the aggression, stopping the genocide. It sounds nice to advocate peaceful means, but it is not realistic. I return to this parallel: If you see some big guy beating a kid in the street, it would be very good if you could go to him and say 'Please stop this, you shouldn't be doing this, it is uncivilized. This poor guy cannot defend himself.' No, if that doesn't work, you call the police, who have to use violence. At this point in history you have to revert to violence to stop crime." [...] Asked whether he signed the particular petition because of the circumstances rather than principally thinking that such measures solve problems, Popović said: [...] "I'll go even further. I signed this document knowing perfectly well that this <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>happen.</b> I did it as a gesture to show that I realized who's the main culprit in the Yugoslav conflict. And I wanted to express my opinion that this government would deserve it, even though it will never happen".|$|E

50|$|The Germans {{continued}} to lengthen {{the road to}} Kirkenes, and {{it came to be}} known as Blodvegen ("the Blood Road") by locals. This project involved prisoners of war, mostly from Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, in building this road under extremely harsh conditions. The workers lived in prison camps where they did not receive enough food for their hard work building the road. This caused many of the workers to collapse and die. A famous sign of this road is the blood cross one of the prisoners drew on the mountainside with his recently killed friend's blood.
