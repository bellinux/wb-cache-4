Tianji 天機, translated [...] "dynamism of Heaven", also occurs in the Zhuangzi (6, tr.

[...] Roth (1997:298-299) notes the final line's contrasting verbs, xun 訓 [...] "follow; accord with" [...] and ni 逆 [...] "oppose; resist", were similarly used in the (168 BCE) Huangdi Sijing Yin-yang silk manuscripts.|$|R

5|$|Church {{growth in}} the Northeast was also {{accompanied}} by revivalism. While calmer and more reserved {{than those in the}} South, the revivals of the Second Great Awakening transformed religion in the Northeast, and they were often led by Presbyterians and Congregationalists. The Plan of Union led to the spread of New England theology (also known as the New Divinity and New Haven theology), originally conceived by Congregationalists. The New England theology modified and softened traditional Calvinism, rejecting the doctrine of imputation of Adam's sin, adopting the governmental theory of atonement, and embracing a greater emphasis on free <b>will.</b> <b>It</b> was essentially an attempt to construct a Calvinism conducive to revivalism. While the Synod of Philadelphia condemned the New Divinity as heretical in 1816, the General Assembly disagreed, concluding that New England theology did not conflict with the Westminster Confession.|$|E

His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved.
