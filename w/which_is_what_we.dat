Already into the process of working on their fourth studio album and hiring new guitarist, John Frusciante, the band held open auditions for a new drummer. Smith {{was one of the last}} drummers to audition for the band and the band felt that on looks alone, Smith would be the wrong fit as he looked more hair-metal than punk. Nonetheless, the band was blown away by his audition. Singer Anthony Kiedis admired Smith and found his persistence impressive. Smith joined the Chili Peppers in December 1988 and within a few months was recording his first album with the band, Mother's Milk. Smith reflected on joining the band in a 2012 interview by saying “I remember thinking, ‘Oh, cool, they have a record deal. Great! I’d love to be in a band that has a record deal.

The calculus forms a core language for {{implementation of a}} wide variety of rewriting languages, or more generally, languages for specifying tree transformations. In this paper we show how a conventional rewriting language based on conditional term rewriting can be implemented straightforwardly in System S. Subsequently we show how this implementation can be extended with features such as matching conditions, negative conditions, default rules, non-strictness annotations and alternative evaluation strategies. We thank Bas Luttik and Andrew Tolmach for many discussions on rewriting strategies and their applications.
