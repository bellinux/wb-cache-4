5000|$|Windows are a {{ready and}} {{predictable}} site for thermal radiation.Energy from radiation can {{move into a}} window in the day time, {{and out of the}} same window at night. Radiation uses photons to transmit electromagnetic waves through a vacuum, or translucent medium. Solar heat gain can be significant even on cold clear days. Solar heat gain through windows can be reduced by insulated glazing, shading, and orientation. Windows are particularly difficult to insulate compared to roof and walls. Convective heat transfer through and around <b>window</b> <b>coverings</b> also degrade its insulation properties. [...] When shading windows, external shading is more effective at reducing heat gain than internal <b>window</b> <b>coverings.</b>|$|R
