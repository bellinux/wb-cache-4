40|$|Stable flies are blood-feeding insects {{with a great}} {{negative}} impact on animals world wide. Larvae develop primarily in animal manure and bacteria are essential for larval development; however, the principle of this dependence is not understood. We hypothesized that as the microbial community of animal manure changes over time, it {{plays an important role}} in stable fly fitness. Two-choice bioassays were conducted using 2 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> horse manure (control) and aging horse manure (fresh to 5 <b>week</b> <b>old)</b> to evaluate the effect of manure age on stable fly oviposition. Our data showed that fresh feces did not stimulate oviposition and that the attractiveness increased as manure aged but started to decline after 3 weeks. Bioassays assessing the effect of manure age at the time of oviposition on larval development demonstrated that 1 – 3 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> manure supported larval development significantly better than fresh, 4, and 5 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> manure. In addition, adult fitness (body size) was significantly higher in flies from 1 and 2 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> manure comparing to that of all other treatments. Analysis of the bacterial community of aging horse manure by 454 -pyrosequencing of 16 S rDNA revealed a great reduction in bacterial diversity and richness from fresh to 1 – 5 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> manure and a major shift from strict anaerobes in fresh manure to facultative anaerobes and strict aerobes in aged manure. Overall, the microbial community of 2 and 3 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> horse manure with its dominant bacterial taxa Rhizobium, Devosia, and Brevundimonas stimulated stable fly oviposition the most and provided a suitable habitat for larval development.

Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight <b>weeks</b> <b>old</b> was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957.

40|$|International audienceLong-term {{potentiation}} (LTP), {{considered the}} neurophysiological basis {{for learning and}} memory, is facilitated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an action more evident when LTP is evoked by weak θ-burst stimuli and dependent upon co-activation of adenosine A 2 A receptors (A 2 AR), which are more expressed in aged rats. Since θ-burst stimuli also favour LTP in aged animals, we hypothesised that enhanced LTP in ageing {{could be related to}} changes in neuromodulation by BDNF. The magnitude of CA 1 LTP induced by a weak theta burst stimuli delivered to the Schaffer collaterals was significantly higher in hippocampal slices taken from 36 - 38 and from 70 - 80 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> rats, when compared to LTP magnitude in slices from 4 or 10 - 15 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> rats; this enhancement does not impact in cognitive improvement since aged rats revealed an impairment on hippocampal dependent learning and memory performance, as assessed by the Morris water maze tests. The scavenger for BDNF, TrkB-Fc, and the inhibitor of Trk phosphorylation, K 252 a, attenuated LTP in slices from 70 - 80 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> rats, but not from 10 - 15 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> rats. When exogenously added, BDNF significantly increased LTP in slices from 4 and 10 - 15 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> rats but did not further increased LTP in 36 - 38 or 70 - 80 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> rats. The effects of exogenous BDNF on LTP were prevented by the A 2 AR antagonist, SCH 58261. These results indicate that the higher LTP magnitude observed upon ageing, which does not translate into improved spatial memory performance, is a consequence of an increase in the tonic action of endogenous BDNF...|$|R

5|$|Usually, {{the mother}} does not {{integrate}} {{herself and her}} cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight <b>weeks</b> <b>old.</b> Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth {{at about the same}} time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles and there is communal raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. The synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival, and older cubs do not dominate the sucklings.|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of EntomologyLudek ZurekStable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans L.) are blood-feeding insects {{with a great}} {{negative}} impact on livestock resulting in annual losses around $ 2 billion in the USA alone. One {{of the main reasons}} for such an impact is because stable fly management is very difficult. Stable fly larvae develop primarily in animal manure and live bacteria were shown to be essential for stable fly development. I hypothesized that the microbial community of horse manure changes over time and {{plays an important role in}} stable fly fitness. Two-choice bioassays were conducted using 2 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> horse manure (control) and aging horse manure (fresh to 5 <b>week</b> <b>old)</b> to evaluate the effect of manure age on stable fly oviposition. The results showed that fresh manure did not stimulate oviposition and that the attractiveness increased as manure aged but started to decline after 3 weeks. Stable fly eggs artificially placed on 1, 2, and 3 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> manure resulted in significantly higher survival and heavier adults comparing to those developing in fresh, 4, and 5 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> manure. Analysis of the bacterial community of aging horse manure by 454 -pyrosequencing of 16 S rDNA revealed a major shift from strict anaerobes (e. g.

In conclusion, the microbial community of 2 and 3 <b>week</b> <b>old</b> horse manure stimulates stable fly oviposition and provides a suitable habitat for stable fly development. Manure at this stage should be the main target for disrupting the stable fly life cycle. Volatile compounds acting as oviposition stimulants/attractants and their specific bacterial origin remain to be determined. Better understanding of stable fly microbial ecology is critical for development of novel management strategies based on alteration of the microbial community of stable fly habitat to generate a substrate that is non-conducive to fly oviposition and/or larval development...|$|R

5|$|When {{they arise}} in the spring, the females go to nursery colonies which may often be the same place where they were born. These nursery colonies consist mainly of adult females and their young and can {{be located in the}} attics of warm {{buildings}} where there is high humidity. These colonies sometimes reach numbers of bats as great as 1,000 per cave/forest. Gestation lasts 50–60 days. They usually have one baby per female each year, sometimes twins, born sometime from late May to early July. The young are born in an altricial state with their eyes closed and will hang in the nursery while their mothers forage at night. Their eyes open on their second day. They cling to a nipple constantly until they are two <b>weeks</b> <b>old.</b> At three weeks, they learn to fly. By four weeks, they are adult sized.

5|$|After lambs {{are several}} <b>weeks</b> <b>old,</b> lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E
