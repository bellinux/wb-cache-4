40|$|This paper reports early {{effects of}} stump height {{on the growth}} and natural pruning of {{potential}} crop trees after pre-commercial thinning of a young stand of naturally regenerated beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in Denmark. The experiment comprises five treatments based on combinations of three grades of pre-commercial thinning and three stump heights. Treatments include the unthinned control, thinning only of whips and <b>wolf</b> <b>trees</b> (using low stumps), and thinning for potential crop trees using low, medium or high stumps. All treatments were replicated three times. Stump heights averaged 10, 90 or 230 cm, respectively. Pre-treatment stem number (live trees) varied from 17, 500 to 41, 000 per ha. In the potential crop tree treatment, post-treatment stem number ranged from 4, 750 to 9, 500 per ha. Following two growth seasons, the quantity of stump regrowth increased with increasing stump height, the rate of stump regrowth increased with increasing stump height, the diameter growth of potential crop trees increased with decreasing stump height, the increase in stand height did not depend on stump height or post-treatment stem number, and the natural pruning of potential crop trees increased with increasing stump height. It remains to be seen, whether these trends hold in the long run, and whether additional economic return from the increase in wood quality with increasing stump height compensates for the reduction in diameter growth...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The diverse {{lichen flora}} of the Pacific Northwest is being {{impacted}} by {{population growth and}} by forest management practices. Accumulating information about our lichen flora will improve our conservation strategies. This dissertation first collects information to improve {{our understanding of how}} lichen communities vary among forests of differing structure, and across the western Oregon landscape. It then proposes a method to predict species occurrence in unsampled sites by utilizing the information on forest characters and environmental gradients at sampled sites. Macrolichen communities sampled in coniferous forests revealed that old-growth stands (> 200 yrs old) harbored communities that differed from those in young forests (50 - 110 yrs old). Even more atypical communities occurred in macrolichen hotspots, which were primarily in riparian zones. Many macrolichen species were associated with these hotspots, including numerous nitrogen-fixing cyanolichens. Macrolichen species associated with old-growth forested plots included the nitrogen-fixing lichen Lobaria oregana and several forage-providing alectorioid lichens. The presence of remnant old trees apparently increased the occurrence of old-growth associates in young stands. The calicioids, a group of microlichens investigated only in the Cascades, had a strong association with old growth forest and remnant trees. Diversity of calicioids may also be increased by legacy structures such as old snags and <b>wolf</b> <b>trees.</b> These structures increase continuity between current and previous stands. Macrolichen communities varied between the Coast and Cascade Mountain Ranges, following climatic gradients, particularly annual precipitation. Successional patterns in macrolichen communities appeared to differ between the mountain ranges. The modeling method proposed for using habitat associations to predict occurrence has several advantages over common modeling methods, such as regression. The method is simple, avoids parametric assumptions, provides easy updating of models as additional sites are sampled, and automatically accounts for interactions among predictor variables. It can be linked with GIS data and software to map estimated probability of occurrence across landscapes. The data on calicioids from the Cascades, supplemented with additional stand inventories, were used to test and demonstrate the modeling method...|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the forest}} the trail passes through is regrowth. The {{original}} woodlands were cleared {{to make room for}} farms in the early 18th century. Old stone walls and crumbling cellar holes are common evidence of the region's agrarian past. When farming interests moved west in the 19th century, the land reverted to forest. Much of these new forests were in turn successively re-harvested for building materials or firewood3. Forests along the trail are in various stages of re-growth, where they have not been cleared {{to make room for the}} ever-increasing suburban development. Notable old growth stands (such as the one on Mount Wachusett—which became a magnet for heated controversy after a 2003 court ruling allowing a ski area expansion under state lease; see (#Protecting the trail corridor below)) are rare on the trail route. Douglas State Forest, near the southern end of the trail, supports an original Atlantic white cedar swamp, although the trees are not considered old growth cedars. Forest ecology types include the oak-hickory forest at lower elevations and the northern hardwood forestat higher elevations. Common species include American beech and yellow birch at higher elevations and on north facing slopes. Eastern hemlock is common in damp, shaded ravines. Red, white, and black oak, sugar maple, and ash are prolific throughout, including frequent very old individual specimens often called <b>wolf</b> <b>trees.</b> Solid stands of eastern white pine are common while pitch pine can be found scattered on dry ledges. Monoculture tree plantations of both native and non-native species can be found along the trail as well. The forest understory supports mountain laurel, witch-hazel, wintergreen, hobblebush, partridgeberry, as well as a variety of herbs, ferns and mosses. Multiflora rose, oriental bittersweet, purple loosestrife, and phragmites are well-established invasive species along the trail. Abandoned farms and currently functional farms, hay fields, pastures, and orchards are also apparent landscape features on the trail.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test whether behaviorally {{mediated}} effects of gray wolf (Canis lupus) presence were visible in terms of browsing intensity by moose (Alces alces) on tree saplings in recently planted clear-cut areas in Sweden. The study involved two different spatial scales; the clear-cut scale and tree scale. At the clear-cut scale the influence of <b>wolf</b> predation risk, <b>tree</b> density and tree height on moose browsing intensity was evaluated. At the individual tree scale, the factor distance to the nearest forest edge was also included. Browsing intensity was measured as apical shoot browsing and lateral shoot browsing in 24 different recently planted clear-cuts. Due to differences in preference between tree species and qualitative differences between plant parts, the same analyses were conducted for the five main tree species and for apical and lateral shoot browsing separately. Based on pellet group counts, moose is most likely the main browser in this study. Further, I found that both tree density and tree height were lower in the wolf core areas, suggesting multicollinearity between <b>wolf</b> utilization, <b>tree</b> density and tree height at the clear-cut scale, the effect of these factors could not be separated in the multivariate models. At the clear-cut scale browsing intensity decreased with tree density. At the <b>tree</b> scale, although <b>wolf</b> utilization was an important factor explaining the variation in browsing intensity, the browsing probability decreased with tree height. Overall, this suggests that moose foraging and thus its browsing intensity was more influenced by tree density and tree height than predation risk by wolves. It also seemed that moose browse through a clear-cut area irrespectively of distance to the closest forest edge...|$|R

50|$|In 1992, an {{examination}} of the mtDNA of 26 grey wolf populations worldwide revealed that the Italian wolf has a unique mitochondrial haplotype not shared by any other grey wolf population. Further tests on grey wolf mtDNA revealed that, unlike several European grey wolf populations, Italian wolves do not share haplotypes with either other grey wolves or domestic dogs. In 2010, a study compared the mitochondrial DNA haplotypes of 24 ancient wolf specimens from western Europe dated between 44,000-1,200 YBP with those of modern gray <b>wolves.</b> The phylogenetic <b>tree</b> indicated that the haplotypes represented two haplogroups that were separated by 5 mutational steps. The ancient wolf samples from western Europe all belonged to haplogroup 2, indicating haplogroup 2 predominance in this region for over 40,000 years before and after the Last Glacial Maximum. A comparison of current and past frequencies indicated that in Europe haplogroup 2 became outnumbered by haplogroup 1 over the past several thousand years but in North America haplogroup 2 became extinct and was replaced by haplogroup 1 after the Last Glacial Maximum. The Italian wolf is the only remaining grey wolf subspecies to still possess this haplotype since the extinction of the Honshu wolf.|$|R
50|$|Urban forests bring many {{environmental}} and economic benefits to cities. Among these are energy benefits {{in the form of}} reduced air conditioning by shading buildings, homes and roads, absorbing sunlight, reducing ultraviolet light, cooling the air, and reducing wind speed - in short improvement of the microclimate and air quality (McPherson 1994; McPherson & Rowntree 1993; Simpson & McPherson 1996; Coder 1996; Wolfe 1999; Hastie 2003; Lohr et al. 2004). There are also economic benefits associated with urban trees such as increased land, property, and rental value (Morales et al. 1983; Anderson & Cordell 1988; Wolf 1998; Dwyer et al. 1992; Mansfield et al. 2005; Orland et al. 1992; Hastie 2003; USDA Forest Service 2003, 2004). Well-maintained trees and landscaped business districts have been shown to encourage consumer purchases and attract increased residential, commercial and public investments (<b>Wolf</b> 2004, 2007). <b>Trees</b> located in business areas may also increase worker productivity, recruitment, retention and satisfaction (Kaplan & Kaplan 1989; Kaplan 1992; Wolf 1998). Urban forests also improve air quality, absorb rainwater, improve biodiversity and potentially allow recycling to 20% of waste which is wood-based Many cities today are dealing with stormwater management system issues where their existing systems can no longer hold the volume of water that falls in storms. One sustainable solution to this is planting street trees with grates underneath them to hold water. Trees and their soils work to filter runoff pollution and soil contaminants by absorbing them and processing them into less harmful substances. They also collect water in their limbs and release it back into the atmosphere over time. This makes trees a solution to stormwater runoff issues and urban heating issues.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the hypothesis that}} spring migration in barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus) enhances access to high quality food, reduces predation risks or both. We related our findings to the hypothesis {{that one of the}} consequences of migration is that prey populations cannot be regulated by predation because predators are unable to respond numerically to changes in abundance of migratory prey. In the Northwest Territories, migration to calving grounds by pregnant cows reduced the risk of predation on neonates. Wolf (Canis lupus) densities on calving grounds averaged only 22 % of winter range densities because most <b>wolves</b> denned near <b>tree</b> line. The quality and quantity of food that was available to cows that migrated to calving grounds was lower than for bulls and other caribou that lagged far behind the pregnant cows during spring migration. Fecal nitrogen levels were higher in bulls than in cows in late May and early June but there were no differences in mid or late June. Areas occupied by bulls in late May had a greater biomass of live sedges than on the calving ground in early June. It appears that although food in July is abundant and nutritious, insect harassment prevents efficient feeding. Body fat reserves in both sexes declined to almost zero by mid-July, the lowest level of the year. Insect numbers declined in August and body fat levels increased to the highest level of the year by early September. Because the timing of caribou's return to the hunting ranges of <b>tree</b> line denning <b>wolves</b> was related to caribou density, our data were inconsistent with the suggested consequence of migration. Tree line denning by wolves and density-dependent changes in caribou migration suggests a mechanism for population regulation in caribou and wolves. We suggest that the process is as follows; when caribou numbers increase, some density-dependent factor causes range expansion in August (e. g., competition for food) causing caribou to return earlier to the hunting ranges of <b>tree</b> line denning <b>wolves,</b> more denning wolves have access to caribou, wolf pup survival increases and wolf numbers increase. The effect on caribou population growth will depend on the timing and magnitude of the wolf numerical response...|$|R
