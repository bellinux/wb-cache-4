25|$|Distillation removes all {{minerals}} from water, and {{the membrane}} methods of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most to all minerals. This results in demineralized water {{which is not}} considered ideal drinking water. The World Health Organization has investigated {{the health effects of}} demineralized water since 1980. Experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased diuresis and the elimination of electrolytes, with decreased blood serum potassium concentration. Magnesium, calcium, and other minerals in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Demineralized water may also increase the risk from toxic metals because it more readily leaches materials from piping like lead and cadmium, which is prevented by dissolved minerals such as calcium and magnesium. Low-mineral water has been implicated in specific cases of lead poisoning in infants, when lead from pipes leached at especially high rates into the water. Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10mg/L with 20–30mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20mg/L minimum and a 40–80mg/L optimum, and a total <b>water</b> <b>hardness</b> (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2 to 4mmol/L.

Contrast and brightness changed with starch source, but was not affected by other processing parameters such as screw configuration and steam injection. Image analysis alone cannot be {{used to describe the}} physical quality such as durability or hardness but it can help explain the process undergone during extrusion, which might explain in part about the physical quality. The study investigated the effect of starch sources, screw configuration, and steam injection on physical quality of extruded fish feed. Pellet durability, <b>water</b> stability and <b>hardness</b> were measured and analyzed. Four starch sources; pregelatinized potato starch, potato starch, whole wheat and wheat starch were used in the production of extruded fish feed. Three screw configuration types; polygon- 2 L, polygon-LR, and LRLR were used during production of feed. Similarly, steam injection and no steam injection in barrel were used for the production of the extruded fish feed. Contrast, brightness and entropy were used to analyze differences in color. Four diets; Pregelatinized potato starch, potato starch, whole wheat and wheat starch showed varied results. In general, potato starch diets gave the highest pellet durability, <b>hardness</b> and <b>water</b> stability than the wheat starch diets. Pregelatinized potato gave highest pellet durability and <b>water</b> stability. <b>Hardness</b> (length, width and breaking force) was also higher for pregelatinized potato starch. Potato starch gave the highest hardness. Screw configuration LRLR gave the highest pellet durability and Polygon-LR had the lowest. Screw configuration Polygon- 2 L and LRLR gave higher breaking force than Polygon-LR. There was no difference in the effect of screw configuration on length and diameter. No steam injection in the barrel gave a higher pellet durability and water stability. Steam pressure did not affect length, diameter and breaking force of the pellet. Wheat diets gave brighter pellets than the potato starch diet, indicating that extent of maillard and caremelization differed for different diet compositions. Screw configuration and steam pressure did not show significant effect on contrast and entropy of the picture. Whole wheat gave lowest contrast and highest entropy. Wheat starch gave highest contrast and lowest entropy. Overall results indicated that starch source and processing parameters affected physical quality of pellets.
