His specialty is ekiben, where the couple has sex with the man standing while the woman <b>wraps</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> around his neck.

It was no time for him to think of truth, nor of the honest duties he had left behind him, as they swam together into the unknown. And of the end I can only guess and dream. Did there come a sudden horror upon him at the last, a sudden perception of infinite error, and was he drawn down, swiftly and terribly, a bubbling repentance, into those unknown deeps?

As they radio for help for Blanche, Jane realizes what is happening and walks into the sea, seemingly to kill herself, but is dragged out by a police officer.

Overhearing Ian’s conversation and reconciliation with Melissa, DiLaurentis chose to escape through the balcony, but not before stealing some files from Ian’s computer. Besides a video of her, she discovered a video labeled “Jenna & Toby.” “There's nothing wrong with us,” Jenna says in the video as she <b>wraps</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> around Toby. “We’re not even related.” Before her disappearance DiLaurentis and Ian met up at the [...] "Kissing Rock" [...] in which she said, after hooking up with Ian, “This is just me killing time while I’m waiting for something better to come along … You and Melissa deserve each other.

5000|$|Laura and Psylocke {{became quite}} {{friendly}} {{with each other}} on their first meeting in Uncanny X-Men #456, shortly after Psylocke came back to life. Both girls seemed to share an enjoyment in fighting. In one instance, Laura was knocked out while Psylocke continued, upon awakening Laura saw all the enemies had disappeared and when she asked Psylocke what happened, Betsy joked that she ate them, to which Laura replied it was cool. Another shared moment was when Betsy and Laura discussed her coming back to life, which Laura didn't see as unique since she herself had died repeatedly when she was experimented on to test her healing factor, but she always [...] "got better". When Psylocke asked how that made her feel, Laura smiled and said she killed them, and they didn't get better. Betsy then smiled and <b>wrapped</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> around Laura's shoulder, saying she had some very definite possibilities. There have also been images of Laura imitating Betsy, including braiding her hair and mimicking her poses.|$|R
60|$|Her head bowed. She sank against him, trembling. Her hands clung {{tightly to}} his. Lane divined {{something}} of her agitation from {{the feel of}} her slender form.

50|$|In 1905 she ascended on a trapeze slung below a {{hot-air balloon}} to {{a height of}} two to four-thousand feet before {{descending}} on a parachute. On one occasion both the balloon and the parachute malfunctioned, and she found herself rising to 15,000 feet. At this height, both the cold and lack of oxygen were threatening to make her lose her grip and fall to her death. Fortunately, the balloon returned to earth {{before it was too}} late. She was not so lucky on a later occasion when she ascended with another girl. The other girl’s parachute would not release, so she had to <b>wrap</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and legs around Dolly so that they could descend on the one parachute. The descent was of course much too fast, and Dolly was paralysed for several weeks. She nevertheless returned to her act and first flew again at Ashby-de-la-Zouch. Edith Maud Cook died from injuries sustained following a jump from a balloon at Coventry on 9 July 1910 when her parachute collapsed after a gust of wind blew her on to a factory roof. Dolly had been due to make the jump at Coventry but Cook had taken her place.|$|R

500|$|When Madonna {{was five}} years old, in 1963, her mother, Madonna Ciccone, {{died of breast cancer}} at the age of30. Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's {{behavior}} and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons. Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by <b>wrapping</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> around <b>her</b> mother tenderly.

5000|$|Anaconda freed {{herself and}} her {{teammates}} from their underwater captivity using her brute strength, and they were sent on another mission—this time, {{to search for a}} powerful weapon known as the Micro-Scanner. After battling Iron Man, Anaconda and the others were defeated and presumably taken to prison. They somehow escaped, and sought out Sidewinder for payment from their first mission together. He gave them their share of the money, plus more, inviting them to join his new criminal organization, the Serpent Society. [...] Anaconda hesitantly accepted the offer. At the orientation, Sidewinder grouped Anaconda together with Cobra and the Rattler to perform an initiation test. Their job was to steal equipment from the bankrupt Brand Corporation. Constrictor, annoyed with the whole idea of the Serpent Society, spied on Anaconda's group and called the Avengers hotline to tip them off. Captain America showed up just as Anaconda and the others were pulling their heist, and Anaconda ordered Cobra and Rattler to return to Sidewinder with the apparatus. During an intense battle with the Avenger, Anaconda was able to <b>wrap</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> around Captain America. She started to crush his bones, but one well-placed hit of his shield knocked her out, and she was taken to jail.|$|R

50|$|While the Pe-2's flying {{characteristics}} were generally favorable {{once it was}} airborne, it took {{a good amount of}} force to pull the elevators up to rotate the plane for takeoff. Russian night bombing missions often flew with female pilots and some of the women were not strong enough to get the airplane airborne by themselves. When such a situation occurred, the procedure was to have the navigator get behind the pilot's seat and <b>wrap</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> around the control wheel and help the pilot pull the wheel back. Once the aircraft was airborne, the navigator returned to her duties and the pilot continued to fly the plane without assistance.Its armament was clearly insufficient, however. The dorsal ShKAS machine gun had a very high rate of fire; however, its 7.62 mm rounds proved inadequate against the armor protection of modern fighters as the war progressed. In addition, it often jammed. The mounting for the ventral Berezin UB had a very limited field of view and the gun was initially unreliable. To give more protection, another ShKAS was added that could be moved between sockets {{on both sides of the}} fuselage and, in an emergency, the gunner could fire upwards, but in this case they had to be quite strong to keep it in their arms. To improve the bomber's defences, a dorsal Berezin UBT 12,7 mm was mounted. This modification was reported to increase the life expectancy of a Pe-2 from 20 sorties to 54.|$|R
