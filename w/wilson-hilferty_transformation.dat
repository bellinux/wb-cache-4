40|$|To {{transform}} the F distribution {{to a normal}} distribution, two types of formula for power transformation of the F variable are introduced. One formula {{is an extension of}} the <b>Wilson-Hilferty</b> <b>transformation</b> for the chi 2 variable, and the other type is based on the median of the F distribution. Combining those two formulas, a simple formula for the median of the F distribution is derived, and its numerical accuracy is evaluated. Simplification of the formula of the <b>Wilson-Hilferty</b> <b>transformation,</b> through the median formula, leads us to construct a power normal family from the generalized F distribution. Unlike the Box-Cox power normal family, our family has a property that the covariance structure of the maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters is invariant under a scale transformation of the response variable. Numerical examples are given to show the diff erence between two power normal families. ...|$|E

The method {{is based on}} the <b>Wilson-Hilferty</b> <b>transformation</b> and an improvement on the rejection technique.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to give an {{algorithm}} to attain joint normality of non-normal multivariate observations through a new power normal family introduced by the author (Isogai, 1999). The algorithm tries to transform each marginal variable simultaneously to joint normality, but due to a large number of parameters it repeats a maximization process with respect to the conditional normal density of one transformed variable given the other transformed variables. A non-normal data set is used to examine performance of the algorithm, and the degree of achievement of joint normality is evaluated by measures of multivariate skewness and kurtosis. Besides the above topic, making use of properties of our power normal family, we discuss not only a normal approximation formula of non-central F distributions in the frame of regression analysis but also some decomposition formulas of a power parameter, which appear in a <b>Wilson-Hilferty</b> power <b>transformation</b> setting. Power normal family, non-normality, joint normality, measures of multivariate skewness and kurtosis,...|$|R
40|$|Random {{variables}} {{which are}} positive linear combinations of positive {{independent random variables}} can have heavily right-skewed finite sample distributions even though they might be asymptotically normally distributed. We provide a simple method of determining an appropriate power transformation to improve the normal approximation in small samples. Our method contains the <b>Wilson-Hilferty</b> cube root <b>transformation</b> for "χ"-super- 2 random variables as a special case. We also provide some important examples, including test statistics of goodness-of-fit and tail index estimators, where such power transformations can be applied. In particular, we study the small sample behaviour of two goodness-of-fit tests for time series models which have been proposed recently in the literature. Both tests are generalizations of the popular Box-Ljung-Pierce portmanteau test, one in the time domain {{and the other in}} the frequency domain. A power transformation with a finite sample mean and variance correction is proposed, which ameliorates the small sample effect. It is found that the corrected versions of the tests have markedly better size properties. The correction is also found to result in an overall increase in power which can be significant under certain alternatives. Furthermore, the corrected tests also have better power than the Box-Ljung-Pierce portmanteau test, unlike the uncorrected versions. Copyright 2004 Royal Statistical Society. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a stochastic procedure for generating evapotranspiration. The procedure consists of two steps: the sequence of four different types of day in relation to rainfall occurrence is obtained by a two-state, first-order Markov chain model; and the daily potential evapotranspiration is generated {{for each type of}} day by employing a simple autoregressive model. The <b>Wilson-Hilferty</b> <b>transformation</b> is used to incorporate asymmetry in the model. Comparing the historical and synthetic series in four meteorological stations in Greece by means of the main statistical parameters, such as the arithmetic mean, standard deviation, skewness coefficient and dimensionless maximum and minimum values, the proposed procedure proved satisfactory. © 1988...|$|E
40|$|Redshift-space {{distortion}} (RSD) {{observed in}} galaxy redshift surveys {{is a powerful}} tool to test gravity theories on cosmological scales, but the systematic uncertainties must carefully be examined for future surveys with large statistics. Here we employ various analytic models of RSD and estimate the systematic errors on measurements of the structure growth-rate parameter, fσ 8, induced by non-linear effects and the halo bias {{with respect to the}} dark matter distribution, by using halo catalogues from 40 realizations of 3. 4 × 10 [8] comoving h[− 3] Mpc[3] cosmological N-body simulations. We consider hypothetical redshift surveys at redshifts z = 0. 5, 1. 35 and 2, and different minimum halo mass thresholds in the range of 5. 0 × 10 [11]– 2. 0 × 10 [13][*]h[− 1][*]M⊙. We find that the systematic error of fσ 8 is greatly reduced to ∼ 5 [*]per[*]cent level, when a recently proposed analytical formula of RSD that takes into account the higher order coupling between the density and velocity fields is adopted, with a scale-dependent parametric bias model. Dependence of the systematic error on the halo mass, the redshift and the maximum wavenumber used in the analysis is discussed. We also find that the <b>Wilson–Hilferty</b> <b>transformation</b> is useful to improve the accuracy of likelihood analysis when {{only a small number of}} modes are available in power spectrum measurements...|$|E
