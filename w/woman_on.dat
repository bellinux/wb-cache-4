5|$|Argento {{reportedly}} {{offered the}} lead role of Peter Neal to Christopher Walken, but eventually it went to Anthony Franciosa. Kim Newman felt that Franciosa's casting was fortunate, as {{he was capable of}} bringing more to the role than the script asked of him. He also believed that if Walken had been cast, it would have been more obvious that he was the killer. According to Jones and Daria Nicolodi, the relationship between Franciosa and Argento was a fractious one. In addition, Nicolodi and Argento were romantically involved at the time, but their relationship had suffered over a disputed story credit during the filming of Suspiria. Nicolodi therefore only agreed to a brief appearance in Tenebrae. By her own account, she originally asked for the small role of Jane McKerrowwhich ultimately went to Veronica Lario. Nicolodi was, according to Alan Jones, cast as the <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> the beach in Neal's flashback. Conversely, Thomas Rostock opines that Nicolodi was never intended for that role, only that of Jane. Transgender actress Eva Robin's was later hired to play the <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> the beach.|$|E

40|$|This Bachelors’ thesis compares {{theoretical}} {{arguments for}} <b>women</b> <b>on</b> boards and in management with practitioners’ argumentations for <b>women</b> <b>on</b> boards. By analyzing 32 {{responses to the}} EU Commission public consultation for <b>women</b> <b>on</b> boards with argument analysis, the study assesses how theoretical models fit the debate in society. The analysis shows that the arguments go ‘outside the theoretical box’ when discussing women’s participation in the labour market. The theoretical models {{does not include the}} effect of the actors’ willingness not only to argue, but to act, in their framework on how to increase the share of <b>women</b> <b>on</b> boards. The thesis therefore concludes that the theoretical frameworks tested need to include perspectives from other areas in order to fully encompass the debate <b>on</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> boards...|$|R

5|$|Although {{best known}} as Night of January 16th, the play's title changed {{multiple}} times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was Penthouse Legend. When Clive picked up the play, he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. The play was called The Verdict during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title <b>Woman</b> <b>on</b> Trial. When Woods took the play to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between The Black Sedan and Night of January 16th. Rand liked neither, but picked the latter. Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not implement them. Prior to the opening, he considered renaming the play The Night is Young. After the play opened, he considered changing its name each day to match the current date.|$|E
