5|$|According to the Augustan History, Odaenathus {{was assassinated}} by a cousin named Maeonius. In Augustan History, Odaenathus' son {{from his first}} wife was named Herodes and was crowned co-ruler by his father. The Augustan History claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a time {{because she did not}} accept her stepson as his father's heir (ahead of her own children). The Augustan History does not suggest that Zenobia <b>was</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> events leading to her husband's murder, and the crime is {{attributed}} to Maeonius' moral degeneration and jealousy. This account, according to historian Alaric Watson, can be dismissed as fictional. Although some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia <b>was</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> assassination due to political ambition and opposition to her husband's pro-Roman policy, she continued Odaenathus' policies during her first years on the throne.|$|E

40|$|Our {{work has}} {{suggested}} that a high-frequency event <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initiation phase of malignant transformation in vitro; a later, mutationlike event appears to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later stages of transformation. There may be no specific "target gene" which directly interacts with carcinogens. It is hypothesized that nonspecific types of DNA damage <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> induction of an ongoing process we know as carcinogenesis. Several genes could <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> maintaining this process. Our recent results suggest that c-myc and c-fos could <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early stages of carcinogenesis, as they are affected by anticarcinogenic protease inhibitors {{in a manner that}} corresponds to <b>the</b> way <b>in</b> which protease inhibitors suppress malignant transformation...|$|R
