25|$|After {{leaving the}} presidency, Jefferson {{continued}} to be active in public affairs. He also became increasingly concerned with founding a new institution of higher learning, specifically one free of church influences, where students could specialize in many new areas not offered at other universities. Jefferson believed educating people <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to establish an organized society, and also felt schools should {{be paid for by}} the general public, so less wealthy people could obtain student membership as well. A letter to Joseph Priestley, in January, 1800, indicated that he had been planning the University for decades before its establishment.|$|E

He stated the soldier next to him while the crew were pinned down was the first to text him on Christmas Day with the first three or four people to ring him Christmas Day also all people he was with in during that incident, reflecting a relief at survival Some of the soldiers he had been deployed with came to see him in the Christmas pantomime season at the end of 2007, stating that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to relax after what they had been through.|$|E
25|$|A {{malthouse}} is {{a building}} in which brewers create malt by starting the germination process of barley or other grains. The malt is then used as a key ingredient {{in the making of}} beer, ale and malt liquor. This malthouse was one of several attempted commercial ventures undertaken by Sir William Keith during his term as governor of Colonial Pennsylvania. His other businesses included a copper mine located west of the Susquehanna River in disputed territory and a foundry on the Christiana River near New Castle, Delaware. The malthouse was constructed during a time of financial complications between Great Britain and her American colonies. Trade was slowed tremendously and supplies of grain were rotting on the idled ships in the colonial ports in cities like Philadelphia. Keith took advantage of the need to have the grain processed and malting the grain <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to preserve it for a time.|$|E

Dick Cook, then-chairman of Walt Disney Studio Entertainment, also mentioned that the simultaneous release <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to distinguish themselves during the competitive holiday season.|$|E

500|$|Eno {{directed}} the musicians by using body language and dancing, {{as well as}} through verbal suggestion, to influence their playing and the sounds they would emit. He felt at the time that this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to communicate with musicians. The album credits Eno with instruments such as [...] "snake guitar", [...] "simplistic piano" [...] and [...] "electric larynx". These terms were used to describe the sound's character or the means of production used to treat the instruments. After recording the individual tracks, Eno condensed and mixed the instrumentation deeply, resulting in some of the tracks bearing little resemblance to what the musicians recorded during the session.|$|E
500|$|... "Lisa's First Word" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Martin, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. The Simpsons writers Mike Reiss and Al Jean were discussing about having an episode where Maggie would say her first word, and Reiss {{thought it would be}} cute to have her say [...] "daddy" [...] when no one could hear her. Jeff Martin was assigned to write the episode because he had done another flashback episode in the past, [...] "I Married Marge". Martin was excited to do another flashback episode because he thought it was fun to check out old newspapers and go back and see what was in the news back in 1983 and 1984. Martin felt it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> of finding a new set of things to make jokes about.|$|E
500|$|Hiscock felt a gay penguin {{marriage}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> {{to connect}} Leslie's character and profession to the issue, since a zoo {{would be part}} of the parks department. He said, [...] "It seemed like a funny starting place: a cute zoo promotion that spins out of control." [...] Although the storyline is comedic through its use of penguins in the same-sex marriage, commentators inferred the episode nevertheless takes a position in favor of same-sex marriage. Hiscock said in writing the script, he did not intend to make a strong political or social message, and that the staff was more focused on comedy and developing the Leslie Knope character. However, Hiscock said, [...] "What I like is that Leslie doesn't back down from her zoo promotion idea and refuses to annul the wedding. In a weird way she takes a stance." ...|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said the}} episode was [...] "completely {{satisfying}} - funny when {{it needed to}} be, sweet when it wanted to be". Sepinwall said Jones was particularly funny during the fake date, {{as well as the}} [...] "constant one-upsmanship" [...] between Ron and Tom. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had a [...] "winning formula". He particularly praised Jones during the practice date, as well as Jerry's role during the contest, which Fowler said <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to allow the supporting cast to work together. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said it seemed like the episode [...] "took everything they were warming up to over the last few weeks, and hit them hard". Heisler particularly praised Poehler's performance, as well as the interactions between Ron and Tom. In contrast, however, A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said [...] "Practice Date" [...] "was the first time all year I felt like P wasn't firing on all cylinders".|$|E
500|$|Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel {{grew up in}} the 1940s and 1950s in the {{predominantly}} Jewish neighborhood of Forest Hills in Queens, New York, just three blocks away from one another, and attended the same schools, Public School 164 in Flushing, Parsons Junior High School, and Forest Hills High School. Individually, when still young, they developed a fascination with music; both listened to the radio and were taken with rock and roll as it emerged, particularly the Everly Brothers. When Simon first noticed Garfunkel, he was singing in a fourth grade talent show, and Simon thought that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to attract girls; he hoped for a friendship which eventually started in 1953 when they were in the sixth grade and appeared on stage together in a school play adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. That first stage appearance was followed by the duo forming a street-corner doo-wop group, the Peptones, with three other friends, and learning to harmonize together. [...] They began performing {{for the first time as}} a duo at school dances.|$|E
500|$|Writing for {{entertainment}} news website Digital Spy, Daniel Kilkelly said Peggy's final episode featured [...] "plenty of poignant moments —not least the scene which saw Peggy {{standing in the}} destroyed Queen Vic and appearing completely devastated." [...] Gareth McLean from The Guardian said the use of [...] "Peggy's Theme" [...] was a [...] "suitably sentimental sendoff" [...] for the character, but said that [...] "in hindsight, Peggy should have left Walford {{three or four years}} ago, her character trapped in a cycle of increasingly samey stories that reduced her to a parody of her former self", describing her efforts to put out the flames as [...] "like a very sooty clockwork mouse". James McCarthy of Welsh newspaper Western Mail said Windsor's [...] "final emotional scene will doubtless remain the stuff of EastEnders legend for years to come," [...] and Jim Shelley from the Daily Mirror said [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to go." [...] However, Shelley's colleague Polly Hudson said Peggy's exit was a [...] "non event", as [...] "Peggy just left, nonsensically and at complete odds with everything we've learnt about her character over the last 15 years." ...|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club writer Steve Heisler {{said the}} episode was [...] "just {{about as good}} as it gets", with several great moments {{revolving}} around Nick Offerman's deadpan comedic delivery. Heisler also said making the police department part of the script <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to better flesh out Pawnee and its townspeople. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell praised the performances of Offerman and Aubrey Plaza, and referred to Tammy as Pawnee's equivalent of Sideshow Bob in The Simpsons Springfield. Kandell also liked that the episode [...] "had heart" [...] because the Tammy subplot was resolved by Ron standing up for Tom. TV Squad writer Joel Keller said the episode did not reach the level of the original [...] "Ron and Tammy", but that [...] "it still had more than enough funny, cringeworthy and downright gross moments to be very satisfying". He declared Mullally [...] "one of the best sitcom creations this side of Colonel Flagg on M*A*S*H". The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow praised Ron Swanson as the show's [...] "breakout character", and said [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two" [...] was so good that he hoped for another sequel episode in the next season.|$|E
500|$|... "Camping" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with several}} commentators praising {{the performance of}} Rashida Jones and the new comedic direction her character was taking. Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com praised how the script featured the entire ensemble cast together, rather than in separate subplots like recent episodes. He also enjoyed the developments with Ann's character, claiming it gave Jones more opportunities to shine than past episodes. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said she particularly enjoyed the jokes involving Jerry's character, and said she enjoyed that Ann once again misinterpreted Chris, although she said the joke was predictable. Zap2it writer Rick Porter said the episode was not as funny as the previous episode, [...] "Harvest Festival", but said [...] "if this is what qualifies as a (slightly) down episode for the show, then that's {{the sign of a}} comedy that's hitting for a very high average". He particularly praised the [...] "fantastic dynamic" [...] that has developed between Rashida Jones and Rob Lowe. TV Squad writer Joel Keller said the camping trip <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to avoid making the show feel stale following [...] "Harvest Festival", and that the outdoors setting created strong potential for character-driven jokes by putting them out of their elements.|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller of TV Squad {{said the}} cast {{did a good}} job of playing drunk without being overly exaggerated. He also {{believed}} Ann's part-time job <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to integrate her into the case, as she had [...] "seemed adrift this season". Zap2it writer Rick Porter felt the episode was [...] "a little light on plot" [...] but included many funny scenes, particularly Andy and April's role-playing, and Ron's chipper attitude the morning after the bar visit, while everyone else remained hungover. Porter also praised Rashida Jones's performance during her hangover scenes. Matt Fowler of IGN said he enjoyed Tom's efforts to [...] "become a high-roller this season", and said Andy and April were fantastic during their role-playing scenes. Fowler also described Ron's defense of Tom's actions as [...] "heart-warming". He gave the episode a 9 out of 10. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic said he believed Ann's new part-time job would help better integrate her into the cast. McHatton said the sweet scenes between Leslie and Ben are [...] "quickly becoming my favorite scenes in the series", and said a shot of Ron dancing while drunk at the Snakehole Lounge was [...] "easily one of the funniest things he’s done yet".|$|E

He {{felt that the}} Mad Hatter mission was [...] "the weakest link in the chain," [...] calling it [...] "a neat concept but it's so {{fleeting}} that I {{barely had time to}} digest it." [...] For Killer Croc's, Carter said the mission was [...] "a predictable storyline" [...] since Killer Croc is generally portrayed as a [...] "one-dimensional" [...] foe, though [...] "t works better than Mad Hatter's portion... because most of it isn't [...] re-used environments, and there is a nice brief reunion with Nightwing." [...] Speaking of the Mister Freeze mission, Carter called the exploration of Freeze's relationship with his wife Nora [...] "compelling" [...] and enjoyed the fact it was the only [...] "Season of Infamy" [...] mission to feature a predator challenge. Additionally, he added that the Batmobile sequence had [...] "more of a reason to exist than most of the ones in the campaign." [...] Finally, Carter called the Ra's al Ghul mission [...] "the other highlight of the pack" [...] and felt the choice the mission gave players at the end was [...] "pretty interesting". He also added the setting of Elliot General Hospital <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to highlight Hush's family legacy since his [...] "part in [...] was extremely disappointing".|$|E
500|$|A {{decade after}} her {{marriage}} to Cole, Victoria marries Brad Carlton (Don Diamont); their marriage ends after Brad has an affair. She then becomes pregnant with J.T. Hellstrom's (Thad Luckinbill) child and during her pregnancy becomes comatose. Heinle believed Victoria and J.T. would [...] "stay together {{for a while before}} they wreck it". After it was announced that Luckinbill was leaving the soap opera, Victoria and J.T. drift apart and eventually divorce. Victoria next begins a relationship with Billy Abbott that their feuding families are against; Heinle described Billy as [...] "the forbidden fruit" [...] and compared their romance to Romeo and Juliet. They later marry in a 1950s-styled screen wedding; her wedding dress was inspired by a gown worn by Audrey Hepburn in the film Funny Face. Actress Elinor Donahue was cast to portray the judge that officiates their wedding, as former co-head writer Scott Hamner felt that Donahue could help them achieve the sense of a [...] "retro-fantasy of better, simpler times". After their wedding, Billy illegally purchases a baby girl for Victoria. Heinle felt this plot <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to conflict drama to the soap opera. The couple lose custody of the child, Billy leaves Genoa City and Victoria divorces him, but her father hides Billy from his family. The pair are later reunited in a New York airport bar. Hamner noted that Victoria would be [...] "absolutely furious" [...] at her father for what he had done: [...] " [...] potential for a huge rift between father and daughter, and there will be some consequences for Victor with his relationship with Victoria in light of all that he's done to keep her apart from the man she loves." [...] He also stated that the [...] "impact of those secrets coming to light was going to be very serious in Billy and Victoria's ability to move forward together".|$|E
