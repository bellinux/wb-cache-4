25|$|The poodle is an active, {{intelligent}} and elegant dog, squarely built, and <b>well</b> <b>proportioned.</b> To ensure the desirable squarely built appearance, {{the length of}} body measured from the breastbone {{to the point of}} the rump approximates the height from the highest point of the shoulders to the ground. The eyes should be very dark, oval in shape, and have an alert and intelligent expression. The ears should fold over close to the head, set at, or slightly below, eye level. The coat should be of naturally curly texture, dense throughout, although most AKC-registered show dogs have a lion-cut or other, similarly shaven look. The sizes of the official AKC-recognized Poodle breeds are determined by height, not by weight.|$|E
25|$|The English Springer Spaniel is a {{medium-sized}} compact dog. Its coat is moderately long with feathering on {{the legs and}} tail. It is a <b>well</b> <b>proportioned,</b> balanced dog with a gentle expression and a friendly wagging tail. This breed represents perhaps the greatest divergence between working and show lines of any breed of dog. A field-bred dog and a show-bred dog appear to be different breeds, but are registered together. In fact, the gene pools are almost completely segregated and have been for at least 70 years. A field-bred dog would not be competitive in a modern dog show, while a show dog {{would not have the}} speed or stamina to succeed in a field trial.|$|E

500|$|Built between 1093 and 1490, Durham Cathedral, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the upper parts of its towers, the eastern extension known as the Chapel of Nine Altars, and the large west window of 1341, is entirely Norman and is regarded by Alec Clifton-Taylor as [...] "the incomparable masterpiece of Romanesque architecture". The interior is “overwhelmingly impressive”. The western Lady Chapel known as the Galilee Chapel is a unique Norman building different in style to the cathedral itself. The view of the cathedral from the south west is particularly famous because of its “incomparable setting” on a steep promontory above the River Wear. The Venerable C.J.

500|$|Bijay Mandal is a {{building}} with a layout plan of x dimensions, with a <b>well</b> <b>proportioned</b> square dome. It cannot be categorized as a tower or a palace. It is a typical Toghlaqi structure with an octagonal plan built in rubble masonry (with massive battered sloping walls on east, west and southern directions) on a raised platform with door ways in each cardinal direction. The purpose of this unusual [...] structure and {{the ruins of the}} Sar Dara Palace was described by [...] Ibn Battuta [...] as the palace with multiple chambers and the [...] large public audience hall as the famed Hazar Sutan Palace. It was also interpreted as serving as an observation tower to monitor the activities of his troops. The ambience of the place presented it as place to relax and enjoy the scenic view of the environs. The inclined path around the monument was a walkway leading to the apartments of the Sultan. Two large openings in the living rooms of the floor were inferred as leading to the vaults or the treasury. On the level platform, outside the building in front of the apartment rooms, small holes equally spaced are seen, which have been inferred to be holes used to fix wooden pillars to hold a temporary shamiana (pavilion) or cover. The process of ushering people into the presence of the Sultan was devious and formal involving entry through semipublic places to private chambers to the audience hall. The debate on whether the Hazara [...] Sutan Palace cited as existing during Allauddin Khalji reign and also during Togluq's time {{are one and the same}} palace, has not been conclusive. A plausible hypothesis is that the stone hall of the palace was built by Allauddin Khalji while the tower adjoining the stone buildings was surely built by Mohammed bin Toghluq.|$|E
500|$|The temple complex, as built, has a <b>well</b> <b>proportioned</b> {{and complex}} [...] "cruciform plan". Overall {{there are only}} nine shikharas (temple towers) {{arranged}} sequentially in an [...] "hierarchical scale". The central shikhara is the largest and is built above the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum), which has nine tiers topped by a decorated amalaka, which at present is seen separated from the shikhara (following the earthquake of 1905). The Thakurdwara has a huge door {{which leads to the}} garbhagriha which has elaborate carvings. The chambers which follow from the entry door are the antarala, mandapa and mukha mandapa ( [...] supported on huge pillars). The garbhagriha, in a square plan ( [...] each side), has an altar where the deities are deified. The approach to the entrance door of the temple (prominently decorated), is through a steep flight of steps. There is also a stairway {{on either side of the}} main temple which leads to the highest part of the shikhara (rises to a height of [...] above the floor of the inset) of the temple complex which provides scenic views all round, particularly of the Dhauladar Range. The intricate sculptural detailing on the doors, jambs, lintels, walls, shikharas, and column capitals on the main shrine and other smaller temples consist of figurines of gods and goddesses such as Shiva, Parvati, Laksmi and Saraswati, and floral designs. In particular, the temple was conceptualized as a tribute to Shiva. There are many lintels which depict scenes of festivals to celebrate the crowning of Shiva, not seen anywhere else in the country. The lintel on the garbagriha of the main shrine shows Shiva's coronation in a [...] "benign posture" [...] with eyes closed like Buddha. The same type of carving is also seen in the medallion on the shikhara. The lintel carvings also show many divinities including Shiva in the central portion flanked by his sons Ganesha and Kartikeya.|$|E

[...] Additional information such as how long she had been active as a prostitute, or if she sang, danced or conversed well, is also included. [...] Addresses and prices, which range from five shillings to five pounds, are provided. [...] The types of prostitute the lists present vary from [...] "low-born errant drabs", to prominent courtesans like Kitty Fisher and Fanny Murray; later editions contain only [...] "genteel mannered prostitutes worthy of praise". [...] The charms of a Mrs Dodd, who lived at number six Hind Court in Fleet Street, were listed in 1788 as [...] "reared on two pillars of monumental alabaster", continuing: [...] "the symmetry of its parts, its borders enriched with wavering tendrils, its ruby portals, and the tufted grove, that crowns the summit of the mount, all join to invite the guest to enter." [...] In the same edition, a similarly lurid description precedes the latter part of Miss Davenport's entry, which concludes: [...] "Her teeth are remarkably fine; she is tall, and so <b>well</b> <b>proportioned</b> (when you examine her whole naked figure, which she will permit you to do, if you perform the Cytherean Rites like an able priest) that she might be taken for a fourth Grace, or a breathing animated Venus de Medicis... she has a keeper (a Mr. Hannah) both kind and liberal; notwithstanding which, she has no objection to two supernumerary guineas." [...] Miss Clicamp, of number two York Street near Middlesex Hospital, is described as [...] "one of the finest, fattest figures as fully finished for fun and frolick as fertile fancy ever formed... fortunate for the true lovers of fat, should fate throw them into the possession of such full grown beauties."

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Figure  14, an {{increasing}} amount of green phosphor reduces the amount of blue emission because the blue rays are used to excite the green phosphor. The red-orange phosphor also absorbs the blue emission but it absorbs the green emission, as well. To increase red-orange emission intensity by keeping green emission intensity at the same level, red-orange phosphor concentration must be increased but green phosphor concentration must also be increased. This fact considerably decreases blue light output. The point is that this behavior could be simulated successfully, as {{can be seen}} from the comparison of the measured and simulated spectral emission characteristics of Figure  14. For this, here again, appropriate phosphor input photoluminescent data had to be provided for the simulation software. A similar fit between the simulated and experimental spectral emission curves was obtained for the other phosphor mixtures (G 1 /R 2, G 2 /R 1, G 2 /R 2) as <b>well.</b> <b>Proportions</b> among the peak blue, peak green and peak red-orange spectral radiant flux values agreed well between the simulations and the measurements across the different CCTs.|$|R
