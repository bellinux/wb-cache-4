5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E

25|$|Transduction {{involves}} chemical messages {{sent from}} the photoreceptors to the bipolar cells to the ganglion cells. Several photoreceptors may send their information to one ganglion cell. There {{are two types}} of ganglion cells: red/green and yellow/blue. These neuron cells constantly fire—even when not stimulated. The brain interprets different colors (and with a lot of information, an image) when the rate of firing of these neurons alters. Red light stimulates the red cone, which in turn stimulates the red/green ganglion cell. Likewise, green light stimulates the green cone, which stimulates the red/green ganglion cell and blue light stimulates the blue cone which stimulates the yellow/blue ganglion cell. The rate of firing of the ganglion cells is increased when it is signaled by one cone and decreased (inhibited) when it is signaled by the other cone. The first color {{in the name of the}} ganglion cell is the color that excites it and the second is the color that inhibits it. i.e.: A red cone would excite the red/green ganglion cell and the green cone would inhibit the red/green ganglion cell. This is an opponent process. If the rate of firing of a red/green ganglion cell is increased, the brain <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the light was red, if the rate was decreased, the brain <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the color of the light was green.|$|E

25|$|From this point, the English fielding {{began to}} go {{downhill}} in no uncertain fashion. Sheppard ran round and round a skier from Carmody and did not touch it and, from having the home men 50 for three, the Englishmen allowed them to get on top completely. This is the worst fielding I had seen from an M.C.C team. Bailey emulated Sheppard by running round and round a catch, and not touching it, and Brown seemed to despair of victory...Brown left Perth stating, in a most determined manner, that his fieldsmen <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they had had fielding practice before very long.|$|E
25|$|Maimonides and Nachmanides {{differed}} {{about the}} reason for the sacrificial system. Maimonides wrote that {{the reason for}} the offerings was because when the Israelites lived in Egypt and Chaldea, the Egyptians worshipped sheep and the Chaldeans worshipped demons in the form of goats. And people in India never slaughter cattle. Thus God commanded the Israelites to slaughter cattle, sheep, and goats to God, so that worshipers of the other lands <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> God required the very act that they considered to be the utmost sin, and through that act God would forgive Israel's sins. God thus intended to cure the people of the other nations of false beliefs, which Maimonides characterized as diseases of the soul, for diseases are healed by medicines that are antithetical to the diseases.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E

Silver believed that Dredd had become such a symbol of law and order to the citizens that news of his departure would provoke a crimewave.|$|E
500|$|On Tuesday 27 February 2007, Saprang led a 13-member {{delegation}} to Europe, {{on what was}} {{claimed to be a}} week-long trip to study safety and security measures at major European airports. [...] Many delegates and accompanying members shared the same surname, and the trip, which cost 7.2 million baht was attacked for [...] "squandering" [...] state funds for personal pleasure, disbursing unrealistic expenses, and inflating costs. [...] The travel agent along received a 500,000 baht commission fee for booking the trip. [...] Saprang denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was the victim of a smear campaign. [...] He also noted that [...] "If you knew my character, you <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> even if a relative joined the trip he should have realised that he should work hard."

500|$|In late 1942, with {{on-going}} Allied {{success in}} the North African Campaign, the thoughts of the military planners turned to the next target. British planners considered that an invasion of France from Britain could not take place until 1944, and the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, {{wanted to use the}} Allied forces from North Africa to attack Europe's [...] "soft underbelly". There were two possible targets for the Allies to attack. The first option was Sicily; control of the island would open the Mediterranean Sea to Allied shipping and allow the invasion of continental Europe through Italy. The second option was into Greece and the Balkans, to trap the German forces present between the British and American invaders and the Soviets. At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943 Allied planners agreed on the selection of Sicily – codenamed Operation Husky – and decided to undertake the invasion no later than July that year. There was concern among the Allied planners that Sicily was an obvious choice – Churchill is reputed to have said [...] "Everyone but a bloody fool <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it's Sicily" [...] – and that the build-up of resources for the invasion would be detected.|$|E

500|$|On 6 October 1955, Diệm {{announced}} the referendum {{would be held}} on 23 October. The election was open {{to men and women}} aged 18 or over, and the government arranged to have a polling station set up for every 1,000 registered voters. The poll was contested by Bảo Đại, who had spent much of his time in France and advocated a monarchy, and Diệm, who ran on a republican platform. According to historian Jessica Chapman, it was a choice between [...] "the country's obsolete emperor and its far-from-popular prime minister, Ngo Dinh Diem". In announcing the referendum, Diệm portrayed his decision as being motivated by a love of democracy and popular discontent with the rule of Bảo Đại. The prime minister cited a plethora of petitions from various social, religious, and political groups calling on him to stage a plebiscite to remove Bảo Đại, claiming he was motivated by these [...] "legitimate and democratic" [...] sentiments. Lansdale cautioned Diệm against electoral fraud, confident that Diệm would win a free election: [...] "While I'm away I don't want to suddenly read that you have won by 99.99%. I <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it's rigged then." [...] U.S. officials thought that a fair election would have seen Diệm poll between 60% and 70% of the vote.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of 23 February, Missouri and Wisconsin turned their big guns on Kuwait's Faylaka Island to support the US-led {{coalition}} ground offensive to free Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation forces. The two ships were to conduct a diversionary assault aimed at convincing the Iraqi forces arrayed along the shores of Faylaka Island that Coalition forces were preparing to launch an amphibious invasion. As part of this attack, Missouri and Wisconsin were directed to shell known Iraqi defensive positions on the island. Shortly after Missouri completed her shelling of Faylaka Island, Wisconsin, while still over the horizon (and thus out of visual range of the Iraqi forces) launched her RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to spot for her [...] guns. As Wisconsins drone approached Faylaka Island, the pilot of the drone was instructed to fly the vehicle low over Iraqi positions so that the soldiers <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they were once again being targeted by a battleship. Iraqi {{troops on the ground}} heard the Pioneer’s distinctive buzzing sound, and having witnessed the effects of Missouris artillery strike on their trench line, the Iraqi troops decided to signal their willingness to surrender by waving makeshift white flags, an action dutifully noted aboard Wisconsin. Amused at this sudden development, the men assigned to the drone’s aircrew called Wisconsins commanding officer, Captain David S. Bill III, and asked, [...] "Sir, they want to surrender, what should I do with them?" [...] This surrender to Wisconsins Pioneer has since {{become one of the most}} remembered moments of the Gulf War; the incident was also the first-ever surrender of enemy troops to an unmanned aircraft controlled by a ship. Wisconsin drone also carried out a number of reconnaissance missions on occupied Kuwait before the coalition's ground offensive.|$|E
