However, he remains concerned that Don Calogero will make a complete fool of both himself and the Salinas.

The Prince notices Tancredi and Angelica dancing happily together, oblivious to the other's desperation, ambition, and greed. As he watches, the Prince comes to realize and accept, if only for a moment, that whatever happiness the lovers feel is to be celebrated, no matter what.|$|E
