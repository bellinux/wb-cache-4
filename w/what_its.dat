5|$|Following Marsh, Ceratopsia has {{usually been}} {{classified}} as a suborder within the order Ornithischia. While ranked taxonomy has largely fallen out of favor among dinosaur paleontologists, some researchers have continued to employ such a classification, though sources have differed on <b>what</b> <b>its</b> rank should be.

5|$|A {{few days}} before the shooting, Vice President George H. W.

When the White House learned of the assassination attempt, however, Bush was over Texas aboard Air Force Two, which did not have secure voice communications, and his discussions with the White House were intercepted and given to the press. The vice president was notified in Fort Worth, Texas of the shooting within eight minutes, but relying on the initial reports that Reagan was unharmed his plane flew to Austin for a speech. After learning that the president was wounded, Air Force Two refueled in Austin before returning to Washington at <b>what</b> <b>its</b> pilot described as the fastest speed in the plane's history.|$|E

5|$|Little {{more was}} {{discovered}} about Venus until the 20thcentury. Its almost featureless disc gave no hint <b>what</b> <b>its</b> surface might be like, {{and it was}} only with the development of spectroscopic, radar and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed. The first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.|$|E

5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and <b>what</b> <b>its</b> maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E

In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought influence in China as the first step of <b>what</b> <b>its</b> government saw as the country's right to rule Asia, used the Mukden Incident as a pretext to launch an invasion of Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo.|$|E

5|$|The lineage {{and honors}} of the 20th Engineer Brigade {{date back to}} the American Civil War. First {{designated}} as the Battalion of Engineers on 3 August 1861, the battalion participated in 10 campaigns during the Civil War. Since that time, unit designations have changed many times as predecessors of the 20th Engineer Brigade have served in the Spanish–American War, the Philippine–American War, the Mexican Expedition, World War I and World War II. Though it was not officially designated as the 20th Engineer Brigade during all of these wars, the Brigade received campaign participation credit for all of these campaigns, and has numerous campaign streamers for <b>what</b> <b>its</b> previous incarnations did during these conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} central forces—those that {{increase}} linearly with distance, F = Cr, such as Hooke's law, and inverse-square forces, , such as Newton's law of universal gravitation and Coulomb's law—have {{a very unusual}} property. A particle moving under either type of force always returns to its starting place with its initial velocity, provided that it lacks sufficient energy to move out to infinity. In other words, {{the path of a}} bound particle is always closed and its motion repeats indefinitely, no matter <b>what</b> <b>its</b> initial position or velocity. As shown by Bertrand's theorem, this property is not true for other types of forces; in general, a particle will not return to its starting point with the same velocity.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} final {{contract}} with delle Croci was in 1516 whereas Cairano was definitively dead in 1517: if Cairano indeed worked on the monument, it can be deduced from the documents {{that he would not}} have had sufficient time to finish it completely within the period, and consequently a large part of it must have been done before this date. This means admitting Cairano's involvement prior to 1516, which is not attested in the documents. Indeed, the same contract of 1516 asserts that the work was incomplete when installed in the church; it is unknown <b>what</b> <b>its</b> condition was at the time; and the remains of Bernardino Martinengo were already housed in it from the previous year. The implication is that the progress on the monument may have been near completion, at least in the structure and architectural components. The incompleteness alluded to in the documents of 1516 likely refer to the decorative inserts of various types, including the bronzes definitively due to della Croci.|$|E

5|$|Selection {{for what}} {{eventually}} became the Italian Heavy Draft was begun in 1860 at the Deposito Cavalli Stalloni (military stud) of Ferrara, Italy. The breed was originally developed by crossing native stock with large Brabant horses. While the resulting horses were strong, {{they were not}} light or fast enough for the farm work required of them by the Italians. To make the breed lighter and faster, Percheron and Boulonnais blood were added. However, the resulting horse was still not exactly <b>what</b> <b>its</b> creators were looking for, and in the 19th century they added more Breton blood to the mix, bringing the breed to its current conformation and gaits. In 1926, a stud book was begun, and selection processes were developed to select horses for use in draft capacities. The breeding programs suffered during World War II, but a careful crossbreeding program with Ardennes, Percheron and Breton horses after the war brought the Italian Heavy Draft to its current state.|$|E
