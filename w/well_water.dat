5|$|Several {{recent studies}} attempt {{to examine the}} effects of chronic low-dose {{manganese}} overexposure on child development. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in <b>well</b> <b>water</b> and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.|$|E
5|$|William McEwan {{opened the}} Fountain Brewery in Fountainbridge, then a suburb on the {{outskirts}} of Edinburgh, in 1856, using £2,000 loaned by his mother and his uncle. The area and the brewery are named after the spring waters from the vicinity, which, in addition to its proximity to the Caledonian railway line and the Union Canal, determined the location of the brewery. McEwan had employed geologists to identify the prime location for a supply of <b>well</b> <b>water.</b> Beforehand, McEwan had engaged in industrial espionage at Bass and Allsopp's breweries in order to learn techniques and assay costs. After establishing a market share in the industrial regions of the Scottish lowlands, from the early 1860s McEwan built up a successful colonial export trade by exploiting his family's shipowning connections. It was during this time that McEwan's India Pale Ale, the beer that was the foundation for much of the company's reputation, was first labelled Export.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, the hotel's {{first floor}} held its {{reception}} rooms, parlors, dining rooms, library, and a lounge area called the Dutch kitchen. The library was adjacent to {{and north of}} the large dining room. The ballroom had classical fluted Ionic columns and Italian marble walls. Thomas Edison was honored there in 1909. The Dutch kitchen had decorations and furnishings from Holland and {{was based on a}} restaurant in Edam. It had rough adze-hewn timbers, a hipped ceiling, etchings from England, and European and American oil paintings. Much of the furniture was purchased from Law's former employer, home furnishings pioneer W. & J. Sloane. Art and decorations throughout the building were largely were sourced from markets in Europe and Asia, and included expensive paintings, bronzes, marble sculptures, rare books, and carved antique furniture. The hotel also had a Chinese tea room and a dark room for amateur photographers. The kitchen was kept clean (such that it was proposed to serve lunches in the kitchen). It was reported to be of elegant design, utilizing white tile and marble. The kitchen equipment was of white porcelain and aluminum, and included numerous glass-lined refrigerators. It sourced its milk, butter, eggs, and vegetables from Briarcliff Farms. The kitchen's trash was frozen to prevent odors before its eventual removal; the lodge also had an ice-producing plant that used sterilized <b>well</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of Lisle, Illinois, {{releases}} of trichloroethylene (TCE) had allegedly occurred on the Lockformer property beginning in 1968 and continuing for an undetermined period. The company used TCE {{in the past as}} a degreaser to clean metal parts. Contamination at the Lockformer site is presently under investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Illinois EPA. In 1992, Lockformer conducted soil sampling on their property and found TCE in the soil at levels as high as 680 parts per million (ppm). During the summer of 2000, a group of residents hired legal counsel, and on October 11, 2000, these residents had their private <b>well</b> <b>water</b> tested by a private environmental consultant. The group owned homes south of the Lockformer property in the suspected path of groundwater flow.

40|$|Perennial rhizomatous grasses are {{regarded}} as leading energy crops due to their environmental benefits and their suitability to regions with adverse conditions. In this paper, two different experiments were carried out in order to study the salinity (S) and water stress (WS) effects on biomass production in giant reed (Arundo donax L.). In Experiment 1, eight clones of giant reed were subjected to four salinity (S) and water stress (WS) treatments: (1) <b>well</b> <b>watered</b> with non-saline solution, (2) water stress with non-saline solution, (3) <b>well</b> <b>watered</b> with saline solution and 4) water stress with saline solution. In Experiment 2, five clones of giant reed were subjected to increasing S levels in two locations: University of Catania (UNICT-Italy) (1) <b>well</b> <b>watered</b> with non-saline solution and (2) <b>well</b> <b>watered</b> with mild saline solution; and University of Barcelona (UB-Spain) (3) <b>well</b> <b>watered</b> with non-saline solution and (4) <b>well</b> <b>watered</b> with severe saline solution. Photosynthetic and physiological parameters as well as biomass production were measured in these plants. According to our data, giant reed {{seems to be more}} tolerant to S than WS. Both stresses mainly affected stomatal closure to prevent dehydration of the plant, eventually decreasing the photosynthetic rate. The differential performance of the giant reed clones was ranked according to their tolerance to S and WS by using the Stress Susceptibility Index. 'Agrigento' was the most WS resistant clone and 'Martinensis' was the most S resistant. 'Martinensis' and 'Piccoplant' were found to be the most suitable clones for growing under both stress conditions. Moreover, 'Fondachello', 'Cefalú' and 'Licata' were the most resistant clones to increasing S levels...|$|R

Greenhouse experiments compared the growth of wheat and ryegrass in pure culture and mixtures in response to temporary and prolonged droughts. The main experiment was a replacement series with wheat:ryegrass ratios of 12 : 0, 9 : 3, 6 : 6, 3 : 9, and 0 : 12 in 19 1 pots. Controls were <b>well</b> <b>watered</b> for the 14 wk experiment. Plants exposed to drought were <b>well</b> <b>watered</b> for 8 wk, had no water for 2 wk, and then were <b>well</b> <b>watered</b> for 4 wk. Despite a much smaller seed than wheat and a similar time of emergence, control ryegrass produced by 14 wk after planting more above and below-ground growth than wheat in pure cultures. But, the greater seed size and height allowed wheat to be more competitive above-around in control mixtures than ryegrass. Wheat maintained a greater leaf expansion rate and area during drought than ryegrass. Drought and rewatering enhanced the growth of wheat relative to ryegrass in pure culture compared to controls. However, the ryegrass in mixtures regrew vigorously during 4 wk of rewatering and was equally competitive with wheat in almost all measures. Ryegrass was equally competitive with wheat for root growth in control and drought mixtures. There was no alleopathic interaction. A companion experiment used rhizotron columns to compare the interaction 7 wk after transplanting seedlings of wheat and ryegrass during continuous <b>well</b> <b>watering</b> and prolonged drought. Above-ground growth of wheat was greater in pure culture than the mixtures and greater in the <b>well</b> <b>watered</b> mixture than the drought mixture. The proportion of ryegrass to wheat as a percent total growth in these mixtures was greater in the drought than the <b>well</b> <b>watered</b> treatment. Thus, the competitiveness of ryegrass relative to wheat was greater in both the temporary drought of the main experiment and the prolonged drought of the companion experiment than in <b>well</b> <b>watered</b> conditions...|$|R
