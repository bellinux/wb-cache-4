The piece {{was in the}} form of a record store in which nothing but original pressings of the LP was on display. Chang created a recording in which the sounds of one hundred copies of side one of the LP were overlaid.|$|E

60|$|A {{correspondent}} {{has written}} me an able and interesting {{letter in the}} matter of some allusions of mine to the subject of communal kitchens. He defends communal kitchens very lucidly {{from the standpoint of the}} calculating collectivist; but, like many of his school, he cannot apparently grasp that there is another test of the whole matter, with which such calculation has nothing at all to do. He knows it would be cheaper if a number of us ate at the same time, so as to use the same table. So it would. It would also be cheaper if a number of us slept at different times, so as to use the same pair of trousers. But the question is not how cheap are <b>we</b> <b>buying</b> a thing, but what are <b>we</b> <b>buying?</b> It is cheap to own a slave. And it is cheaper still to be a slave.|$|R

500|$|Before Phantasmagoria was released, CompUSA, the nation's largest {{discount}} computer retailer, notified Sierra {{it would}} not stock the game. The company did not comment on specific reasons for their decision except for a written statement from chief operating officer Hal Compton: [...] "Software comes out all the time. Some <b>we</b> <b>buy,</b> some we don't. This one we chose not to." [...] Analysts believed CompUSA objected to the realistic violence in the game. Lee S. Isgur of Jefferies & Co., a global investment bank that followed the computer game industry, said CompUSA's decision probably would not harm overall sales of the game, {{and that it could}} in fact help it generate publicity. He added that [...] "It's probably one of the bloodiest games ever." [...] Likewise, Vincent Turzo of Jefferies & Co. said, [...] "When you say you're not going to carry something, of course the consumers rush to the stores to see what it's all about." [...] Roberta Williams said of CompUSA's announcement: [...] "I'm disappointed that they decided to make a stand with my product." [...] Some smaller retailers also decided not to stock Phantasmagoria, but others like Walmart continued to carry it.|$|E

5000|$|Writer Johan Norberg, {{a proponent}} of market economics, points out an irony: critics say that <b>we</b> shouldn't <b>buy</b> from {{countries}} like Vietnam because of its labor standards, they've got it all wrong. They're saying: [...] "Look, you are too poor to trade with us. And that means that we won't trade with you. <b>We</b> won't <b>buy</b> your goods until you're as rich as we are."

In an op-ed essay Leigh pointed out previous police efforts and mistakes while educating about how mislabeling and forcing the women to either testify that they were prostitutes or illegal aliens. She stated, [...] "Before <b>we</b> <b>buy</b> into the [...] "sex slave" [...] melodrama, we should consider the complexities of sex work, migration and trafficking.

2500|$|According to Robert Reischauer, {{president}} of the Urban Institute and {{vice chairman of the}} Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, [...] "Accessible information on the quality, price, effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare services and providers is developing rapidly, but is nowhere near the minimum standard assumed by well functioning CDHC. And employers, bound in part by Treasury Department regulations, do not vary deductibles, catastrophic caps or contributions to HSAs and HRAs to workers' family incomes or health status as equitable CDHC would call for....Many things <b>we</b> <b>buy</b> in health care are pieces of larger packages which are undefined when the decisions are made concerning whether to purchase and where to purchase. For example, when one goes to the doctor because of a particular set of symptoms, the doctor ask a number of questions which leads to a series of recommended tests whose results then determine an appropriate treatment regime. One could select the doctor to visit on the basis of price and quality but that is no guarantee that the package of tests and treatments that resulted would be the lowest cost or highest quality....The costs of the really expensive treatments would be largely unaffected." ...|$|E

This exhibition report explores the thinking behind my Masters exhibition “if you sing me a lullaby I will sing you a song about war. ” It is specifically about the English colonisation of the Highlands and the Pacific and relates directly to my own family story.
