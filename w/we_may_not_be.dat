Instead, she credits director Milton Katselas with teaching her the difference between how an actor initially thinks a character would behave during a particular scene, and how the actor themself would behave during that same scene. Vulture.com's Angelica Jade Bastién identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an actress of such depth, breadth, and tenacity, she obliterates the argument that an untrained actor has less capability than her trained counterparts." [...] In 1992, Rolling Stone Gerri Hirshey identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an accomplished character actress" [...] who is comfortable wearing costumes that are unflattering in the traditional Hollywood sense, The Fabulous Baker Boys Susie Diamond – her most critically acclaimed role to-date – being a notable exception at the time. Pfeiffer explained that she rarely accepts glamorous roles because she finds few of them interesting, opting to play characters that [...] "move" [...] her instead: [...] "I know that if I can hear the character as I'm reading, it's made some connection [...]" [...] A film critic once summarized the actress as [...] "a character actress in a screen siren's body", a sentiment with which her Scarface co-star and friend Al Pacino agrees. Pfeiffer is often commended for her ability to disguise her true feelings and emotions, a technique she frequently uses to her advantage in period films; playing roles in period costume {{has become something of}} a trademark of hers. Pfeiffer herself has admitted to being skilled in this particular area but at the same time believes that hiding one's true feelings is not uncommon, speculating, [...] "that's how most people behave. <b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> as mannered or as proper as people were in the 19th century, but very rarely are we talking about what we're really thinking." [...] Pfeiffer has called acting a [...] "sadomasochistic" [...] profession due to how [...] "brutal" [...] the process can be at times. She is often praised for her acting abilities by various directors with whom she has collaborated over the years. Director Martin Scorsese described Pfeiffer, who he directed in the period drama The Age of Innocence (1993), as [...] "an actress who could portray inner conflict with her eyes and face better than any other film star of her generation." [...] Jonathan Demme (Married to the Mob, 1988) declared “It’s hard for me to imagine anyone who, on a level of quality, would have an edge on her." ...|$|E

He also {{said that if the}} United States were to oppose Russia's expansion, nuclear strikes on American soil are also pending. [...] "We will suffer grave economic damage, but will not engage in military action to stop the conflict.

2500|$|Flat {{taxes have}} also been {{considered}} in the United Kingdom by the Conservative Party. In September 2005, George Osborne, then in opposition, said {{that while he was}} [...] "fully conscious that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to introduce a pure flat tax, {{we may be able to}} move towards simpler and flatter taxes." [...] However, it was roundly rejected by Gordon Brown, then the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said that it was [...] "An idea that they say is sweeping the world, well sweeping Estonia, well a wing of the neo-conservatives in Estonia", and criticised it thus: [...] "The millionaire to pay exactly the same tax rate as the young nurse, the home help, the worker on the minimum wage".|$|E
2500|$|The {{sense of}} an enlightened {{approach}} and the critical method required that [...] "If one cannot prove that a thing is, he may try {{to prove that it}} is not. If he fails to do either (as often occurs), he may still ask whether it is in his interest to accept {{one or the other of}} the alternatives hypothetically, from the theoretical or the practical point of view. Hence the question no longer is as to whether perpetual peace is a real thing or not a real thing, or as to whether <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> deceiving ourselves when we adopt the former alternative, but we must act on the supposition of its being real." [...] The presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was then a practical concern, for [...] "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams..." ...|$|E
2500|$|These six roots, Mind, Voice, Reason, Reflection, Name, and Thought, {{are also}} called six powers. Commingled {{with them all}} was the great power, the [...] "Boundless Power." [...] This was that which [...] "has stood, stands, and will stand," [...] the seventh power (root) {{corresponding}} to the seventh day after the six days of creation. This seventh power existed before the world, it is the Spirit of God that moved upon {{the face of the}} waters (Genesis 1:2). It existed potentially in every child of man, and might be developed in each to its own immensity. The small might become great, the point be enlarged to infinity. This indivisible point which existed in the body, and of which none but the spiritual knew, was the Kingdom of Heaven, and the grain of mustard-seed. But it rested with us to develop it, and it is this responsibility which is referred to in the words—"that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> condemned with the world" [...] (1 Corinthians 11:32). For if the image of the Standing One were not actualized in us, it would not survive the death of the body.
