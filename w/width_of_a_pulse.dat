The {{first part of this}} thesis presents event-driven switch-level algorithms for handling abnormal situations occurring in networks in the presence <b>of</b> faults. <b>A</b> proposal is made for an extension to the traditional single-dominance node model which efficiently solves conflicts that may occur between adjacent nodes assigned the X state and thereby significantly reduces the spread of X values as compared with traditional methods. The degradation of confidence in fault detection measures owing to undetermined output values is discussed. A new switch-level model is presented which allows <b>an</b> arbitrary number <b>of</b> dominant signals associated with the state <b>of</b> <b>a</b> node. The strength of several signal contributions can thereby be taken into account when the logic state is computed. It is shown that the error bounds in the voltage prediction, in many cases, are significantly reduced in comparison with traditional models.

Estimates of Q from pulse width measurements {{are often not}} robust for oscillatory arrivals or for impulsive arrivals {{in the presence of}} noise. We present a method to estimate Q from two arrivals using measurements of any signal attribute, 5, that is sensitive to propagation loss. The propagation loss is defined as the change in 5 divided by the difference in traveltime between the arrivals. The first data arrival is used as the reference wavelet. The Q-gram method is based on propagating the reference wavelet with a plane-wave Q-propagator for various values of Q-'. The &-propagator includes a dispersion relation and the measured difference in traveltime between the data arrivals. The plot of synthetic propagation loss between the reference and propagated wavelets, versus Q-', is called a Q-gram. The Q-gram, together with the measured propagation loss of the data, gives the Q of the data. The averaged instantaneous frequency 7 and the averaged instantaneous pulse width T make good signal attributes. Tests on synthetic seismograms show that the Q-gram method, using either 7 or Z for <, is applicable to both impulsive and oscillatory arrivals and is relatively robust with regard to noise, phase changes and signal clipping. We apply the Q-gram method to horizontal-component airgun ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) data using the basement-converted shear-wave reflection, PS, as the first arrival and PSSS as the second arrival.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{theoretical}} and experimental examination of two-photon direct frequency comb spectroscopy (DFCS) using atomic two-level systems. This method {{is a very}} promising tool to extend optical spectroscopy into the short wavelength region where only few cw laser sources exist. The high peak intensities of pulsed lasers facilitate efficient nonlinear conversion into frequency regions which are so far unexplored, for example by high harmonic generation (HHG). DFCS is based on theoretical work in the 1970 s which showed that <b>a</b> <b>pulse</b> train <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mode-locked laser drives a two-photon transition as efficient as <b>a</b> cw laser <b>of</b> same average power. Thereby the effective line width {{is determined by the}} narrow <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single comb mode rather than by the spectral <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>pulse.</b> In this way a frequency comb combines the spectral purity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cw laser with the high peak intensity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pulsed laser. To demonstrate the capability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nonlinearly converted frequency comb for DFCS, the absolute frequency <b>of</b> <b>a</b> two-photon transition in $^{ 24 }$Mg at 431 ~nm was measured in a first experiment. The accuracies of the values could be improved by more than two orders of magnitude with respect to previously reported values. Furthermore two crucial effects which affect the transition rates were analyzed quantitatively for the first time: the impact <b>of</b> <b>a</b> linear chirp and non-centered spectral envelope on the spectroscopy. In general the <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nonlinear converted frequency comb are not bandwidth limited leading to a partially destructive pairwise addition of modes. To describe the impact <b>of</b> <b>a</b> linear chirp a theoretical model was developed and verified experimentally using two-photon spectroscopy on cesium. Moreover, theory and experiment have shown a Gaussian decrease in the transition rate with increasing detuning of the laser spectrum. %Another important aspect is the centering of the laser spectrum with respect to the atomic transition. Theory and experiment show here a Gaussian decrease in the transition rate with increasing detuning. Finally the progress of $ 1 S - 3 S$ spectroscopy in hydrogen is presented. This transition is a promising candidate for <b>a</b> test <b>of</b> bound state quantum electrodynamics. Using cw lasers the required wavelength of 205 ~nm is hard to generate, making this transition to an eligible system for DFCS.

The quiver energy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free electron under these conditions {{is less than the}} ionization potential of all rare gases, ensuring that ionization occurs only by optical field-induced processes. Spectral blueshifts of up to 2 nm have been observed, and the blueshifted spectra show an oscillatory structure. The blueshifted spectra are shown {{to be the result of}} plasma-induced self-phase modulation and can be modeled by assuming tunneling ionization and one dimensional pulse propagation. The newly discovered oscillatory structure in the spectra is related to that observed in earlier experiments on self-phase modulation in optical fibers. To investigate the temporal behavior of the field ionization process, pump-probe experiments have been performed with a 100 fs probe pulse at 497 nm and a 400 fs pump pulse at 248 nm. Under conditions of weak ionization (Z ≪ 1), pump-probe experiments and theoretical calculations show that the ionization rate of the field ionized gas is maximum at the peak of the laser pulse and that the degree of ionization changes over a time equal to about half of the pump pulse width. By observing changes in the transmission of the probe pulse caused by plasma absorption, the electron temperature <b>of</b> <b>a</b> field ionized rare gas is determined to be on the order of 1 eV. The time varying electron density in the pump-probe experiments also causes plasma-induced cross-phase modulation, or spectral blueshifting of the probe pulse spectrum of up to 15 nm.

40|$|We {{developed}} a rotary valve for <b>a</b> <b>pulse</b> detonation engine (PDE), and confirmed its basic characteristics and performance. In a square cross-section combustor, we visualized <b>a</b> multi-shot <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pulse</b> detonation rocket engine (PDRE) cycle at <b>an</b> operation frequency <b>of</b> 160 Hz {{by using a}} high-speed camera (time resolution: 3. 33 μs, space resolution: 0. 4 mm) and a Schlieren method. The propellant filling process and the purge process were confirmed, and each process was modeled. Moreover, we confirmed the processes of detonation wave generation and burned gas blowdown. In addition, we investigated the impact of shortening the passage <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> combustor and negative-time ignition (ignition time is earlier than the end-time of the propellant filling process) on the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) distance and time. The DDT distance did {{not depend on the}} passage <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> combustor and decreased under the negative-time ignition condition. With <b>a</b> passage <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 20 mm, the DDT distance decreased by 22 % under the negative-time ignition condition to a minimum value (76 ± 8 mm). The DDT time from spark time reached a minimum value (69 ± 14 μs) under the condition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> passage <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 10 mm and negative-time ignition. The detonation initiation time and the DDT distance were represented by the time until the flame expanded toward the tube-axis one-dimensionally from ignition (characteristic time). We also carried out thrust measurement using a PDRE system composed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> circular cross-section combustor and the newly developed valve. We obtained a stable time-averaged thrust in <b>a</b> wide range <b>of</b> operation frequency (40 – 160 Hz) and confirmed the increase of specific impulse due to a partial-fill effect. At a maximum operation frequency of 159 Hz, we achieved a maximum propellant-based specific impulse of 232 s and a maximum time-averaged thrust of 71 N...|$|R
