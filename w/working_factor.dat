The author studied on some physiological aspects of streptomycin-dependent strain of Escherichia coli in comparison with streptomycin sensitive strain. The results are summarized as follows: 1) By inoculation of a great amount of streptomycin-sensitive E. coli on plain broth agar plates containing 1. 000 γ / cc of streptomycin, one streptomycin-dependent strain was isolated. 2) The reverse mutant from this dependent strain was a streptomycin-sensitive strain, the re-reverse mutant from this reverse mutant was a dependent strain, and no resistant strain could be obtained. 3) This dependent stain could not multiply using streptomycin as the sole carbon or nitrogen source. 4) This dependent strain showed a higher requirement to streptomycin in the media containing the fatty acits related to the citric acid cycle than in those containing amino acids as its growth substrates. 5) Streptomycin showed no noticeable action on the respiration of this dependent strain. From these results, it is inferred that streptcomycin works not as a nutriment but as some <b>working</b> <b>factor</b> for the growth or multiplication of the streptomycin-dependent E. coli...|$|E

40|$|In {{this review}} I present studies {{concerning}} {{the processing of}} music in the brain. The aim of the review was to identify neurobiological mechanisms underlying music therapy effects, with special focus on music used for pain relief. One of the main challenges {{in the field of}} music therapy seems to be the lack of a common theoretical framework for the diverse music therapy working areas and practitioners. Hillecke et al thus proposed a <b>working</b> <b>factor</b> model based on five ingredients or working factors that seem to be central aspects of music therapeutic work. The five factors are the attentiveness factor, the emotional factor, the cognitive factor, the motor behavioural factor, and the interpersonal factor. The authors suggest these five factors as a common theoretical basis for music therapy work. In addition, the literature mentions a sixth factor which might be of significant importance for future music therapy research and clinical use: the physiological factor. There is some evidence that music may induce physiological responses through the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Another challenge in the field of music therapy is the specificity problem. It is difficult to tell whether an observed change is due to the music itself or to other contributory factors like the therapist-patient relationship. Many authors suggest that music can influence the neuronal plasticity of our brains in several favourable ways. With regard to music as treatment for pain, a meta-analysis revealed that the clinical significance of music is unsure. However, the possible physiological effects of music, an other possible indirect effects of music on pain processing should be investigated...|$|E

For prosthetic works burnt the clay, it may deteriorate the quality of metal-clay connection. Parameters of sandblasting have the significant influence on the amount of stubble elements stuck into the base. The aim of the research is examining possibilities of applying neuron networks for modeling this process. Examples were sandblasted using alternating parameters (pressure of <b>working</b> <b>factor,</b> angle of sandblasting, size of grains). As a next the amount of stubble elements stuck into the base were calculated. Study results allowed to work out a set of 180 standardized teaching patterns. Next, a group of 150 randomly selected neuron networks was submitted to teaching process. The aim was to select net architecture with the highest adjustment for discussed issue. Finally, a MLP (Multi Layer Perception) was chosen. Training process of the net involved presentation of process entrance parameters to the net, followed by presentation of researched proportional partaking of stuck elements. In following training cycles the error was decreasing systematically. After finishing the training, the average medium error between the real measurement and the one anticipated by the net was about 5 per cent. Additional number of abrasive jet machining processing was done to verification experiments. As the study shows, designed artificial neuron net stimulates real dependencies appearing during abrasive jet machining-processing in a proper way and can be used for estimating proportional part of grains stuck into base after this processing.

In general stress is a major factor in Information Technology professional's day to day life and work. The pressure that they work under is very high. Previous researches have already proved that programmer stress is both extremely common and extremely problematic. Then there arise questions in mind asking whether there is a relationship between levels of stress with the IT professionals' work environment and demographic factors and what contemporary factors make more stress in Sri Lanka. The sample of the study included the IT Professionals with certain restrictions of the Software companies which were established five years and more. The Professionals were under the category that they posses more than 5 years of the field experience, at least five subordinates, does more than three projects per year and also posses a senior position in the company. A multiple response questionnaire was developed (Survey Instrument) online to measure the stress levels of the IT professionals, which was based on the Occupational stress indicator (OSI) and Pressure management indicator (PMI) by Williams and Cooper. The data was gathered from 50 respondents among 60 different Software develop men! companies of Sri Lanka.
