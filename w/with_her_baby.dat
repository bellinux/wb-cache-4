5|$|Poehler became {{pregnant}} {{during the latter}} half of the season, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>baby</b> due in the summer or early fall of 2010. The Parks and Recreation producers decided not to write the pregnancy into the show, so they decided to enter into a continuous production after the season ended to bank episodes for the third season. Six season three episodes were filmed in this fashion. However, in May 2010, NBC announced the third season of Parks and Recreation was being moved to an undisclosed midseason premiere date to allow the network's new comedy, Outsourced, to run in the Thursday two-hour comedy schedule block. NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no effect on the show's momentum, but could actually build anticipation for its eventual return. In November 2010, it was announced Parks and Recreation would return to a 9:30p.m. Thursday timeslot effective January 20, 2011.|$|E

25|$|Carmel {{is first}} seen in Walford in June 1986 {{when she is}} {{assigned}} as Michelle Fowler's (Susan Tully) health visitor. West Indian by origin, British by education, Carmel is unmistakable with her long dreadlocks and colourful clothing. Carmel is kept extremely busy in Walford as she has all the difficult cases - Mary Smith (Linda Davidson), a prostitute, whose baby, Annie, has been removed; Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff), a mentally unstable mother who is obsessed <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>baby,</b> Ali's, welfare; Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), a self-destructing heroin addict, and jobless Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), among others.|$|E

25|$|Both {{general and}} {{regional}} anaesthesia (spinal, epidural or combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia) are acceptable for use during Caesarean section. Evidence {{does not show}} a difference between regional anaesthesia and general anaesthesia with respect to major outcomes in the mother or baby. Regional anaesthesia may be preferred as it allows the mother to be awake and interact immediately <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>baby.</b> Other advantages of regional anesthesia may include the absence of typical risks of general anesthesia: pulmonary aspiration (which has a relatively high incidence in patients undergoing anesthesia in late pregnancy) of gastric contents and esophageal intubation. However, one trial found no difference in satisfaction when general anaesthesia was compared with either spinal anaesthesia.|$|E

25|$|Although Parliament disavowed {{the terms}} of the truce, no blame was {{attached}} to Monck's recognition of military necessity. He next fought at Oliver Cromwell's side in Scotland at the 1650 Battle of Dunbar, a resounding Roundhead victory. Made commander-in-chief in Scotland by Cromwell, Monck completed the subjugation of the country. After his forces stormed the town of Dundee, he lost control of his men with the resulting murder and rape of the population. The streets of the town were reputed to run red with blood for days and Monck eventually was sickened by the barbarity when he saw the corpse of a suckling mother <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>baby</b> still feeding. In February 1652 Monck left Scotland to recover his broken health at Bath, and in November of the same year he became a General at Sea in the First Anglo-Dutch War.|$|E
25|$|Australian Jews never {{constituted}} {{more than}} 1% {{of the total}} colonial community. Eight convicts transported to Botany Bay in 1788 aboard the First Fleet {{have been identified as}} Jewish. There were probably more, but exact numbers are not possible as the transportation records did not indicate a convict's religion. Over a thousand more people of Jewish descent are estimated to have been sent to Australia as convicts during the next 60 years. Most of them came from London, were of working-class background and were male. Only 7% of Jewish convicts were female, compared to 15% for non-Jewish convicts. The average age of the Jewish convicts was 25, but ranged as young as 8 to some elderly people. Esther Abrahams (who arrived with the First Fleet, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>baby</b> daughter Roseanna) and Ikey Solomon were among the convicts who were Jewish.|$|E

Ball appeared on the cover of TV Guide more than any other person; she appeared on 39 covers, including the first cover in 1953 <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>baby</b> son, Desi Arnaz, Jr. TV Guide voted Lucille Ball as the 'Greatest TV Star of All Time' and it later commemorated the 50th anniversary of I Love Lucy with eight collector covers celebrating memorable scenes from the show.

Because of her liberated mindset and approval of the Women's Movement, Ball was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Lynott {{was born}} in Hallam Hospital in West Bromwich, England, and christened at St Edward's Church, Selly Park, Birmingham. His mother, Philomena Lynott {{was born in}} Dublin on 22 October 1930, and his father, Cecil Parris, was from Georgetown, British Guiana. Philomena met Parris in Birmingham in 1948, having moved to England to seek work {{and they were in}} a {{relationship}} for a few months, until Parris was transferred to London. Shortly afterwards, Philomena found she was pregnant and, after Philip was born, she moved <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>baby</b> to a home for unmarried mothers in Selly Oak, Birmingham. When Parris learned of Philip's birth, he returned to Birmingham and arranged accommodation for Philomena and Philip in nearby Blackheath. Her relationship with Parris lasted two more years although he was still working in London and they did not live together. Philomena subsequently moved to Manchester but stayed in touch with Parris and, although she turned down a marriage proposal from him, he agreed to pay towards his son's support.|$|E
25|$|Kim meets Silas {{once again}} in the {{hospital}} while it is temporarily shut down. Silas and Lindsey put their plan into action and break into the Roscoe home but Mercedes is not there. Angered by this failure, Silas disowns Lindsey and tells her he will go after Mercedes alone. However, Lindsey's waters break and she goes into labour. Alarmed, Silas bundles her into the Roscoe garage, steals Joe's phone and abandons her. Later that day, Mercedes answers the door to find Silas. Meanwhile, Lindsey has managed to summon Kim for help and gives birth to a baby girl at the hospital with the reluctant help of Tegan and Celine McQueen (Sarah George). When Joe and Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) arrive at the hospital to find Lindsey with the baby, they try to call the police, but Lindsey warns them not to as Mercedes is in danger. Silas plays a game of chess with Mercedes, while blaming her for Riley's death. Mercedes angrily demands where Silas was when Riley died and throws him into a rage when she reminds him of his part in Heidi's death. He tells her that she is to be his final victim and he will not be cheated this time as he was with Lynsey and Texas. Silas allows Mercedes to take JJ to bed, but she secretly hides a nail file in her pocket. When Silas guides her downstairs, Mercedes attempts to stab him with the nail file, but Silas easily deflects it. Lindsey then gives the order for Silas to kill Mercedes, but Mercedes criticises him for taking orders from a woman, especially one who cheated on Joe with Freddie. When Silas criticises Mercedes' stillborn son, Gabriel, Mercedes asks him to kill her so she can be with him. Silas is touched by this and noting that Mercedes has made significant effort to mend her ways over the years, he decides to spare her life. When Lindsey shows up at the Roscoe home, having managed to escape from the hospital <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>baby,</b> Silas feigns concern and asks to hold her baby. Silas then gives Mercedes the baby and asks her to ensure that the child grows up as pure and innocent as she is now. Silas then turns on Lindsey for cheating on the Roscoe brothers. Joe, Kim and Freddie arrive to find Lindsey's corpse on the couch. Silas is last seen looking on as a hysterical Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) is led out of The Loft by Tegan and Celine. He then leaves the village, smirking.|$|E

500|$|Maggie has {{performed}} {{a number of}} feats that suggest she is a genius. She has spelled out E=MC² <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>baby</b> blocks, driven Homer's car, escaped from the Springfield daycare center, written her name on an Etch A Sketch, played Internet poker, and treated her pacifier like a cigarette. However, {{the rest of the}} Simpsons family are unaware of Maggie's maturity and Marge carries Maggie wherever they go rather than letting her walk by herself. Maggie is keenly aware of her surroundings, and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her. She shows a high degree of dexterity, and she once hit Homer on the head with a mallet and shot a dart at a photograph of him in imitation of Itchy and Scratchy. Despite her age, Maggie is a formidable marksman, as seen in [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" [...] where she shoots Mr. Burns with a handgun that falls into her hands, and in a more intentional manner during [...] "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge" [...] where she is able to non-fatally shoot a group of mobsters in rapid succession with a rifle that she apparently hides in her crib.|$|E

500|$|According to a belief, {{the power}} of dragon boys was {{greatest}} {{at the time of}} their birth; the younger they were, the greater power they had. In a folk tale from eastern Serbia, a group of dragons surrounded an ala, which broke away and flew into a watermill. There was a woman in the mill <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>baby,</b> who was a dragon boy; he grabbed a stone and killed the ala with it. It was recorded in the region of Niš that a winged dragon boy, in his fights with ale, [...] "takes a plough beam and immediately stops the ala, and hail ceases." [...] The mother of a dragon boy wanted to make him an ordinary child by cutting off the winglets beneath his armpits, but that section resulted in the boy's death. As was thought in the Župa basin and nearby areas, no one but the mother should see a dragon boy during the first seventeen days of his life; otherwise the child would die. If he survived, he would protect his village from hail, and at the age of seven he would fly away from home. It was also believed in Župa that the dragon men lived alone, without contacts with other humans.|$|E
500|$|With Karmal's {{ascension}} to power, Parchamites {{began to}} [...] "settle old scores". Revolutionary Troikas {{were created to}} arrest, sentence and execute people. Amin's guard were the first victims of the terror which ensued. Those commanders who had stayed loyal to Amin were arrested, filling the prisons. The Soviets protested, and Karmal replied, [...] "As long as you keep my hands bound and do not let me deal with the Khalq faction {{there will be no}} unity in the PDPA and the government cannot become strong... They tortured and killed us. They still hate us! They are the enemies of the party..." [...] Amin's daughter, along <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>baby,</b> was imprisoned for twelve years, until Mohammad Najibullah, then leader of the PDPA, released her. When Karmal took power, leading posts in the Party and Government bureaucracy were taken over by Parchamites. The Khalq faction was removed from power, and only technocrats, opportunists and individuals which the Soviets trusted would be appointed to the higher echelons of government. Khalqists remained in control of the Ministry of Interior, but Parchamites were given control over KHAD and the secret police. The Parchamites and the Khalqists controlled an equal share of the military. Two out of Karmal's three Council of Ministers deputy chairmen were Khalqists. Khalqists controlled the Ministry of Communications and the interior ministry. Parchamites, on the other hand, controlled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence. In addition to the changes in government, the Parchamites held clear majority in the PDPA Central Committee. Only one Khalqi, Saleh Mohammad Zeary, {{was a member of the}} PDPA Secretariat during Karmal's rule.|$|E
500|$|Allegra was {{the product}} of a {{short-lived}} affair between the Romantic poet and her starstruck teenage mother, who was living in reduced circumstances in the household of her stepsister and brother-in-law. Clairmont wrote to Byron during the pregnancy begging him to write back and promise {{to take care of her}} and the baby; however, Byron ignored her pleas. After her birth, she was initially taken into the household of Leigh Hunt as the child of a cousin. A few months later the Shelleys and Clairmont took the baby back as an [...] "adopted" [...] child. Clairmont bonded <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>baby</b> daughter and wrote in her journal with delight about her close, physical connection with little Allegra, but she was also dealing with emotional and financial pressures from the Shelleys that made it difficult for her to keep the baby with her. The Shelleys were fond of Allegra, but Mary Shelley feared that neighbours would believe Percy Bysshe Shelley had fathered her as the truth about her relationship to Clairmont leaked out. William Godwin, Mary's father and Clairmont's stepfather, had immediately leaped to that conclusion when he learned of Allegra's birth. In an October 1817 letter to Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley remarked that their toddler son William disliked Allegra, but was fond of his baby sister Clara. She saw her son's reaction to Allegra, who was no blood relation to him, as [...] "an argument in favor of those who advocate instinctive natural affection". In addition, the Shelleys were constantly in debt and Mary Shelley wanted the baby to be sent to Byron and wanted her difficult and temperamental stepsister, who had too close a relationship with her husband, to leave her house.|$|E
