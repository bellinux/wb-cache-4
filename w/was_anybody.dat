500|$|Willis went to {{the camp}} and {{impressed}} Brown with his speed and reflexes, as he had at Ohio State. Brown lined him up against center Mo Scarry in practice on his first day. Willis beat him every time. Scarry complained that Willis was coming across the line before he snapped the ball. On one snap, Scarry stepped on quarterback Otto Graham's foot as he backpedaled to handle Willis. Brown took a look himself: Willis was not offside. He was getting a jump by watching for the center's fingers to tighten on the ball. [...] "He was quick", said Alex Agase, who later joined the Browns as a guard. [...] "I don't think there <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> as quick at that position, or any position for that matter. He came off that ball with that ball as quick as anything {{you would want to}} see." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michener was {{immediately}} recalled from India {{and it was}} on March 29, 1967, that Queen Elizabeth II had, by commission under the royal sign-manual and Great Seal of Canada, appointed Pearson's choice of Michener to succeed Georges Vanier as the Queen's representative. Despite being a Conservative, Liberal members of parliament and cabinet ministers welcomed the selection of Michener; Paul Martin Sr. said [...] "I don’t think there <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> inside or outside the public service who could qualify better than Michener... People just felt that this was a good appointment." [...] Michener was subsequently sworn-in during a ceremony in the Senate chamber on April 17 that year, leaving one of the shortest periods where an individual has been governor general-designate.|$|E
2500|$|Another writer {{recalled}} {{the area around}} the Dunbar as [...] "a place where people love to congregate and have a good time, check out the new models and pick up on the latest lingo." [...] The Dunbar built a reputation in the 1930s as [...] "the symbol of L.A.'s black nightlife," [...] as [...] "regular jamming sessions and meetings in the hotel lobby elevated the structure to a practically mythical status." [...] Lionel Hampton had fond memories of jam sessions and practices on the Dunbar's mezzanine. Hampton recalled, [...] "Everybody that <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> showed up at the Dunbar. [...] I remember a chauffeur would drive Stepin Fetchit, the movie star, up to the curb in a big Packard, and he'd look out the window at all the folks." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 23 March 2007, Pakistan {{players and}} {{officials}} were questioned by Jamaican police and submitted DNA samples along with fingerprints, {{as part of}} the routine enquiries in the investigation into Woolmer's murder. Three days after leaving the West Indies for Pakistan, via London, the Pakistan team were ruled out as suspects. The deputy commissioner of Jamaican police. Mark Shields, the detective in charge of the investigation, announced, [...] "It's fair to say they are now being treated as witnesses." [...] "I have got no evidence to suggest it <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> in the squad." [...] A memorial service was held in Sacred Heart Church, Lahore, for Bob Woolmer on 1 April 2007. Among the attendees were Pakistan players and dignitaries, including Inzamam-ul-Haq, who was quoted as saying, [...] "After Woolmer's family, the Pakistan team was the most aggrieved by his death." [...] After the World Cup ended, serious doubts were raised about the investigation, with increasing speculation that Woolmer died of natural causes. This has now been accepted as fact, and the case has been closed.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his celebrated flaws, history records Fox as {{an amiable}} figure. The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, [...] "I have passed two evenings with him, and never <b>was</b> <b>anybody</b> so agreeable, {{and the more}} so from his having no pretensions to it". Selwyn also said that [...] "Charles, I am persuaded, would have no {{consideration}} on earth but for what was useful to his own ends. You have heard me say, that I thought he had no malice or rancour; I think so still and am sure of it. But I {{think that he has}} no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; and if I could trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence because then I had much rather (if it were possible) think well of him than not". Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: [...] "The essential defect in his character and the cause of all his failures, strange as it may seem, was that he had no heart". Edward Gibbon remarked that [...] "Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood." [...] Central to understanding Fox's life was his view that [...] "friendship was the only real happiness in the world." [...] For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks's to Westminster. [...] "Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power." [...] The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke’s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt’s prosecution of the war against France. Moreover, the Foxites were [...] "the witty and wicked" [...] satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.|$|E
