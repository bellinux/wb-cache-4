30|$|<b>Waiting</b> {{to receive}} a service is broadly defined as the time from the moment {{customers}} are ready {{to receive a}} service to the moment they actually receive it (Taylor 1994; Jin et al. 2009). Depending on when the <b>wait</b> occurs, this period can be categorized as a pre-process <b>wait,</b> in-process <b>wait,</b> and post-process <b>wait</b> (Dube-Rioux et al. 1989). This study understands <b>waiting</b> to purchase goods as {{the process by which}} customers <b>wait</b> to obtain a fashion product; this delay, caused by in-store crowd control, is similar to <b>waiting</b> to receive a service. When the <b>waiting</b> types identified by Dube-Rioux et al. (1989) are applied to the context of purchasing a fashion item, <b>waiting</b> can be categorized into <b>waits</b> outside and <b>waits</b> inside the store. The former occur before customers explore or purchase a product and can be regarded as a pre-process <b>wait.</b> <b>Waits</b> inside the store are in-process <b>waits</b> that occur after customers enter the store to explore and purchase a product; these can be categorized as <b>waits</b> for trial and <b>waits</b> for payment. <b>Waits</b> for payment are customers’ post-process <b>wait</b> (i.e., <b>waiting</b> in line) at the cash register to purchase a product. Unlike in the service context, purchasing fashion goods is strongly affected by limited supply. The psychological and emotional responses induced by customers’ <b>waits</b> to purchase scarce goods differ from those felt when <b>waiting</b> to receive a service.|$|R

40|$|A {{major concern}} for service {{managers}} is to counteract {{negative effects of}} <b>waiting.</b> In this study, the effects of objective <b>waiting</b> time and <b>waiting</b> environment on satisfaction with the service were investigated. Two elements of the <b>waiting</b> environment were distinguished: the attractiveness of the <b>waiting</b> room {{and the presence of}} television (TV) as an explicit distracter. The mediating role of three subjective variables (perceived <b>waiting</b> time, acceptable <b>waiting</b> time and the (cognitive and affective) appraisal of the <b>wait)</b> was explored. <b>Waiting</b> appears to influence satisfaction quite strongly. The adverse effects of <b>waiting</b> can be soothed more effectively by improving the attractiveness of the <b>waiting</b> environment than by shortening the objective <b>waiting</b> time. Objective <b>waiting</b> time influences satisfaction mainly via a cognitive route: through perceived <b>waiting</b> time (in minutes) and the long/short judgment of the <b>wait.</b> Perceived attractiveness of the <b>waiting</b> environment operates mainly through affect, and thus serves as a mood inducer. The acceptable <b>waiting</b> time appears to be a critical point of reference, since surpassing it provokes strong affective responses. Although the presence of TV did not result in the expected effect of distraction, the tendency to watch it was found to be dependent on the length of the <b>wait</b> (and thus, boredom) ...|$|R

5|$|The British camp in Balaclava {{was on a}} plateau, {{with two}} {{approaches}} – the South and North valleys – and a small hill, known as the Causeway Heights, between them. At Balaclava, the force <b>waited</b> for supplies while the allied ships bombarded the forts surrounding Sevastopol, starting on 17 October. The forts proved to be particularly strong, but some damage was caused and Admiral Kornilov killed. From then on, time and time again, the allied navy would bombard the forts, causing damage, which the Russians would then repair each night. While the allied armies <b>waited</b> to strengthen their positions and increase their resources, Prince Menshikov, commander of the Russian forces, had a desire to provide a victory to the Tsar following his defeat at Alma. He formed a plan to cut the British army off from the harbour at Balaclava, with a secondary objective of capturing the harbour itself. The Russian forces assembled on 24 October, and attacked at around 7am on the 25th. General Gribbe covered the Russian left flank, with Semiakin, Levoutsky and Scudery on his right: General Ryzhov <b>waited</b> behind them, prepared to support any individual force that came under trouble. The Turkish forces in the first redoubts were quickly overwhelmed and forced to flee.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Providing {{emergency}} department (ED) <b>wait</b> time {{information to the}} public has been suggested as a mechanism to reduce lengthy ED <b>wait</b> times (by enabling patients to select the ED site with shorter <b>wait</b> time), but the effects of such a program have not been evaluated. We evaluated the effects of such a program in a community with two ED sites. METHODS: Descriptive statistics for <b>wait</b> times of the two sites before and after the publication of <b>wait</b> time information were used to evaluate the effects of the publication of <b>wait</b> time information on <b>wait</b> times. Multivariate logistical regression was used to test whether or not individual patients used published <b>wait</b> time to decide which site to visit. RESULTS: We found that the rates of <b>wait</b> times exceeding 4 h, and the 95 th percentile of <b>wait</b> times in the two sites decreased after the publication of <b>wait</b> time information, even though the average <b>wait</b> times experienced a slight increase. We also found that after controlling for other factors, the site with shorter <b>wait</b> time had a higher likelihood of being selected after the publication of <b>wait</b> time information, but there was no such relationship before the publication. CONCLUSIONS: These findings were consistent with the hypothesis that the publication of <b>wait</b> time information leads to patients selecting the site with shorter <b>wait</b> time. While publishing ED <b>wait</b> time information did not improve average <b>wait</b> time, it reduced the rates of lengthy <b>wait</b> times...|$|R
40|$|Besley, Hall, and Preston (1999) {{estimated}} a {{model of}} the demand for private health insurance in Britain as a function of regional <b>waiting</b> lists and found that increases {{in the number of people}} <b>waiting</b> for more than 12 months (the long-term <b>waiting</b> list) increased the probability of insurance purchase. In the absence of <b>waiting</b> time data, the length of regional long-term <b>waiting</b> lists was used to capture the price-quality trade-off of public treatment. We revisit Besley et al. ?s analysis using Australian data and test the use of <b>waiting</b> lists as a proxy for <b>waiting</b> time in models of insurance demand. Unlike Besley et al., we find that the long-term <b>waiting</b> list is not a significant determinant of the demand for insurance. However we find that long <b>waiting</b> times do significantly increase insurance. This suggests that the relationship between <b>waiting</b> times and <b>waiting</b> lists is not as straightforward as is commonly assumed. <b>waiting</b> time, <b>waiting</b> lists, health insurance, regional aggregation...|$|R
