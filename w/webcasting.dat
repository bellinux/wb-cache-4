25|$|On February 16, 2017, Sanders began <b>webcasting</b> The Bernie Sanders Show using Facebook live streaming. As of April 2, 2017, {{guests have}} {{included}} William Barber, Josh Fox, Jane Mayer, and Bill Nye. Nye's episode has 4.6 million views and 25,000 shares.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} audio plays {{have also been}} webcast on bbc.co.uk, {{beginning}} with Death Comes to Time in 2001. The first episode had been made for, and then turned down by, BBC Radio 4 and after an experimental <b>webcasting</b> of this pilot generated over a million page hits, {{the rest of the}} episodes were produced and webcast. The serial featured Sylvester McCoy reprising his role as the Seventh Doctor.|$|E
25|$|In September 2005, MCOT (broadcaster of Channel 9), in {{response}} to allegations that Muangthai Rai Sapda had made inappropriate references to the monarchy, cancelled the program. However, Sondhi felt he was dropped for criticising the Thaksin government. He subsequently started broadcasting his talk show via satellite and <b>webcasting</b> it on the website {{of one of his}} newspapers, doubling his daily number of site visitors. The event became the magnet for oppositions of Thaksin's government.|$|E
50|$|In {{its first}} {{semester}} of existence (Spring 2011), SGSN would <b>webcast</b> 16 varsity events. The 2011-12 school year would see 106 live <b>webcasts,</b> {{along with the}} addition of game highlights and the debut of Squawk Talk. In 2012-13, SGSN partnered with Stretch Internet, improving the quality of <b>webcasts</b> and giving the network the ability to produce even more <b>webcasts.</b> That year's <b>webcast</b> total increased to 140 live <b>webcasts.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1995, Chris Jaeb {{and fellow}} Indiana University alumnus Todd Wagner started Audionet (which Cuban started to fund in 1998), {{combining}} their mutual interest in Indiana Hoosier college basketball and <b>webcasting.</b> With a single server and an ISDN line, Audionet became Broadcast.com in 1998. By 1999, Broadcast.com {{had grown to}} 330 employees and $13.5million in revenue for the second quarter. In 1999, Broadcast.com helped launch the first live-streamed Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. That year, during the dot com boom, Broadcast.com was acquired by Yahoo! for $5.7billion in Yahoo! stock.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, BBCi, the {{interactive}} media {{arm of the}} corporation, who had scored successes with their Doctor Who webcasts (beginning with the aforementioned Death Comes to Time, which was followed by Real Time in 2002 and a re-make of the uncompleted Shada in 2003), decided on a more ambitious project to celebrate the programme's upcoming 40th anniversary. In July 2003, BBCi announced the production of Scream of the Shalka, a fully animated adventure adapted for <b>webcasting</b> with Richard E. Grant as the Doctor and Sir Derek Jacobi as the Master. As there were no concrete plans for producing a new series, BBCi announced Shalka as the official continuation of the programme, and that Grant was the official Ninth Doctor. However, events were soon to overtake that.|$|E
25|$|Television programs, web {{videos and}} social media can also bring an {{understanding}} of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project integrated a one-hour HD documentary, short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition {{as part of the}} educational outreach. <b>Webcasting</b> is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live underwater video of the Queen Anne's Revenge Shipwreck Project was webcast to the Internet {{as a part of the}} QAR DiveLive educational program that reached thousands of children around the world. Created and co-produced by Nautilus Productions and Marine Grafics, this project enabled students to talk to scientists and learn about methods and technologies utilized by the underwater archaeology team.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWebcasts have {{enhanced}} in {{the learning}} procedures of education, however few researches have indicate developmental instructions. In this study, we used a hybrid framework based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, Social Cognitive Theory and Theory of Planned Behavior. We aim to clarify the effect of <b>webcast</b> duration into learners’ intention to adopt <b>webcasts</b> for learning. A survey of 176 <b>webcast</b> based learners found an influence between the duration and learners’ intention to use the <b>webcast.</b> The results indicated that learners who are using longer <b>webcasts</b> have significant higher levels of behavioural intention to use it. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
25|$|A {{slightly}} different Radio 3 {{was launched in}} 2000 as a converged <b>webcasting</b> project based in Vancouver, with its own servers and managed by CBC Radio. The team consisted of Susan Englebert, Robert Ouimet, Dave Tonner, Loc Dao, Rob McLaughlin and other partners. CBC Radio 3 initially launched separate sites 120 Seconds, New Music Canada and Just Concerts through a collaboration between CBC Radio, media design company Dotaku Group, and technology company Internet Edge. Each provided audio, video and Flash content as media-on-demand streaming for site users. 120 Seconds was a directory of user and artist-created video and documentary projects, New Music Canada was composed entirely of user-created and uploaded music by Canadian independent pop, rock, electronic and hip hop musicians, and Just Concerts included exclusive recordings of live performances by independent artists, both regular concert performances and Radio 3 studio sessions. The first musician to create an artist profile on the site was rapper Classified. Roots Music Canada was later added to the trio of websites, and offered songs uploaded by country and folk musicians.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} it can {{be difficult}} to allow access to the results of the archaeological research as underwater sites do not provide good outreach possibilities or access for the general public. Work has been done to bridge this difficulty through the use of the World Wide Web for <b>webcasting</b> projects. An example is [...] the excavation of the Queen Anne's Revenge and the QAR DiveLive program, a live interactive virtual field trip to the wrecksite.|$|E
2500|$|Sanders {{announced}} {{his campaign for}} the Democratic presidential nomination on April 30, 2015. Initially considered a long shot, Sanders won 23 primaries and caucuses and approximately 43% of pledged delegates to Clinton's 55%. His campaign was noted for its supporters' enthusiasm, {{as well as for}} his rejection of large donations from corporations, the financial industry, and any associated Super PAC. On July 12, 2016, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton in her unsuccessful general election campaign against Republican Donald Trump, while urging his supporters to continue the [...] "political revolution" [...] his campaign had begun. In November 2016, Sanders's book [...] was released; upon its release, it was number 3 on The New York Times Best Seller list. In 2016 Sanders formed Our Revolution, a political organization dedicated to educating voters about issues, getting people involved in the political process, and electing progressive candidates. In February 2017, Sanders began <b>webcasting</b> The Bernie Sanders Show on Facebook. Polls taken in 2017 have found Sanders to be the most popular politician in the United States.|$|E
50|$|AOL also {{provided}} a <b>webcast</b> of the entire show as it happened and carried <b>webcasts</b> of {{almost all of the}} Live 8 shows.|$|R
50|$|Viewers who logged {{onto the}} Victoria's Secret's website {{to view the}} company's first <b>webcast</b> of their fashion show on February 3, 1999, were unable to view the <b>webcast</b> due to the Internet {{infrastructure}} Victoria Secret's selected was unable to meet user demand causing some users to be unable to view the <b>webcast.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lukas and {{the band}} were also {{featured}} on an exclusive <b>webcast</b> through Yahoo Music that was shot at TRI Studios (Bob Weir’s studio).

2500|$|With {{the rise}} of the Internet, many new career paths were created. Before the rise, many {{technical}} jobs were seen as nerdy. The Internet led to creative work that was seen as laid-back and diverse amongst sex, race, and sexual orientation. Web design, gaming design, <b>webcasting,</b> blogging, and animation are all creative career paths that came with this rise. At first glance, the field of new media may seem hip, cool, creative and relaxed. [...] What many don't realize is that working in this field is tiresome. Many of the people that work in this field don't have steady jobs. Work in this field has become project-based. Individuals work project to project for different companies. Most people are not working on one project or contract, but multiple ones at the same time. Despite working on numerous projects, people in this industry receive low payments, which is highly contrasted with the techy millionaire stereotype. It may seem as a carefree life from the outside, but it is not. [...] New media workers work long hours for little pay and spend up to 20 hours a week looking for new projects to work on.|$|E
2500|$|Diver trails {{also called}} wreck trails {{can be used}} to allow scuba-divers to visit and {{understand}} archaeological sites that are suitable for scuba-diving One excellent example is the Florida Public Archaeology Network's (FPAN) [...] "Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail." [...] The Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail features 12 shipwrecks including artificial reefs and a variety of sea life for diving, snorkeling and fishing offshore of Pensacola, Destin, Panama City and Port St. Joe, Florida. Otherwise presentation will typically rely on publication (book or journal articles, web-sites and electronic media such as CD-ROM). Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project integrated a one-hour HD documentary, short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. <b>Webcasting</b> is also another tool for educational outreach.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{a context for}} models of <b>webcasts</b> and {{webinars}} {{from the perspective of}} a UK higher education Institution and the corporate training setting. Our synthesis of technical and pedagogic elements arises from these e-learning and marketing considerations and forms a proposal for the Interactive New-media <b>Webcast</b> design (INWeb). Three <b>webcast</b> models are compared with respect to moderated text discussion, the presenterʼs capacity and the type of content engagement for the online event as a key component of the new design model. These e-learning <b>webcast</b> models are triangulated with Garrisonʼs (2004) distance learning historical timeline and Pincasʼ (2007) collection of pedagogic designs known as the 3 Ps (Presentation, Practice and Performance). A critique of our mini-case studies is our way to ground the e-learning theory in real-world examples of use. These <b>webcast</b> illustrations are presented from both a business and academic perspective. Mooreʼs (1993, 1996) Transactional Distance Theory (TDT) is critically reviewed for its application to the pedagogic design of the INWeb model. Dialogue and structure are analysed to see the impact on the autonomous learner as a <b>webcast</b> participant. The transactional distance between the <b>webcast</b> presenter and the online viewer/ callers is explored in the context of the <b>webcast</b> content as a learner-generated Web 2. 0 dynamic resource for learning and marketing. Our summary reflections then discuss how the current <b>webcast</b> models may be extended if we provide a framework informed by the Evolutionary Graph Theory and Metcalfeʼs Law (Hendler, 2008) as possible theoretical positions to tie together the professional social network and Web 2. 0 elements to future interactive New-media <b>Webcast</b> Designs...|$|R
