Unlike the other examples, neither station had a pre-existing newscast at the time; WUTR's original news department was closed in 2003 by previous owner Clear Channel Communications as a cost-saving measure, and WFXV had never aired local news programming at all. Its slate included early and late evening newscasts on WUTR, an encore of WUTR's evening newscast on WPNY, and a 10:00p.m. newscast on WFXV with a faster, younger-skewing format. The station's executive vice president, Steve Merren (who had come from NBC affiliate WKTV, which had the sole television news operation in the market prior {{to the formation of}} Nexstar's Eyewitness News operation) believed that it [...] " [...] important that the community has another source of news. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> newspaper and one news station and the community could benefit from another voice." ...|$|E

On one occasion, {{when they were}} having difficulty in the heat, Jardine said: [...] "Thank God <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> bowler in the side"—referring to Verity. The two men admired each other greatly. Verity {{was impressed with the}} depth of Jardine's thinking on the game and his intelligence, enjoying tactical discussions with him on the voyage to Australia. According to Alan Hill, Verity did not relish the Bodyline tactics on that tour but supported his captain's stance completely. Verity even named his second son Douglas after Jardine. Jardine considered Verity to be the best slow left-arm bowler of all time, writing: [...] "I venture to doubt whether any other bowler of his type has proved such a master on all kinds of wickets... No captain could have a greater asset on his side than Verity. He would make a great captain himself." [...] Historian David Frith writes that Verity was [...] "probably the cricketer [...] admired above all others", while Bob Wyatt believed the two men were very similar in outlook, temperament and desire to succeed.|$|E

In a statement on the difficulties facing the US rollout, BBC’s Head of Communications for Global iPlayer Tessa Matchett said: [...] "The United States {{is a very complex}} media market.

2500|$|A Judex (pl. judices), is {{what was}} known in medieval Gaelic as Brithem or Breitheamh, and later {{becoming}} known in English as doomster. The institution is so Gaelic in nature that it is rarely translated by scholars. It probably represents a post-Norman continuity with the ancient Gaelic orders of lawmen called in English today Brehons. However, in rare cases, the term was also used for similar Anglo-Saxon officials in the English-speaking lands of the Scottish king. Bearers of the office almost always have Gaelic names north of the Forth or in the south-west; continental names are rare. Judices were often royal officials who supervised baronial, abbatial and other lower-ranking [...] "courts". They {{seem to have been}} officials who, at least in the thirteenth century, were designated by province, for example, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> styled Bozli judice Mernis (i.e. [...] "Bozli, Brehon of The Mearns"). There also existed an official called the judex regis (i.e. [...] "King's Brehon"), and perhaps this status was a way of ranking various orders of Gaelic lawmen.|$|E
