5|$|Maxwell {{made this}} {{announcement}} on a Saturday when most Football League clubs, including Oxford and Reading, were playing League fixtures. Oxford were playing away at Doncaster Rovers. Jim Smith {{learned of the}} announcement shortly before kick-off at Doncaster's Belle Vue ground from John Ley, a journalist with the Oxford Mail, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> the news from another newsman by telephone. Smith immediately called Maxwell to ask {{whether or not he}} would be retained to manage Thames Valley Royals, and was told that he would be.|$|E

Joe Ranft, member of Pixar's story team, played Heimlich the caterpillar {{at the suggestion of}} Lasseter's wife, Nancy, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> him playing the character on a scratch vocal track.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of these}} Arab raids, an {{invasion}} under a certain Maimun al-Gurgunami ("Maimun the Mardaite") took place, which raided Cilicia and was defeated by a Byzantine army under a general named Marianus near Tyana. The dating of this expedition is unclear; although the primary account, by al-Baladhuri, places it under Abd al-Malik (who died in 705), it is commonly dated to 706 by modern scholars. According to Baladhuri, this Maimun had been a slave of Caliph Muawiyah's sister, who had fled to the Mardaites, a group of Christian rebels in northern Syria. After the Mardaites had been subdued, the general Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> of his valour, liberated him and entrusted him with a military command, and later swore to avenge his death.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of her debut studio album, Breaking Night (1989), La India went on to produce When the Night is Over (1991), a {{collaboration}} between her then-husband Little Louie Vega and Marc Anthony. Both albums were recorded {{at the time when}} freestyle music's popularity was beginning to wane, and neither was a commercial success. India and Vega left Atlantic Records, as India wanted to pursue her singing career performing in Spanish. Three years later, American musician Eddie Palmieri, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> her singing on the radio, wrote and produced India's first Spanish-language record titled Llegó la India, via Eddie Palmieri (1992). Although it was a commercial success, her high-pitched vocals were criticized.|$|E
5|$|Pitts and Tuck renamed {{their product}} from Spacewar to Galaxy Game due to anti-war {{sentiment}} and founded {{a company called}} Mini-Computer Applications in June 1971 to operate the game as it neared completion. The development of the prototype machine took around {{three and a half}} months. By August, they were well into development and had gotten permission to place the machine at the Tresidder student union building at Stanford as a test site. It was then that they received a call from Nolan Bushnell, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> of their project and wanted to show them his similar project he was working on.|$|E
5|$|Shadrick's {{family was}} {{informed}} {{of his death}} by a neighbor <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> his name on a radio broadcast, and the news from the military came via telegraph several days later. The family was immediately inundated by reporters and local well-wishers. Shadrick's body was returned to the United States, and on June 17, 1951, a funeral attended by hundreds of local residents was held in Beckley, West Virginia. The service was set {{to coincide with the}} anniversary of the start of the war. His flag-draped casket was escorted down the streets of the town on a horse-drawn carriage, and he was buried at the American Legion cemetery in the town.|$|E

5|$|Alvarado {{arrived at}} Buena Esperanza {{in the middle}} of its abandonment. His sudden {{appearance}} halted the exodus, and many colonists who had already left returned. Cerezeda sent messages from Naco, imploring Alvarado to take over as governor of the province. The town council joined in session and installed Alvarado as justicia mayor (chief judge), and as captain-general of Honduras-Higueras until the Crown appointed someone else, or confirmed him in his post. Alvarado's presence turned Spanish morale around overnight. The factions that had plagued the colonial government dissipated, and the colonists rallied around the new governor. Alvarado, known to the natives by his Nahuatl nickname Tonatiuh, had a fearsome reputation amongst the indigenous population, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> of his ruthless exploits elsewhere. Alvarado rapidly re-established firm Spanish control over the area around Buena Esperanza and founded a military encampment in Tencoa. He successfully established profitable gold and silver mines in Higueras.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1802, Wrexham was visited by a troupe of {{travelling}} comedians. One of the leaders, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> Randles play, requested that she performed with them. Before the age of two, she joined the troupe at Wrexham theatre to play Ar hyd y nos and The Downfall of Paris. There, she played her pieces with an apple and slice of cake {{on either side of}} the piano, receiving both when she finished for playing well. Over the next nine months, Randles played at the houses of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, Lady Dungannon and Lady Cunliffe. Williams-Wynn proposed that Randles play in a Wrexham concert during the spring of 1803, under the direction of the Welsh harpist John Parry. The concert was postponed a number of times due to the illness of Randles' mother, who insisted they carry on without her. On the night of the concert, Randles' mother died, after hearing that it was a success.|$|E
5|$|As they left, {{thousands}} of National Guardsmen <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> the news were assembling at the Place de Grève. The Marquis de Lafayette, in Paris as their commander-in-chief, discovered to his dismay that his soldiers were largely {{in favor of}} the march and were being egged on by agitators to join in. Even though he was one of France's greatest war heroes, Lafayette could not dissuade his troops and they began threatening to desert. Rather than see them leave as another anarchic mob, the Parisian municipal government told Lafayette to guide their movements; they also instructed him to request that the king return voluntarily to Paris to satisfy the people. Sending a swift horseman forward to warn Versailles, Lafayette contemplated the near mutiny of his men: he was aware that many of them had openly promised to kill him if he did not lead or get out of the way. At four o'clock in the afternoon, fifteen thousand guards with several thousand more civilian latecomers set off for Versailles. Lafayette reluctantly took his place at the head of their column, hoping to protect the king and public order.|$|E

5|$|In 112, Zhang {{was summoned}} {{to the court of}} Emperor An (r.106–125), <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> of his {{expertise}} in mathematics. When he was nominated to serve at the capital, Zhang was escorted by carriage—a symbol of his official status—to Luoyang, where he became a court gentleman working for the Imperial Secretariat. He was promoted to Chief Astronomer for the court, serving his first term from 115–120 under Emperor An and his second under the succeeding emperor from 126–132. As Chief Astronomer, Zhang was a subordinate of the Minister of Ceremonies, one of Nine Ministers ranked just below the Three Excellencies. In addition to recording heavenly observations and portents, preparing the calendar, and reporting which days were auspicious and which ill-omened, Zhang was also in charge of an advanced literacy test for all candidates to the Imperial Secretariat and the Censorate, both of whose members were required to know at least 9,000 characters and all major writing styles. Under Emperor An, Zhang also served as Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages under the Ministry of Guards, in charge of receiving memorials to the throne (formal essays on policy and administration) as well as nominees for official appointments.|$|E

25|$|An early Anglo-Saxon {{depiction}} survives on the Franks Casket (early 7th century, whalebone carving), {{the only}} Christian scene, which {{is combined with}} pagan and classical imagery. In its composition it follows the oriental style, which renders a courtly scene, with the Virgin and Christ facing the spectator, while the Magi devoutly approach from the (left) side. Even amongst non-Christians <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> of the Christian story of the Magi, the motif was quite popular, since the Magi had endured a long journey and were generous. Instead of an angel, the picture places a swan-like bird, perhaps interpretable as the hero's fylgja (a protecting spirit, and shapeshifter).|$|E
25|$|The word {{is derived}} from feeling; it was a USinfluenced popular musical fashion of the late 40s and the 50s. It {{describes}} a style of post-microphone jazz-influenced romantic song (crooning). Its Cuban roots were in the bolero and the canción. Some Cuban quartets, such as Cuarteto d'Aida and Los Zafiros, modelled themselves on U.S. close-harmony groups. Others were singers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Nat King Cole. Filín singers included César Portillo de la Luz, José Antonio Méndez, who spent a decade in Mexico from 1949 to 1959, Frank Domínguez, the blind pianist Frank Emilio Flynn, and the great singers of boleros Elena Burke and the still-performing Omara Portuondo, who both came from the Cuarteto d'Aida.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} day of the siege, early at dawn, Muttawmp had his men fill a village wagon with {{combustible}} material and direct it at the fortified house, hoping to set it on fire and in that way force the defenders out. However, the plan did not work because of heavy rains which began to pour while the wagon was in preparation. During the confusion that accompanied the execution of the plan, Ephraim Curtis managed to sneak out of the house and made a successful run for the woods. He eventually made it to Marlborough although by that time colonial soldiers had already been alerted by some travelers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> gunfire near Brookfield. As a result, a group of men under Major Simon Willard were already on their way to relieve the besieged.|$|E
25|$|At around 10:00pm, some 200 men {{attacked}} {{the residence of}} Lafontaine, who was at home and without a guard. It was around 5:00pm when he learned of a rumour circulating in town saying that his house {{was going to be}} attacked.

Around the same time, some friends <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> the rumour arrived on their own to help him defend his life and his property. Among them were Étienne-Paschal Taché, C.-J.

25|$|Chambers won the {{starring}} role in film director David Cronenberg's low-budget Canadian movie Rabid, which was released in 1977. Cronenberg stated {{that he wanted to}} cast Sissy Spacek in the film lead, but the studio vetoed his choice because of her accent. Spacek's film Carrie was released during this film's production and proved to be a massive hit (and a movie poster for the film appears when the main character walks by a movie theater at 59:15). The director says that the idea of casting Chambers came from producer Ivan Reitman, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> that Chambers was looking for a mainstream role. Reitman felt that {{it would be easier to}} market the film in different territories if the well-known porn star portrayed the main character. Cronenberg stated that Chambers put in a lot of hard work on the film and that he was impressed with her. Cronenberg further states he had not seen Behind the Green Door prior to casting her.|$|E
