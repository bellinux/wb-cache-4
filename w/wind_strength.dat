2500|$|When the towing cable broke, {{at about}} 70 miles off shore on November 27, the barge {{displayed}} lights {{and put up}} part of the main sail to keep the bow into the wind. [...] The crew of the barge saw {{the lights of the}} tug for about 15 minutes after the tow line broke. [...] When the barge crew was able to raise all the sails, the barge could still make no headway to windward, and instead drifted in a northwesterly direction for about 35 hours. [...] Wheeler made a zig-zag course, governed by the <b>wind</b> <b>strength</b> [...] and direction, back east towards the Oregon coast, eventually spotting the Yaquina Head Light at about 7:00 pm on Tuesday.|$|E

50|$|Wind {{power in}} New Zealand shares the {{difficulties}} typical to other nations (uneven <b>wind</b> <b>strengths,</b> ideal locations often remote from power demand areas). The Tararua Wind Farm averages {{slightly more than}} New Zealand's 45% full capacity usage (in other words, wind farms in New Zealand produce more than double their average energy during periods of maximum useful <b>wind</b> <b>strengths).</b> However, the New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority figures indicate that wind power {{is also expected to}} operate at maximum capacity for around 4,000 hours a year, much more than for example the approximately 2,000 hours (Germany) to 3,000 hours (Scotland, Wales, Western Ireland) found in European countries.|$|R
2500|$|In exposed systems, wind {{can create}} turbulent, spiral-formed surface {{currents}} called Langmuir circulations (Fig. 3). [...] Exactly how these currents become established {{is still not}} well understood, but {{it is evident that}} it involves some interaction between horizontal surface currents and surface gravity waves. [...] The visible result of these rotations, which can be seen in any lake, are the surface foamlines that run parallel to the wind direction. [...] Positively buoyant particles and small organisms concentrate in the foamline at the surface and negatively buoyant objects are found in the upwelling current between the two rotations. [...] Objects with neutral buoyancy tend to be evenly distributed in the water column. This turbulence circulates nutrients in the water column, making it crucial for many pelagic species, however its effect on benthic and profundal organisms is minimal to non-existent, respectively. The degree of nutrient circulation is system specific, as it depends upon such factors as <b>wind</b> <b>strength</b> and duration, as well as lake or pool depth and productivity.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} [...] {{people thought that}} the master of Vosburg had not done {{everything}} he could have to rescue the barge. [...] The surviving crew of the Wheeler “severely condemned” {{the actions of the}} captain of the Vosburg, saying that Vosburg had recently taken on a fresh supply of coal at Coos Bay and that on board Wheeler there was another towing cable of better quality than the one which had broken. [...] Later, “Mike” Olderman, who along with J.W. Cole, {{had been one of the}} first two crewmen washed off Wheeler into the surf, said they after the towing cable had broken, the crew of Wheeler had tried to attract the attention of Vosburg by building a large fire on the deck, using oil to increase its size. [...] According to Olderman, the barge was not in danger until many hours later when the <b>wind</b> <b>strength</b> increased to that of a hurricane. [...] Capt. W.H.

2500|$|A {{court of}} inquiry found that the loss was due to a known design flaw {{identified}} in tank testing. The flaw resulted {{in the loss of}} the RHIB and water entering the cargo deck after the doors were opened by the sea. As a result of this the doors were tied shut. The {{court of inquiry}} also reported slamming of the bow and propellers leaving the water. Options to resolve the design problems on the ship include closing the alcoves in which the ship's boats had been stowed. At the time the RHIB was lost, the ship's log records the weather conditions as being a <b>wind</b> <b>strength</b> of , gusting to , a swell of [...] (sea state six), and a completely overcast, very dark night. The alcoves are [...] above the waterline and were swamped by the waves and because the ship was experiencing severe motion, rolling up to 28 degrees to port, at a roll frequency of 11.5 seconds. The ship's anti-roll system will not function when the period of the ship's roll is less than 11.9 seconds. As a result, work was begun to relocate the boats to a less vulnerable location.|$|E

50|$|A major {{engineering}} {{reason to}} choose copper windings over aluminium is space considerations. This is because a copper-wound transformer {{can be made}} smaller than aluminium transformers.

30|$|Urban areas often {{suffer from}} {{so-called}} urban heat islands (UHIs), characterized by aridity, heat and lower <b>wind</b> <b>strengths</b> {{compared to the}} rural surroundings (Arnfield 2003). Typical physical legacies of mining activities such as wet areas affected by subsidence or dry, wind-exposed dumps can help to mitigate the impact of UHIs if such sites are made safe, free of pollution and planted with specific forms of vegetation to create valuable habitats. Climate-regulating ecosystem services are becoming ever more important to help counter the impact of climate change. In particular, water-logged ground as well as water bodies, which frequently emerge in former mining areas, can mitigate strong temperature differences or serve as pathways for the inflow of cold, fresh air from rural to urban areas. Also, the shift in airflows caused by dumps and hollows could boost air movement and thus balance the UHI.|$|R
