5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen. Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she <b>will</b> <b>sing</b> for him alone ("").|$|E
5|$|Like other white-eyes, {{the golden}} white-eye is diurnal. In {{contrast}} to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, the golden white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young. The golden white-eye is also territorial, and pairs <b>will</b> <b>sing</b> throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The golden white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of {{them in order to}} disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, and in fact the rufous fantail seeks out the golden white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The golden white-eye is socially dominant over the bridled white-eyes and rufous fantails, but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.|$|E

25|$|The show {{is noted}} for {{starting}} and ending each episode with a musical performance {{by either the}} in-house band and singers, or guests, or sometimes both. Performances also occur at random points throughout the show, usually after a correct answer. These performances are usually shorter in length than the proper song's length to accommodate a 30-minute time slot. The game is played entirely for cash, with the show's winner playing the Golden Medley for 10,000 zloty. On some occasions, Janowski himself <b>will</b> <b>sing.</b>|$|E

25|$|A Groom {{comes to}} talk to Richard in his office about the {{disappearance}} of a horse named Caesar ("Late Last Night I'm In The Cellars"). Richard decides that the man is an idiot and promptly fires him. Raoul, feeling betrayed, meets with Christine at a local graveyard ("All Of My Dreams Faded Suddenly"). He is then introduced to the angelic voice of the Angel Of Music ("While Floating High Above"). Christine leaves and The Phantom attempts to throttle Raoul, but is disturbed by a Grave Digger, and runs off. Back at the Opera House, the unfortunate Richard has had to stand by while his son pursues the chorus girl Christine Daae, and now must convince his diva Carlotta, who feels she is too ill to perform, to sing at the performance later that evening, {{with the help of}} his staff ("She Says She's Got The Nodules"). An agreement is made that Christine Daae <b>will</b> <b>sing</b> the role, while Carlotta mimes the act.|$|E
25|$|The song {{structure}} {{consists of}} four pushups, singing the chorus and verse through four times. In each chorus the melody is introduced or led off by the lead singer whose is then seconded by another singer who begins to vary the melody {{before the end of}} the leader's first line. They are then joined by the entire chorus for the rest of the pushup. Three down strokes or hard beats mark the end of the chorus and beginning of the verse, and during these drummers will alter their dancing such as by hopping low like fancy dancers. An increase in tempo and volume on the last five beats marks the end of the final verse. The dancing stops on the final beat and then a tail, or coda, finishes the song with a shortened chorus. Sometimes a drum group <b>will</b> <b>sing</b> the song more than four times, particularly when the song feels good and the singers seize the moment for an extra pushup or two (or more), or when a dancer blows a whistle or passes his staff or fan over the drum to signal that the song is to be continued four extra pushups while he prays.|$|E

25|$|At the {{gambling}} tables, Vicomte de Trévilhac, Capréola, Trevulce and the Marquis Attavanti (all {{supporters of the}} Kingdom of Naples), discuss the French defeat at Genoa earlier that month, their apparent defeat at Marengo, and the disappearance of Angelotti and Cavaradossi. Princesse Orlonia and other ladies of the court join them. All discuss the cantata by Paisiello which Tosca <b>will</b> <b>sing</b> later that evening {{as part of the}} victory celebrations. Baron Scarpia arrives and there is further discussion of Angelotti's escape, cut short by the arrival of Tosca. Queen Marie Caroline enters for the performance of the cantata accompanied by Paisiello, Prince Diego Naselli, courtiers, musicians, Austrian army officers, and monsignors. She reiterates her demand that Scarpia capture Angelotti and have him hanged. Scarpia must now find the fugitive's hiding place as quickly as possible. Hoping to provoke Tosca into leading him to Cavaradossi and Angelotti, he takes her aside and shows her the Marquise Attavanti's fan, intimating that she and Cavaradossi are lovers. Tosca is overcome with jealousy. As the cantata performance is about to begin, couriers arrive with a letter announcing that the French had been victorious at the Battle of Marengo after all. The Queen faints. Tosca throws the pages of her score into the air and rushes out with her maid. Scarpia orders his men to follow her carriage.|$|E

500|$|An ancient Greek and Roman adage runs [...] "The swans <b>will</b> <b>sing</b> {{when the}} jackdaws are silent", meaning that educated or wise people will speak {{only after the}} foolish have become quiet. In Ancient Greek folklore, a jackdaw can be caught with a dish of oil. A narcissistic creature, it falls in while looking at its own reflection. The mythical Princess Arne Sithonis was bribed with gold by King Minos of Crete, and was punished by the gods for her greed by being {{transformed}} into an equally avaricious jackdaw, who still seeks shiny things. The Roman poet Ovid described jackdaws as harbingers of rain in his poetic work Amores. Pliny notes how the Thessalians, Illyrians, and Lemnians cherished jackdaws for destroying grasshoppers' eggs. The Veneti are fabled to have bribed the jackdaws to spare their crops.|$|E
500|$|Act 2 {{begins with}} a short prelude, based on a melody that José <b>will</b> <b>sing</b> offstage before his next entry. A festive scene in the inn precedes Escamillo's tumultuous entrance, in which brass and {{percussion}} provide prominent backing while the crowd sings along. The quintet that follows is described by Newman as [...] "of incomparable verve and musical wit". José's appearance precipitates a long mutual wooing scene; Carmen sings, dances and plays the castanets; a distant cornet-call summoning José to duty is blended with Carmen's melody {{so as to be}} barely discernible. A muted reference to the fate motif on an English horn leads to José's [...] "Flower Song", a flowing continuous melody that ends pianissimo on a sustained high B-flat. José's insistence that, despite Carmen's blandishments, he must return to duty leads to a quarrel; the arrival of Zuniga, the consequent fight and José's unavoidable ensnarement into the lawless life culminates musically in the triumphant hymn to freedom that closes the act.|$|E
500|$|She {{was known}} for having a dynamic vocal range, and was {{described}} as having an emotional awareness during her performances. She occasionally danced during her shows, and was described as having a sensuous presence on stage. She was able to vary her voice considerably: an obituary remarked that she [...] "could soar like an opera singer, but she could also whisper, roar, hiss, growl and shout. She could sing while making the epiglottal clicks of the Xhosa language." [...] She sang in English and several African languages, but never in Afrikaans, {{the language of the}} apartheid government in South Africa. She once stated [...] "When Afrikaaners sing in my language, then I <b>will</b> <b>sing</b> theirs." [...] English was seen as the language of political resistance by black South Africans due to the educational barriers they faced under apartheid; the Manhattan Brothers, with whom Makeba had sung in Sophiatown, had been prohibited from recording in English. Her songs in African languages have been described as reaffirming black pride.|$|E

500|$|When alone, a magpie {{may make}} a quiet musical warbling; these complex melodious warbles or subsongs are pitched at 2–4 [...] KHz and do not carry for long distances. These songs have been {{recorded}} up to 70 minutes in duration and are more frequent {{after the end of}} the breeding season. Pairs of magpies often take up a loud musical calling known as carolling to advertise or defend their territory; one bird initiates the call with the second (and sometimes more) joining in. Often preceded by warbling, carolling is pitched between 6 and 8 [...] kHz and has 4–5 elements with slurring indistinct noise in between. Birds will adopt a specific posture by tilting their heads back, expanding their chests, and moving their wings backwards. A group of magpies <b>will</b> <b>sing</b> a short repetitive version of carolling just before dawn (dawn song), and at twilight after sundown (dusk song), in winter and spring.|$|E
500|$|When {{musician}} Randy Castillo {{died from}} cancer in 2002, Slash, McKagan, and Sorum performed at a benefit concert {{to raise money}} and commemorate Castillo with Josh Todd and Keith Nelson of Buckcherry as well as B-Real and Sen Dog of Cypress Hill. Recognizing that their musical relationship was still intact, the trio began rehearsing with Todd and Nelson, working on material that would become [...] "Dirty Little Thing", but eventually decided against forming a group with them. During a Loaded show at West Hollywood's Viper Room, McKagan introduced Kushner to Slash, who were previously friends in {{junior high and high}} school. Kushner was invited to jam with the group and was soon invited to join with Slash, stating that [...] "Dave brought a cool vibe to what [...] were doing. There was no deliberation; that was it, it was a perfect fit." [...] Their former Guns N' Roses band mate Izzy Stradlin also joined them for two weeks, eventually suggesting that [...] "Duff and [...] <b>will</b> <b>sing</b> and [...] will just do a club tour in a van." [...] Slash states in his autobiography that {{it was hard to tell}} if Stradlin was serious or kidding. After auditioning Kelly Shaefer of Atheist and Neurotica, Stradlin left the group.|$|E
