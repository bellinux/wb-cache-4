5|$|After Gordon fends off a Combine {{attack on}} the base, Alyx gives Dr. Kleiner the message from Judith Mossman {{recovered}} at the Citadel. It contains footage and the coordinates of the Borealis, an Aperture Science research vessel which, Kleiner explains, vanished along with part of the surrounding drydock. Kleiner insists {{that it should be}} used to aid the Resistance effort, while Eli counters {{that it is impossible to}} control and must be destroyed. They agree that Alyx and Gordon will travel to the Borealis and attempt to find Mossman. Alyx unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, shaking him. Alone with Gordon, Eli reveals that it was the G-Man who provided the test sample that caused the Black Mesa incident, and that he <b>whispered</b> <b>the</b> same warning to him as Gordon entered the test chamber. He promises to explain more after the portal is closed.|$|E
5|$|Ramram hoped his {{son would}} {{follow in his}} profession, but Ramprasad showed no {{interest}} in practical pursuits. As he grew up, his spiritual inclinations caused {{a great deal of}} anxiety to his parents. Believing that marriage would make Ramprasad more responsible, his parents married him to a girl named Sarvani when he was twenty-two years old. In keeping with the family custom, the newly wed couple was initiated by the family's spiritual teacher, Madhavacharya. According to traditional accounts, during initiation when the guru <b>whispered</b> <b>the</b> mantra to him, Ramprasad became consumed by intense longing for the goddess Kali. One year after the initiation he lost his guru. Ramprasad later became the disciple of Krishnananda Agamavagisha, a Tantric yogi and scholar. Agamavagisha was a well known devotee of Kali {{and the author of the}} Bengali book Tantrasara. Agamavagisha instructed Ramprasad in Tantric sadhanas (spiritual disciplines) and worship of Kali.|$|E
500|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} January 1945; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present. Raitt was {{presented}} with the lyrics for [...] "Soliloquy" [...] on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the piece ran nearly eight minutes. [...] Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he {{felt that they were}} never fully addressed. [...] At some point during rehearsals, Molnár came to see what they had done to his play. [...] There are a number of variations on the story. [...] As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár {{in the rear of the}} theatre and <b>whispered</b> <b>the</b> news to his partner. [...] Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go right. [...] At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. [...] Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, [...] "What you have done is so beautiful. [...] And you know what I like best? [...] The ending!" [...] Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.|$|E

500|$|Müller was {{not without}} support in the press. An {{editorial}} in The Times on 29 October 1860 called him [...] "nothing more nor less than the best Sanscrit scholar in the world." [...] It compared the situation to the 1832 election, when there had also been a choice between the best scholar (Wilson) and a good scholar [...] "who was held to have made the most Christian use of the gift" [...] (William Hodge Mill). Williams, it said, appeared as [...] "the University man... the man sufficiently qualified for the post, and, above all, as the man in whose hands, it is <b>whispered,</b> <b>the</b> interests of Christianity will be perfectly safe." [...] His proposal not to teach history, philosophy, mythology or comparative philology [...] "seems to strip the subject very bare" [...] and would, it thought, leave the post as [...] "an empty chair." [...] It stated that Müller [...] "best answers {{to the terms of}} Colonel Boden's foundation." [...] His field of study– the oldest period of Sanskrit literature– [...] "must be the key of the whole position", whereas Williams was only familiar with the later, [...] "less authentic, and less sacred" [...] writings. The editorial ended by saying that Oxford [...] "will not choose the less learned candidate; at all events, it will not accept from him that this is the true principle of a sound Christian election." ...|$|E
500|$|Faulkner is {{considered}} one of the foremost American writers on race in the United States, and his novels, including Light in August, often explore the persistent obsession with blood and race in the South that have carried over from the antebellum era to the 21st century. Christmas has light skin but is viewed as a foreigner by the people he meets, and the children in the orphanage in which he was raised call him [...] "nigger." [...] Chapter 6 begins with the oft-cited sentence: Memory believes before knowing remembers and gives an account of the five year old Christmas amongst the uniform denim of the other children. The first reference to him though is not by these children but by the dietitian who gave him a dollar to not tell about her amorous adventure with an intern doctor. However suspicion must fall on Doc Hines Joe's derranged grandfather who placed him in the orphanage and stays on as the boilerman. It is he who may have <b>whispered</b> <b>the</b> lie about the liitle boy's origines to the other children. Because of this, Joe Christmas is fixated on the idea that he has some African American blood, which Faulkner never confirms, and views his parentage as an original sin that has tainted his body and actions since birth. Because of his obsessive struggle with his twin identities, black and white, Christmas lives his life always on the road. The secret of his blackness is one that he abhors as well as cherishes; he often willingly tells white people that he is black in order to see their extreme reactions and becomes violent when one white Northern woman reacts nonchalantly. Though Christmas is guilty of violent crimes, Faulkner emphasizes that he is under the sway of social and psychological forces that are beyond his control and force him to reenact the part of the mythical black murderer and rapist from Southern history.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to another}} tradition, the devil {{appeared}} to Cain and instructed {{him how to}} exact revenge on Abel. [...] "Hit Abel's head with a stone and kill him", <b>whispered</b> <b>the</b> devil to Cain. After the murder, the devil hurried to Eve shouting: [...] "Eve! Cain has murdered Abel!". Eve {{did not know what}} murder was or how death felt like. She asked, bewildered and horrified, [...] "Woe to you! What is murder?". [...] "He [...] does not eat. He does not drink. He does not move [...] ", answered the Devil. Eve burst out into tears and started to wail madly. She ran to Adam and tried to tell him what happened. However, she could not speak because she could not stop wailing. Since then, women wail brokenheartedly when a loved one dies. A different tradition narrates that while Cain was quarreling with Abel, the devil killed an animal with a stone in Cain's sight to show him how to murder Abel.|$|E
2500|$|Clark, Vines, and Harlan <b>whispered</b> <b>the</b> {{password}} {{to viewers}} {{on the first}} two versions of the show, but the practice was discontinued, beginning with Password All-Stars, when a computer (referred to as [...] "Murphy" [...] on-camera by Allen Ludden) was incorporated; it would display the password, one letter at a time (like a typewriter), followed by the quotation marks. A beeping sound would accompany each letter as it appeared on the screen. A final beep would signal that the password was revealed to the home viewer, and play would start. On Password Plus, a bell would ring when the password was revealed. On Super Password from September 24, 1984 to October 31, 1986, a chirping sound was heard when the password was revealed. However, Gene Wood began whispering the words on Super Password just like in the original, starting on November 3, 1986. The practice was again discontinued on Million Dollar Password.|$|E
