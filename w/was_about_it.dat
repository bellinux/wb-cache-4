25|$|However, it was {{a superb}} spell by Alan Davidson with the new ball in England's second innings that turned a {{hitherto}} evenly-poised game towards Australia. 'Davo', with his late swing and cut, was a superb bowler at his best, and this <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>it...</b> Soon after lunch {{on the fourth day}} it was over, and England had gone - oh, so mildly.|$|E
500|$|For the {{destruction}} of the Bus, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s plane that serves as a mobile command center, series lead visual effects provider FuseFX were able to storyboard and plot out the sequence earlier than usual, before creating a completely computer generated sequence in which the plane is hit by a missile while flying in the arctic. As the plane is brought down, [...] "pieces of wreckage catch fire and burn as they fall to earth. There is also a smaller plane that flies through the airborne debris. It’s a very complex sequence, combining CG, effects simulations and pyrotechnics." [...] Series visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack elaborated that [...] "Doing fire realistically on television is a tall order. You don’t get the representation of what a real fire element looks like using software, but the guys at FuseFX, those FX animators are amazing. It takes a long time and a lot of set up to get things right. And it wasn’t just the fire, it was the smoke and the debris, and then it was the cloaking device, and May [...] in the cockpit and it was May on bluescreen. Between Houdini and the particles we had to create for that one shot—a big giant virtual shot where we had a QuinJet come down and all the debris is falling all around and there’s fire and smoke, that sequence was what that episode <b>was</b> <b>about.</b> <b>It</b> was a big scene to pull off." ...|$|E
500|$|American {{musician}} Shawn Colvin guest {{starred in}} the episode as Rachel Jordan, a character that she would later return to voice in the episode [...] "I'm Goin' to Praiseland" [...] (2001) from season twelve. In that episode, she stays at the Flanders' house with Ned, and leaves briefly after he attempted to mold her {{in the image of}} his deceased wife. At the end of the episode, however, she returns and has a date with him. Colvin told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that being raised in Carbondale, Illinois meant she did not have to do much research for the guest appearance: [...] "It's just very isolated [...] There was church music and that <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] I didn't have to dig too deep for the role. I suppose the whole 'Simpsons' thing is kind of like a hick town." [...] Colvin has shown a segment of her guest role on The Simpsons during some of her concerts, including one at Cape Cod Melody Tent in 2007. She has also performed the song that she sings in [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily" [...] in concert. The Wisconsin State Journal reported that during her 2001 concert at Barrymore Theatre, the [...] "loudest audience response came after she sang a ditty that she performed as a character on The Simpsons." [...] The song, called [...] "He's the Man", later appeared on the 2007 soundtrack album [...]|$|E

500|$|Rihanna {{began to}} film the music video for [...] "Diamonds" [...] on October 21, 2012, at the Mojave Desert in Lancaster, California. It was {{directed}} by her regular collaborator Anthony Mandler, who previously directed her videos for [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] (2009) and [...] "Man Down" [...] (2011). Photographs of the production leaked to the press the same day and showed Rihanna in a white and black dress {{in front of a}} fire. Ethan Sacks of the New York Daily News remarked that she [...] "looked like a gem on the set of her video shoot." [...] Rihanna said that she wanted the video's abstract scenes to capture the appropriate emotion for the audience. Mandler sought to create a [...] "wider landscape" [...] by suggesting and transfiguring ideas for viewers through the video: [...] "hey needed to feel like dream vignettes, like, when you wake up from a dream, you realize what you were dreaming about is not really what it <b>was</b> <b>about,</b> <b>it</b> was about something else." [...] He also tried to relate the video's concept to Rihanna's personal life: [...] "What's truth or fiction? You know 'Is she drowning, or is she in complete ecstasy? Are those hands coming apart, or are they finding each other?' ... we tried to bring up these deeper questions that relate to song and her life and finding beauty in chaos and finding beauty in pain and finding pain in beauty." [...] On November 7, a behind-the-scenes video was posted on MTV's official website. It featured Rihanna in a [...] "leopard-print" [...] robe as she emerged from a trailer and headed to the shooting set. The scenes were intercut with police officers who chase armed fighters. Rihanna stands in a deserted landscape in the video's other scenes. The music video for [...] "Diamonds" [...] premiered November 8 on MTV. The video was also made available for streaming at Rihanna.MTV.com. It was digitally released on November 14 via the iTunes Store.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{was noted}} for his dreadlocks hair style, but he shaved them off {{during a trip}} to Australia. His shyness made Williams appear {{somewhat}} of an odd ball. [...] "Ricky's just a different guy", former Saints receiver Joe Horn explained. [...] "People he wanted to deal with, he did. And people he wanted to have nothing to do with, he didn't. No one could understand that. I don't think guys in the locker room could grasp {{that he wanted to be}} to himself – you know, quiet. If you didn't understand him and didn't know what he <b>was</b> <b>about,</b> <b>it</b> always kept people in suspense." [...] Besides keeping to himself, Williams was known for conducting post-game interviews with his helmet on (complete with tinted visor) and avoiding eye contact. Williams was later diagnosed with clinical depression and social anxiety disorder.|$|E
