25|$|Some clay {{models of}} houses survive {{to give us}} an idea of what smaller {{dwellings}} were like. One depicts a round hut with a conical roof thatched in layers, while another depicts a rectangular house with rectangular doors and windows, a roof supported by beams that end in 'monkey heads', and a parapet and <b>water</b> <b>spout</b> on the roof. Both were found in Hawelti. Another depicts a square house with what appear to be layers of pitched thatch forming the roof.|$|E
25|$|The Telaga Batu inscription, {{discovered}} in Sabokingking, eastern Palembang, {{is also a}} siddhayatra inscription. It is highly possible that this 7th century inscription was used {{in some kind of}} oath allegiance ritual. The top of the stone is adorned with seven nƒÅga heads, and on the lower portion, there is some kind of <b>water</b> <b>spout</b> to channel the liquid that was likely poured over the stone during a ceremonial allegiance ritual. The ritual demonstrate the use of curse in sumpah (allegiance) ritual for those who commit treason against Kadatuan Srivijaya.|$|E

[...] At night, some of the videos are replaced by images of nature or solid colors. Also at night, the other three sides of the fountain display changing colors. [...] The outer Color Kinetics surfaces randomly display the translucent glow of one of eight colors along {{with each of the}} inner opposing faces. [...] As a video sculpture with a variety of cascade and <b>water</b> <b>spout</b> fountain modes, the sculpture is a fluid, dynamic evolving artwork.|$|E

500|$|Plensa {{feels that}} the {{challenge}} {{in the creation of}} successful work of public art is to integrate the viewer into an interactive relationship with the art. [...] The fountain is known for encouraging its visitors to splash and slide in the reflecting pool, jostle for position under the <b>water</b> <b>spout</b> and place themselves under the cascade. [...] This interactivity was to some degree accidental. [...] Although the city planned for some interactivity, the transformation of the fountain into a water park for kids within hours of opening surprised Plensa. [...] Now, when the National Weather Service issues summer heat advisories and the Governor of Illinois declares state office buildings as official daytime cooling centers, the national press points to Crown Fountain as a respite for inhabitants of the Chicago metropolitan area.|$|E
500|$|The {{fountain}} uses [...] per hour, 97% {{of which}} is recycled back into the system. [...] Getting the water to the spout took ingenuity. Although consideration was given to omitting a LED tile, {{it was determined that}} the images would then look as though they were each missing a tooth. Instead, one tile in each tower is recessed about [...] to allow the installation of [...] clear tubing for the water nozzle. The water regularly spills over the fountain and down the sides of the towers and intermittently spouts from the nozzle. Two essential custom fittings contribute to the artistic vision of the fountain: a custom glass block at the upper edge for guiding the water's descent while remaining unobtrusive, and a plastic nozzle fitted to the stainless steel frame to control the rate of water flow and reduce liability to the city for any injuries sustained by the fountain's interactive participants. The interactive participants are usually children playing in the stream from the <b>water</b> <b>spout</b> or under the cascade. The risk that the spouting water would knock people down made the design both a legal and a physical challenge.|$|E

2500|$|The {{enclosed}} {{compound of}} the Narayanhity Palace Museum {{is in the}} north-central part of Kathmandu. [...] "Narayanhity" [...] comes from Narayana, a form of the Hindu god Lord Vishnu, and Hiti, meaning [...] "water spout" [...] (Vishnu's temple is opposite the palace, and the <b>water</b> <b>spout</b> is east of the main entrance to the precinct). Narayanhity was a new palace, {{in front of the}} old palace built in 1915, and was built in 1970 {{in the form of a}} contemporary Pagoda. It was built on the occasion of the marriage of King Birenda Bir Bikram Shah, then heir apparent to the throne. The southern gate of the palace is at the crossing of Prithvipath and Darbar Marg roads. The palace area covers (...) and is fully secured with gates on all sides. This palace was the scene of the Nepali royal massacre. After the fall of the monarchy, it was converted to a museum.|$|E
2500|$|House {{pictures}} were released on June 27, 2007. The house has an Alice in Wonderland theme and contains an over sized bedroom {{and a small}} bedroom. The small bedroom features a very small doorway and five beds which are only five feet long, while the over sized bedroom features shoulder-height beds and enormous drawers which need a ladder to reach. A third bedroom is decorated all in red, and two large, round beds sit {{in the center of}} the room. The walkway to the Head of Household room is a modernist inspired enchanted forest. The living room features several colored mirrors, varying in shape and size. The living room is connected to the kitchen, which is connected to the HoH stairway and a hallway. There is one door in the hallway, which features a gym available to the HouseGuests. The hallway then leads to the bathroom, which features a lavish blue wall, and a shower which features a lion-shaped <b>water</b> <b>spout.</b> The backyard contains animal-shaped topiaries, flowers, a swimming pool, and a spinning teacup, which the HouseGuests can sit in. As revealed during the [...] "Majority Rules" [...] competition, the teacup holds nine gallons of water, which the HouseGuests place their feet in. Workout equipment can also be found outside. There are also multiple lawn chairs that the HouseGuests may use to lay out in the sun. There is also a large couch under a roof by the sliding glass door that the HouseGuests may use in case of rain.|$|E

50|$|The term {{gargoyle}} is {{most often}} applied to medieval work, but throughout all ages some means of water diversion, when not conveyed in gutters, was adopted. In Ancient Egyptian architecture, gargoyles showed little variation, typically {{in the form of}} a lion's head. Similar lion-mouthed <b>water</b> <b>spouts</b> were also seen on Greek temples, carved or modelled in the marble or terracotta cymatium of the cornice. An excellent example of this are the 39 remaining lion-headed <b>water</b> <b>spouts</b> on the Temple of Zeus. There were originally 102 gargoyles or spouts, but due to the heavy weight (they were crafted from marble), many snapped off and had to be replaced.|$|R
