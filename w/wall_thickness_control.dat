40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has {{identified}} the high efficiency Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) {{as a candidate}} power source for long duration Science missions, such as lunar applications, Mars rovers, and deep space missions, that require reliable design lifetimes of up to 17 years. Resistance to creep deformation of the MarM- 247 heater head (HH), a structurally critical component of the ASRG Advanced Stirling Convertor (ASC), under high temperatures (up to 850 C) is a key design driver for durability. Inherent uncertainties in the creep behavior of the thin-walled HH and the variations in the <b>wall</b> <b>thickness,</b> <b>control</b> temperature, and working gas pressure need to be accounted for in the life and reliability prediction. Due to the availability of very limited test data, assuring life and reliability of the HH is a challenging task. The NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has adopted an integrated approach combining available uniaxial MarM- 247 material behavior testing, HH benchmark testing and advanced analysis in order to demonstrate the integrity, life and reliability of the HH under expected mission conditions. The proposed paper describes analytical aspects of the deterministic and probabilistic approaches and results. The deterministic approach involves development of the creep constitutive model for the MarM- 247 (akin to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory master curve model used previously for Inconel 718 (Special Metals Corporation)) and nonlinear finite element analysis to predict the mean life. The probabilistic approach includes evaluation {{of the effect of}} design variable uncertainties in material creep behavior, geometry and operating conditions on life and reliability for the expected life. The sensitivity of the uncertainties in the design variables on the HH reliability is also quantified, and guidelines to improve reliability are discussed...|$|E

A 10 % ammoniumthioglycolate solution was used as test liquid. The low pressure available in glass bottles which wereexamined together with the plastic bottles allows the determination of the oxygen consumption rate constant.

40|$|Colloidal {{polypyrrole}} and polyaniline stabilized by {{anionic surfactants}} were prepared and characterized. A "pseudo-micelle" {{model has been}} proposed. The aggregation of pseudo-micelles on the forming polymer chains {{is believed to be}} the key step in the stabilization process. Only when the aggregation is possible and fast enough to follow the polymer formation, will the polymer be stabilized. Colloidal polypyrrole and polyaniline were prepared in the presence of the sodium salt of poly(styrene sulfonate). The polymerization is believed to follow a template-guided fashion in which poly(styrene sulfonate) functions as a molecular template for pyrrole and aniline polymerization. The stability and water solubility of the colloids are attributed to the presence of excess poly(styrene sulfonate) sulfonate groups in the resulting complexes. It was found that the chemical polymerization of pyrrole is catalyzed by anionic surfactants and polyelectrolytes. The catalysis is believed to arise from the accumulation of protons, neutral pyrrole monomer and oligomers, and their radical cations in the micellar or polyelectrolyte pseudophase via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Nucleation was found to be a necessary and important step in the chemical polymerization of conducting polyaniline and polypyrole. A nucleation process has been proposed. A polyaniline-polypyrrole graft- or block-copolymer was produced by adding colloidal PANI to a similar amount of pyrrole. Hollow conducting polypyrrole nanoparticles with diameters of ca. 140 nm or 60 nm and <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> of ca. 10 nm were fabricated.

Group 1 rats (n = 8) were subjected to daily graded swimming (up to 45 minutes a day) starting 24 hours after coronary occlusion for a total of 7 days followed by 2 weeks of nonswimming.

Twenty-one days after coronary occlusion, the rats were anesthetized, their heart excised and <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> determined histologically. Noninfarcted septal <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> was similar in both Groups 1 and 2. A ratio for transmural infarcts was obtained from multiple measurements by dividing scar thickness by noninfarcted septal <b>wall</b> <b>thickness.</b> Ratio of scar thickness divided by noninfarcted <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> for the <b>control</b> (nonswimming) group was 0. 48 ± 0. 05 (mean ± standard error of the mean); however, in the exercise (swimming) group, there was marked scar thinning with a ratio of 0. 25 ± 0. 02 (mean ± standard error of the mean, p < 0. 001). Infarct extent assessed by planimetry as percent of left ventricular slices was similar in both groups. Thus, early short-term swimming exercise during the first week after experimental myocardial infarction even when followed by 2 weeks without swimming, has long-lasting effects on scar formation.

The aims of this study were 1) to characterize the age- and gender-related changes of the aortic wall components in vivo, using a mechanical model based on ultrasound measurements of pulsatile aortic diameter changes combined with intra-arterial pressure; 2) to validate ultrasound measurements of diameter and intima-media thickness (IMT) of the AA in order to calculate wall stress; 3) to study the stress driven remodeling response of the aortic wall in healthy individuals and the influence of age and gender; and 4) to study wall stress and remodeling of the AA in diabetic patients in order to elucidate the protective influence of diabetes on abdominal aortic aneurysm formation. The stiffness of the isotropic material (mainly elastin) increased in males despite the known decrease in elastin content with age. Further, an exponential increase in stiffness of the anisotropic material (mainly collagen) in males at high physiological pressure was found. This might be due to changed isoforms of collagen and increased glycation with age. Females were less affected than males. The reproducibility of the ultrasound measurements of diameter and IMT in the AA was acceptable (CV; 4 % and 11 % respectively), making it possible to calculate circumferential aortic wall stress in vivo. The age-related remodeling of the arterial wall led to increased diameter, and compensatory thickening of the wall preventing the circumferential wall stress from increasing in the common carotid artery of males and females, and the AA of females. However, the compensatory increase in <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> was defect in the male AA, where stress increased with age. Pulsatile stress influenced the material parameters of the AA, leading to increased stiffness of anisotropic material (mainly collagen), whereas stiffness of isotropic material (mainly elastin) was unaffected. Patients with diabetes mellitus had increased aortic <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> than <b>controls,</b> generating less circumferential stress. This coincides with the known reduction of abdominal aortic aneurysms in diabetic patients and may act as a protective factor...|$|R

Methods: The arterial <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> was measured and compared between one normal subject and one patient suffering from malignant hypertensive retinopathy. Results: Increased arterial <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> was revealed with a newly developed AO-SLO system, in a retinal artery of 1 -papilla diameter temporal inferior to the optic disc. The average <b>wall</b> <b>thickness,</b> with hypertension, was 18. 7 µm, and the wall-to-lumen ratio was 0. 44, both bigger than normal. Conclusion: AO-SLO enabled us to evaluate the retinal <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> in the hypertensive patient. The arterial walls were thickened compared with normal. AO-SLO may facilitate future noninvasive study of arterial walls in human medicine. Keywords: <b>wall</b> <b>thickness,</b> AO-SLO, hypertensive retinopath...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} with the micromechanical modelling of closed-cell polymeric foams (M 130) using Laguerre tessellation models incorporated with realistic foam cell size and cell <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> distributions. The cell size and cell <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> distributions of the foam were measured from microscope images. The Young&# 039;s modulus of cell wall material of the foam was characterised by nanoindentation tests. It is {{found that when}} the cell size and cell <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> {{are assumed to be}} uniform in the models, the Kelvin, Weaire-Phelan and Laguerre models overpredict the stiffness of the foam. However, the Young&# 039;s modulus and shear modulus predicted by the Laguerre models incorporating measured foam cell size and cell <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> distributions agree well with the experimental data. This emphasizes the fact that the integration of realistic cell wall and cell size variations is vital for foam modelling. Subsequently the effects of cell size and cell <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> variations on the stiffness of closed-cell foams were investigated using Laguerre models. It is found that the Young&# 039;s modulus and shear modulus decrease with increasing cell size and cell <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> variations. The degree of stiffness variation of closed-cell foams resulting from the cell size dispersion and cell <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> dispersion are comparable. There is little interaction between the cell size variation and cell <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> variation as far as their effects on foam moduli are concerned. Based on the simulation results, expressions incorporating cell size and cell <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> variations were formulated for predicting the stiffness of closed-cell foams. Lastly, a simple spring system model was proposed to explain the effects of cell size and cell <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> variations on the stiffness of cellular structures...|$|R

40|$|To {{show that}} right {{ventricular}} <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> (RVWT) measurements {{can be made}} with precision by echocardiography, we correlated these measurements with those obtained at necropsy in 32 terminal patients. The correlation between the echocardiographic diastolic right ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> (mean 4. 0 +/- 1. 62 mm) and the necropsy measurement (mean 4. 3 +/- 1. 52 mm) was good (r = 0. 83) in all 32 patients with normal or increased right ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> at necropsy. In 19 patients without necropsy evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVWT {{less than or equal to}} 4 mm), the mean diastole and systolic right ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> were 3. 0 +/- 0. 92 mm and 5. 1 +/- 1. 64 mm, respectively. In 13 patients with necropsy evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVWT greater than or equal to 5 mm), the mean diastolic and systolic right ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses</b> were 5. 3 +/- 1. 56 mm and 8. 2 +/- 1. 88 mm, respectively. We conclude that technically satisfactory echocardiograms of the right ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> Echocardiography can reliably estimate the diastolic <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> and may be helpful in the evaluation of right ventricular hypertrophy...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> variation on tank’s wall buckling mode under the effect of critical harmonic settlement for open top tanks. The study was performed on four tanks which have the same geometric and material properties except <b>wall</b> <b>thickness,</b> for each case the tank was subjected to several settlement waves which has the same settlement amplitude, and the buckling mode and critical vertical settlement results were compared. For buckling mode, the results show that tanks with <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> at a close range have similar buckling mode behaviour and in case using too thick wall the buckling mode starts to change. And for the effect on critical vertical settlement, the results show that vertical settlement is sensitive to any variation in <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> beside that settlement value changes with the effected wave number and this variation could change the whole behaviour of the tanks. The study recommended that in case of performing analysis for a tank with neglecting the variation in <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> values, the value of chosen <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> should be the average of <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> values obtained from the designed equation...|$|R
