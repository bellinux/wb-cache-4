60|$|Bartolomeo Moratini {{was still}} at the Palazzo Orsi, so, seizing my opportunity, I took {{him by the arm}} and walked with him to the statue gallery, where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> in peace.|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> of {{our plans}} for the future without being overheard by Job Lord, and this would have been, so I argued, in the highest degree dangerous, for there was yet the {{possibility}} he might succeed in making his escape before <b>we</b> <b>could</b> leave the town, in which case he would have us at a disadvantage.|$|R

5000|$|For {{those who}} want to talk a lot about World War II, if it's about {{occupation}}, then <b>we</b> <b>could</b> also <b>talk</b> about it (Muslim prayers in the streets), because that is occupation of territory ... It is an occupation of sections of the territory, of districts in which religious laws apply ... There are of course no tanks, there are no soldiers, but it is nevertheless an occupation and it weighs heavily on local residents.|$|R
60|$|For a time, however, nothing happened, {{although}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{hear them}} <b>talking</b> {{somewhere near the}} cattle kraal, about {{a hundred and fifty}} yards away.

50|$|Notice that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> also <b>talk</b> {{about the}} {{derivative}} of a vector {{with respect to}} a matrix, {{or any of the other}} unfilled cells in our table. However, these derivatives are most naturally organized in a tensor of rank higher than 2, so that they do not fit neatly into a matrix. In the following three sections we will define each one of these derivatives and relate them to other branches of mathematics. See the layout conventions section for a more detailed table.|$|R

500|$|Following the {{underground}} {{success of the}} band's second studio album Kerplunk (1992), {{a number of major}} record labels became interested in Green Day. Representatives of these labels attempted to entice the band to sign by inviting them for meals to discuss a deal, with one manager even inviting the group to Disneyland. The band declined these advances until meeting producer and Reprise representative Rob Cavallo. They were impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only person <b>we</b> <b>could</b> really <b>talk</b> to and connect with".|$|R

40|$|Animacy distinctions {{has never}} been {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the outstanding features of the grammar of Akan. However, based on the form and distribution of nominal prefixes in the language and the nature of the pronominal system, it is concluded that the notion of animacy distinction is relevant to the grammar of Akan. The purpose of this paper is to show that the grammar of Akan is sensitive to animacy distinctions, and to some limited extent, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> even <b>talk</b> about the presence of animacy hierarchy in the language.

5000|$|According to Rick Potts, {{without an}} age {{there would be}} no way to judge the {{evolutionary}} significance of this find. He had stated that [...] "it's hard to know without a date whether it's from that period, as one of those experiments that then went nowhere, or whether it's in fact much less than one million years old. In that case, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> be <b>talking</b> about something that also didn't go anywhere and was just an isolated, probably very small population that persisted {{for a long time in}} splendid isolation." ...|$|R

5000|$|Hunt {{has also}} {{described}} transgender inclusion in Stonewall as [...] "a real joy", saying that: [...] "We Stonewall {{made a series}} of cockups, so it didn't look like we were trying to support people ...

40|$|The paper charts the {{development}} of dance anthropology from the beginner’s fascination with body techniques through the first scientific explanations of dance. The paper highlights the fact that {{the development}} of this branch of anthropology has been burdened with epistemological uncertainties and dilemmas. Hence, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>talk</b> about a consistent sub-discipline when looking at the approaches to dance in anthropology, but we always talk about mushrooming and interconnected traditions. Finaly, the paper will introduce two current and conflicting approaches to dance, textual and kinaesthetic, which open up old questions and dilemmas but which offer fresh perspectives as well...|$|R
