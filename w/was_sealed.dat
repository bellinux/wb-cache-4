50|$|Although the LDS Church has {{abandoned}} {{the practice of}} plural marriage, it has not abandoned the underlying doctrines of polygamy. According to the church's sacred texts and pronouncements by its leaders and theologians, the church leaves {{open the possibility that}} it may one day re-institute the practice. It is still the practice of monogamous Mormon couples to <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to one another. However, in some circumstances, men and women may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to multiple spouses. Most commonly, a man may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to multiple wives: if his first wife dies, he may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to a second wife. A deceased woman may also <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to multiple men, but only through vicarious <b>sealing</b> if they <b>are</b> also deceased.|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} argued that the LDS Church's policy on {{sealings}} and cancellations reflect its doctrine of plural marriage. Although plural marriage is currently prohibited in the church, a man can <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to multiple women, in the case of widowers who <b>are</b> <b>sealed</b> to their dead and living wives. Additionally, men who are dead may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> by proxy to all women to whom they were legally married while alive. Recent changes in church policy also allow women to <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to multiple men, but only after both she and her husband(s) are dead.|$|R

50|$|The {{union of}} a <b>sealed</b> couple <b>is</b> {{regarded}} as valid only if both individuals have kept their religious commitments and followed LDS teachings. Just as deceased individuals may refuse any temple ordinance (such as a sealing) done by proxy on their behalf, couples, parents, {{and children who}} <b>were</b> <b>sealed</b> {{to each other in}} life may refuse to accept a sealing of which they were a part. No one will <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to any one with whom {{they do not want to}} <b>be</b> <b>sealed.</b>|$|R

5|$|Arsenal's {{dominance}} of the decade <b>was</b> <b>sealed</b> with a second FA Cup in 1935–36, winning 1–0 against Sheffield United with a goal from Drake. Arsenal faded in the League somewhat after the 1934–35 title, and were weakened by the retirement of Alex James and the club's inability to replace him, as well as long-term injuries to several other key players such as Herbie Roberts and Joe Hulme. Nevertheless, they won a fifth League title in 1937–38, pipping Wolves {{on the final day}} of the season, to cap off a highly successful decade.|$|E
5|$|Author Robert R. Frump {{wrote in}} The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican {{refugees}} regularly crossing Kruger National Park {{at night in}} South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may {{have been killed in}} the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border <b>was</b> <b>sealed,</b> Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.|$|E
50|$|Generally, record <b>sealing</b> can <b>be</b> {{defined as}} the process of {{removing}} from general review the records pertaining to a court case. However, the records may not completely disappear and may still be reviewed under limited circumstances; in most instances, it requires {{a court order to}} unseal records once they <b>are</b> <b>sealed.</b> In the United States, some states order records to be destroyed after they <b>are</b> <b>sealed.</b> Once a record <b>is</b> <b>sealed,</b> in some states, the contents are legally considered never to have occurred and are not acknowledged by the state.|$|R

The tomb {{contained}} a rich array of offerings, including ceramic vessels and food, and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king. A dog was also entombed with the deceased king. Pots in the tomb were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and Teotihuacan styles. Among the offerings was an incense-burner {{in the shape of}} an elderly underworld god, sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands. The tomb <b>was</b> <b>sealed</b> with a corbel vault, then the pyramid was built on top.|$|E

Before filming commenced, Minogue covered her death scene above a chroma key mattress. The scene in London commenced filming at sunset in Cardiff city centre.

After its closure in 1981, it <b>was</b> <b>sealed</b> with soil and planted over with Grasslands and trees. Sin Fat Road, which runs {{up the hill and}} hosts Sceneway Garden Minibus Terminus, was constructed. Sai Tso Wan Landfill was later rebuilt into Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground.|$|E

50|$|Marriage and sealing: An {{ordinance}} where individuals <b>are</b> {{married and}} <b>sealed</b> as {{husband and wife}} as an eternal family. Any children the couple may already have <b>are</b> <b>sealed</b> to the family and any children born into this marriage after <b>sealing</b> <b>are</b> also <b>sealed</b> into that family which will live together forever, if obedient to God's commandments. Children that are brought into the family later, though not born into the family such as via Adoption, can <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to the family later in a sealing ceremony without the need for the marriage portion. This ordinance is particularly performed by the LDS Church and branches of Mormon fundamentalism.|$|R
