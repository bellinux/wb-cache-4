Heidegger states that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> relativism by testing interpreted truths against Dasein's facticity, or something that is already given in existence that informs our theorizing. Additionally, hermeneutic psychotherapists and theorists say that interpreted truths must be congruent with ontological hermeneutics theory.|$|E

She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married, but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe, many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path. The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska's family, and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental consent, with the permission only of Ostrowska's sister and the headmistress of the finishing school. Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple's hopes, but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry. Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the critical moment: Let us not, if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> it, fall victim to the dead letter of the law. I don't want to postpone the happiness of these two youngsters if we can help it. All laws have been twisted and tortured out of semblance of law, what with war and revolutions.

2500|$|Evolutionary {{analyses}} of sequences are conducted {{on a wide}} variety of time scales. Thus, it is convenient to express these models in terms of the instantaneous rates of change between different states (the Q matrices below). [...] If we are given a starting (ancestral) state at one position, the model's Q matrix and a branch length expressing the expected number of changes to have occurred since the ancestor, then we can derive the probability of the descendant sequence having each of the four states. [...] The mathematical details of this transformation from rate-matrix to probability matrix are described in the mathematics of substitution models section of the substitution model page. By expressing models in terms of the instantaneous rates of change <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> estimating a large numbers of parameters for each branch on a phylogenetic tree (or each comparison if the analysis involves many pairwise sequence comparisons).|$|E

After much discussion regarding the status of McMordie within the band after the tour, on 21 April 2006, Burns posted on the message board [...] "For the time being Mr. McMordie is happy to continue as long as his busy schedule allows.

2500|$|In {{an essay}} for the Wall Street Journal, Nawaz stated that Jihadists {{of all types}} seek to create discord by [...] "pitting Muslims against non-Muslims in the West and Sunni Muslims against Shiite Muslims in the East". He argues that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is out to provoke a Clash of Civilisations, and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> this clash by calling out the {{underlying}} Islamist ideology and isolating Jihadists from ordinary Muslims. He also took exception to Pope Francis's characterisation of Paris attacks as the start of [...] "World War 3", noting {{that we are not}} facing another World War but a Global Jihadist insurgency. According to him, an insurgency is different from a conventional war in that insurgents rely on some level of support from the communities they recruit from. And since it is an insurgency, the Counter-insurgency strategy should have messaging and psychological warfare as its critical parts, with the aim of isolating insurgents from their target host communities. On a physical level, he supported the idea of an international coalition against ISIL, fronted by Sunni Arab forces and backed by international special forces.|$|E

However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. If I go back, I am afraid that my master will blame me, so I suggest we escape together."
