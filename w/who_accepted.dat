In contrast, nāstika are those who deny the respective definitions of āstika.|$|R

However, as the Warrior quit the promotion on November 21, his spot was surprisingly offered to Mr. Perfect, <b>who</b> <b>accepted</b> it in spite of Flair, thereby turning face and initiating a feud with Flair which culminated in Flair leaving the WWF in January 1993.|$|E
5|$|Following Mangini's departure, New York {{hoped to}} lure former Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Bill Cowher out of retirement, {{suggesting}} that Cowher might be given control of football operations {{in addition to}} serving as coach. However, Cowher decided to remain retired for the season. On January 20, 2009, the Jets offered the position to Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Rex Ryan, <b>who</b> <b>accepted.</b> Tannenbaum engineered a draft-day trade with Cleveland, which enabled New York to move up and select highly regarded USC quarterback Mark Sanchez.|$|E
5|$|John Sigismund {{appointed}} a Calvinist bishop {{as the only}} religious leader of the Romanians in his realm in November 1566. The Diet also ordered that all Romanian priests who refused to convert to Calvinism were to be expelled, but this decision was not carried out. Influenced by Dávid and Biandrata, John Sigismund became receptive to Anti-Trinitarian ideas from early 1567. With John Sigismund's support, Dávid published five books to promote his views, reproving for idolatry those <b>who</b> <b>accepted</b> the dogma of the Trinity.|$|E

5|$|Sunday was a {{conservative}} evangelical <b>who</b> <b>accepted</b> fundamentalist doctrines. He affirmed and preached the inerrancy of the Bible, the virgin birth of Christ, {{the doctrine of}} substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection of Christ, a literal devil and hell, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, most Protestant church members, regardless of denomination, gave assent to these doctrines. Sunday refused to hold meetings in cities where he was not welcomed by {{the vast majority of the}} Protestant churches and their clergy.|$|E
5|$|The Kačić's {{family can}} be traced to the Pacta conventa, an {{agreement}} dating from 1102 (or later), according to which the Kačićs were one of the twelve Croatian noble tribes (genus) <b>who</b> <b>accepted</b> the Hungarian king Coloman as the new king of Croatia. They were represented by comes Juraj Kačić (Comittem Gurram de genere Chaçittorum). According to the Supetar Cartulary, they were one of six tribes which selected bans who, in turn, elected a new king in a case where the prior king died without leaving heirs.|$|E

5|$|After {{the revolt}} had largely been suppressed, those <b>who</b> <b>accepted</b> Ottoman {{suzerainty}} were initially allowed {{to retain their}} holdings and partial autonomy. Many timars were also granted to local Albanians holding high posts of the administration, especially during the rule of Jakub Muzaka and Skanderbeg. Throughout the pacification process, various primarily rural areas were still in revolt and new rebellions erupted, like that of Teodor Korona Muzaka in 1437. As the empire further extended its area of rule in the Balkans, centralization attempts and the replacement of local timar holders with Ottoman landowners resumed. These policies would lead {{in part to the}} formation of the League of Lezhë under Skanderbeg in 1444, and a new era in the Ottoman–Albanian wars.|$|E
5|$|During the Northern Song (960–1126 CE), a {{new class}} of scholar-artists emerged who did not possess the tromp l'oiel skills of the academy {{painters}} nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters. The literati's painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled, yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self-expression. The scholar-artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, worst of all, <b>who</b> <b>accepted</b> monetary payment for their work were no better than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace. They were not to be considered real artists.|$|E

5|$|In March 1549, {{the city}} of Strasbourg forced Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius to leave. Cranmer {{immediately}} invited the men to come to England and promised {{that they would be}} placed in English universities. When they arrived on 25 April, Cranmer was especially delighted to meet Bucer face to face after eighteen years of correspondence. He needed these scholarly men to train a new generation of preachers as well as assist in the reform of liturgy and doctrine. Others <b>who</b> <b>accepted</b> his invitations include the Polish reformer, Jan Łaski, but Cranmer was unable to convince Osiander and Melanchthon to come to England.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{stabilize}} Ottoman authority, Murat II appointed native Albanians like Jakub Muzaka and Skanderbeg to high positions within the sanjak of Albania. The nobles <b>who</b> <b>accepted</b> Ottoman overlordship were granted their pre-Ottoman holdings and border estates {{as well as}} a degree of autonomy, while others were exiled or continued warring. In 1436–37, rebels were active in the regions of Gjirokastër and Vlorë and Teodor Korona Muzaka led a revolt in the region of Berat. As many rebels used Venetian territories like Shkodër and Parga as bases to launch raids into Ottoman territory, representatives of Mehmed II asked the Venetians to outlaw their activity in October 1436.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for a war against the Ottomans, Matthias held a Diet at Tolna in March 1463. Although the Estates authorized him to levy a one-florin extraordinary tax, he did not intervene when Mehmed II invaded Bosnia in June. In a month, the Ottomans murdered King Stephen Tomašević and conquered the whole country. Matthias only adopted an offensive foreign policy after the terms of his peace with Emperor Frederick were ratified in Wiener Neustadt on 19 July 1463. He led his troops to Bosnia and conquered Jajce and other forts in its northern parts. The conquered regions were organized into a new defensive province, or banate. Assisted by Stefan Vukčić, Duke of Saint Sava, Matthias also conquered Bosanska Krajina and granted it to the Duke, <b>who</b> <b>accepted</b> his suzerainty.|$|E

5|$|It was {{believed}} that immortality could be achieved if one reached the lands of the Queen Mother of the West or Mount Penglai. Han-era Daoists assembled into small groups of hermits who attempted to achieve immortality through breathing exercises, sexual techniques and use of medical elixirs. By the 2nd century AD, Daoists formed large hierarchical religious societies such as the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice. Its followers believed that the sage-philosopher Laozi (fl.6th century BC) was a holy prophet who would offer salvation and good health if his devout followers would confess their sins, ban the worship of unclean gods <b>who</b> <b>accepted</b> meat sacrifices and chant sections of the Daodejing.|$|E

The pavilion was named after Jay Pritzker, whose family is known for owning Hyatt Hotels.

After demanding several script changes, Takei declined, saying {{he did not want}} to make fun of public transportation as he was a member of the board of directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District (now the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority).
