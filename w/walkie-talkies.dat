5|$|An {{extended}} {{version of the}} film, including altered special effects, was released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as {{he did not have}} enough time to perfect the animatronics. Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with <b>walkie-talkies.</b>|$|E

It operated on two vacuum tubes. The <b>walkie-talkie</b> weighed about 1,2 kg and had 1,5 km operating distance.|$|R
25|$|Close {{air support}} was {{initially}} provided by fighters from escort carriers off the coast. This shifted {{over to the}} 15th Fighter Group, flying P-51 Mustangs, after they arrived on the island on 6 March. Similarly, illumination rounds (flares) which were used to light up the battlefield at night were initially provided by ships, shifting over later to landing force artillery.

25|$|The IDF {{identified}} {{a group of}} some 50 men who were responsible for attacking IDF soldiers. The {{members of this group}} were not carrying identity cards or passports, but each carried an envelope with some $10,000 in cash. The Israeli defense establishment suspected that the funding may have come from elements in the Turkish government. One member of the group, who was {{identified a}}s its ringleader, travelled to Bursa to recruit members. The members were stationed in groups throughout the ship, mostly on the upper deck, and communicated with each other via <b>walkie-talkies.</b> The members were well-trained and equipped with gas masks and bulletproof vests.|$|E
25|$|After great deliberation, the {{decision}} was made by the IAF Commander, Gp Capt. M.P Premi, to abort further drops by the helicopters. GOC 54 Div, Maj Gen Harkirat Singh, was informed by Gp Capt Premi about the situation, and told the Mi-8s were {{not in a position to}} carry out further troop insertions. As Maj Sheonan Singh, leading the Para Commandos, was informed that no more support was available, Sheonan asked the GOC for the plan of action. By this time, although the hundred and twenty para commandos were in position, only thirty of the intended three hundred and sixty Sikh LI troops had been inserted. and sniper fire had picked off the Sikh LI radio man. All messages that received were relayed via the Para Commandos through hand-held short range <b>walkie-talkies.</b> At the landing ground, the battle was so intense that in many cases the Indian troops were not able to see the LTTE snipers and attackers. Under heavy fire from all sides, and coming under sniper fire, the troops were under orders not to use heavy weapons. The Sikh LI, as well as the commandos, were in danger of getting bogged down.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, he asks why, if the {{movement}} was planned by military officers, as alleged in the Cornell Paper, was it so poorly planned. Despite {{the movement}} being labeled a “coup attempt,” the movement’s troops did not execute the plan with military efficiency or planning. As Roosa notes, the movement’s military force, which only consisted of 2,130 total military personnel and 2,000 civilians, was spread too thin to constitute a single operational force, especially compared {{to the number of}} military troops stationed in the city(footnote). Also, the lack of tanks proves that the forces did not have the intention of taking government control. The forces of Aidit and his men were separated {{from the rest of the}} movement’s forces under Untung and the other men by a total distance of two miles, under two separate strategic headquarters. Furthermore, the two forces did not have efficient means of communication between them; the movement itself shut down the city’s telephone system when it took over the telecommunications building, and neither group had <b>walkie-talkies</b> or other radio devices to relay plans back and forth. Instead, several of the leaders used shuttles and couriers as a means of communication. Roosa contributes these inconsistencies in planning to Sjam, noting his lack of experience in military strategy. In any case, he says, the movement's leaders as a group were too disparate to find enough common ground to carry out the operation.|$|E
25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: You {{had a lot of}} Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with <b>walkie-talkies,</b> arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E
500|$|At the premiere, John Williams {{conducted}} a live {{performance of the}} score. The new release grossed $68 million in total, with $35 million coming from Canada and the United States. The changes to it, particularly the escape scene, were criticized as political correctness. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wondered, [...] "Remember those guns the feds carried? Thanks to the miracle of digital, they're now brandishing <b>walkie-talkies....</b> Is this what two decades have done to free speech?"

Police in Aurora, Colorado, a suburb east of Denver, pulled over his rented 2008 blue Dodge Ram truck, which was swerving erratically. Police found a Ruger Model M77 Mark II 22-250 bolt-action rifle with an attached scope and bipod, and a Remington Remington Model 721 270 bolt-action rifle with an attached hunting scope. One of the rifles was fitted with a silencer. Police also found two wigs, three fake IDs, camouflage clothing, a bulletproof vest, two <b>walkie-talkies</b> and 4.4grams of what appeared to be methamphetamine in the truck. The truck contained enough drug-making equipment for the vehicle to be considered [...] "a mobile lab". At least one of the rifles had been reported stolen. Gartrell was under the influence of methamphetamine when arrested. He was found to be driving on a suspended license, and was carrying a false Colorado identification card with a Centennial, Colorado address. Gartrell was using crutches {{at the time of his}} arrest.|$|E
500|$|On May 2, {{more than}} a {{thousand}} students skipped school and gathered at the 16th Street Baptist Church. The principal of Parker High School attempted to lock the gates to keep students in, but they scrambled over the walls to get to the church. Demonstrators were given instructions to march to the downtown area, to meet with the Mayor, and integrate the chosen buildings. They were to leave in smaller groups and continue on their courses until arrested. Marching in disciplined ranks, some of them using <b>walkie-talkies,</b> they were sent at timed intervals from various churches to the downtown business area. More than 600 students were arrested; the youngest of these was reported to be eight years old. Children left the churches while singing hymns and [...] "freedom songs" [...] such as [...] "We Shall Overcome". [...] They clapped and laughed while being arrested and awaiting transport to jail. The mood was compared to that of a school picnic. Although Bevel informed Connor that the march was to take place, Connor and the police were dumbfounded by the numbers and behavior of the children. They assembled paddy wagons and school buses to take the children to jail. When no squad cars were left to block the city streets, Connor, whose authority extended to the fire department, used fire trucks. The day's arrests brought the total number of jailed protesters to 1,200 in the 900-capacity Birmingham jail.|$|E
500|$|The Apprentice Boys' parade is {{an annual}} celebration by unionists {{of the relief}} of the Siege of Derry in 1689, which began when {{thirteen}} young apprentice boys shut the city's gates against the army of King James. [...] At that time the parade was held on 12 August each year. Participants from across Northern Ireland and Britain marched along the city walls above the Bogside, and were often openly hostile to the residents. [...] On 30 July 1969 the Derry Citizens Defence Association (DCDA) was formed to try to preserve peace {{during the period of}} the parade, and to defend the Bogside and Creggan {{in the event of an}} attack. [...] The chairman was Seán Keenan, an Irish Republican Army (IRA) veteran; the vice-chairman was Paddy Doherty, a popular local man sometimes known as [...] "Paddy Bogside" [...] and the secretary was Johnnie White, another leading republican and leader of the James Connolly Republican Club. [...] Street committees were formed under the overall command of the DCDA and barricades were built on the night of 11 August. [...] The parade took place as planned on 12 August. [...] As it passed through Waterloo Place, on the edge of the Bogside, hostilities began between supporters and opponents of the parade. Fighting between the two groups continued for two hours, then the police joined in. They charged up William Street against the Bogsiders, followed by the 'Paisleyites'. They were met with a hail of stones and petrol bombs. The ensuing battle became known as the Battle of the Bogside. [...] Late in the evening, having been driven back repeatedly, the police fired canisters of CS gas into the crowd. [...] Youths on the roof of a high-rise block of flats on Rossville Street threw petrol bombs down on the police. [...] <b>Walkie-talkies</b> were used to maintain contact between different areas of fighting and DCDA headquarters in Paddy Doherty's house in Westland Street, and first aid stations were operating, staffed by doctors, nurses and volunteers. Women and girls made milk-bottle crates of petrol bombs for supply to the youths in the front line [...] and [...] "Radio Free Derry" [...] broadcast to the fighters and their families. [...] On the third day of fighting, 14 August, the Northern Ireland Government mobilised the Ulster Special Constabulary (B-Specials), a force greatly feared by nationalists in Derry and elsewhere. [...] Before they engaged, however, British troops were deployed at the scene, carrying automatic rifles and sub-machine guns. The RUC and B-Specials withdrew, and the troops took up positions outside the barricaded area.|$|E

2500|$|A loudspeaker, a {{transducer}} {{that turns}} an electrical signal into sound waves, is the functional opposite of a microphone. Since a conventional speaker is constructed {{much like a}} dynamic microphone (with a diaphragm, coil and magnet), speakers can actually work [...] "in reverse" [...] as microphones. The resulting signal typically offers reduced quality including limited high-end frequency response and poor sensitivity. In practical use, speakers are sometimes used as microphones in applications where high quality and sensitivity are not needed such as intercoms, <b>walkie-talkies</b> or video game voice chat peripherals, or when conventional microphones are in short supply.|$|E
2500|$|A {{frequency}} synthesizer is an electronic circuit that generates {{a range of}} frequencies from a single reference frequency. Frequency synthesizers are used in many modern devices such as radio receivers, televisions, mobile telephones, radiotelephones, <b>walkie-talkies,</b> CB radios, cable television converter boxes [...] satellite receivers, and GPS systems. A {{frequency synthesizer}} may use the techniques of frequency multiplication, frequency division, direct digital synthesis, frequency mixing, and phase-locked loops to generate its frequencies. The stability and accuracy of the frequency synthesizer's output {{are related to the}} stability and accuracy of its reference frequency input. Consequently, synthesizers use stable and accurate reference frequencies, such as those provided by crystal oscillators.|$|E
2500|$|This {{is where}} the debate comes in. On {{the other side of}} the {{argument}} there is evidence that shows this aid may have not been as adequate as many historians believe.

The rebel officers pleaded for heavy artillery, anti-aircraft rounds, and anti-tank grenades. They required Rifles, mortars, <b>walkie-talkies,</b> field telephone sets, maps, medical kits, binoculars, etc. However, ‘India seemed more worried about the embarrassment that would inevitably follow when Indian weapons were captured during the fighting and thus was hesitant in expediting the deployment of arms to the rebels.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{different}} types of propagation are used in practical radio transmission systems. [...] Line-of-sight propagation means radio waves which travel {{in a straight line}} from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. [...] Line of sight transmission is used in short to medium range radio transmission such as cell phones, cordless phones, <b>walkie-talkies,</b> wireless networks, [...] FM radio and television broadcasting and radar, and satellite communication, such as satellite television. [...] Line-of-sight transmission {{on the surface of the}} Earth is limited to the distance to the visual horizon, which depends on the height of transmitting and receiving antennas. [...] It is the only propagation method possible at microwave frequencies and above. [...] At microwave frequencies moisture in the atmosphere (rain fade) can degrade transmission.|$|E
2500|$|Line-of-sight {{refers to}} radio waves which travel {{directly}} {{in a line}} from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. [...] It does not necessarily require a cleared sight path; at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings, foliage and other obstructions. [...] This is the most common propagation mode at VHF and above, and the only possible mode at microwave frequencies and above. [...] On the surface of the Earth, line of sight propagation is limited by the visual horizon to about 40 miles (64 km). [...] This is the method used by cell phones, cordless phones, <b>walkie-talkies,</b> wireless networks, [...] point-to-point microwave radio relay links, [...] FM and television broadcasting and radar. [...] Satellite communication uses longer line-of-sight paths; [...] for example home satellite dishes receive signals from communication satellites 22,000 miles (39,000 km) above the Earth, and ground stations can communicate with spacecraft billions of miles from Earth.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 June 1998, the KLA {{seized the}} Belaćevac open-pit coal mine, {{near the town}} of Obilić.

The attack represented the most serious challenge to the Yugoslav establishment since fighting erupted earlier in the year, {{not only because of the}} mine's strategic significance but also because of its close proximity to Pristina. Upon entering the mine, the militants took a number of Serb mineworkers hostage, halting production. Human Rights Watch identified the nine captives as Dušan Ađančić, Pero Ađančić, Zoran Ađančić, Mirko Buha, Filip Gojković, Božidar Lempić, Srboljub Savić, Mirko Trifunović and Dragan Vukmirović. Some of the militants were armed with automatic weapons, but most carried hunting rifles. There were about 30 fighters in all, most wearing civilian clothes. [...] "Some of the guerrillas were no more than boys with single-shot rifles," [...] wrote journalist Jeffrey Fleishman. [...] "Others were brawny men with handlebar mustaches, ammunition belts and bayonets."
