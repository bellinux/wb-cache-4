40|$|Abstract Objective This study {{aimed to}} explore {{cross-sectional}} and longitudinal associations between pathological <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fatigue in a working population. Methods In employees with very low or very high fatigue levels, psychometrics of the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; measuring pathological <b>worry)</b> <b>and</b> the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS; measuring fatigue) were examined and their cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were explored. Results Pathological <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fatigue can be measured as different constructs. However, pathological <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fatigue were also associated on a cross-sectional level. Pathological worry predicted fatigue level 10 months later, but this association disappeared after adjustment for the cross-sectional association between pathological <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fatigue. Conclusion Although they can be measured as different constructs, pathological <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fatigue seem to be associated. When studying longitudinal relations between pathological <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fatigue, their cross-sectional association {{should be taken into}} account. Pathological worry might not be a risk factor for fatigue per se, but might act more like a mediating factor...|$|R

This study explored the degree of overlap between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination on the levels of standardized questionnaires and a priori lay concepts. Method: The subjective conceptualization of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> of rumination of 221 undergraduate and graduate students was assessed with the semantic differential technique, together with the frequency and intensity with which they experienced <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination (based on their lay concepts). Standardized self-report measures for <b>worry,</b> rumination, depression, <b>and</b> anxiety were also administered. Results: Worry was viewed as more negative than rumination and was more predictive of anxiety {{as well as}} of depression than rumination, especially when the assessment was based on the subjective lay concepts. The different measures of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination were only moderately correlated with each other.

40|$|Major {{depression}} is characterised by ruminative thinking whilst worry is considered central in {{generalised anxiety disorder}} (GAD). However, not only do these two forms of repetitive negative thinking regularly co-occur in the same individual but similarities between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination are apparent. Adapting a methodology developed by Langlois et al. (Behav. Res.

40|$|Worry is {{a common}} feature of chronic pain. The purpose of his {{study was to examine}} he extent of worry {{experienced}} by adult, with chronic pain, and to explore features of problem solving associated with <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> chronic pain. A further purpose was to investigate whether there were differences in <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> problem solving for those presenting at a pain clinic for treatment, compared to those who identified as chronic pain sufferers but who were not presenting for treatment. A final purpose was to examine whether the extent of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> problem solving attitudes helped to predict the primary clinical features of chronic pain such as intensity, disability and depressive mood. One hundred and eighty five adults with chronic pain provided completed questionnaires assessing worrying, problem solving, pain severity, disability, catastrophic thinking and depressive mood. Analyses showed that <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> problem solving approaches sampled in this study were not abnormal. Furthermore, no {{differences were found between the}} clinical and non-clinical sample for <b>worrying</b> <b>and</b> problem solving.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was twofold: 1) to {{investigate}} the psychological profile of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) as compared to patients with other chronic pain syndromes (CP) and healthy subjects (HS); 2) to examine the associations between anxiety, depression, <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> angry rumination in FS patients. FS patients (N= 30), CP patients (N= 30) and HS (N= 30) completed measurements of anxiety, depression, <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> angry rumination. FS patients showed higher levels of state <b>and</b> trait anxiety, <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> angry rumination than CP patients and HS, and higher levels of depression than HS. <b>Worry</b> <b>and</b> angry rumination were strongly associated in the FS group. FS patients may use <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination as coping strategies to deal with their negative emotional experience, which might impair their emotional wellbeing. Findings from the present study add to our understanding of the psychological profile of FS patients, and have important implications for developing a tailored CBT protocol for pain management in FS patients...|$|R

This gruesome task was passed on to her nanny who set off on the search after leaving her own similarly aged daughter an omamori, an amulet for protection. The nanny’s search for a woman willing to give up her unborn child’s liver lasted for weeks and months before the nanny, tired and weary, reached Adachigahara, where she decided to stay in a cave to wait for pregnant travelers to pass by. Years passed before a lone pregnant woman approached her cave. Desperate, the nanny jumped upon the woman and retrieved the fetus’ liver. Only after accomplishing her goal did she realize that the woman was wearing the omamori she had given her daughter many years ago. Driven insane by this realization, the nanny became a yōkai and from then on attacked passers-by and ate their flesh.|$|E
40|$|SummaryRisk {{perception}} and psychological concerns are relevant for understanding how people view Lyme disease. This study investigates the four separate outcomes of susceptibility, likelihood to be diagnosed, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> fear for contracting Lyme disease. University students (n= 713) were surveyed about demographics, perceived health, Lyme disease knowledge, Lyme disease preventive behaviors, Lyme disease history, and Lyme disease miscellaneous variables. We {{found that women}} were associated with increased susceptibility and fear. Asian/Asian-American race/ethnicity was associated with increased <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fear. Perceived good health was associated with increased likelihood to be diagnosed, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> fear. Correct knowledge was associated with increased susceptibility and likelihood to be diagnosed. Those who typically {{spend a lot of}} time outdoors were associated with increased susceptibility, likelihood to be diagnosed, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> fear.

40|$|<b>Worry</b> <b>and</b> {{rumination}} are cognitive processes, often {{represented as}} verbal or linguis-tic activities. Despite similarities in definition <b>and</b> description, <b>worry</b> {{has been most}} closely examined in relation to anxiety whereas rumination has traditionally been related to depression. This distinction remains in spite of high rates of comorbidity between anxiety and depression. This study sought {{to better understand the}} distinct and overlapping features of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination as well as their relationship to anx-iety and depression. Seven hundred eighty-four unselected college students completed self-report measures of <b>worry,</b> rumination, anxiety, <b>and</b> depression. Items from the respective <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination scales were submitted to factor analysis, which re-vealed a four-factor solution comprised of 2 <b>worry</b> factors <b>and</b> 2 rumination factors. A Worry Engagement factor as well as a Dwelling on the Negative factor emerged as distilled measures of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination, respectively. Scores on these factors were highly correlated with each other and demonstrated equally strong relationships to both anxiety and depression. Findings from this study suggest that <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination represent related but distinct cognitive processes that are similarly related to anxiety and depression.

Research findings have been limited and discrepant with respect to the degree that <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> anxiety correlate with academic procrastination.

In an attempt to expand of extant literature, we examined the moderating role of experiential avoidance in the relationship between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> academic procrastination. Contrary to expectation, a significant relationship was not found between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> academic procrastination, and precluded an interaction effect between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> experiential avoidance such that one’s level of experiential avoidance does not appear to impact the relationship between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> academic procrastination.

In Experiment 1, 30 good and 30 poor sleepers were instructed either to monitor or not to monitor a clock as {{they were trying to}} get to sleep. Worry was indexed by self-rating. Sleep was measured by self-report and actigraphy. Compared to non-monitors, clock-monitors reported more pre-sleep <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> they experienced longer sleep onset latency (SOL). These findings held true for both good and poor sleepers. In Experiment 2, following one night of baseline measurement, 38 individuals diagnosed with primary insomnia were instructed to monitor either a clock or a digit display unit (a control monitoring task) as {{they were trying to get}} to sleep. The clock-monitoring task was rated to be more <b>worry</b> provoking <b>and</b> sleep interfering than the display unit-monitoring task.

His accuracy and stamina allowed Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, one of Australia's finest fast bowling pairs of all time, to draw breath between short and incisive bursts of pace and swing. Standing , he was particularly effective on sticky wickets, reducing his speed to slow medium pace and using a repertoire of off cutters, inswingers, outswingers and leg breaks. Bowling a leg-stump line from over the wicket with a leg side cordon of two short legs and a silly mid-on, he was described by Bradman as [...] "unique in every way".

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} overlap and {{differences}} between measures of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). It was expected that: (1) <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> obsessive compulsive symptoms are distinct concepts, yet that (2) <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> the cognitive components of OCD are more strongly related compared to the behaviour components of OCD. By means of confirmatory analysis {{it was found that}} all six components, i. e. worry, obsessive rumination, impulses, washing, checking and precision proved distinct components. Of the obsessive compulsive components, rumination was found to be most closely associated with worry. In further investigating the relative impact of obsessive compulsive symptoms on worry, it was found that obsessive rumination offered the largest unique contribution to the prediction of worry. When controlled for depressive mood, the overlap between rumination <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> dropped substantially. The results of this study clearly underline the differentiation between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> obsessive compulsive symptoms. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
