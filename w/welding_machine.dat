5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
25|$|A welder, Ray Bradley {{was working}} with a crew of men {{installing}} an expansion joint on July 31, 1950. That day, it was raining heavily and Ray had reached down to grab the led direct current wire for a <b>welding</b> <b>machine.</b> According to the Pierce County Coroner's report, he suffered a heart attack, although bridgemen believed his death {{was the result of}} electrocution.|$|E
25|$|The {{plunge depth}} {{is defined as}} the depth of the lowest point of the {{shoulder}} {{below the surface of the}} welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality. Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the tool. Tilting the tool by 2–4 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in the tool displacement while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains the tool position above the weld plate.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{young man}} Larry learned how to weld from Conrad Stenglein in the Newburgh, New York area. [...] The shop was simple. As Stenglein {{described}} it: [...] "All {{we had in the}} shop was a <b>welding</b> <b>machine,</b> torches, grinder, body putty, stuff like that." [...] Quality of work was important to Larry early on. [...] Stenglein said that [...] "Whatever part we made for a bike, it had to be strong and had to be good, that was our thing. It had to be perfect. If Larry put something on a bike that he didn't like, he'd cut it off. That's how he was." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1895, {{he founded}} the Lincoln Electric Company in Cleveland, Ohio with a capital {{investment}} of $200.00. Lincoln used the facilities of his company to do research and to experiment with the electrical devices which he invented. The main product of the company was electric motors of his own design. He was directly responsible for 55 patents which gained him national fame as an industrialist. Lincoln helped finance the education of his brother James F. Lincoln who joined him upon his graduation in 1907, as the sales director of the company. The product line of the company expanded and included battery chargers for electric automobiles. In 1914, James F. Lincoln headed and supervised the company as general manager. This in turn gave Lincoln {{the time that he}} needed to continue with his research, experiments and inventions. The first variable voltage, single operator, portable <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> in the world was introduced by the Lincoln Electric Co. in 1911. Lincoln created and patented [...] a flux. The flux made a weld as flexible as steel. The shielded arc welding process developed by Lincoln [...] {{played an important role in}} the manufacture of merchant ships in World War II.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, British {{engineer}} Francis Thomas Bacon successfully {{developed a}} 5kW stationary fuel cell. In 1955, W. Thomas Grubb, a chemist {{working for the}} General Electric Company (GE), further modified the original fuel cell design by using a sulphonated polystyrene ion-exchange membrane as the electrolyte. Three years later another GE chemist, Leonard Niedrach, devised a way of depositing platinum onto the membrane, which served as catalyst for the necessary hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. This {{became known as the}} [...] "Grubb-Niedrach fuel cell". GE went on to develop this technology with NASA and McDonnell Aircraft, leading to its use during Project Gemini. This was the first commercial use of a fuel cell. In 1959, a team led by Harry Ihrig built a 15kW fuel cell tractor for Allis-Chalmers, which was demonstrated across the U.S. at state fairs. This system used potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and compressed hydrogen and oxygen as the reactants. Later in 1959, Bacon and his colleagues demonstrated a practical five-kilowatt unit capable of powering a <b>welding</b> <b>machine.</b> In the 1960s, Pratt and Whitney licensed Bacon's U.S. patents for use in the U.S. space program to supply electricity and drinking water (hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks). In 1991, the first hydrogen fuel cell automobile was developed by Roger Billings.|$|E
