40|$|We {{report an}} {{innovation}} that utilizes {{solar and wind}} energy in a compact and practical way. A mobile solar and wind-powered mobile generator that produces 1. 5 kW has been designed and constructed at the University of Bahrain, in collaboration with Long International, Bahrain. The renewable-energy system was erected on a trailer and is self-contained. It contains 16 solar panels with each panel capable of producing 75 W (VSC= 17 V and ISC= 4. 45 A), 2 Rutland <b>wind-power</b> <b>generators</b> (output 50 W at a wind speed of 9. 8 m s- 1), 20 deep cycle batteries [each of 12 V with 100 Ah (ampere-hours) ], a charge controller, and a voltage inverter (Power 1500 VA, 6. 5 A, frequency 50 Hz). The cost of each watt in this mobile station is BD 3. 3, i. e. USD 8. 6. The system {{has the advantage of}} being easy to install (maximum erection time 10 min by two people), produces no noise, looks good, is environmentally friendly, reliable and educational. ...|$|R
40|$|Ice loads {{measured}} on lighthouses in the Gulf of Bothnia {{can serve as}} guidance for design of foundations for <b>wind-power</b> <b>generators.</b> At some locations in the sea these structures must withstand high pressure from solid land fast ice {{as well as from}} ridges or other compacted ice masses that are drifting. Recommendations for design of offshore foundations around the Swedish coastline have recently been written by the authors. For the purpose of design, effective pressure as well as compressive strength is assumed to be independent of ice thickness. All structures should be designed for dynamic ice loads that are dependent on the natural frequency of the structure and the ice drift velocity. Increased effective pressure has earlier been indicated for high speed ice crushing both in field studies and compression tests. The presented results from ice load measurements on lighthouse Norströmsgrund support the suspicion that also design ice loads should increase with drift speed. This rate effect and other uncertainties about the worst case scenario for ice-induced vibrations suggest a more conservative design of wind-power foundations inside the dynamic ice zone.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{microcontroller}} based sinusoidal {{pulse width modulation}} SPWM single-phase inverter is emphasized to constant frequency conversion scheme for wind power application. The <b>wind-power</b> <b>generator</b> output voltage and frequency are fluctuated due to the variation of wind velocity. Therefore the AC output voltage of wind-generator is converted into DC voltage by using rectifier circuit and this DC voltage is converted back to AC voltage by using inverter circuit. SPWM technique is used in inverter to get nearly sine wave and reduce harmonic content. The rating of inverter is 500 W single-phase 220 V 50 Hz. The required SPWM timing pulses for the inverter are generated from the PIC 16 F 877 A microcontroller. Circuit simulation was done by using Proteus 7 Professional and MATLABR 2008 software.

40|$|AbstractTaiwan Power Company (TPC) {{launched}} the CCS pilot project in 2008. In the investigation stage, the Chang-Gong site {{was selected as}} the preferred site for the suitable geology condition and large storage capacity. Under the Chang- Gong preferred site, target aquifer underlying the recent overburden sediments consists of four key geologic formations, namely KCL, CS, CL, and TKS formations from bottom to top. These formations have been outlined based on extensive literal review and analysis of available geological data, the maximum depth is estimated approximately 3, 000 m. Hence, prior to allocate a 3, 000 m deep characterization well, the land seismic reflection survey is regarded as compulsory to testify the adequacy of required drilling depth. Six survey lines were distributed in the industrial park of the preferred site, the seismic data showed higher S/N ratio than expected. It {{may be due to the}} fact that only few human activities and rather low background noises of the preferred test site. The continuous operation of <b>wind-power</b> <b>generator,</b> ocean current and tidal wave resulted in no significant effects on the seismic data. Moreover, the saturated soil would also help the downward penetration of source energy with mini-vibe. For better interpretation of the seismic profiles, an auxiliary seismic survey had been conducted nearby a pre-existing deep well (WG- 1) located 15 km away and south of the industrial park. The auxiliary seismic profile showed four extinct reflectors which match in sequence with the formation boundaries as revealed with the well log of the WG- 1. The six seismic profiles obtained also showed four extinct reflectors, which correlated consistency with the profile obtained 15 km away. This seismic investigation showed the top of the target formations was in depth ranged from 2, 200 m to 2, 460 m. Based on the depth interpretation of the target geological formations, a preliminary planning on the drilling depth, well bore development scheme, and stability design can be done prior to allocate a 3000 m characterization well on-site...|$|E
40|$|Agent {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most vibrant and active areas of research and development in information technology. Multi-agents and mobile agent technologies are making significant impacts upon almost all aspects of computing discipline. Boldly speaking, they are underpinning the profound changes taking place in our information society. One of the admittedly most successful applications is in global business partnerships, directly due to the nature of the problem. In fact, virtual organizations and e-commerce have become fashionable practices of today's global businesses.

40|$|A coupled field-circuit {{simulator}} for the transient {{analysis of}} wind energy conversion systems with a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) {{was developed and}} experimentally validated. Short-term grid disturbance and ride-through analyses were carried out for a 1. 7 -MW DFIG wind-power conversion system. Two simulation models of the wind-power DFIG were compared to reveal {{the consequences of the}} different modeling approaches for the accuracy of transient analysis. The DFIG was represented in the simulator by an analytical two-axis model with constant lumped parameters or by a finite element method-based model. The model of the generator was coupled with a model of the crowbar-protected and direct torque-controlled frequency converter, a model of the main transformer, and a simple model of the grid. In addition, a detailed model of the wind turbine was compared with a simplified model that omits the model of the mechanical part of the wind turbine. The simulator was experimentally validated by a 1. 7 -MW full-scale measurement set-up. The comparison between the simulated and measured results shows reasonable agreement. The analytical model of the DFIG, however, manifests certain drawbacks that are overcome by using a FEM model. The developed coupled field circuit-based simulator has proved to be capable and reliable for modeling of complicated power electronics and electrical machine set-ups and thus is a useful tool for the development and optimization of <b>wind-power</b> <b>generators.</b> reviewe...|$|R
5|$|Electricity for Canberra mainly {{comes from}} the {{national}} power grid through substations at Holt and Fyshwick (via Queanbeyan). Power was first supplied from a thermal plant built in 1913, near the Molonglo River, but this was finally closed in 1957. A 20 megawatt photovoltaic solar plant, described as the largest photovoltaic solar farm in Australia, was officially opened at Royalla on 3 September 2014. The 2.3 megawatt Mount Majura solar farm was opened in Majura on 6 October 2016. Construction is under way on a 13 megawatt solar farm at Mugga Lane, Hume and an 11 megawatt solar farm at Williamsdale. The Williamsdale solar farm was originally planned to be built at Uriarra but faced local opposition. In addition numerous houses in Canberra have photovoltaic panels and/or solar hot water systems. Some limited local renewable power is produced via a hydro generator on the main water supply pipeline for Canberra at Mount Stromlo and methane plants at waste landfill sites at Belconnen and Mugga Lane. There are currently no <b>wind-power</b> <b>generators</b> in Canberra, but several have been built or are being built or planned in nearby New South Wales, such as the 140.7 megawatt Capital Wind Farm. The ACT government announced in 2013 that it was raising the target for electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources to 90% by 2020. This will raise the target from 210 to 550 megawatts. It announced in February 2015 that three wind farms in Victoria and South Australia would supply 200 megawatts of capacity; these {{are expected to be}} operational by 2017. Contracts for the purchase of an additional 200 megawatts of power per year from two wind farms in South Australia and New South Wales were announced in December 2015 and March 2016. The ACT government announced in 2014 that up to 23 megawatts of feed-in-tariff entitlements would be made available {{for the establishment of a}} facility in the ACT or surrounding region for burning household and business waste to produce electricity by 2020.|$|R
