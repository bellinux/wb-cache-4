5|$|When the <b>Whiskers</b> first {{formed in}} 1998, their main rivals were Young Ones, Lazuli, Elveera and Vivian. These were their main rivals for three years, then Gattaca formed {{north of the}} <b>Whiskers</b> {{territory}} and became their rivals. Over the next few years, Vivian {{moved away from the}} <b>Whiskers</b> and Commandos became the <b>Whiskers</b> new rivals. Soon Elveera and Lazuli moved away from the <b>Whiskers</b> and Aztecs form their territory next to the <b>Whiskers.</b> In 2007 <b>Whiskers</b> main rivals were Young Ones, Aztecs and Commandos. Then Young Ones died out, and Kung Fu formed next to <b>Whiskers,</b> Commandos moved away and the Sequoia formed. Today <b>Whiskers</b> main rivals are Toyota, Lazuli, Kung Fu and Sequoia.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Whiskers</b> are a {{successful}} group of meerkats that own a two-square-mile {{area in the}} Kuruman River Reserve. The group came into existence in 1998, with four Young Ones females and two Lazuli rovers - reinforced with a wild meerkat who had been released nearby (instead of the potjie) from Van Zylsrus. Holly and Argon took dominance till 2000. After Holly died Risca took dominance with Beetle. She evicted some females who formed the Asphodel and Hobgoblin groups. Eleven Vivian rovers emigrated into <b>Whiskers</b> in 2001. Izit won dominance over Basil, despite Basil being older. Basil left to join to Lazuli. Risca and Izit lost dominance and left to form the Gattaca. Vialli and Zaphod became the next dominant pair. After Vialli died, Flower won dominance in 2002. Yossarian overthrew Zaphod taking male dominance but Zaphod overthrew him sometime after. Flower and Zaphod reign then on. The group split Yossarian and Super Furry Animal taking dominance in the splinter till Baddiel overthrew her sister. The <b>Whiskers</b> reunited and Flower and Zaphod took back dominance. Flower evicted Kinkaju and Mozart with two other females who formed the Starsky. Flower succumbed to a snake bite in January 2007. Her daughter Rocket Dog rose to power after her. The <b>Whiskers</b> split in two and formed the Aztecs. After Rocket Dog died in 2008 and Ella established dominance. Five <b>Whiskers</b> males emigrated into the Lazuli kicking out Thundercat who soon joined the <b>Whiskers.</b> The group recently recovered after a low in numbers. Many <b>Whiskers</b> formed or joined other groups. Some males have joined the <b>Whiskers</b> rivals the Lazuli and Commandos. While many groups were formed by <b>Whiskers</b> members such as the two largest group in the KMP today, the Baobab and Kung Fu. With every move recorded on camera by Cambridge University, the <b>Whiskers</b> became famous as {{the stars of the}} hit television series, Meerkat Manor (2005).|$|E
5|$|The Whiskers' new {{neighbours}} {{were the}} Zappa and the Starsky. Although {{smaller than the}} <b>Whiskers,</b> the Zappa attacked frequently, and when they fled after one attack, the <b>Whiskers</b> – in a rare occurrence – adopted an abandoned Zappa pup. The Starsky group, on the other hand, was no threat to the <b>Whiskers.</b> Formed by a trio of Flower's daughters permanently evicted from the <b>Whiskers,</b> the small group was ravaged by illness, predators, {{and a lack of}} new pups. The constantly struggling Starsky succumbed in the penultimate episode, with the death of the last survivor, Mozart, who was killed by a jackal. Former <b>Whiskers</b> female Maybelline broke away from the group {{at the end of the}} third series, forming a new group called the Aztecs which became the Whiskers' rivals in the fourth series.|$|E
30|$|To {{explain the}} above effect, {{we have used}} {{additional}} experiment consisting in subsequent etching the surface layers of the crystal and measuring the <b>whisker</b> resistance. The etching of the <b>whisker</b> surface leads to substantial increase of the <b>whisker</b> resistance indicating that the <b>whisker</b> subsurface layers are the main contributors for the <b>whisker</b> conductance.|$|R
40|$|<b>Whisker</b> {{movement}} {{has been shown to}} be under active control in certain specialist animals such as rats and mice. Though this <b>whisker</b> movement is well characterised, the role and effect of this movement on subsequent sensing is poorly understood. One method for investigating this phenomena is to generate artificial <b>whisker</b> deflections with robotic hardware under different movement conditions. A limitation of this approach is that assumptions must be made in the design of any artificial <b>whisker</b> actuators, which will impose certain restrictions on the whisker-object interaction. In this paper we present three robotic <b>whisker</b> platforms, each with different mechanical <b>whisker</b> properties and actuation mechanisms. A feature-based classifier is used to simultaneously discriminate radial distance to contact and contact speed for the first time. We show that whisker-object contact speed predictably affects deflection magnitudes, invariant of <b>whisker</b> material or <b>whisker</b> movement trajectory. We propose that rodent <b>whisker</b> control allows the animal to improve sensing accuracy by regulating contact speed induced touch-to-touch variability...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{fabrication}} of a Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based, mouse (or rodent) <b>whisker</b> mimicking, tactile sensor is presented. Unlike previous designs {{reported in the}} literature, this sensor mimics the mouse <b>whisker</b> not only mechanically, but it also makes macro movements just like a real mouse <b>whisker</b> in a natural environment. We have developed a mathematical model and performed finite element analysis using COMSOL, in order to optimise the <b>whisker</b> {{to have the same}} natural frequency as that of a biological <b>whisker.</b> Similarly, we have developed a control system that enables the <b>whisker</b> mimicking sensor to vibrate at variable frequencies and conducted practical experiments to validate the response of the sensor. The natural frequency of the <b>whisker</b> can be designed anywhere between 35 and 110 Hz, the same as a biological <b>whisker,</b> by choosing different materials and physical dimensions. The control system of this sensor enables the <b>whisker</b> to vibrate between 5 and 236 Hz...|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the fourth series, Nikita is shown without a mate after the death of Hannibal. Nikita is {{impregnated}} by Seacrest, a <b>Whiskers</b> roving male, in the third episode of the fourth series.

5|$|The meerkat Flower is {{born in the}} Kalahari Desert on March 15, 2000, to Holly, {{the leader}} of a meerkat group called the <b>Whiskers.</b> After an attack by a rival group, the Lazuli, the <b>Whiskers</b> are forced to {{surrender}} their territory and move to a new home. A hawk kills Holly when Flower is a year old, and her father abandons the group to find a new mate. Flower's sister Viale becomes the group's matriarch and chooses Youssarian, a roving male from the Lazuli, as her mate. Flower mates with Yossarian's brother, Zaphod, but Viale kills the resulting pups and banishes Flower from the group, allowing her to return later. During a time of starvation and drought, Viale attempts to lead the group across a road to forage. As she crosses, she is struck and killed by a passing truck. As the <b>Whiskers</b> attempt to adjust to the loss of their leader, a snake approaches the group. Flower steps in to lead an attack to drive it off. In doing so, she becomes the new leader of the group. Zaphod returns to the group to be her mate, while Yossarian steps aside and leaves the group. Flower leads the <b>Whiskers</b> back to their original home, and after a brief battle, the <b>Whiskers</b> reclaim it from the Lazuli. At end of the film, an on-screen note describes Flower's death during the third season of Meerkat Manor and the children she left behind.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: SiC <b>whisker</b> was {{introduced}} into reaction bonded silicon carbide to produce high performances composite by slip casting and reaction sintering. This study aimed at morphology of SiC <b>whisker</b> in the reaction bonded silicon carbide ceramics. The <b>whisker</b> was homogeneously dispersed into SiC/C suspension by ball-milling and ultrasonic dispersion. By chemical etching, the <b>whisker</b> displays the original burl profile on the polished {{surface of the}} composite. The raise of <b>whisker</b> fraction leads to an increase of porosity of the green body; and thus a decrease of density of the sintered body. For the specimen with 25 wt. % <b>whisker,</b> the rapid reaction of carbon with excess molten silicon leads to the missing of burl profile on the <b>whisker</b> surface. It is speculated that β-SiC on the <b>whisker</b> surface dissolved in the molten silicon during liquid silicon infiltration...|$|R
5|$|In season 3, Sophie {{was mostly}} only {{mentioned}} in the starting episodes of the third season. She was a frequent babysitter, often left with Flower' pups, Buster, Izzy and Suggs, along with Mitch and Jogu. When the <b>Whiskers</b> moved territories, Izzy fell behind and {{was expected to be}} killed by an eagle owl, but Sophie rescued the pup. Later, Sophie once again came to Izzy's aid and offered some food. When the babysitters (Sophie, Mitch and Jogu) and the pups were separated from the <b>Whiskers,</b> Mitch, being the oldest, left to find the main group to try and reunite them with the pups. Soon after a Zappa female named Maryline visited the burrow looking for her family. Following his hormones, Jogu went off after the evicted female, leaving Sophie to watch Flower's pups by herself. When the rival gang, the Zappa, attacked, Sophie took the pups below ground. But before the Zappa reached the burrow, the <b>Whiskers</b> arrived and chased them off. After these events, Sophie was seldom mentioned again throughout the season. At one point in the third season, she was played by Finn because Tina Sparkle was evicted.|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{was seen}} {{much more in}} The Next Generation. She was the prime {{babysitter}} and target for roving males, particularly Wilson from the Commandos. In an early episode, Sophie climbed a tree in search of caterpillars, but slipped and fell, injuring one of her front paws. The <b>Whiskers</b> moved on, potentially abandoning Sophie, but the injured female managed to limp after them and quickly recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sophie was evicted, for mating with Wilson, by Rocket Dog, who was also pregnant by Wilson. Rocket Dog gave birth to two pups and allowed Sophie to rejoin the group once she aborted her litter. Sophie babysat the two pups, Nugget and Beaker, along with Simon. The babysitters {{decided to take the}} pups foraging, but they ran into the Aztecs and headed for bolt hole. Inside, Simon found a puff adder, but the Whiskers' babysitters couldn't escape due to the Aztecs, they were viciously blocking the entrance. Eventually, the rain forced the Aztecs to retreat, but with it being so late, the babysitters couldn't return to the main burrow. The next day, Sophie reunited the pups with the <b>Whiskers,</b> but Simon had died from a snake bite. Later on in the series, Sophie was evicted by pregnant subordinate female, Wiley Kat. But before long, Wiley Kat was also kicked out by Rocket Dog. In spite of what Wiley Kat had done to her, Sophie stayed with her, and the pair were quickly joined by Wilson and Philippe. During their time together the small family encountered a Genet and Sophie mated with Wilson. But the rovers eventually left. After that, Wiley Kat and her unborn litter simply disappeared, but pregnant Sophie managed to rejoin the <b>Whiskers.</b> She gave birth to three pups named Flashman, Pickle and Chips, and spent her time babysitting Juno. When Rocket Dog was bitten by a Cape cobra, Sophie led the <b>Whiskers</b> to a new burrow, where Rocket Dog eventually met up with them and slowly recovered from her bite. In this season, Sophie was played by Flower's daughter Ella because her other counterparts, Tina Sparkle and Finn were evicted. After Rocket Dog's Death, she became the dominant female of the <b>Whiskers</b> and still retains that position today.|$|E
5|$|Zaphod, {{named after}} Zaphod Beeblebrox from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, was Flower's devoted partner and the {{dominant}} male of the <b>Whiskers.</b> As Zaphod assumed both roles by usurping, {{he tended to}} be edgy if Yossarian got too close to Flower. According to the Meerkat Manor: The Series Begins film, Zaphod was a roving Lazuli male before he joined the <b>Whiskers.</b> He was really born in the Vivian, not the Lazuil. He and his younger brother, Yossarian, visited the <b>Whiskers</b> {{at the same time}} in search of females. Flower's sister Viale, then the dominant female, chose Yossarian as her mate and he became the group's dominant male. Zaphod and Flower also mated, but Viale killed the resulting pups. After Viale's death, Flower assumed the role of dominant female and showed preference to Zaphod for her mate. Yossarian then left the group for an unknown length of time.|$|E

5|$|Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage {{on their}} own, their food choices are {{influenced}} by social interactions that may take place far away from foraging sites.

This inclines them not to eat poisons avoided by older rats.|$|E
5|$|Daisy {{is another}} of Flower's daughters {{and the first to}} be {{impregnated}} by roving Lazuli male Carlos. When the <b>Whiskers</b> were temporarily split into two groups after a goshawk attack {{in the middle of the}} series, Daisy assumed the role of dominant female of the splinter group, but lost the role when her evicted sister Tosca found the group and took control. When the splinter group rejoined the main <b>Whiskers,</b> Flower discovered Daisy's pregnancy but allowed her to remain in the group. Daisy gave birth in an empty burrow, and after Yossarian found her, he helped to carry her newborn pups to the real burrow. The next day, Flower initiated a burrow move. In order to remain with her family, Daisy left the pups behind to die in the abandoned burrow.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{effects of}} sensory {{deprivation}} on excitatory and inhibitory {{activity in the}} primary somatosensory cortex were studied in the adult rat. Excitatory and inhibitory transmission generated by <b>whisker</b> stimulation, and neuronal responsiveness to iontophoretically applied excitatory amino acids were recorded. <b>Whisker</b> input deprivation, through <b>whisker</b> trimming for a median of 24 days, resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} excitatory transmission to surround <b>whisker</b> stimulation. In contrast, the response magnitude to principal <b>whisker</b> stimulation remained unchanged. However, the response latencies to principal <b>whisker</b> and surround <b>whisker</b> stimulation were significantly reduced, which led to altered temporal response distributions in deprived cells. Neurons deprived of sensory input were significantly less responsive to glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, ct-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazol, epropionate and kainate. Following deprivation, no change was observed in cortical inhibitory transmiss~n measured 30 - 200 ms post-stimulus. These results show that excitatory transmission (including excitatory amino acid receptor function) is altered by adult <b>whisker</b> deprivation.

50|$|<b>Whisker</b> {{did not run}} in 1817 {{and made}} his first {{appearance}} on 13 April 1818 at the Craven Meeting (still listed as a five-year-old) in the Craven Stakes, for which he ran unplaced in a 22 horse field. At Newmarket, <b>Whisker</b> was third in the Fifty Pound subscription stakes, losing to the four-year-old colt Skim and the horse Fugitive. A few days later, <b>Whisker</b> beat Lord Cavendish's colt Little Dick in a 200-guinea match race. <b>Whisker</b> received 200 guineas forfeiture from the horse Cannonball on 11 May at Newmarket. The next day, <b>Whisker</b> finished third in a handicap race, losing to the colt Merrymaker and the filly Leopoldine (the full-sister to 1816 Derby winner Prince Leopold). At the same meeting, <b>Whisker</b> beat Mr. Prince's colt Manfred in a match race and {{a few hours later}} finished fifth (unplaced) in a 50-guinea Cup race won by The Flyer.

5000|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{aspect of the}} barrel field are the <b>whisker</b> barrels. These structures were first discovered by Woolsey and Van der Loos. Staining in the <b>whisker</b> barrels is more distinct than that {{in other areas of}} somatosensory cortex. Recognizing that the array was {{similar to that of the}} vibrissae on the mystacial pad, they hypothesized that the barrels were the [...] "cortical correlates of the mystacial vibrissae" [...] and that [...] "one barrel represents one vibrissa". Whereas small non-whisker areas of barrel cortex correspond to large and sometimes overlapping areas of the body, each much larger <b>whisker</b> barrel corresponds to a single <b>whisker.</b> As a result, the <b>whisker</b> barrels are the focus of the majority of barrel cortex research, and 'barrel cortex' is often used to refer primarily to the <b>whisker</b> barrels. Consequently, much of this article focuses on rodent <b>whisker</b> barrel cortex.|$|R
5|$|The Commandoes Mob {{was formed}} in 2004 {{when a group of}} Gattaca females teamed up with a Young Ones roving coalition. Aragorn and Zorilla {{established}} dominance after several disputes.

Then five <b>Whiskers</b> males emigrated and all natal adult males had left, Zarathustra became dominant male till he was predated. Then Baker took his position but Miles stole it from him. Throuought their history, the Commandos had been a fast-growing group, unlike their founding group the Gattaca. In January 2009, Zorilla, Miles, Baker Karim and Cody were killed by TB, the group is led by <b>Whiskers</b> male Panthro and Commandos female Celidh. Disease hit the group killing a few members. The Commandos left the monitored area and could no longer be tracked. A few new groups were formed from Commandos members. The Kung Fu was formed by Zorilla's sister.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{clear evidence}} of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda and Megaconus, from 164 million {{years ago in the}} mid-Jurassic. In the 1950s, it was suggested that the foramina (passages) in the maxillae and premaxillae (bones {{in the front of the}} upper jaw) of cynodonts were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae (<b>whiskers)</b> and so were evidence of hair or fur; it was soon pointed out, however, that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae, as the modern lizard Tupinambis has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the nonmammalian cynodont Thrinaxodon. Popular sources, nevertheless, continue to attribute <b>whiskers</b> to Thrinaxodon. Studies on Permian coprolites suggest that non-mammalian synapsids of the epoch already had fur, setting the evolution of hairs possibly as far back as dicynodonts.|$|E
