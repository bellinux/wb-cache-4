5|$|Before {{the age of}} the bucentaurs, it is {{probable}} that for ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> assigned a small galley from the Venetian fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were made for a special ship to be built. This is evidenced by the promissioni – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E

5|$|By 1963 McNamara had {{convinced}} Kennedy that the Zeus <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> not worth deploying. The earlier concerns about cost and effectiveness, {{as well as}} new difficulties in terms of attack size and decoy problems, led McNamara to cancel the Zeus project on 5 January 1963.

The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.|$|E

In one case the Blenheim was able to see the target, but when it spotted them the aircraft increased power and disappeared. From 1 to 15 October 1940 Mk.
