5|$|A {{controlled}} {{comparative study}} by the Navy Experimental Diving Unit in the NEDU Ocean Simulation Facility wet-pot comparing the VVAL18 Thalmann Algorithm with a deep stop profile suggests that the deep stops schedule had {{a greater risk of}} DCS than the matched (same total stop time) conventional schedule. The proposed explanation was that slower gas <b>washout</b> or continued gas uptake offset benefits of reduced bubble growth at deep stops.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the wing was its <b>washout.</b> The {{trailing}} edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span, the angle of incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This <b>washout</b> was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{had been}} unbeaten {{throughout}} the tour. Between the Fourth and Fifth Test, they played five tour matches. They defeated Derbyshire by an innings, before having a <b>washout</b> against Glamorgan. The Australians then defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets, before drawing with Lancashire, who hung on with three wickets in {{hand on the}} final day. Australia's final lead-in outing was a two-day non-first-class match against Durham, which was drawn after rain washed out the second day.|$|E
5|$|The linear {{component}} is active when the tissue pressure exceeds ambient pressure by a given amount {{specific to the}} tissue compartment. When the tissue pressure drops below this cross-over criterion the tissue is modelled by exponential kinetics. During gas uptake, tissue pressure never exceeds ambient, so it is always modelled by exponential kinetics. This results in a model with the desired asymmetrical characteristics of slower <b>washout</b> than uptake.|$|E
5|$|After the Fourth Test, the Australians {{had five}} tour matches {{before the final}} Test. They {{defeated}} Derbyshire by an innings, before having a <b>washout</b> against Glamorgan. The Australians then defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets, before drawing with Lancashire, who hung on with three wickets in hand on the final day. This {{was followed by a}} two-day non-first-class match against Durham, which was drawn after rain washed out the second day. During this period, Barnes returned to action after recuperating from his rib injury. Toshack also recovered to play against Lancashire, but injured himself again and was ruled out of the remainder of the tour.|$|E

40|$|Irrigation or <b>washouts</b> of {{the bladder}} are usually {{performed}} in various clinical settings. In the 1980 s Elliot and colleagues argued that urothelial damage could occur after <b>washouts</b> and irrigations of the bladder. The exact mechanism underlying urothelial damage {{has not yet}} been discovered. To our knowledge, this is the first report of fatal fluid overload and pulmonary edema, due to urothelium disruption occurring during bladder irrigation, approached performing complete histological and immunohistochemical investigation on bladder specimens. The exposed case deserves attention since it demonstrates that, although very rarely, irrigation or <b>washouts</b> of the bladder may have unexpected serious clinical consequences...|$|R
5|$|Irreversible antagonists covalently bind to the {{receptor}} target and, in general, {{cannot be}} removed; inactivating the receptor {{for the duration}} of the antagonist effects is determined by the rate of receptor turnover, the rate of synthesis of new receptors. Phenoxybenzamine is an example of an irreversible alpha blocker—it permanently binds to α adrenergic receptors, preventing adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding. Inactivation of receptors normally results in a depression of the maximal response of agonist dose-response curves and a right shift in the curve occurs where there is a receptor reserve similar to non-competitive antagonists. A <b>washout</b> step in the assay will usually distinguish between non-competitive and irreversible antagonist drugs, as effects of non-competitive antagonists are reversible and activity of agonist will be restored.|$|E
5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, {{it is important to}} include a <b>washout</b> period of about two weeks between the medications. The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to heavy}} rainfall, {{widespread}} flooding was reported, {{especially in the}} central and western portions of the county. Whole neighborhoods in The Acreage, Loxahatchee, Royal Palm Beach, and Wellington were left stranded for up to several days. In some areas, flooding was considered the worst since Hurricane Irene in 1999. At the post office in Loxahatchee, {{the parking lot was}} flooded, forcing the building to close for several days. A major <b>washout</b> was reported in West Palm Beach at the intersection of State Roads 80 and 882. Also in West Palm Beach, a road collapsed and fire rescue crews quickly closed the road. On State Road 704, a portion of it became inaccessible to low-clearance vehicles. A man died in West Palm Beach after driving through the storm and crashing into a concrete wall along Interstate 95. Several major and minor roads were also inundated by water in Wellington. Additionally, there was flooding at the intersections of Meadow Avenue and Greenview Shores Boulevard, and Indian Mound Road and South Shore Boulevard. Heavy rainfall left several leaking roofs at an apartment complex in Pahokee.|$|E

25|$|<b>Washout</b> toilets have a flat {{platform}} with a shallow pool of water. They are flushed by a {{jet of water}} from the back that drives excreta into the trap below. From there, the water flow removes it into the sewage system. An advantage of the design is that users will not get splashed from below. <b>Washout</b> toilets have a shallow pool of water into which waste is deposited, with a trapped drain just behind this pool. Waste is cleared out from this pool of water by being swept over into the trap (usually either a P-trap or an S-trap) and then beyond into a sewer by water from the flush. <b>Washout</b> pans were amongst the first types of ceramic toilets invented and since the early 1970s are now only found in a decreasing number of localities in continental Europe. A <b>washout</b> toilet is a kind of flush toilet which were once predominantly used in Germany, Austria and France. It was patented in Britain by George Jennings in 1852 and remained the standard toilet type in Britain throughout the 19th century.|$|E
