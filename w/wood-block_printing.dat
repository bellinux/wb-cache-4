There were great advances in artistic work, in technical skill and in all the amenities of life. Tea was first used, paper manufactured and <b>wood-block</b> <b>printing</b> began. Millions of people indeed were leading orderly, graceful and kindly lives in China during these centuries when the attenuated populations of Europe and Western Asia were living either in hovels, small walled cities or grim robber fortresses.

40|$|For {{many centuries}} artists have {{considered}} and depicted illumination in art, from {{the effect of}} sunlight on objects {{at different times of}} the day, of shadows and highlights as cast by the moon, through indirect light as that through an open window or the artificial light of the candle or firelight. The presentation will consider artists who were fascinated by the phenomena of natural and artificial illumination and how they were able to render the natural world as a form of dynamic range through pigment. Artists have been long aware of the psychological aspects of the juxtaposition of colour in exploiting the optical qualities and arranging visual effects in painting and prints. Artists in the 16 th century were attempting to develop an extended dynamic range through multi-colour, <b>wood-block</b> <b>printing.</b> Artists working at the height of naturalist realism in the 17 th through the 19 th century were fascinated by the illusory nature of light on objects. The presentation will also consider the interpretation of dynamic range through the medium of mezzotint, possibly the most subtle of printing methods, which was used by printers to copy paintings, and to create highly original works of art containing a dynamic range of tones...|$|E
40|$|Gutenbergin Shanghai is a {{book about}} the {{industrial}} revolution in China's print culture and the ensuing rise of print capitalism ‘with Chinese characteristics. ’ It offers a coherent and unique account of the introduction, adaptation and eventual imitation of modern, i. e. Western, print technology in China, with the aim of establishing the material basis on which to study the transition of China's ancient literary culture into the industrial age. It reconstructs the history of print technology from the first cast type matrices to the adaptation of the electrotype process, from photo-lithography to the colour-offset press, from the platen press to the rotary printing press, and tells the stories of three of the most dominant lithograph and letterpress publishers of the late Qing and the early Republican period respectively. This is a worthwhile undertaking, exploring an aspect of modern publishing in China, which hitherto has not received the attention it deserves. The study is based on missionary writings, personal reminiscences, collections of source materials, documents on the early book printers' trade organizations from the Shanghai Municipal Archives, and oral history materials (interviews conducted during the 1950 s with former printing workshops apprentices). The bibliography also lists a couple of interviews, but unfortunately {{it is not clear how}} relevant they are to the story told in the book. The introduction of lithography into Shanghai by Jesuit missionaries in 1876 plays a pivotal role in this account. Lithography, especially photolithography coming a few years later, was a technology particularly suited to Chinese needs and cheaper than traditional <b>wood-block</b> <b>printing...</b>|$|E

40|$|For {{over five}} hundred years a group of wool {{tapestries}} created in China have been stored in Japan. The tapestries are woven of soft wool, their surfaces hand painted with unusual motifs on backgrounds dyed the soft orange-red hue produced by the safflower plant. Their motifs are identified with the ancient Manichaean religion, considered extinct since the seventeenth century. The motifs and {{the layout of the}} tapestries’ design suggests that they functioned as mantles used by religious leaders. The Chinese government outlawed the Manichaean religion and prohibited its trappings, the laws strictly enforced as the Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644) became firmly established. The tapestries were collected and destroyed, with a few sold off to ocean traders. In the following centuries the merchants of Kyoto were able to acquire some of the latter and have utilized them ever since to adorn their annual Gion Festival Procession. Meanwhile, in China, surviving religionists migrated southward to China’s Southern Coastal communities. This migration, began as early as the Sung Dynasty (1127 - 1278), continued throughout the Yuan (1279 - 1368) and Ming (1368 - 1644) Dynasties. The artisans, who were descendants of Uyghur Manichaean clans who had settled in China as early as the ninth century, strived to perpetuate their sacerdotal costume tradition of decorated wool mantles. However, in their new environment in Southern Coastal China, the only sheep bred were marshland sheep, which produce a coarse rough yarn. The cherished red-orange dye was scarce as well, as safflower was cultivated in the North. Fine hand painting was replaced by <b>wood-block</b> <b>printing.</b> Taoist motifs, more acceptable to the Chinese Government, replaced the outlawed Manichaean motifs. Nevertheless the designers, weavers, and dyers continued to produce the transformed tapestries in Southern Coastal communities, production continuing throughout the twentieth century...|$|E
40|$|Almost {{as soon as}} {{they were}} invented in 1858, {{chemical}} dyes were introduced to Japanese artists and craftsmen. Chemically dyed red, purple, orange and blue silk yarns were woven into elaborate textiles used to furnish the Meiji palaces, costume Noh actors, and wrap Buddhist priests, while dyers adapted resist techniques such as yuzen and stencil resist. Japanese wood-block print artists also responded to the new colors and incorporated them into their work creating vibrant scenes of life during the Meiji period. The bright, bold colors produced with the early synthetic dyes became emblematic of the technological advances of the Meiji period and were know as “the colors of progress. ” This paper is based on a study begun at the Museum of Fine Arts to identify the chemical dyes used in Japan in both textiles and <b>wood-block</b> <b>printing.</b> Standards for the identification of chemical dyes have been created by the Museum’s Conservation Science Department and will serve as a basis for determining which chemical dyes were used by the Japanese and, because many woodblock prints are dated, maybe even begin to identify when the dyes were introduced. The Museum’s collection provides a remarkable resource for such a study. Its woodblock print collection and its collection of Japanese textiles and costume are unrivaled in the United States. The collection contains a remarkable number of Meiji-era textiles collected by one of the museum’s most significant donors of Japanese art, William Sturgis Bigelow. Bigelow lived and traveled throughout Japan during the Meiji period and collected all types of Japanese art, both traditional and contemporary. The Meiji-period textiles and costume that entered the collection include a selection of Noh theater costume, kimono, textile lengths, yuzen samples, furnishing textiles and Buddhist textiles, including kesa, ohi, and uchishiki. The Museum’s collection also contains a book of Meiji-period textile samples purchased by the MFA’s first curator Charles Loring during a visit to the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. The samples in this book will be analyzed and will provide evidence of the first wholesale use of aniline dyes in Japan. While one aspect of this study is to better understand which dyes were used in Japan, an important theme of this paper will be the reasons why chemical dyes were so readily accepted in Meiji Japan and their propagandistic role within the Meiji government as symbols of progress...|$|E
