25|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid-state}} joining {{process that}} uses a non-consumable tool to join two facing workpieces without melting the <b>workpiece</b> <b>material.</b> Heat is generated by friction between the rotating tool and the <b>workpiece</b> <b>material,</b> {{which leads to a}} softened region near the FSW tool. While the tool is traversed along the joint line, it mechanically intermixes the two pieces of metal, and forges the hot and softened metal by the mechanical pressure, which is applied by the tool, much like joining clay, or dough. It is primarily used on wrought or extruded aluminium and particularly for structures which need very high weld strength. FSW is also found in modern shipbuilding, trains, and aerospace applications.|$|E
25|$|Most {{metalworking}} and {{machining processes}} {{can benefit from}} the use of cutting fluid, depending on <b>workpiece</b> <b>material.</b> Common exceptions to this are cast iron and brass, which may be machined dry (though this is not true of all brasses, and any machining of brass will likely benefit from the presence of a cutting fluid).|$|E
25|$|The {{tools are}} usually mounted in a {{dedicated}} bore finishing machine, however {{they can also}} be mounted in a milling machine. In either case the tool, workpiece, or both are rotated and the tool is plunged into the bore and removed. The part is then transferred to the next station or a larger tool is mounted and a larger bore machined, and the process repeated until the desired bore geometry is reached. The number of tools required to achieve the desired bore size is dependent on the <b>workpiece</b> <b>material,</b> the amount of stock to be removed and geometrical requirements, with four to six tool pieces being common. Each tool is progressively larger than the last, but in diminishing increments; as the stock removal is reduced, so is the tool's diamond grit size.|$|E

The developement of a cBN coating for cutting tools, combining the advantages of coating and of cBN, is of great importance for many branches of industry. Based on the first success of deposting adherent cBN films on cemented carbide substrates with a thickness of up to 0, 8 pm at temperature for below 1000 °C, indexable inserts were coated with a B C film as target and a cBN facing.

40|$|Every {{machining}} operation leaves characteristic {{evidence on the}} machined surface. This evidence {{takes the form of}} finely spaced micro irregularities left by the cutting tool. A two-pass technique was introduced for enhancing the surface roughness for different cutting conditions and <b>workpiece</b> <b>materials</b> based on the feed marks (pattern) left by the tool in the {{machining operation}}. An important drawback of this technique is that the time taken for its two passes represents twice the time of regular machining. Another drawback is the difficulty of adjusting the tool in the second pass with the appropriate accuracy. For solving these problems, a tool design is provided in this paper to achieve the same results of the two-pass technique in one pass. The objective of this research is to compare this technique using different methods (regular or one pass, two passes, new tool) using different cutting conditions and different <b>workpiece</b> <b>materials.</b> In addition to the surface roughness, straightness and roundness errors are measured for these methods (two passes, new tool) and compared with regular cutting. Improvement of surface roughness was shown as the straightness and roundness errors decrease by using this new technique. In practice, the new tool technique improves the surface roughness, straightness error, and roundness error by more than 58, 65, and 50 per cent respectively at the proposed cutting condition (50 m/min cutting speed, 0. 2 mm/rev feed, and 1 mm depth of cut) for all <b>workpiece</b> <b>materials</b> used.

40|$|Abstract: Using a gas as {{cutting fluid}} {{is a new}} {{solution}} for enhancing machinability. Traditional methods such as wet cutting have some drawbacks such as high cost, pollution, and unsatisfactory product quality. The present research is concerned with studying the effect of applying different gases (N 2, O 2, and CO 2) on cutting forces and product quality under different cutting conditions for different <b>workpiece</b> <b>materials.</b> Two groups of experiments were planned. The first was performed using different gas flowrates to study the effect of flowrate on cutting forces and surface roughness. The second group was performed using different cutting condi-tions and <b>workpiece</b> <b>materials.</b> Empirical equations and a correlation for the behaviour {{of each of the}} output responses were investigated {{as a function of the}} independent variables when applying each gas. Results showed that better product surface finish and lower cutting forces could be achieved by using gas cutting fluids compared with dry cutting. Also, machinability improved when the gas flowrate increased...|$|R

Surface roughness values at different cutting conditions were measured and analysed.

50|$|Lubricants are {{sometimes}} used {{to cool the}} workpiece and wheel, lubricate the interface, and remove swarf (chips). It must be applied directly to the cutting area {{to ensure that the}} fluid is not carried away by the grinding wheel. Common lubricants include water-soluble chemical fluids, water-soluble oils, synthetic oils, and petroleum-based oils. The type of lubrication used depends on the <b>workpiece</b> <b>material</b> and is outlined in the table below.|$|E
50|$|When {{using the}} {{technique}} of backward impact extrusion putting an angle on the punch in the press is used to decrease the amount of pressure applied to the punch.

50|$|If {{variables}} such as cutter geometry and the rigidity of the machine tool and its tooling setup could be ideally maximized (and reduced to negligible constants), then only a lack of power (that is, kilowatts or horsepower) available to the spindle would prevent {{the use of the}} maximum possible speeds and feeds for any given <b>workpiece</b> <b>material</b> and cutter material.

50|$|Typical <b>workpiece</b> <b>materials</b> include aluminum, brass, plastics, cast iron, mild steel, and {{stainless}} steel.

Stainless steel {{is very difficult to}} grind due to its toughness and ability to work harden, but can be worked with the right grade of grinding wheels.|$|R
50|$|Typical <b>workpiece</b> <b>{{materials}}</b> include {{cast iron}} and mild steel. These two materials don't tend to clog the grinding wheel while being processed.

5000|$|The most {{important}} property of an abrasive is its hardness. For abrasive grains to effectively cut, {{they must be}} significantly harder than the <b>workpiece</b> <b>material.</b> They can be grouped based on their hardness into two categories: conventional abrasives and superabrasives. Conventional abrasive materials {{have been used by}} man since the advent of machining. They are made of materials that exist naturally on Earth, and they are abundant and cheap. Conventional abrasives can suitably machine most materials. Superabrasives are much harder than conventional abrasives. Since they are much more expensive, they are used when conventional abrasives will not suffice. Common abrasives are listed below.|$|E
50|$|The {{shockwave}} generated coldwork (plastic strain) in the <b>workpiece</b> <b>material</b> creates compressive and tensile {{residual stresses}} {{to maintain an}} equilibrium state of the material. These residual stresses are compressive at the workpiece surface and gradually fade into low tensile stresses below and surrounding the laser peened area. The cold work also work hardens the surface layer. The compressive residual stresses, {{and to a lesser}} extent, the cold work, from laser peening have been shown to prevent and mitigate high cycle fatigue (HCF), low cycle fatigue (LCF), stress corrosion cracking, fretting fatigue and to some degree, wear and corrosion pitting. It is outstanding at mitigating foreign object damage in turbine blades.|$|E
