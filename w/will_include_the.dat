5|$|In June 2005, a team {{of experts}} from the UK, Europe, Egypt, Russia and USA {{undertook}} a joint project to produce a new digital edition of the manuscript (involving all four holding libraries), {{and a series of}} other studies was announced.

5|$|The Wey and Arun Canal {{is being}} {{restored}} by the Wey and Arun Canal Trust, which {{was set up}} in the 1970s. The Wey and Arun Canal technically ended at Newbridge, but the restoration <b>will</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> Arun Navigation section down to Pallingham to reach the River Arun. For many years, the Solent and Arun Branch of the Inland Waterways Association organised an annual cruise on the river to ensure that the navigation rights were maintained. Responsibility for its organisation has now been passed to the Wey and Arun Canal Trust.|$|E
5|$|The {{downtown}} transit tunnel {{is expected}} to lose bus service in 2019, due to construction at Convention Place station; the tunnel would become served exclusively by light rail trains after that point. International District/Chinatown station will become the transfer point between the north–south Central Link light rail line and east–west East Link light rail line when the latter opens in 2023, connecting Seattle to Mercer Island, Bellevue, and Redmond. The new line <b>will</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> construction of a turnback track within the station, as well as reconfiguration of other tracks.|$|E

5|$|The heart {{derives from}} splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the {{cardiogenic}} region. Two endocardial tubes form here that fuse {{to form a}} primitive heart tube known as the tubular heart. Between {{the third and fourth}} week, the heart tube lengthens, and begins to fold to form an S-shape within the pericardium. This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further development <b>will</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> septa and valves formation and remodelling of the heart chambers. By the end of the fifth week the septa are complete and the heart valves are completed by the ninth week.|$|E
5|$|While {{dysprosium}} {{is never}} encountered {{as a free}} element, it is found in many minerals, including xenotime, fergusonite, gadolinite, euxenite, polycrase, blomstrandine, monazite and bastnäsite; often with erbium and holmium or other rare earth elements. Currently, most dysprosium is being obtained from the ion-adsorption clay ores of southern China, and future sources <b>will</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> Halls Creek region in Western Australia. In the high-yttrium version of these, dysprosium {{happens to be the}} most abundant of the heavy lanthanides, comprising up to 7–8% of the concentrate (as compared to about 65% for yttrium). The concentration of Dy in the Earth's crust is about 5.2mg/kg and in sea water 0.9ng/L.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} element {{for the formation}} of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium, but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below its compensation depth. Calcium carbonate also becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, and corals, because their ability to form shells will be reduced, and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. Affected planktonic organisms <b>will</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> snail-like molluscs known as pteropods, and single-celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. All of these are important parts of the food chain and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences. In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as it becomes more difficult to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers.|$|E

5|$|The Saudi {{system of}} justice {{has been criticized for}} being slow, arcane, lacking in some of the {{safeguards}} of justice and unable to deal with the modern world. In 2007, King Abdullah issued royal decrees with the aim of reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system. The reforms have yet to be implemented in full but, once they are, <b>will</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> creation of a Supreme Court and the transfer of the Board of Grievances' commercial and criminal jurisdictions to a restructured general court system. New specialist first instance courts will be established comprising general, criminal, personal status, commercial and labor courts. The Sharia courts will therefore lose their general jurisdiction to hear all cases and the work load of the government's administrative tribunals will be transferred to the new courts. Another important change is the establishment of appeal courts for each province. It has been claimed that the reforms will establish a system for codifying Sharia and incorporating the principle of judicial precedent into court practice.|$|E
