40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} market trend {{analysis}} of radishes, which are increasing in cultivation, and is conducted in <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> across Japan. There {{are two major}} objectives of the analysis. One {{is to determine the}} contents of shipments from the districts competing with Hokkaido by conducting analysis at <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets.</b> The other is to clarify the characteristics of distributive markets for Hokkaido-produced radishes by classifying <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> using quantity per year and quantity per day. The vegetables and fruits markets information (NAPASS) and the competitive-producing district analysis system, which was developed by Matsuyama, were used as the analysis method and technique respectively. The results are as follows: Hokkaido competes with Aomori from July to October when Hokkaido-produced radishes enter <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> across Japan. In order to clarify the characteristics of the <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> where Hokkaido-produced radishes are delivered, three types were classified by market share (from July through October). Type I (market share 30 %〜 60 %) shows the <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> where Hokkaido-produced radishes compete with ones from other districts. Type II (60 %〜) shows the <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> where Hokkaido-produced radishes register larger quantity per day than type I. Type III (〜 30 %) shows the <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> where Hokkaido-produced radishes register smaller quantity per day than type I. More than half of type III <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> are largely supplied by local districts, therefore increased shipments of Hokkaido-produced radishes can be expected depending on the situation of the local districts. However, Aomori has high market shares in four markets in the Kyushu area which belong to type III, shipment to the Kyushu area requires coordination with Aomori...|$|R

25|$|The {{electricity}} {{market in}} Colombia has regulated and non-regulated segments. The regulated market, which is directly contracted and supplied by distribution companies, applies to industrial, commercial, and residential users with power demands under 0.5MW. In this market, the tariff structure is {{established by the}} regulatory agency CREG. In the non-regulated market, consumers with power demands of 0.5 MW and above can negotiate freely and contract their supply in the <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> (i.e., spot and contracts markets) directly or through commercial entities, distributors, or producers.|$|E
25|$|In {{different}} deregulation processes {{the institutions}} and market designs were often very different {{but many of the}} underlying concepts were the same. These are: separate the potentially competitive functions of generation and retail from the natural monopoly functions of transmission and distribution; and establish a wholesale electricity market and a retail electricity market. The role of the <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> is to allow trading between generators, retailers and other financial intermediaries both for short-term delivery of electricity (see spot price) and for future delivery periods (see forward price).|$|E
25|$|The reforms {{implemented}} in the 1990s led to high investment, which allowed for a 75% increase in generation capacity, resulting in the decrease of prices in the <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> from US$40/MW·h in 1992 to US$23/MW·h in 2001. However, the reforms failed to deliver the necessary increase in transmission capacity. Only one relevant project, {{the addition of the}} 1,300km high voltage line between Comahue and Buenos Aires, was built in the 1990s. Distribution networks were also renovated and expanded, which resulted in efficiency and quality improvements.|$|E
50|$|Rural {{assembly}} {{markets are}} located in production areas and primarily serve as places where farmers can meet with traders to sell their products. These may be occasional (perhaps weekly) markets, such as haat bazaars in India and Nepal, or permanent. Terminal <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> {{are located in}} major metropolitan areas, where produce is finally channelled to consumers through trade between wholesalers and retailers, caterers, etc. The characteristics of <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> have changed considerably as retailing changes in response to urban growth, the increasing role of supermarkets and increased consumer spending capacity. These changes may require responses {{in the way in}} which traditional <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> are organized and managed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> {{can either}} be primary, or terminal, markets, {{situated}} in or close to major conurbations, or secondary markets. The latter are generally found only in larger developing countries where they are located in district or regional cities, taking {{the bulk of their}} produce from rural assembly markets that are located in production areas The distinction between rural assembly <b>markets</b> and secondary <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> is that secondary <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> are in permanent operation (rather than being seasonal in nature or dealing in specialized produce), larger volumes of produce are traded than at the rural assembly markets and specialized functions may be present, such as commission agents and brokers. [...] Terminal <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> are located in major metropolitan areas, where produce is finally channelled to consumers through trade between wholesalers and retailers, caterers, etc. Produce may also be assembled for export. In some countries, such as India and China, terminal markets also supply other parts of the country. For example, New Delhi serves as a distribution centre to the south of India for apples grown in the Himalayan foothills. The problems of terminal <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> are usually ones of congestion caused by an unsuitable location or by an inappropriate mixture of wholesale and retail functions. Traditionally, <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> were built adjacent to city centres, located at a focal point of the inter-city transport facilities and close to the main retailing areas. Population growth, changes in urban land-use patterns and the development of modern transport systems have all influenced the suitability and functionality of existing sites.|$|R

By the mid twentieth century, it was the main <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> for the city. However, this market became too small to handle the wholesale volume for the growing city.

The market began running on a deficit in 1954, and by 1959 was only 70 percent occupied, forcing Reading to raise rents. The state-of-the-art cold storage facility was shut down and dismantled, forcing tenants to supply their own storage. Several other events hurt the market and its merchants financially. The Dock Street <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> was closed and demolished {{as part of the}} urban renewal program in Society Hill.
