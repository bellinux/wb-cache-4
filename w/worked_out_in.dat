Ideas from this project later {{became a part of}} his Theory of the Consumption Function. Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during autumn 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work on professional income. This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes from Independent Professional Practice, which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income, a major component of the Permanent Income Hypothesis that Friedman <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> greater detail in the 1950s. The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, while US battleships were {{standardized}} {{as much as}} possible, design improvements {{were incorporated}} whenever possible. Most {{of the changes in}} the Tennessees were incorporated prior to any of their keels being laid. However, plans for the underwater protection—the ships' main defense against torpedoes and shells that fell short of the ship but traveled through the water to hit underneath the waterline—could not be <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> time. The problem was that tests in caissons—experiments that would eventually prove that a series of compartments divided between being filled with liquid and being left empty would be a very effective defense against torpedoes—were not yet complete. In order to commence construction of the ships as soon as possible, bids sent out to shipbuilding corporations noted that if they were selected to build the ships, an alteration to the design of the ships three months after their keels were laid must be allowed.|$|E
5|$|The Sprain Brook {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the early 1920s as a parkway between the Bronx River Parkway and the Hawthorne Circle. The parkway sold a majority of its right-of-way in the 1920s, but the proposed parkway met strong opposition {{from the village of}} Bronxville and Yonkers. The Sprain Brook proposal sat on the table until 1949, when the State Council of Parks, run by Robert Moses, sought to ease congestion on the Bronx River Parkway. Moses proposed that a new state park would be constructed in Westchester, with the Sprain Brook Parkway serving as a traffic alternative to the Bronx River, and nearly {{a decade and a half}} after the parkway was deeded land. This time, Bronxville opposed the project rather than Yonkers, but an agreement was <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> 1951. This new alignment would bypass the parts of Bronxville and Yonkers to construct the freeway.|$|E

The technique to obtain data that is by spreading the sample questionnaire respondents from each age category, the group of children under 15 years, adolescents with age between 15 - 25 years, adults between the ages of 26 - 50 years, and older people over the age of 50 years a total of 200 people. The results showed that the public interest in the use of public open space as a place to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Salatiga was 76. 14 % for the children category, amounting to 74. 42 % for the teen category, amounting to 82. 08 % for the adult category, and amounted to 76. 86 % for the parent category. It can be concluded that the public interest in the use of public open space as a place to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Salatiga in 2013 in high categorized or interested.

At the same time they announced their desire to formally unite the two churches. Following the rise of Cromwell and the secret Engagement of some Scots with Charles this hope was abandoned, and the documents were never formally adopted.

5|$|In summer 1335, {{the delegates}} of John of Bohemia {{and the new}} King of Poland, Casimir III, entered into {{negotiations}} in Trencsén {{to put an end}} to the conflicts between the two countries. With Charles's mediation, a compromise was reached on 24August: John of Bohemia renounced his claim to Poland and Casimir of Poland acknowledged John of Bohemia's suzerainty in Silesia. On 3September, Charles signed an alliance with John of Bohemia in Visegrád, which was primarily formed against the Dukes of Austria. Upon Charles's invitation, John of Bohemia and Casimir of Poland met in Visegrád in November. During the Congress of Visegrád, the two rulers confirmed the compromise that their delegates had <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Trencsén. CasimirIII also promised to pay 400,000 groschen to John of Bohemia, but a part of this indemnification (120,000 groschen) was finally paid off by Charles instead of his brother-in-law. The three rulers agreed upon a mutual defence union against the Habsburgs, and a new commercial route was set up to enable merchants travelling between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire to bypass Vienna.|$|E
5|$|President George Washington {{appointed}} Hamilton as {{the first}} United States Secretary of the Treasury on September 11, 1789. He left office {{on the last day}} of January 1795. Much of the structure of the government of the United States was <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> those five years, beginning with the structure and function of the cabinet itself. Biographer Forrest McDonald argues that Hamilton saw his office, like that of the British First Lord of the Treasury, as the equivalent of a Prime Minister. Hamilton oversaw his colleagues under the elective reign of George Washington. Washington requested Hamilton's advice and assistance on matters outside the purview of the Treasury Department. In 1791, while Secretary, Hamilton was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Hamilton submitted various financial reports to Congress. Among these are the First Report on the Public Credit, Operations of the Act Laying Duties on Imports, Report on a National Bank, On the Establishment of a Mint, Report on Manufactures, and the Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit. So, the great enterprise in Hamilton's project of an administrative republic is the establishment of stability.|$|E

Topos theory is a form of abstract sheaf theory, with geometric origins, and leads to ideas such as pointless topology.|$|E

25|$|Easter and the {{holidays}} {{that are related}} to it are moveable feasts which do not fall on a fixed date in the Gregorian or Julian calendars which follow only the cycle of the sun; rather, its date is determined on a lunisolar calendar similar to the Hebrew calendar.

No details for the computation were specified; these were <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> practice, a process that took centuries and generated a number of controversies.

25|$|It {{was only}} {{the first of the}} three {{sections}} of the science of ethics — the doctrine of moral ends — that Schleiermacher handled with approximate completeness; the other two sections were treated very summarily. In his Christian Ethics he dealt with the subject from the basis of the Christian consciousness instead of from that of reason generally; the ethical phenomena dealt with are the same in both systems, and they throw light on each other, while the Christian system treats more at length and less aphoristically the principal ethical realities — church, state, family, art, science and society. Rothe, amongst other moral philosophers, bases his system substantially, with important departures, on Schleiermacher's. In Beneke's moral system his fundamental idea was <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> its psychological relations.|$|E
25|$|The Caribbean {{islands and}} early Spanish explorations around the circum-Caribbean region {{had not been}} of major political, strategic, or {{financial}} importance until the conquest of the Aztec Empire in 1521.

The indigenous societies of Mesoamerica brought under Spanish control were of unprecedented complexity and wealth from what they had encountered in the Caribbean. This presented both an important opportunity and a potential threat {{to the power of}} the Crown of Castile, since the conquerors were acting independent of effective crown control. The societies could provide the conquistadors, especially Hernán Cortés, a base from which the conquerors could become autonomous, or even independent, of the Crown.|$|E
