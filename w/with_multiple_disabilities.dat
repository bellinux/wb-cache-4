40|$|Title: Pain in non-verbal {{children}} <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities.</b> A {{qualitative study}} of parents perceptions about pain in their non-verbal child <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities,</b> {{and how it}} affects {{activities of daily living}} in the family. Purpose: The purpose of this master thesis is to describe parents‟ experiences with pain in children <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities,</b> and how they perceive that pain affects naturally occurring activities of daily living in the family. This knowledge can help more effective healthcare provision for pain that better meets the needs of the family. Research questions: This project explored the following two research questions: How do parents perceive and communicate about pain and discomfort in a non-verbal child <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities?</b> How does pain and discomfort in a non-verbal child <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities</b> affect activities of daily living in the family? Theoretical Framework: This project views a child <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities</b> within the context of his or her family, and in mutual relation to other systems as presented in Bronfenbrenner‟s Ecological Developmental Model (1979). The first research question is based on perspectives on interaction and symbolic interactionism. The second research question includes perspectives on interaction, coping and caregiving. Method: This project is a qualitative study involving parents of school-aged children <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities</b> experiencing pain or discomfort. Data collection occurred through semi-structured life world interview technique. The data were analyzed by a phenomenological approach, utilizing a thematic analysis inspired by Giorgi (1975) as described by (Malterud, 2008). Findings: Pain in a child <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities</b> appears to {{have a negative effect on}} naturally occurring activities of daily living in the family. Parents have expert practical knowledge regarding their child and identifying and handling pain behaviors and appearances within the context of naturally occurring activities of daily living in the family.

40|$|Background This study {{considered}} the general {{validity of the}} basic domains of quality of life that appear in theoretical models, in relation to people <b>with</b> profound <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities.</b> The authors examined how parents and direct support staff operationalized these basic domains for people <b>with</b> profound <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities.</b> They investigated {{the effect of the}} support setting and age of people <b>with</b> profound <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities</b> on this operationalization. Methods A number (n = 76) of parents and direct support staff of people <b>with</b> profound <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities</b> were interviewed. Transcripts were analysed in depth. Results Results showed that the five basic domains as described within the model of Felce & Perry [Research in Developmental Disabilities (1995) vol. 16, pp. 51 - 74; Quality of Life in Health Promotion and Rehabilitation Conceptual Approaches, Issues and Applications (1996 a) Sage Publications; Quality of Life. Vol. I: Conceptualization and Measurement (1996 b) American Association on Mental Retardation] were identified spontaneously by {{more than half of the}} respondents as being salient for the quality of life of people <b>with</b> profound <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities.</b> When asked explicitly, this value rose to between 88. 2 and 100 %. The operationalization of these basic domains by parents and direct support staff differed in several aspects from operationalizations for other target groups. Neither age nor support setting turned out to have a significant effect on the operationalization. Conclusions The results supported the multidimensionality of quality of life and the validity of the basic domains for people <b>with</b> profound <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities.</b> The content of the domains of quality of life differed, however, to a considerable extent for people <b>with</b> profound <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Furthermore, these people are extremely dependent on others for the gratification of their needs and therefore for their quality of life...|$|R

40|$|As the {{inclusive}} education {{for students with}} disabilities has been expanded recently, the number of special class and {{the number of students who}} are given {{inclusive education}} in regular schools have increased. In spite of the current tendency in South Korea, the children <b>with</b> severe and <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities</b> have been frequently isolated or neglected from education and the inclusive education has focused on the physical inclusion; the educational supports are not sufficient. In this context, this study aims to find the tasks for educational supports in order to successfully realize inclusive education by understanding the actual situation of children <b>with</b> severe and <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities</b> and clearly identifying the problems of inclusive education for children <b>with</b> severe and <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities.</b> The literature review focusing on the analyses for the precedent studies on related areas is employed for this study. The inclusive education for children <b>with</b> severe and <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities</b> has difficulties caused by problem behaviors of children <b>with</b> severe and <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities,</b> the lack of systematic education and administrative support and the insufficient expertise and knowledge of teachers for disabilities. To solve these difficulties, several tasks need to be accomplished; the school curriculum and reinforcement of individualized education customized for children <b>with</b> severe and <b>multiple</b> <b>disabilities,</b> the reinforcement of expertise of teachers in charge of inclusive classes and special classes, and the collaboration with other professionals including psychiatrists, physical therapists and nurses...|$|R
