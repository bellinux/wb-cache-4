About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Of the remaining 150 unclaimed bodies, 121 <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> non-denominational Fairview Lawn Cemetery; 19 were buried in the Roman Catholic Mount Olivet Cemetery, and 10 <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jewish Baron de Hirsch Cemetery.

Between 21 September 1943 and 3February 1944 the camp was gradually liquidated.

5|$|Amorium was {{strongly}} fortified and garrisoned, but a traitor revealed a weak {{spot in the}} wall, where the Abbasids concentrated their attack, effecting a breach. Unable {{to break through the}} besieging army, Boiditzes, the commander of the breached section privately attempted to negotiate with the Caliph without notifying his superiors. He concluded a local truce and left his post, which allowed the Arabs to take advantage, enter the city and capture it. Amorium was systematically destroyed, never to recover its former prosperity. Many of its inhabitants were slaughtered, and the remainder driven off as slaves. Most of the survivors were released after a truce in 841, but prominent officials <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> caliph's capital of Samarra and executed years later after refusing to convert to Islam, becoming known as the 42 Martyrs of Amorium.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} 198284 Suresh Srivastava, a GSI {{geologist}} at the Palaeontology Division of the GSI's Western Region, collected {{large numbers of}} bone fossil fragments from Rahioli, and also precisely mapped the area. These fossils <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Palaeontology Division at Jaipur for identification. U. B. Mathur and Suresh Srivastava, {{under the supervision of}} S. C. Pant, meticulously cleaned many of the skeletal parts (braincase, dorsal and caudal vertebrae, sacrum, thigh bone, upper arm, shin bones, and others), leading to the publication of multiple research papers. There was a lull in further activity until a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with Punjab University in 199495.|$|E
5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood shavings until one of the excavators found two stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. They <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he}} was able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of cursive script and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E

5|$|In January 1942, the Germans {{estimated}} at the Wannsee Conference that Albania was inhabited by 200 Jews. That same month, Jews were interned by the Italians at a camp in Pristina. Though they feared {{they would be}} {{handed over to the}} Germans, the Italian commander of the camp promised them that this would never happen. On 14 March 1942, the Italians blockaded the camp and arrested the Jews that had been detained there. Some were handed over to the Germans and transported to the Sajmište concentration camp, near Belgrade, where they were killed. Others, together with Serbs, <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp in Berat, where they were detained until Italy's capitulation. It is estimated that as many as 500 Jews were interned in the camps in Berat, Krujë and Kavajë during the Italian occupation.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1941, the battalion, less 'D' Company which {{travelled}} {{west for}} home leave, entrained at Oakbank, near to Woodside, South Australia {{where they had}} moved the previous February.

Sailing via Fremantle where 'D' Company rejoined the battalion, they sailed on to Colombo, which was reached in late April, where the troopship put in for repairs and shore leave was given to all battalion personnel. Departing again in early May, they continued on alone, crossing the Red Sea in a week and making landfall at Port Tewfik. The troops had to endure a two-day wait before disembarkation whereupon they <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastern side of the Suez Canal by lighter and then transferred by train to Kantara.|$|E
