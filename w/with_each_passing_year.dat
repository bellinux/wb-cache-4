25|$|Despite never {{recovering}} {{the ground}} it lost from its CBS days, even sliding into the lowest {{third in the}} ratings by 1977, ratings for The Edge of Night improved slightly during the early 1980s, thanks {{in no small part}} to the overall rise of ABC's soap opera lineup and to the fresh new characters such as Steve, Draper, Logan, Deborah, April, Raven, and Damian. While the numbers were less solid, The Edge of Night still pulled in ratings in the 5.0 range and improved its position on the ratings list, peaking at 11th in both 1981 and 1982. However, from 1982 on, ratings fell as even more ABC affiliates dropped the show in favor of the aforementioned syndicated offerings: At the end of the 1981-82 television season, The Edge of Night pulled in a 5.0 rating, but with the resulting pre-emptions, the show's rating dropped to a 3.8 in 1983.

These particular finances have been well spent, in agreement with the Board of Management and the Parents Council with the recent extension of the school, that is the new roof, the new rooms, extra class room and activities room, plus the provision of an enclosed basketball court and the updating of all the surrounds of the school. Within the school, there has been the provision of more modern furniture, fittings for the school, audio-visual equipment, computers and photocopiers and other such appliances, which are now the norm in a progressive school. Finances have also been provided for school tours and recreational activities for all the pupils. Also, as originally promised by the parents when they started off, money was put forward towards the development of the Lahardane Community Centre and approximately €11,000 was given towards the building this year.

In addition, computers with hardware acceleration were not common at the time the decision was made.

2500|$|Trolling is {{a fishing}} method of casting the lure or bait {{to the side}} of, or behind, a moving boat, and letting {{the motion of the}} boat pull the bait through the water. In theory, for light and medium {{freshwater}} gamefishing, any casting or spinning rod (with the possible exception of ultralight rods) can be used for trolling. In the last 30 years, most manufacturers have developed a complete line of generally long, heavily built rods sold as [...] "Trolling Rods", and aimed generally at ocean anglers and Great Lakes salmon and steelhead fishermen. A rod effective for trolling should have relatively fast action, as a very [...] "whippy" [...] slow action rod is extremely frustrating to troll with, and a fast action (fairly stiff) rod is generally much easier to work with when fishing by this method. Perhaps the extreme in this philosophy was reached during the 1940s and early 1950s, when the now-defunct True Temper corporation – a maker of garden tools – marketed a line of trolling rods of 4.5 to 5ft length made of tempered steel which were square in cross section. They acted as excellent trolling rods, though the action was much too stiff for sportsmanlike playing of fish once hooked. As Great Lakes sportfishing in particular becomes more popular <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>passing</b> <b>year,</b> all rod manufacturers continue to expand their lines of dedicated [...] "trolling" [...] rods, though as noted, for most inland lake and stream fishing, a good casting or spinning rod is perfectly adequate for trolling.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s a few paleoclimatologists were {{concerned}} {{with the possibility of}} global cooling, and suggested that the next glacial period could be rapidly approaching. The previous interglacial periods seemed to have lasted about 10,000 years each; a report in 1972 assuming that the present interglacial period would be equally long concluded, [...] "it is likely that the present-day warm epoch will terminate relatively soon if man does not intervene". Since then, our understanding of the climate system has improved. It is known that not all interglacial periods are of the same length and that solar heating varies in a non-linear fashion forced by the Milankovitch orbital cycles (see Causes section above). At the same time, it is also known that greenhouse gases are increasing in concentration <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>passing</b> <b>year.</b> Based on the variations in solar heating and on the amount of [...] in the atmosphere, some calculations of future temperatures have been made. According to these estimates, the interglacial period Earth is in now may persist for another 50,000 years if [...] levels increase to 750 parts per million (ppm) while the recent atmospheric concentration of [...] is about 407 ppm by volume. If [...] drops instead to 210 ppm, then the next glacial period may only be 15,000 years away. Moreover, studies of seafloor sediments and ice cores from glaciers around the world, namely Greenland, indicate that climatic change is not smooth. Studies of isotopic composition of the ice cores indicate the change from warm to frigid temperatures can occur in a decade or two. In addition, the ice cores show that an ice age is not uniformly cold, nor are interglacial periods uniformly warm (see also stadial). Analysis of ice cores of the entire thickness of the Greenland glacier shows that climate over the last 250,000 years has changed frequently and abruptly. The present interglacial period (the last 10,000 to 15,000 years) has been fairly stable and warm, but the previous one was interrupted by numerous frigid spells lasting hundreds of years. If the previous period was more typical than the present one, the period of stable climate in which humans flourished—inventing agriculture and thus civilization—may have been possible only because of a highly unusual period of stable temperature.|$|E
