500|$|A triple album, The Concert for Bangladesh, was {{released}} by Apple Corps that year, followed by a concert film in 1972. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: [...] "Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation... The money we raised was secondary, and although <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> money problems... they still got plenty... {{even though it was}} a drop in the ocean. The main thing was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended." [...] The event has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid.|$|E
500|$|The 1947 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team went 10–0 and outscored their opponents 394 to 53. Dworsky led a defensive unit that gave up {{an average of}} 5.3points per game and shut out Michigan State (550), Pitt (600), Indiana (350), Ohio State (210), and USC (490). He also played fullback and center for the 1947 team and was named a third team All-American by the American Football Coaches Association. In a 1988 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Dworsky described the 1947 team's defensive scheme as follows: [...] "We were an intelligent team and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> complex defenses, the nature of which you see today.

500|$|On the Aurora, Mertz met Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Fusiliers. Like Mertz, Ninnis {{was responsible for the}} expedition's dogs; Auroras captain, John King Davis, regarded the pair as [...] "idlers". [...] "I wish <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> one on board who could look after ," [...] he wrote in his diary, [...] "it is a great shame that they should suffer from neglect." [...] On 2 December 1911, after final preparations and loading were completed in Hobart, the Aurora sailed south; she stopped briefly at Macquarie Island, where a wireless relay base was established, and reached the site of the expedition's main base at Cape Denison in Adélie Land, on the Antarctic continent, in early January.|$|E
500|$|The {{process of}} putting {{together}} All the Way... A Decade of Song was laborious for all involved, from balancing {{the number of}} hits and new songs to ensuring {{that each of the}} latest tracks showed a new side of Dion. [...] "We had hourly conversations, back and forth, about what the combination should be," [...] said John Doelp, the album's co-executive producer. [...] "We wanted to make sure <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> new sounds and {{that we were able to}} go to new places." [...] Co-executive producer Vito Luprano added: [...] "The first idea was to record three new songs, then Dion said, 'Let's go for five,' her lucky number. But we had so many great songs coming in that we ended up recording nine. Out of that, we decided to go with seven." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ice" [...] {{was also}} {{considered}} one of the best episodes of the first season by the production crew. According to Carter, Morgan and Wong [...] "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director David Nutter, who really works so hard for us. I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, and we had a great supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring the hell out of the audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that [...] "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> great actors to work with".|$|E

500|$|Following {{the first}} leg, Shankly was adamant that Liverpool would still progress: [...] "This tie {{is by no}} means over yet. We will win easily. We will smash in at least seven goals. This was ridiculous. Ajax played {{defensive}} football on their own ground. We never play well against defensive teams." [...] Such was the shock at the result that Shankly's claim was taken seriously. The defeat convinced Shankly that adopting Ajax's patient, passing style was the key to success in Europe. The defeat is still Liverpool's record defeat in European competition. Michels was worried that Liverpool might adopt aggressive tactics in the second leg: [...] "Our fear is that Liverpool may try to eliminate us through rough play. They showed some of this rough play in the first leg and they will play even harder in front of their own supporters". He also admitted that his side had some luck in the first leg but was adamant they would progress: [...] "There are not many great players in this Liverpool side, but they are all fighters. I agree <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> luck in Amsterdam, but I am sure we will go through." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the third}} {{international}} break, Benfica returned on 18 November with a match {{on the road}} against Braga. Quim had a particularly unfortunate game, making costly mistakes in two goals, and Benfica lost the match 3–1. Santos acknowledged his team's disappointing performance, saying, [...] "We never controlled the game, despite having opportunities to even up. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> reasonable moments but far away from our best." [...] On the following Tuesday, Benfica played Copenhagen in Estádio da Luz for the fifth match-day of the group stage. Benfica scored three goals in the first half, two of them spaced by two minutes and winning the match 3–1. After news of Celtic's win against United, Benfica would only progress to the last 16 if they won at Old Trafford, which Santos believed to be possible. On the 25th, Benfica hosted Marítimo. Benfica scored first with an own-goal from Alex von Schwedler, but Marítimo levelled the score before half time through Marcinho. In the second half, Katsouranis scored the second Benfica goal, establishing the final result at 2–1 to Benfica. Santos criticized his players for [...] "excessive individualism".|$|E
500|$|Malick and Toll {{shot for}} 100 days in Australia using Panavision cameras and lenses, 24 {{days in the}} Solomon Islands and three days in the United States. They scouted the {{historic}} battlefields on Guadalcanal and shot footage, but health concerns over malaria limited filming to daylight hours only. Logistics were also difficult to shoot the entire film there: As director of photography John Toll put it, [...] "It's still a bit difficult to get {{on and off the}} island, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> scenes that involved 200 or 300 extras. We would have had to bring everybody to Guadalcanal, and financially it just didn't make sense". The Thin Red Line was filmed predominantly in the Daintree Rainforest and on Bramston Beach, both in north Queensland, Australia. Filming also took place on Dancer Mountain, which had such rough terrain that trailers and production trucks could not make it up the hill. A base camp was set up and roads carved out of the mountain. Transporting 250 actors and 200 crew members up the hill took two hours. Filming took place in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California near Santa Catalina Island.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Vig and Manson met at {{the funeral}} of Pablo Castelaz, the six-year-old son of Dangerbird Records founder Jeff Castelaz, and had a {{conversation}} where, according to Vig, [...] "we felt like <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> unfinished business, and we realized how precious life is and how important music has been in our lives." [...] Manson suggested calling guitarists Duke Erikson and Steve Marker {{to get together and}} write some songs. One week later, the group informally convened in Los Angeles, where they laughed, drank, and reminisced of the old days, leaving behind the tensions among them and general weariness that was partly responsible for their 2005 breakup; they set up their equipment and [...] "started fucking around." [...] "We were all pleased to notice on the first day there just didn't seem to be any personal tensions," [...] Vig recalled. [...] "Enough time had passed that any sort of weirdness or tension that had risen between us all had dissipated. So it was easy. There was no one telling us what to do. We weren't signed to a label. We were between managers. So we made this on our own terms." [...] In that session, the group wrote the song [...] "Battle In Me".|$|E
500|$|About the {{re-recording}} {{of the old}} songs, Westfall said [...] "We've made a lot {{of changes}} to these songs that we play live [...] and now we're getting a chance to record it, so the people that don't get to see us live can hear it and appreciate it for what it is." [...] On the new tracks, producer Andrew Wade said [...] "I think this new stuff that we're recording is really gonna blow a lot of kids away. [...] just sound amazing, they all sound like completely different songs, and the new song is serious." [...] About the new song, [...] "Why Walk on Water When We've Got Boats", the band wanted to do a fast-paced song. McKinnon admitted the band [...] "kinda just winged it. But <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> little ideas from being on tour and messing around." [...] Woodard said about inspiration for the tempo of the song: [...] "We've all been listening to a lot of faster stuff like Comeback Kid and stuff like that and I don't know and just sitting here one day 'let's write a fast song'." [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] had appeared on the band's Myspace account, on September 21, 2007, as free for download. [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] had overdubs added to it especially for the release on the For Those Who Have Heart reissue.|$|E

According to Rhys the only plan the group stuck to {{was to make a}} [...] "more coherent" [...] record: [...] "In the past ... we'd put ideas kind of side by side, and on this record we wanted all those sounds to be more blended". Following arguments over the track listing of previous album Rings Around the World, after a [...] "lot of songs" [...] were recorded necessitating four months worth of discussions about which tracks to leave off the record, the group recorded just 16 largely acoustic based songs during the sessions for Phantom Power. Rhys's initial batch of songs were augmented by, among others, the Huw Bunford penned [...] "Sex, War & Robots", the first time the guitarist had had one of his songs included on a Super Furry Animals album and also {{the first time he had}} sung lead vocals for the group, [...] "Slow Life", which grew out of an electronic piece of music keyboardist Cian Ciaran had been working on for several years and [...] "The Piccolo Snare" [...] which was partly written in the studio.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the 2004–05 season, in July 2004, Nutter {{signed for}} Conference South side Grays Athletic, managed by Mark Stimson. He made his Grays debut {{on the opening}} day of the season, playing the first 57 minutes in a 1–1 away draw against Hayes on 14 August 2004. Three days later, he scored his only goal of the season as Grays beat Redbridge comfortably at the New Recreation Ground. In Nutter's first season with Grays, the club secured the Conference South title in {{comprehensive}} fashion, winning the division by 23 points. During the same season, Grays also won the FA Trophy, beating Hucknall Town on penalties in the final at Villa Park, with Nutter playing the whole match. As a result of Grays' promotion, the 2005–06 season gave Nutter another opportunity to play in the Conference National. He was almost ever-present during yet another successful season for the Essex club, with Grays finishing third in the league. His only goal of the season came in the Conference play-off semi-final second leg, as Grays eventually lost to Halifax Town 5–4 on aggregate. Shortly after the play-off defeat, Nutter was part of the side that secured back-to-back FA Trophy titles courtesy of a 2–0 win against Woking at Upton Park. It was to be Nutter's last game for the club. On securing successive FA Trophy victories with Grays, Nutter stated — [...] "The FA Trophy wins for Grays Athletic were great, a fantastic achievement for the club, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> terrific players at the time".|$|E
500|$|... "Ride Me to Hell" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Rowe and {{directed}} by Aaron Augenblick and series creator Devin Clark. Screenwriter and executive producer Daniel Powell said that the episode explores [...] "a little bit more" [...] about Mark's background, particularly that his father left {{him when he was}} younger, and that it [...] "sort of informs why he became a social worker". Unlike the series' first season, which paid homage mainly to horror films, season two referenced a variety of genres. In an interview with Matt Barone of the magazine Complex, Clark used [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] as an example that the season [...] "taps into a little bit beyond the horror culture". He referred it to as [...] "one of our big episodes" [...] and stated that it references contemporary shows with [...] "unsatisfied endings", such as Monk and Lost. In the episode, Grimes unleashes memories of being a cop in the 1970s, which Clark saw as an opportunity to make fun of 1970s cop shows, such as CHiPs and Starsky and Hutch. He said, [...] "It's always a fun opportunity to see what other worlds I can pull from, even beyond horror. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> really fun opportunities this season to pull from old '70s cop shows. ... So, it's fun for me just to step out and try lots of different styles and looks. I'm excited for whatever the writers throw at me, thematically. It's just a new opportunity to try something different." [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] was the fifth episode to be produced for the second season. In addition to the regular cast, the episode features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes, Julie Klausner and Mike O'Gorman.|$|E

[...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of American Dad!, The Simpsons and Bob's Burgers that preceded the show, and the episode of The Cleveland Show that followed it, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I don't {{have much to say}} about tonight's Family Guy. Last week, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> comments about how Family Guy seems to be willing to play with its format this season. That didn't happen this week at all." [...] Kaiser went on to criticize the flashback involving Lois and Joyce in high school, stating, [...] "Having a previously unknown flashback as the big reveal feels like cheating, if you're inclined to view Family Guy as consistent." [...] He concluded his review by praising [...] "the burning bush" [...] joke, and ultimately gave the episode a C- rating, the worst rating of the night. It was beaten by the American Dad! episode [...] "Fart-Break Hotel", The Cleveland Show episode [...] "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Roberta?", The Simpsons episode [...] "Flaming Moe", and the Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Crawl Space". In a slightly more positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode for some of its [...] "silly side jokes," [...] but felt disappointed by the ending to the show, commenting, [...] "it didn't follow any real logic [...] It was an easy way out, as if they'd written themselves into a corner." [...] Hughes also criticized the episode for its dependence on cutaway gags, writing, [...] "at least there were some funnier moments in this one. Unfortunately, a lot of those came in the cutaways. And I thought we were starting to move away from a dependence on them." [...] Hughes went on to comment that he felt confused by Stewie possibly being fathered by a porn star, adding that [...] "it would be far more likely that Chris or Meg was fathered by the porn star." ...|$|E
