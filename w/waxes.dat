However, research needs to be done regarding the quality of batik product resulting from a production process using <b>wax</b> which involves the use of batik <b>wax</b> waste. The batik product quality is determined by latched power, and the resistance of the <b>wax</b> against cracking and alkaline chemicals of batik <b>wax</b> product which has been used. The latched power test results from four groups of batik <b>wax</b> product showed the area with minimum latched power on temperature range of 50 - 70 ˚C for batik <b>wax</b> which have been made from blending of bees <b>wax,</b> <b>wax</b> waste, and gum rosin, 50 - 80 ˚C for batik <b>wax</b> which have been made from blending of bees <b>wax,</b> <b>wax</b> waste, and paraffin;  50 - 90 ˚C for batik <b>wax</b> which have been made from blending of bees <b>wax,</b> gum rosin and lard.

5|$|The {{first step}} in the {{manufacture}} of a typical shoe polish is the melting of the wax with the highest melting point in an electric heater. Following this, all other <b>waxes</b> are added, usually by descending order of melting point. While this wax is held at a constant temperature, the emulsion—a mixture of the various oils and, if used, fats, is then heated separately, at around 85°C. The heated emulsion is then added to the <b>waxes,</b> along with distilled water. When the mixture reaches around 80°C, turpentine oil is added. This mixture is then mixed and continually stirred for half an hour. Dyes are added and mixed in turpentine oil if it is not a neutral polish. The mixed mass is reduced slowly to 50°C, and as its viscosity increases, it is poured through a closed funnel into a cooling chamber. The poured mass is allowed to settle slowly, providing uniform distribution. The process is considered straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire. The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around $600,000 (as of 2005).|$|E

30|$|<b>Wax</b> {{deposits}} on {{the wall}} of a crude oil pipeline are a solid <b>wax</b> network of fine crystals, filled with oil, resin, asphaltene and other impurities. In this paper, a series of experiments on <b>wax</b> deposition in a laboratory flow loop were performed under different conditions (flow rate, temperature differential between crude oil and pipeline wall, and dissolved <b>wax</b> concentration gradient), and the <b>wax</b> deposits were analyzed, so quantitative relationships among <b>wax</b> content, <b>wax</b> appearance temperature (WAT), shear stress, and radial concentration gradient of dissolved <b>wax</b> at the solid/liquid interface were obtained. Finally, a model was established to predict WAT and the <b>wax</b> content of the deposit.|$|R
50|$|Stripless <b>wax</b> (as {{opposed to}} strip <b>wax),</b> also {{referred}} to as hard <b>wax,</b> is applied somewhat thickly and with no cloth or paper strips.

Stripless <b>wax</b> does not adhere to the skin as much as strip <b>wax</b> does, thus making it a good option for sensitive skin as finer hairs are more easily removed because the hard <b>wax</b> encapsulates the hair as it hardens. The stripless <b>waxing</b> method can also be less painful.|$|R

40|$|A {{large part}} of worlds {{remaining}} oil and gas resources is found in harsh environments such as deep water and arctic conditions. The development of such oil and gas fields requires advanced process and transport solutions. <b>Wax</b> is precipitated out of solution as reservoir fluid cools down during transport. <b>Wax</b> precipitation may cause operational problems when unprocessed well streams are transported in undersea pipelines. The goal of this work is to investigate modelling concept for controlled <b>wax</b> deposition and controlled <b>wax</b> loosening that is applicable to subsea flowlines in {{oil and gas production}} systems. An approach to <b>wax</b> control using the annulus pipe in pipe flow concept is modelled and also described. <b>Wax</b> thermodynamic and deposition models is reviewed and evaluated. The review is aimed to provide accurate prediction analysis of <b>wax</b> precipitation and to serve as a reliable knowledge input into <b>wax</b> deposition modelling in oil and gas flow systems. The cold flow concept for <b>wax</b> deposition solution is developed using an annulus pipe in pipe configuration for the cooling of oil below the <b>wax</b> appearance temperature. A <b>wax</b> deposition zone is created, an effect of a large temperature gradient, which is the driving force between cooling water and the flowing oil in the annulus cooling section of the pipeline. Co-current and counter current oil cooling cases is tested. The counter current annulus-cooling case is validated to adequately knock out potential <b>wax</b> from the oil in the <b>wax</b> deposition zone. The annulus cooling approach is considered to provide an efficient and economic <b>wax</b> control strategy for the mechanical removal of <b>wax</b> in a <b>wax</b> control zone when pigging of <b>wax</b> is to be employed in a flowline eliminating excessively long pigging routes and high cost of pigging operation in typical subsea pipelines. A wax-loosening model is further developed to determine potential loosening and potential transport tendencies of stable <b>wax</b> solids liberated from the wall flowline downstream the annulus. Experimental results from the Porsgrunn flow loop of Statoil AS reveals that stable <b>wax</b> solid is released from <b>wax</b> deposits on pipeline walls when the inner wall is heated {{for a short period of}} time such that released stable <b>wax</b> is transported in the cool stream with no or low tendency of re-deposition downstream the flowline. Deposited <b>wax</b> in the <b>wax</b> deposition zone is liberated using hot water sent through the annulus. Model results show re-deposition downstream the flowline. Ability of this <b>wax</b> deposition module to predict <b>wax</b> loosening is criticised. OLGA shows good representation of <b>wax</b> deposition growth in the annulus but incapable to represent expected <b>wax</b> liberation in the flowline at temperatures higher than the <b>wax</b> appearance temperature but below the dissolution temperature. A cold flow <b>wax</b> liberation model using active fluid forces with minimum wall heating for effective stripping of <b>wax</b> from the <b>wax</b> deposition zone is proposed. </p...|$|R

5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, <b>waxes,</b> cutinaceous and corky materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} glide <b>waxes</b> are {{tailored}} for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} to lubricate its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. A tipping point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder <b>waxes</b> address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer <b>waxes</b> have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic <b>waxes</b> with 50 or more carbon atoms, microcrystalline <b>waxes</b> with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin <b>waxes</b> with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such <b>waxes</b> include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|E

40|$|Deposition of <b>wax</b> {{on a cold}} {{surface is}} a serious problem in oil production. Progress in {{developing}} more effective <b>wax</b> inhibitors has been impeded by the lack of an established mechanism connecting the molecular structure to inhibitor efficiency. Some comb-like polymers having long alkyl side chains are known to decrease the rate of <b>wax</b> formation. Among several possible mechanisms, we investigate here the incorporation-perturbation mechanism. According to this mechanism, the inhibitor molecules in oil are preferentially partitioned (incorporation) toward the wax-rich (amorphous) <b>wax</b> deposits (soft <b>wax),</b> which then serves as a perturbation to slow down the ordering transition of soft amorphous <b>wax</b> into more stable but problematic hard <b>wax</b> crystals. Indeed, molecular dynamics simulations on an effective inhibitor molecule in both the oil phase and in the amorphous <b>wax</b> phase support the idea that the oil-to-wax partition of the inhibitor is energetically favorable. With the inhibitor molecule embedded, the structure of <b>wax</b> crystal is disturbed, significantly decreasing the order and significantly lowering the cohesive energy density relative to that of the pure <b>wax</b> crystal, supporting the slower transition from soft <b>wax</b> to hard <b>wax.</b> Thus, in the presence of an effective <b>wax</b> inhibitor, crystallization (formation of hard <b>wax)</b> is slowed dramatically, so that there is time to flush out the soft <b>wax</b> with a high-pressure flow inside the pipeline. This suggests design principles for developing improved <b>wax</b> inhibitors. 1...|$|R

25|$|Hard wax: a {{traditionally}} paraffin wax-based substance with admixtures—for snow comprising crystals that are relatively intact and not substantially changed by packing or freeze-thaw. The admixtures, {{which include a}} dye, rubber, rosin, resin and colophony, adjust the hardness of the wax to tailor the effectiveness of its grip for specific, discrete temperature ranges (from approximately -25°F to +35°F); <b>waxes</b> are graded and color-coded according to these temperature ranges. Harder grip <b>waxes</b> are designed for colder snow temperatures, but grip poorly in warm temperatures.
