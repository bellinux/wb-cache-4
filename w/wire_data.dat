50|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>data</b> is {{distinct}} from machine-generated data, which is system self-reported information typically {{in the form of}} logs sourced from elements like network routers, servers, and other equipment. Unlike those forms of machine-generated data, which are dependent on the logging configurations of those devices, <b>wire</b> <b>data</b> is defined by wire and transport protocols. There is a small amount of overlap between <b>wire</b> <b>data</b> and machine-generated data but also significant differences. For example, web server logs typically record HTTP status code 200 responses, indicating that a web page was served to a client. However, web servers do not log the transaction payload and so {{would not be able to}} show which HTTP status code 200 responses were for pages with a “service unavailable” message. That information is contained in the <b>wire</b> <b>data</b> or transaction payload and is not logged by the server.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{methods of}} {{capturing}} and analyzing <b>wire</b> <b>data</b> include offline network packet analyzers.

50|$|The {{instantaneous}} wave-free ratio {{can also}} be calculated on a beat-to-beat basis. If performed during the slow withdrawal of a pressure wire (referred to as 'pullback') under resting conditions, {{it is possible to}} plot the change of iFR or trans-stenotic gradient over the wave-free period throughout the vessel. This can help identify focal and diffuse coronary disease potentially amenable to revascularisation. An example of pullback in clinical use can be seen in this video. The pressure <b>wire</b> <b>data</b> can be co-registered with the angiographic findings to aid ease of interpretation. With mechanised pullback approaches which move the pressure wire at a fixed speed, the physiological length of a stenosis can be determined. With advanced live co-registration this is also feasible with during manual pullback.|$|E

40|$|A two {{component}} Point Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) {{system has}} been developed and tested. Improvements were made to an earlier PDV system, in terms of experimental techniques, {{as well as the}} data acquisition and reduction software. Measurements of the streamwise and spanwise mean and fluctuating velocities for flows from a rectangular channel and over an NACA 0012 airfoil were made, and the data were compared against hot <b>wire</b> <b>data.</b> The closest to the airfoil surface that PDV measurements could be made was on the order of 0. 005 m(0. 2 ", z/c = 0. 0169). When the PDV and hot <b>wire</b> <b>data</b> were compared, the time traces for each appeared similar. The mean velocities agreed to within plus or minus 2 m/sec, while the RMS velocities agreed to plus or minus 0. 4 m/sec. While the PDV time autocorrelations agreed with those of the hot <b>wire</b> <b>data,</b> the PDV power spectral densities were noisier above 750 Hz. A major source of error in these experiments was determined to be the drifting of the iodine cell stem temperatures. While the stem temperatures were controlled to within plus or minus 0. 1 C, this could lead to a frequency shift of as much as 6 MHz, which translates into an error of 1. 6 m/sec for the back scatter channel, and up to 6. 9 m/sec for the forward scatter channel. These error estimates are consistent with the observed error magnitudes...|$|E
40|$|Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has {{recently}} gained considerable attentions from both industry and research communities since {{the development of}} communication technology and smart city. However, a proprietary and closed way of operating hardwares in network equipments slows down the progress of new services deployment and extension in IoV. Moreover, the tightly coupled control and data planes in traditional networks significantly increase the complexity and cost of network management. By proposing a novel architecture, called Software-Defined Internet of Vehicles (SDIV), we adopt the software-defined network (SDN) architecture to address these problems by leveraging its separation of the control plane from the data plane and a uniform way to configure heterogeneous switches. However, the characteristics of IoV introduce the very challenges in rule installation due to the limited size of Flow Tables at OpenFlow-enabled switches which are {{the main component of}} SDN. It is necessary to build compact Flow Tables for the scalability of IoV. Accordingly, we develop a rule optimization approach for real-time query service in SDIV. Specifically, we separate <b>wired</b> <b>data</b> plane from wireless data plane and use multicast address in wireless data plane. Furthermore, we introduce a destination-driven model in <b>wired</b> <b>data</b> plane for reducing the number of rules at switches. Experiments show that our rule optimization strategy reduces the number of rules while keeping the performance of data transmission...|$|R
