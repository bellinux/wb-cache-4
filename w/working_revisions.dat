40|$|When {{reengineering}} software systems, maintainers {{should be}} able to assess and compare multiple change scenarios for a given goal, so as to choose the most pertinent one. Because they implicitly consider one single <b>working</b> copy, <b>revision</b> control systems do not scale up well to perform simultaneous analyses of multiple versions of systems. We designed Orion, an interactive prototyping tool for reengineering, to simulate changes and compare their impact on multiple versions of software source code models. Our approach offers an interactive simulation of changes, reuses existing assessment tools, and has the ability to hold multiple and branching versions simultaneously in memory. Specifically, we devise an infrastructure which optimizes memory usage of multiple versions for large models. This infrastructure uses an extension of the FAMIX source code meta-model but it is not limited to source code analysis tools since it can be applied to models in general. In this paper, we validate our approach by running benchmarks on memory usage and computation time of model queries on large models. Our benchmarks show that the Orion approach scales up well in terms of memory usage, while the current implementation could be optimized to lower its computation time. We also report on two large case studies on which we applied Orion...|$|R

40|$|We {{have had}} several conversations with Knutson during recent months, and we {{certainly}} agree that the one-dimensional mass exchanger model is more appropriate than the zero-dimensional model which has appeared {{in much of the}} past literature and which we also applied. We have been <b>working</b> on <b>revisions</b> of these calculations that incorporate the one-dimensional model, and we report some of our findings in Refs. [2]; [5]. However, we believe that PRO has clear potential for energy recovery, as we explain in detail below. Further, Knutson's analysis of the power generation is flawed and his conclusions regarding energy recovery are not accurate. Knutson's method of analysis makes the assumption of infinite membrane water permeability (equivalent to infinite surface area), taking the value of A in Eq. (1) to be infinity. Because the value of A for the membrane is assumed to be infinite, the local water flux is equal to zero at the inlet, outlet, or both ends of the PRO module. In another words, the driving force for the water flux will vanish at the inlet, outlet, or both ends. This is similar to the assumption of zero pinch {{at the end of a}} heat exchanger, such as might be obtained with infinite surface area. This is an interesting method, and it should give similar trends as given in Ref. [4] if it is applied correctly...|$|R

40|$|Deligne's {{regularity}} {{criterion for}} an integrable connection ∇ on a smooth complex algebraic variety X says that ∇ is regular along the irreducible divisors at infinity in some fixed normal compactification of X if {{and only if}} the restriction of ∇ to every smooth curve on X is regular (i. e. has only regular singularities at infinity). The "only if" part is the difficult implication. Deligne's proof is transcendental, and uses Hironaka's resolution of singularities. We give here an elementary and purely algebraic proof of this implication: it is, as far as we know, the first algebraic proof of Deligne's regularity criterion. Comment: N.

But expectations of arts as curative or benevolent in the context of institutions do not only come from the prison service – organisations and artist facilitators often also perpetuate them.
