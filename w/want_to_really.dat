Although Connelly {{surrounded}} himself with three different musicians, the tendency to sound a bit like his main band was unavoidable, particularly since he has one of those singing voices that is quite unmistakable. However, the differences between his solo project and Nuclear Assault was mostly found in the more rock oriented song structures, timid adventurism (the band sounds like they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> go into left field but never make it past the short stop), and occasional humor. Nuclear Assault would split up in 1993, John released his solo project called John Connelly's Theory.|$|E
