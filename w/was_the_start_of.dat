Until that time, players had been forced to accept whatever NHL management paid in salaries. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the player's agent era in professional hockey. For Eagleson, it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> his sports business empire. Based on the Orr signing, Eagleson would become the executive director of the new National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) and started on his rise to become one of the most powerful men in the sport and business of ice hockey.|$|E

5|$|Fielding first {{produced}} a play in February 1728.

On 16 March 1728, Fielding enrolled at the University of Leyden, {{but he did not}} abandon the theatre. His early plays were those of an amateur hobby, but he later returned to London to earn a living. Arthur Murphy, in his 1762 biographical introduction to Fielding's works, believed that Fielding returned to London and treated the theatre as a career because his father stopped an allowance of 200 pounds a year.|$|E
