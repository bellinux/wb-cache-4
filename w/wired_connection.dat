25|$|In 2010, Microsoft {{released}} Windows Thin PC or WinTPC, {{which is}} a feature- and size-reduced locked-down version of Windows 7 expressly designed to turn older PCs into thin clients. WinTPC is available for software assurance customers and relies on cloud computing in a business network. Wireless operation is supported since WinTPC has full wireless stack integration, but wireless operation {{may not be as}} good as the operation on a <b>wired</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chromecast {{devices are}} dongles that are powered by {{connecting}} the device's micro-USB port to an {{external power supply}} or a USB port. Video-capable Chromecasts plug into the HDMI port of a high-definition television or monitor, while the audio-only model outputs sound through its integrated 3.5 millimeter audio jack/mini-TOSLINK socket. By default, Chromecasts connect to the Internet through a Wi-Fi connection to the user's local network; a standalone USB power supply with an Ethernet port, introduced in July 2015 for US$15, allows for a <b>wired</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kamen {{has stated}} that FIRST is the {{invention}} he feels most proud of, and predicts that participants {{will be responsible for}} significant technological advances in years to come. The first FRC season was in 1992 and had one event at a high school gymnasium in New Hampshire. That first competition was relatively small-scale, similar in size to today's FIRST Tech Challenge and Vex Robotics Competition games. Robots relied on a <b>wired</b> <b>connection</b> to receive data from drivers; in the following year, it quickly transitioned to a wireless system.|$|E

2500|$|Chromecast Ultra {{is similar}} in design to the second-generation model, but {{features}} upgraded hardware that supports the streaming of 4K resolution content, as well as high-dynamic range through the HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats. Google stated that the Chromecast Ultra loads video 1.8 times faster than previous models. Unlike previous models that could be powered through a USB port, the Chromecast Ultra {{requires the use of}} the included power supply for connecting to a wall outlet. The power supply also offers an Ethernet port for a <b>wired</b> <b>connection</b> to accommodate the fast network speeds needed to stream 4K content.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{wireless}} networks, {{setting up}} a computer network in a business, home or school often required running many cables through walls and ceilings in order to deliver network access {{to all of the}} network-enabled devices in the building. With the creation of the wireless access point, network users were able to add devices that access the network with few or no cables. An AP normally connects directly to a wired Ethernet connection and the AP then provides wireless connections using radio frequency links for other devices to utilize that <b>wired</b> <b>connection.</b> Most APs support the connection of multiple wireless devices to one <b>wired</b> <b>connection.</b> Modern APs are built to support a standard for sending and receiving data using these radio frequencies. Those standards, and the frequencies they use are defined by the IEEE.|$|E
