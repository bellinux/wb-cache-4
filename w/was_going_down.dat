25|$|India was on {{the charge}} from the {{beginning}} of their innings when debutante Yusuf Pathan started aggressively by hitting one four and one six. But {{he was the first to}} fall for 15 runs at 25/1 at over 2.4. Then Indian scoring rate <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>down.</b> Robin Uthappa(8 run from 11 ball), Yuvraj Singh(14 run from 19 ball), MS Dhoni(6 run from 10 ball) all departed soon and while Gambhir was stuck to the other end. His 75 from 56 hit 8 four and 2 six and Rohit Sharma's 30 not out of 16 hit 2 four and one six at last stage took India to 157–5 in 20 overs. Umar Gul took 3–28 to be the best performer for Pakistan.Mohammad Asif and Sohail Tanvir take one wicket each.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Dell did not {{emphasize}} the consumer market, {{due to the}} higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed in 1996, when Dell.com reached $1 million in daily sales within 6 months of its launch. While the industry’s average selling price to individuals <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>down,</b> Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.|$|E
25|$|The post lunch {{session was}} one of the most {{dramatic}} sessions in Test history. VVS Laxman played one of his best knocks along with Ishant Sharma for most of the post lunch session. He was happy to give Ishant most of the strike with Ishant stone-walling the rest of the over. Occasional boundaries (mainly from Sharma) and early singles off every over had India slowly, but surely inching towards their target. In what seemed like forever, India crawled from 124/8 to 170, 180 and 190/8. Finally Ishant got out to a Ben Hilfenhaus lbw decision that replays showed <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>down</b> the leg side, with the score at 205. Pragyan Ojha, the last man for India joined Laxman at the crease. During Mitchell Johnson's over more drama followed with Ojha being clearly struck in line, but On-field Umpire Billy Bowden turned down the appeal. Pragyan Ojha tried to sneak a single when substitute fielder Steven Smith shied at the stumps. But unfortunately for Australia, no fielders where backing his throw. It went for four overthrows meaning India just needed 2 runs to win.|$|E

500|$|At home, Lansbury {{served a}} second term as Mayor of Poplar, in 1936–37. He argued against direct {{confrontation}} with Mosley's Blackshirts during the October 1936 demonstrations known as the Battle of Cable Street.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Christian Spurrier, his first writing credit for the series. He joined the Spooks writing staff in January 2008. Producer Katie Swinden wanted to base an episode on the economy, {{which at the time}} was facing a {{recession}} following the financial crisis of the British bank Northern Rock just months before. After trying a few different stories, the producers settled on a story about a bank collapse that is so severe it could result in an economic collapse. Spurrier did research on banking climate in the City of London in March 2008, and realised the economy <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>down,</b> but also wanted to exaggerate the numbers for the episode. Ros was chosen to lead because the character had a background in business. In some of the original drafts of the episode, John Castle would return as Jocelyn Myers, Ros' father, but later on the producers realised they did not need him. The producers also wanted to include some jeopardy in the climax, namely adding a gun to a head or a bomb, which created the scenes where Darlek threatened to kill Ros. Spurrier felt he had a [...] "lot of juggling" [...] in writing three separate storylines; the main plot, the Sugarhorse subplot and Jo; but did a lot of learning how to write a Spooks script as he wrote it.|$|E

[...] That Pillar, says Gogarty, [...] "marks {{the end of a}} civilization, the culmination of the great [...] period of eighteenth century Dublin".

2500|$|The senior Rivers, {{also called}} William, was the master gunner aboard the Victory {{and it is}} thanks to his commonplace book (now kept in the Royal Naval Museum library in Portsmouth) {{that many of the}} {{thoughts}} of the sailors aboard Nelson's flagship are preserved. Midshipman Rivers, who claimed to be [...] "the man who shot the man who fatally wounded Lord Nelson" [...] proved himself to be a model of heroism in the Battle of Trafalgar. In the course of his duties, the seventeen-year-old midshipman's foot was almost completely blown off by a grenade, left attached to him [...] "by a Piece of Skin abought 4inch above the ankle". [...] Rivers asked first for his shoes, then told the gunner's mate to look after the guns and informed Captain Hardy that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>down</b> to the cockpit.
