25|$|Neither {{sophisticated}} nor particularly interesting, English-Canadian historical writing <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was: traditional, political, constitutional, {{at times}} sentimental, and too {{focused on the}} story of self-government, its development over time, and its ultimate achievement.... If it wasn't dry-as-dust constitutional history, it was after-dinner expressions of loyalty to Great Britain, heroic accounts of great men, and patriotic renderings of the Plains of Abraham and General Wolfe or of Queenston Heights and General Brock.|$|E
25|$|My first well-remembered {{intentional}} use of {{the double}} bind occurred in early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf {{out of the barn}} to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they turned back to the barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance {{on the part of the}} calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> apparently wished to do. Accordingly I presented the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn. Reprinted in Collected Papers Volume 3.|$|E
500|$|Millett wrote {{several books}} on women's lives from a feminist perspective. For instance, in the book The Basement: Meditations on a Human Sacrifice (1979), {{completed}} over four years, she chronicled the torture and murder of Indianapolis teenager Sylvia Likens by Gertrude Baniszewski in 1965 that had preoccupied her for 14 years. With a feminist perspective, she explored {{the story of the}} defenseless girl and the dynamics of the individuals involved in her sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Biographer Roberta M. Hooks wrote, [...] "Quite apart from any feminist polemics, The Basement can stand alone as an intensely felt and movingly written study of the problems of cruelty and submission." [...] Millett said of the motivation of the perpetrator: [...] "It {{is the story of the}} suppression of women. Gertrude seems to have wanted to administer some terrible truthful justice to this girl: that this <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was to be a woman".|$|E

500|$|Before the Clash's founding, the band's future {{members were}} active in {{different}} parts of the London music scene. John Graham Mellor sang and played rhythm guitar in the pub rock act the 101'ers, which formed in 1974. By the time the Clash came together two years later, he had already abandoned his original stage name, [...] "Woody" [...] Mellor, in favour of [...] "Joe Strummer", a reference to his rudimentary strumming skills on the ukulele as a busker in the London Underground. Mick Jones played guitar in protopunk band London SS, which rehearsed for much of 1975 without ever playing a live show and recording only a single demo. London SS was managed by Bernard Rhodes, a sometime associate of impresario Malcolm McLaren and a friend of the members of the McLaren-managed band, the Sex Pistols. Jones and his bandmates became friendly with Sex Pistols Glen Matlock and Steve Jones, who would assist them as they tried out potential new members. Among those who auditioned for London SS without making the cut were Paul Simonon, who tried out as a vocalist, and drummer Terry Chimes. Nicky Headon drummed with the band for a week, then quit. After London SS broke up in early 1976, Rhodes continued as Jones's manager. In February, Jones saw the Sex Pistols perform for the first time: [...] "You knew straight away that was it, and this <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was going to be like from now on. It was a new scene, new values—so different from what had happened before. A bit dangerous." [...] At the instigation of Rhodes, Jones contacted Simonon in March, suggesting he learn an instrument so he could join the new band Jones was organising. Soon Jones, Simonon on bass, Keith Levene on guitar and [...] "whoever we could find really to play the drums" [...] were rehearsing. Chimes was asked to audition for the new band and got the job, although he soon quit.|$|E

[...] At the same time, several members of the Flames, along with their counterparts of the Edmonton Oilers, challenged the NHL's right to lock the players out, filing a complaint with the Alberta Labour Relations Board (ALRB). The board, however, rejected the players' application. The ALRB described the petition as an [...] "unhelpful distraction" [...] from the negotiating efforts of the league and its union.|$|E

[...] Regarding the result, Vang said [...] "his film is not a documentary. We can't expect 101 percent correctness." [...] During the filming, Hmong cast members addressed what they believed to be cultural inaccuracies that were being introduced. Cedric Lee, a half-Hmong {{who worked as a}} production assistant and a cultural consultant, said that [...] "Some things were over-exaggerated for dramatic purposes. Whether it was our job or not, I still felt some responsibility to speak our mind and say something, but at the same time, the script <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was. We didn’t make the final decision." [...] Vang said while many Hmong had objected to some elements, the producers selected the viewpoints of the cultural consultants which [...] "had the most amenable take on the matter and would lend credence to whatever Hollywood stereotypes the film wanted to convey." [...] Vang further said that [...] "this was a white production, that our presence as actors did not amount to control of our images." ...|$|E
