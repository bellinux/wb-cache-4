5|$|After {{following}} his father {{into the local}} politics of his home county, Clements agreed to chair the gubernatorial campaign of Thomas Rhea in 1935. Already committed to Rhea, he turned down an offer from Happy Chandler to chair his campaign, beginning the rift between the two men.

In 1944, he was selected as Democratic floor {{leader of the senate}} and successfully campaigned for a larger budget than that proposed by Republican governor Simeon Willis. His stand against Willis made him popular in the Democratic Party, and he went on to serve two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1944 to 1948.|$|E

5|$|Eder {{made his}} first {{appearance}} for Sweden at the under-20 level, competing in the 2006 World Junior Championships in British Columbia.

Two years later, Edler debuted with Sweden's men's team at the 2008 IIHF World Championships in Halifax and Quebec City. He scored his first international goal on the powerplay against French goaltender Fabrice Lhenry in a 9–0 round-robin win. Sweden <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bronze medal game, where they were defeated by Canada 5–4. Edler finished with a goal and two assists in eight games. His 19:02 minutes of average ice time per game ranked third among team defencemen.|$|E

5|$|In the NCAA tournament Final Four UConn met Notre Dame for {{the fourth}} time of the season, with the underdog Fighting Irish {{prevailing}} and ending UConn's bid for a third straight National Championship. The keys to Notre Dame's success were the stellar performance of sophomore Skylar Diggins and the hot shooting (over 50 percent from the field, a first against UConn in its last 262 games), while UConn had a lack of support for Moore's 36 points. Notre Dame <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National Championship Game, but were defeated by the Texas A Aggies.|$|E
5|$|LAX (Hernandez and Homicide) became {{number one}} contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Championship at Destination X. They were given their {{championship}} match on the April 17 episode of Impact!, however at Lockdown {{the team of}} Eric Young and Kaz won a Cuffed in the Cage match earning them a championship match as well. Due to this, it became a Three Way Tag Team match between LAX, the team of Young and Kaz, and TNA World Tag Team Champions Styles and Tomko. Young and Kaz won the bout, however, due to a controversial finish the championship was vacated by Cornette. Cornette then set up the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament heading into TNA's Sacrifice PPV event on May 11, 2008, to crown new champions. LAX <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> event to win the tournament, thus winning the championship.|$|E

He won the free skate, landing a clean quadruple jump, {{but was unable to}} pull up to first overall, due to Daisuke Takahashi's twelve point lead after the short program. He <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2007 Cup of China, where he won the short program with a score of 81.55, improving his personal best by almost thirteen points.

After the Saturday matinée in each city, a panel discussion was held with both the audience and anyone else who wanted to attend, the purpose being to raise awareness about human trafficking in Canada and elsewhere. The final talkback panel in Red Deer was attended by about 70 people.|$|E
5|$|Cramer's {{reinforcements}} {{arrived in}} the Sidi Azeiz area at 03:00 and reached Fort Capuzzo at 06:30. At around 08:00, he made contact with Kampfgruppe von Herff, but by mid-morning both groups {{had run out of}} fuel. The German advance resumed at 16:00 before being stopped by around 17 tanks of 2RTR. The British reported one German tank set alight and another disabled and that an advance of up to fifty tanks had been halted, while the Germans believed that they had repulsed a strong British tank attack. As nightfall approached, Herff broke off the action and <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defensive. He intended to repair his damaged machines, reorganise, and resume offensive operations on 18 May. 2RTR pulled back to Bir el Khireigat, initially followed by two German tanks, one of which withdrew after the other was destroyed. The regiment arrived at Bir el Khireigat, from where it had set out two days previously, at around 02:30 on 17 May.|$|E

Trailing by a score of 5–2 with 10 minutes {{to play in the}} third period of Game 6, the Blues mounted a furious comeback to send the contest into overtime, where Doug Wickenheiser scored to force a deciding seventh game. Calgary would win Game 7 at home, 2–1, advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time. The Flames proved to be no match for the Montreal Canadiens, losing the championship series in five games. Montreal rookie goaltender Patrick Roy was nearly unbeatable in the last two games, allowing only four goals en route to winning the Conn Smythe Trophy.|$|E

5|$|In 1962 Lord Evershed {{resigned}} as Master of the Rolls, and Denning {{was appointed to}} replace him on 19 April 1962 with a salary of £9,000. Although Denning himself described it as 'a step down' he was pleased with his appointment, as he had much preferred his time with the Court of Appeal than the House of Lords. Court of Appeal judges sit in threes, and the Lords in fives (or more), so {{it was suggested that}} to get his way in the Court of Appeal Denning only had to persuade one other judge whereas in the House of Lords it was at least two. The other 'benefit' of the Court of Appeal is that it hears more cases than the House of Lords, and so has a greater effect on the law. During his twenty years as Master of the Rolls, Denning could choose both which cases he heard, and the judges with whom he sat. Therefore, on most issues, he effectively had the last word; comparatively few cases <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords, which was at that time Britain's highest court of law.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to demands for more aircrew to fulfil Australia's commitments to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, flying training underwent {{major changes in}} 1951–52, the syllabus at No.1 FTS being split among three separately located units. No.1 Initial Flying Training School (No.1 IFTS) was raised at RAAF Station Archerfield, Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received their flight grading during twelve hours on Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No.1 IFTS <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> newly formed No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) at Uranquinty, where they underwent a further 90 hours of aerial instruction that included instrument, formation and night flying, first on Tiger Moths and then on Wirraways. Successful students finally transferred to No.1 FTS, which was renamed No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS) in March 1952. There they undertook 100 flying hours of advanced weapons and combat training on Wirraways, before graduating as sergeant pilots. RAAF College, formed at Point Cook in 1947, {{was to be the}} Air Force's primary source of commissioned officers. The Tiger Moths and Wirraways of No.1 BFTS were subsequently replaced by the CAC Winjeel, first delivered in 1955.|$|E
5|$|No.1 ITS's inaugural {{commanding}} officer was Wing Commander Wilfred Lampe. Tiger Moths began arriving at Archerfield on 4January 1952, {{and the first}} course commenced two days later. It graduated on 27March, having flown a total of some 1,000 hours. The unit was renamed No.1 Initial Flying Training School on 28May. As well as RAAF pilots, the school trained students from the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Air Arm, and gave Air Training Corps cadets flying experience. Six of its Tiger Moths went on a recruiting drive around Kingaroy and Bundaberg in August 1952, the same month that its first graduates commenced {{the next phase of}} their training at No.1 BFTS. Those students selected to be navigators rather than pilots <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> School of Air Navigation at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria. No.1 IFTS was responsible for staging aerial pageants as part of Air Force Week in September 1952, and again in September 1953. Ground staff from the school won the Hewitt Trophy for small arms proficiency held at Liverpool, New South Wales, in December 1953. In April 1954, the Tiger Moths practised bombing and strafing troops in an exercise with the Australian Army's 9th Battalion.|$|E
