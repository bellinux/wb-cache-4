5|$|Todd Stone – Gardner's {{son and the}} dealership's Vice President. Stone {{began working}} at G. Stone Motors in 1985 by washing cars {{while he was still}} in school.

He and Gardner often disagree on <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> a good trade, which can lead to minor conflicts between the two and the shop's other employees.|$|E

5|$|Weather, {{seen from}} an anthropological perspective, is {{something}} all humans {{in the world}} constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> it change, the effect it has on humans in different situations, etc. Therefore, weather is something people often communicate about.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah.

There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
5|$|Layers {{deposited}} {{during the}} Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, {{and are the}} product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as till, over the area. The thickness of the glacial till layer ranges between 100 and 900 feet (30 and 270 m). This till is also <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> agriculture more prevalent in eastern South Dakota as it is extremely fertile.|$|E

5|$|The Deep Impact {{mission was}} planned to help answer {{fundamental}} questions about comets, which included <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> up {{the composition of}} the comet's nucleus, what depth the crater would reach from the impact, and where the comet originated in its formation. By observing {{the composition of the}} comet, astronomers hoped to determine how comets form based on the differences between the interior and exterior makeup of the comet. Observations of the impact and its aftermath would allow astronomers to attempt to determine the answers to these questions.|$|E

In the magazine, he notices an ad for a children's contest in which an essay must be written about <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> America great. Lisa chooses to enter, takes a trip to Springfield Forest, and is inspired to write her essay when she sees the forest's natural beauty and when an eagle lands right by the branch she is sitting under. Lisa's article is approved for entry in the national finals in Washington, D.C. after the contest judge observes Homer's poor vocabulary and realizes that he could not have written Lisa's essay for her.|$|E
5|$|Mary Watts died in 1938, and {{was buried}} {{alongside}} George Frederic Watts near the Watts Mortuary Chapel, {{which she had}} herself designed and built in Compton in 1901. Following her death, and with both George and Mary Watts increasingly out of fashion, the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52of the intended 120spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be {{a symbol of the}} Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> it of value in the present day.|$|E

5|$|On Nimbus III, the Enterprise crew {{discovers that}} renegade Vulcan Sybok, Spock's half-brother, {{is behind the}} hostage crisis. Sybok reveals the hostage {{situation}} was a ruse to lure a starship to Nimbus III. Sybok wants to use a ship to reach the mythical planet Sha Ka Ree, the place where creation began; the planet lies behind a seemingly impenetrable barrier {{near the center of}} the galaxy. Sybok uses his unique ability to reveal and heal the innermost pain of a person through the mind meld to subvert the wills of the hostages and crew members. Only Spock and Kirk prove resistant to Sybok; Spock is unmoved by the experience and Kirk refuses the Vulcan's offer, telling him that his pain is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> him human. Sybok reluctantly declares a truce with Kirk, realizing he needs his leadership experience to navigate the Enterprise to Sha Ka Ree.|$|E
5|$|The analog {{technique}} {{is a complex}} way of making a forecast, requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event {{that is expected to}} be mimicked by an upcoming event. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future. Some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition. It remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans, as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future. A similar {{technique is}} used in medium range forecasting, which is known as teleconnections, when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime. An example of teleconnections are by using El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The first section, {{entitled}} Definitions and Distinctions, {{consists of}} five chapters and details how Wellek and Warren define literature. This section also contrasts Wellek and Warren's definition {{with those of}} others, such views of literature as everything in print and as only belles-lettres (accepted literary canon). They define literary scholarship as beyond the personal ("super-personal") and contrasted with the literary arts by its more scientific approach. Wellek and Warren suggest that neither a purely objective nor a purely subjective approach {{would be able to}} properly describe literature. They note that literary scholarship should not only examine <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> a work or author unique, but also its general characteristics that allow it to be compared to other works.|$|E

5|$|<b>What</b> <b>makes</b> Yoshi's Island DS {{different}} is {{the addition of}} five babies for Yoshi to carry, each bestowing a different ability — Baby Mario allows Yoshi to dash and makes special 'M' blocks appear, and can grab Super Stars to become Super Baby Mario, and grants ricocheting eggs; Baby Peach allows Yoshi to float and fly on wind currents and grants a more forgiving timing to use Yoshi's flutter jumping abilities effectively; Baby Donkey Kong can grab and swing on vines and ropes, grants a special dash attack, allows Yoshi's eggs to explode as per Yoshi's Story (but they do so on impact) and allows Yoshi to push objects faster; Baby Wario uses his magnet to attract metal objects and allows Yoshi's eggs to bounce; and Baby Bowser spits fireballs, but the Yoshi carrying him cannot make eggs, though the eggs Yoshi already carries can bounce. The last three babies tend to make the timing for Yoshi's flutter jumping less forgiving and slow down his movement a little bit. The need to switch babies at key points adds a puzzle element to the game.|$|E
