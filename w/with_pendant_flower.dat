Members of the Buckleyi Group, such as the old-fashioned Christmas cactus <b>with</b> <b>pendant</b> <b>flowers,</b> are more tolerant of high light levels than members of the Truncata Group, such {{as most of the}} modern cultivars. Too much light causes stems to take on a reddish colouration; however, very low light levels will prevent flowering. Day length is important in controlling flowering; continuous darkness for at least 12 hours is necessary to induce bud formation. A period of about 8 days with 16 hours of darkness at [...] has been shown to cause flower buds to form. Lower temperatures slow this process. The advice sometimes given to withhold water to produce flower buds {{has been shown to be}} incorrect.|$|R
50|$|Cubanola domingensis are shrubs {{or small}} trees up to 2 m in height <b>with</b> <b>pendant,</b> white <b>flowers.</b> Leaves <b>with</b> {{petioles}} 1-3 mm long, blades ovate or elliptic 6-12 cm long, 3.3-6 cm wide, acuminate or acute at apex, obtuse or acute at base. Calyx lobes 1.1-2.5 cm long, 1-2 mm wide. Corolla 18.5-19.8 long, tube 6.5-7 cm long, lobes 7-8 mm long. Fruit ellipsoid, 3-4.3 cm long, apex obtuse.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers of}} all {{species of the}} genus are born on inflorescences. In most cases the inflorescences are long enough to hang like a pendant, but in the westernmost {{population}}s of P. tomentella and {{in at least one}} population of P. pepei, the inflorescence is so reduced that it remains almost hidden in the leaf axil. In the species <b>with</b> <b>pendant</b> inflorescences, the <b>flowers</b> are born regularly along the rachis or clustered toward the terminal end. The flowers themselves are reduced and have many features associated with wind pollination. These include: the absence of petals, green rather than colored sepals, an absence of scent or nectar, numerous anthers with long filaments, abundant, dry pollen, a large, spreading, fine fringed stigma, compounded pinnate leaves and the growth of trees in strands.|$|R
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} is a raceme {{emerging from}} the leaf axils {{with one or two}} <b>pendant</b> <b>flowers</b> having narrowly bell-shaped, pink to white corollas up to 1 cm (0.4 inch) with a lobed mouth.|$|R
50|$|Flowers: Short, {{terminal}} racemes of <b>pendant,</b> single <b>flowers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Fritillaria is a genus of {{herbaceous}} bulbous perennials. It is characterised by nodding (<b>pendant)</b> <b>flowers,</b> perianths campanulate (bell- or cup-shaped) with erect {{segments in}} upper part, a nectarial pit, groove or pouch {{at the base}} of the tepal, anthers usually pseudobasifixed, rarely versatile, fruit sometimes winged, embryo minute.|$|R
50|$|Yucca tenuistyla is a short, acaulescent (trunkless) species forming {{colonies of}} rosettes. Leaves can {{be up to}} 70 cm (28 inches) long but only 2 cm (0.8 inches) wide. The {{flowering}} stalk can be up to 100 cm (33 inches) tall, bearing many <b>pendant</b> <b>flowers.</b> Fruits are dry, with glossy black seeds.|$|R
50|$|Laburnum {{species and}} hybrids are {{cultivated}} as ornamental trees for gardens and parks. They are also trained as espaliers on pergolas, for ceilings of <b>pendant</b> <b>flowers</b> in season. In its natural form, Laburnum is a shrubby, multi-branched tree, {{but it is}} often pruned to maintain a single trunk which displays the smooth green bark.|$|R
5000|$|Diplolaena grandiflora {{grows to}} between 0.5 and 3 metres high {{and has an}} erect habit. In a period between late autumn and spring, it {{produces}} showy, upright or <b>pendant</b> <b>flowers</b> [...] These have a cluster of red stamens in the centre, surrounded by pinkish-red bracts. The leaves are ovate and are up to 5 cm in length and are dark green {{on the top and}} downy on the undersides.|$|R
50|$|Trochetiopsis erythroxylon, the Saint Helena redwood, is {{a species}} of plant, now extinct in the wild. It was {{formerly}} abundant enough in the upland parts of the island of Saint Helena for early settlers in the 17th century to use the timber to make their homes. It now exists in cultivation, although cultivated stock is weak. This species has <b>pendant</b> <b>flowers,</b> petals that turn pink with age, and white staminodes.|$|R
5000|$|Capsicum cardenasii, {{like most}} members of the Pubescens complex, is a {{perennial}} plant that develops woody stems. The plant can grow up 2-3 feet high with a width of 1-1.5 feet. The leaves are narrow, lanceolate and pubescent. Plants generally produce between 1 and 2 flowers at the internodes. The petioles grow erect and have campanulate, <b>pendant</b> <b>flowers.</b> The corolla is white and purple colored. The plant produces small, fleshy, red fruit. It is likely the wild ancestor of rocoto peppers.|$|R

The large corona allows the bees to crawl into the {{perianth}} {{but then the}} narrow tube prevents further progres, causing them to probe deeply for nectar. The <b>pendant</b> <b>flowers</b> prevent pollination by lepidoptera. In N. albimarginatus there may be either a long stigma with short and mid length anthers or a short stigma and long anthers (dimorphism). In N. triandrus there are three patterns of sexual organs (trimophism) but all have long upper anthers but vary in stigma position {{and the length of}} the lower anthers.|$|R
