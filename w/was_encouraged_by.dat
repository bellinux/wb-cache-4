5|$|The {{publisher}} <b>was</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>by</b> the book's {{critical and}} financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on the successor The Lord of the Rings, he made retrospective accommodations {{for it in}} The Hobbit. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{publication}} of Industrial Society and Its Future, Ted Kaczynski's brother, David Kaczynski, <b>was</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>by</b> his wife Linda {{to follow up on}} suspicions that Ted was the Unabomber. David was at first dismissive, but began to take the likelihood more seriously after reading the manifesto a week after it was published in September 1995. He browsed through old family papers and found letters dating back to the 1970s written by Ted and sent to newspapers protesting the abuses of technology and which contained phrasing similar to that found in Industrial Society and Its Future.|$|E

The decision <b>was</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>by</b> his father, who valued Booth's education. Enrolled at Michigan State University while playing for the school's hockey team, he studied dentistry before switching to general management.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte was a {{favourite}} of her paternal grandparents, {{whom she}} frequently saw. King Wilhelm and Queen Augusta spoiled their granddaughter and encouraged her {{rebellion against the}} Crown Prince and Princess, and Charlotte and her brother frequently took their side in disputes with her parents. This rebellion <b>was</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>by</b> the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who held political disagreements with the liberal Crown Prince and Princess. Charlotte also enjoyed {{a close relationship with}} her eldest brother, though they grew apart after his marriage in 1881 to Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein ("Dona"), a princess described by Charlotte as plain, slow-witted, and shy. Charlotte's relationship with Wilhelm would remain troubled as a result.|$|E
5|$|Growth in the Northeast was {{accompanied}} by the creation of moral reform organizations, such as Sunday schools, temperance associations, tract and Bible societies, and orphanages. The proliferation of voluntary organizations <b>was</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>by</b> postmillennialism, {{the belief that the}} Second Coming of Christ would occur {{at the end of an}} era of peace and prosperity fostered by human effort. The 1815 General Assembly recommended the creation of societies to promote morality. Organizations such as the American Bible Society, the American Sunday School Union, and the American Colonization Society, while theoretically interdenominational, were dominated by Presbyterians and considered unofficial agencies of the Presbyterian Church.|$|E

He <b>was</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>by</b> Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington {{to join him in}} the political battle surrounding the establishment of an independent United States Air Force. Separately, the two men gave promotional speeches around the country. As a result, SAC's efficiency suffered. On 8 May 1946, Kenney publicly presented the Medal of Honor to the family of Thomas B. McGuire, Jr, the second-highest scoring US fighter pilot, who had been killed in action.|$|E

An early fascination with the theatre <b>was</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>by</b> his parents, who took him on a family outing to Peter Pan at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three.

Students demonstrating against increasing dominance of Japanese investors <b>was</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>by</b> General Sumitro, deputy commander of armed forces. Sumitro was an ambitious general who disliked the strong influence of Suharto's Aspri inner circle. It was reported to Suharto that the riots were engineered by Sumitro who wished to destabilize the regime utilizing the student unrest, resulting in Sumitro's dismissal and forced retirement. This incident is referred as Malari Incident (Malapetaka Lima Belas Januari / Disaster of 15 January). However, Suharto also disbanded Aspri to appease popular dissent.|$|E

The result was widely admired, not least by Darwin; other reviewers {{sometimes}} disagreed with the book's support for evolution, but generally enjoyed {{his account of the}} journey, scenery, people, and natural history. The book has been reprinted many times, mostly in Bates's own effective abridgement for the second edition, which omitted the more technical descriptions.|$|E
5|$|This {{was part}} of a {{phenomenon}} that took place during the 1970s and 1980s, as the term Wicca became increasingly associated purely with Gardnerianism and Alexandrianism (together known as British Traditional Wicca in North America), rather than with other variants of Pagan Witchcraft. This <b>was</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>by</b> elements within the Gardnerian and Alexandrian communities who wished to emphasise what they perceived as their special position within the Pagan community. The word Wicca first appeared in a book title in 1981 as Wicca: The Ancient Way; written by Janus-Mithras, Nuit-Hilaria and Mer-Amun and published in Canada. It discussed a Gardnerian-based tradition.|$|E
5|$|Whereas Milian's {{previous}} albums had pop and R stylings, she <b>was</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>by</b> Island Def Jam {{to target}} a new audience and release an urban record. Explaining the change, Milian {{said that one}} of her main problems was that previous releases would often find mainstream success, but would be relatively unsuccessful on urban radio. As an R artist, she wanted to build her core audience–a true fan base that would support her through time–to increase her career's longevity. The main purpose of her genre change was {{to go back to the}} streets and add to her core audience.|$|E

5|$|Winchelsey held various benefices in England, {{and was the}} Chancellor of Oxford University {{before being}} elected to Canterbury in early 1293.

5|$|After Sercey {{returned}} to Île de France his squadron broke up. Four ships were {{sent back to}} France in 1797 and 1798 as Île de France could no longer supply repairs, manpower or provisions in support of Sercey. This dispersal of the squadron <b>was</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>by</b> the Colonial Assembly of Île de France and Governor Malartic neither of whom were well-disposed to the Directory then ruling France. With his remaining crews becoming rebellious, Sercey sent Forte and Prudente on a commerce raiding operation during the autumn of 1798, during which they achieved some success in the Bay of Bengal. By the time this force {{returned to}} Île de France Sercey had sailed to Batavia, leaving instructions for Forte and Prudente to follow him. Malartic countermanded this order, seizing Prudente and selling the frigate to a privateer concern and ordering Forte to operate independently in the Bay of Bengal {{in the autumn of}} 1798. Sercey was furious, but could do nothing to alter Malartic's arrangements.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Usama was {{the second}} of four boys and raised by his nurse, Lu'lu'a, who had also raised his father and would later raise Usama's own children.

He also had much direct experience of battle, against the neighbouring crusader County of Tripoli and Principality of Antioch, hostile Muslim neighbours in Hama, Homs, and elsewhere, and Hashshashin who had established a base near Shaizar.|$|E
