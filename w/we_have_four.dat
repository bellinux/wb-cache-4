2500|$|Set in 2003, {{the novel}} {{consists}} of three parts: [...] "The Beginning," [...] "Middle" [...] and [...] "The End." [...] Each part contains four separate narrations, one focusing on {{each member of the}} Smart family: Eve, the mother, Michael, her husband, Astrid (12) and Magnus (17), two children of Eve’s from a previous marriage (to Adam Berenski). Opening and closing the novel, and between each part, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>four</b> sections of first-person narration from ‘Alhambra’ – who we can assume is Amber, the Smarts' uninvited house-guest.|$|E
2500|$|On Tuesday, September 10, Sokolich texted Baroni: [...] "Presently <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>four</b> {{very busy}} traffic lanes merging into only one toll booth... bigger problem is getting kids to school. Help please. It's maddening." [...] Kelly's text message {{exchange}} with Wildstein {{referred to the}} mayor's message. Kelly asked, [...] "Is it wrong that I am smiling?" [...] Wildstein replied, [...] "No." [...] Kelly then wrote, [...] "I feel badly about the kids. I guess." [...] Wildstein responded, [...] "They are the children of Buono voters," [...] referring to Barbara Buono, Christie's Democratic opponent in the November election.|$|E
2500|$|Articles {{often take}} a {{definite}} editorial stance and almost never carry a byline. Not even {{the name of}} the editor (since 2015, Zanny Minton Beddoes) is printed in the issue. It is a long-standing tradition that an editor's only signed article during their tenure is written on the occasion of their departure from the position. The author of a piece is named in certain circumstances: when notable persons are invited to contribute opinion pieces; when journalists of The Economist compile special reports (previously known as surveys); for the Year in Review special edition; and to highlight a potential conflict of interest over a book review. The names of The Economist editors and correspondents can be located on the media directory pages of the website. Online blog pieces are signed with the initials of the writer and authors of print stories are allowed to note their authorship from their personal web sites. [...] "This approach is not without its faults (<b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>four</b> staff members with the initials [...] "J.P.", for example) but is the best compromise between total anonymity and full bylines, in our view", wrote one anonymous writer of The Economist.|$|E

Company leader Emil Simeonov recalled the marketing campaign {{that took place in}} the nation for the film as [...] "massive, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>four</b> of the top 20 most popular singers and actors involved and we covered every channel I know, even a few communication channels I'd heard of for the first time." ...|$|R

The moral, or immoral, {{elements}} which unite to {{form the}} spirit of Central Renaissance architecture are, I believe, in the main, two,--Pride and Infidelity; but the pride resolves itself into three main branches,--Pride of Science, Pride of State, and Pride of System: and thus <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>four</b> separate mental conditions which must be examined successively.|$|E

[...] And he counted them over on his fingers and held up his hand triumphantly. [...] "And there she stands, the girl to whom I--I, Giuseppe Giacosa--taught her {{alphabet}} and her piano-scales; there she stands in her incomparable beauty, and Roman princes come and bow to her.

[...] "Unless you are {{prepared}} {{to hand over the}} sum of five thousand pounds, my solicitor, Mr. Cheape here, will at once commence proceedings against you with reference to the affair in Mrs. Delaporte's flat.

Let us simply say that our army that is {{fighting}} their army, and their army that is fighting our army, amount altogether to about a thousand men. Say that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>four</b> thousand. It is very simple. Of the thousand fighting, they have at the very most, three hundred, so that, with those three hundred, they have now to fight four thousand seven hundred men.

We may as well give them a few shots, too, with our {{carbines}} and the rifles that remain serviceable. They will carry as far as half a mile if we give them elevation enough, and it is well to impress them as much as possible.' ...|$|E

Of course, {{there are people}} who have made a good deal more in the same time, but then there are {{thousands}} who are no richer than when they began. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> done little more than keep ourselves when we went to work on Adams's claim. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> nearly <b>four</b> hundred apiece from him, besides what we made for our labour, for the horses pretty well kept us; then from the claim six hundred apiece. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>four</b> thousand each out of the rich strike we made at the head of the gulch; the bank gave me two thousand more; the odd money represents the receipts of the rest of my digging and of my earnings with the mule team." ...|$|R

These four I have, with full trust, admitted to the Holy Communion. Mr. Nihill had taught them well, and I am sure they could pass an examination in Scriptural history, simple doctrinal statements, &c., {{as well as most}} young English people of the middle class of life. The other two are well taught, and one of them knows a great deal, but, poor fellow, he misconducted himself at Nengone, and hence I cannot recommend him to the Bishop for baptism without much talk about him.|$|E

Lillie is going to New York to spend the holidays; and I wanted you to shut up, and come up and keep house for us.

[...] "Cut two, as if you were hedging--so. Three, as if you were reaping--so. Four, as if you were threshing--in that way. Then the same on the left.
