40|$|This thesis explores, through photography, the question: What {{will the}} {{landscape}} of next generations look like? What are <b>we</b> <b>leaving</b> behind for future generations? The author created images which impart a ponderous mood which reflects on how individual lifestyles affect our natural environment. Are <b>we</b> <b>leaving</b> behind any natural resources for our future generations...|$|R

25|$|Measuring consumers' {{conscious}} and subconscious through studying their biological sensorimotor, {{cognitive and affective}} response to marketing stimuli, called neuromarketing, is of increasing interest to marketers {{in order to gain}} insight into how they consume. Dawkins (1989) explained that when we die <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> behind genes and memes; genes being the unit of genetic information, and memes the units of cultural information. Neuromarketing aims to examine the memory of these memes in order to manipulate them.|$|E
25|$|In {{the long}} history of {{canonical}} quantum gravity formulating the Hamiltonian constraint as a quantum operator (Wheeler–DeWitt equation) in a mathematically rigorous manner has been a formidable problem. It was in the loop representation that a mathematically well defined Hamiltonian constraint was finally formulated in 1996. <b>We</b> <b>leave</b> more details of its construction to the article Hamiltonian constraint of LQG. This together with the quantum versions of the Gauss law and spatial diffeomorphism constrains written in the loop representation are the central equations of LQG (modern canonical quantum General relativity).|$|E

25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> behind us {{that is worth}} anything {{is that we can}} be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, and that we can say that we left the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E
25|$|At the reception, various {{patrons and}} curators congratulate George {{on his work}} while George flits among them, commenting on the {{difficulties}} of producing modern art ("Putting It Together"). Like his great-grandfather, he conjures his surroundings, allowing himself to hold multiple conversations at once. The only voice he finds he cannot ignore is that of an art critic who advises him that he is repeating himself and wasting his gifts. After the museum's patrons have left for dinner, Marie speaks to her mother's image in the painting, worrying about George. When he arrives to take her home, she tells him about her mother, attempting to pass on a message about the legacy <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> behind ("Children and Art"). She dozes off and George, alone with the painting, realizes he is lacking connection.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{importance}} of Iraq, the potential for catastrophe, and the role and commitments of the United States in initiating events that have led to the current situation, we believe it would be wrong for the United States to abandon the country through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support. A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.|$|E
6000|$|Mistrust {{is a fine}} {{thing at}} times. [...] "Forewarned is forearmed," [...] says the proverb, and of all fore{{warnings}} there is none we {{are more likely to}} heed than our own mistrust; for whereas <b>we</b> may <b>leave</b> unheeded the warnings of a friend, <b>we</b> seldom <b>leave</b> unheeded the warnings of our spirit.|$|R
5000|$|So it was {{the night}} before <b>we</b> were to <b>leave</b> to return to America. Mom was packing. And there had been talk about our {{passports}} and our papers weren't in order and, you know, there were issues. But {{everything was going to}} work out. It was going to be all right. And then the night before <b>we</b> were to <b>leave,</b> <b>we</b> were in the bedroom. Mom was packing. And my dad came in and said that's it. <b>We</b> weren't <b>leaving.</b> <b>We</b> were in Iran until we died. And we were in his country. We had to abide by his rules. And from then on, he was a completely different person. To me, that's when my daddy died. You know, he was, from that moment on, completely changed. Mahtob Mahmoody, November 29, 2015 ...|$|R

500|$|Michael Reyes, {{writing for}} Cinema Blend in July 2017, quoted Scott stating that if Sigourney Weaver could reprise {{her role as}} Ellen Ripley in the prequels, then [...] "We're heading toward {{the back end of}} the first Alien, so using CGI may be feasible. I don't think it'll... but Ripley's going to be somebody's daughter. Obviously. We're coming in from the back end. The time constraints, of what's the time between this film, where <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> David going off heading for that colony. I think you're {{probably}} two films out from even considering her." ...|$|E
500|$|Axe to Fall debuted {{at number}} 74 on the Billboard 200 with 7,400 copies sold, {{becoming}} Converge's highest charting album in the US at that time. That chart high was surpassed by 2012's All We Love <b>We</b> <b>Leave</b> Behind. It also {{became the first}} Converge album to not appear on the Billboard Top Heatseekers albums, which ranks the top 50 albums released by bands that have never charted higher that 100 on the Billboard 200. By November 4, 2009, the album had sold 10,487 units. Axe to Fall also appeared in Canada's Chart Magazine, a weekly chart that compiles airplay data from various Canadian campus radio stations, and peaked at number 42 on their [...] "Top 50" [...] album chart and number 1 on their [...] "Metal/Punk" [...] chart.|$|E

500|$|The State Department {{appeared}} {{to not be}} well-informed about the action, as Ball cabled Lodge {{a few hours after}} the coup started: [...] "We have so little info on motivations and other factors involved in current crisis that <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> to your judgment how to handle. Meantime we trust you will make very clear that we {{had nothing to do with}} coup. If you consider it advisable and possible there would seem to us to be merit in preserving Minh as head of Government since he appears to have best potentialities for rallying support of people." [...] The Pentagon had opposed the removal of Diệm and opposed his successors, while the State Department supported such a move, and Khánh later reflected: [...] "Maybe in the coup of January 30, 1964, the U.S. Army had come to conclude that it too should have the capacity to bring about a coup." ...|$|E
500|$|In the song's final bridge section, at 2:58, {{the spoken}} phrase [...] "Fucking hell!" [...] appears. Scott admits that {{although}} he was told about it, he could not hear the words originally. Lennon attributed the expletive to McCartney, according to Emerick, who reports Lennon's comment in his autobiography: [...] "'Paul hit a clunker on the piano and said a naughty word,' Lennon gleefully crowed, 'but I insisted <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> it in , buried just low enough {{so that it can}} barely be heard. Most people won't ever spot it ... but we'll know it's there.'" [...] Womack considers that the expletive was actually uttered by Lennon. Malcolm Toft, the mix engineer on the Trident recording, also attributes it to Lennon. In Toft's recollection, Lennon was overdubbing his harmony vocal when, in reaction to the volume being too loud in his headphones, he first called out [...] "Whoa!" [...] then, two seconds later, swore as he pulled the headphones off.|$|E
500|$|One shot {{created by}} Shade VFX {{is when the}} {{audience}} sees Matt Murdock's [...] "vision" [...] – {{the way that he}} [...] "sees" [...] using his other heightened senses. On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in [...] "Stick", where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in [...] "The Ones <b>We</b> <b>Leave</b> Behind" [...] when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The final use of the effect {{was going to be in}} [...] "Daredevil" [...] when the camera pushes in on Page's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work together. Here, the effect was hiding all of the nuances in her expression, so it was decided that it would be better to remove it.|$|E

500|$|Obama's {{selections}} of Warren and Lowery to deliver prayers for the inaugural ceremony were controversial. Warren {{had a history}} of vocal opposition to same-sex marriage, and Lowery had a background as a civil rights activist. Neither Obama nor Warren made references during the inaugural program to issues of direct concern to the gay community. In the invocation, Warren asked for [...] "forgiveness for Americans 'when we fight each other' and 'civility in our attitudes even when we differ.'" [...] Warren mentioned Dr.MartinLuther King and Jesus in the invocation, and he concluded the invocation with the Lord's Prayer. Lowery used humor as he delivered the benediction. One of his messages was the statement that [...] "as <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> this mountaintop, help us {{to hold on to the}} spirit of fellowship and the oneness of our family." [...] Lowery concluded the benediction with a humorous message of anticipation for the day [...] "when brown can stick around, when yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead man and when white would embrace what is right". Conservatives, including Rush Limbaugh decried Lowery's benediction, which quoted from [...] "Lift Every Voice and Sing" [...] (the [...] "Black National Anthem"), as racist, while Democrats disagreed. Another of Lowery's rhymes, [...] "When black will not be asked to get in back", borrowing (along with other lines in his conclusion) from the Big Bill Broonzy song [...] "Black, Brown and White", particularly offended the likes of Limbaugh who felt that Obama's ascension on that day symbolized the fact that America had come to that point already.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{believed}} that the United States should be looking beyond the present situation in Iraq: [...] "whether <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> there under our own terms or not, it's {{still going to be}} a very dangerous world.
