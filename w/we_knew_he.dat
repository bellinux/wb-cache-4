500|$|Sam Waley-Cohen (Oscar Time, 2nd): [...] "The {{plan was}} always {{to come with}} one smooth run. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> had a huge jump in him so I {{was just trying to}} get him to pop a little bit and save and not get too keen. He did {{everything}} I asked of him." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} the season, Torres agreed a new {{contract}} with Liverpool, which he signed on 14 August. By signing, Torres had the option of a one-year extension after the contract's expiration in 2013. Torres scored two goals in a 3–2 win over West Ham United on 19 September 2009, a result that took Liverpool to third in the Premier League. One week later, he scored his first hat-trick of the 2009–10 Premier League season in a 6–1 victory over Hull City at Anfield. He was named Premier League Player of the Month for September, after scoring five goals during the month and becoming the Premier League's top goalscorer. On 25 October 2009, he scored the first goal in a 2–0 victory for Liverpool over Manchester United, after which Rafael Benítez praised Torres' performance, saying, [...] "We were waiting for that final pass. When it came <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would score." [...] Torres was named in the FIFPro World XI for the second successive season in December 2009. His stoppage-time winning goal against Aston Villa on 29 December 2009 made him the fastest Liverpool player ever to score 50 league goals. He was substituted on 65 minutes in a 1–1 draw with Birmingham City on 4 April 2010, which Benítez justified by saying Torres was [...] "exhausted". Torres made his last appearance of the season scoring twice in a 4–1 victory over Benfica in the Europa League on 8 April 2010, and it was announced on 18 April that he would miss {{the rest of the season}} to undergo knee surgery. This meant that Torres finished the season with 22 goals in 32 games in all competitions, finishing as Liverpool's top scorer for the second time.|$|E

2500|$|His call-up to the India {{national}} cricket team {{to replace}} the injured Sreesanth came little more than ten weeks after his first-class debut, but his Karnataka coach Sanath Kumar was not surprised; [...] "From day one <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> had the potential, he has the pace, bowling around 140kmh, and he has performed in every game, whether it is junior cricket or first-class cricket.|$|E
2500|$|Rick Leach {{rushed for}} 65 yards and {{completed}} 9 of 15 passes for 151 {{yards and two}} touchdowns. [...] With Illinois putting seven or eight men on the line at times, no Michigan player was able to rush for 100 yards in the game. [...] Accordingly, Michigan opened up the passing attack. [...] Bo Schembechler said after the game, [...] "When they put that many people on the line of scrimmage, you have {{to throw the ball}} over their heads." [...] In addition to the touchdown pass to Lytle, Leach connected with tight end Mark Shmerge in the second quarter for a seven-yard touchdown pass. [...] Jim Smith also caught six passes for 127 yards. [...] Leach's two touchdown passes gave him 13 for the season, tying the Michigan record set in 1947 by Bob Chappuis. [...] After the game, Illinois coach Bob Blackman said, [...] "Leach is not just a good quarterback, he is a great quarterback. [...] <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> could run the option, but he can also pass the ball." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help it, sir," [...] Harris said; [...] "we {{all felt}} we couldn't {{go to bed}} to-night without telling Norris that <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was innocent." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A horrible place, truly," [...] {{said the}} Captain, [...] "and one {{that it would}} be hard to find a fellow in even if <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was here." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{would not}} have been safe for us to say he was mistaken, but <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was. Nikolaus said, [...] "We ask pardon for the mistake, but we meant to say seven." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Who {{paid for}} Stephen Harper's {{rise to the}} head of the party? <b>We</b> don't <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> refuses to reveal his donors.

6000|$|... "Jeff was on {{the first}} raft, and for all <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> is now safe at Fort Henry. Our {{steersman}} was shot, and we were captured." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a pity you didn't {{catch that}} robber," [...] said he. [...] "For all <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> {{may be the}} fellow who has been {{stealing}} here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well" [...] (resuming {{her former}} tone), [...] "don't squeeze your fingers quite into my hand. I see. There is nothing {{wonderful}} in that. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he,</b> at least, was here, whoever might be absent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but {{his name}} was in the list; and <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> had strong fancy for South Africa, whither the Hippolyta was bound. In fact {{he ought to have}} been a sailor, and only yielded to his mother's wishes." ...|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, he vaulted {{with a light}} leap on {{his hands}} up {{the edge of the}} precipice. The next thing <b>we</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>he</b> was standing, safe and sound, with the rope round his waist, a living soul, on the further brink beyond the chasm.|$|E
60|$|And then, {{there being}} {{sufficient}} pennies in the cap, the author starts away, and pretends that Angelina thought this and said that, and that Edwin did {{all sorts of}} wonderful things. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> is making it all up as <b>he</b> goes along. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> is making up just what he thinks will please us. He, on the other hand, has to make-believe that he is doing it because he cannot help it, he being an artist. But <b>we</b> <b>know</b> well enough that, were we to stop throwing the pennies into the cap, he would find out precious soon that he could.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>know</b> <b>we</b> {{are all in}} the dark, Papa," [...] said she, {{thinking}} it expedient to change the conversation. [...] "For anything <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> may be at this moment engaged to Mrs. Bold." ...|$|R
50|$|Apollonius Attaleus (Απολλώνιος Ἀτταλεύς) {{was a man}} {{mentioned}} by Artemidorus as being {{the author of a}} work on dreams. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> lived in or before the 2nd century, but nothing else.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did, but {{he could}} say little more than <b>we</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>He</b> says {{nothing could be more}} {{exemplary}} than Kendal's whole conduct in India, he only regretted that he kept so much aloof from others, that his principle and gentlemanly feeling did not tell as much as could have been wished. He has always been wrapped up in his own pursuits--a perfect dictionary of information.' ...|$|E
60|$|So Jed and I, two youngsters of nine, {{went out}} under the white flag {{to talk with the}} leader of our enemies. But Lee would not talk. When he saw us coming he started to sneak away. We never got within calling {{distance}} of him, and after a while he must have hidden in the brush; for we never laid eyes on him again, and <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> couldn't have got clear away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't see as it's any {{different}} {{from what it was}} before. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was bound to drive me away, an' it wasn't likely he'd stop after what little he's done. Now, Carrots, there's jest this much about it: you wouldn't be in any fuss with him if it wasn't for me, an' you can square things up this very minute by sayin' you've shook me. Why not do it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't shoot," [...] he cried, in a {{voice of}} {{surprised}} dismay and disapproval. [...] "We mustn't take his life. How do <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he's</b> an enemy at all? He mayn't be pursuing us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe Sobber {{will ever}} return to Putnam Hall," [...] came from Tom. [...] "Especially {{when he finds}} out that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> is the nephew of such a swindler as Merrick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More than likely. For all <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> {{may be one}} of the firm!" [...] went on Dick suddenly. [...] "Wait, I've got an idea. I think I'll go back {{to those}} offices." ...|$|R
6000|$|One of {{the first}} persons we encountered, as we walked up the street, was the Rev. Mr. ------, an old friend from America--a lucky encounter, indeed, for his is a most gentle, refined, and {{sensitive}} nature, and his company and companionship are a genuine refreshment. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> had been in Europe some time, but were not at all expecting to run across him. Both parties burst forth into loving enthusiasms, and Rev. Mr. ------ said: ...|$|E
60|$|As I say, {{with three}} feet to our two, till {{we saw the}} rudder lift green at every jump--and I {{swinging}} on to the wheel and cursing, with {{my back to the}} Russian shot. For <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> had it in mind to run before us, that he might get away while we were caught. And they knocked our masts out of us till we dragged into the wind like a wounded gull; but he went on {{over the edge of the}} sky line--he and Unga.|$|E
6000|$|The {{words were}} {{typical of the}} man, though their {{undercurrent}} of melancholy troubled me; but, for <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> spoke the truth {{in regard to the}} farming, the matter was settled so. I should much have preferred that Harry return to Fairmead, but {{it was clear that the}} task most suited me. Perhaps Johnston guessed my reluctance, for he said playfully: [...] "Is not banishment worse than snow slides or the high peak's frost, and what are all the flowers of the prairie to the blood-red rose of the valley that was grafted from Lancastrian stock?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} legged {{it for all}} he was worth after he jumped through the window," [...] was Roger's comment. [...] "For all <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> may be miles away from here by now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that so?" [...] said Mr. Crewe. He {{wanted to}} be of service, as <b>we</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> {{was a man of}} ideas, and the opening {{sentences}} of the speech were already occurring to him.|$|R
