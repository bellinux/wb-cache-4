5|$|After the Jacobite rising of 1745, Adam's {{position}} as Mason to the Board of Ordnance {{brought him a}} number of large military contracts in the Highlands. In 1746, the position of Master Carpenter to the Board of Ordnance became vacant, and Adam <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> put forward his son John's name for consideration, although he was unsuccessful in securing him the post. His three eldest sons were all involved in the family business by 1746, James and John both leaving Edinburgh University early to join their father.|$|E
5|$|Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruises, the world's {{two largest}} cuise operators, {{diverted}} their ships {{away from the}} damaged cruise port of Puerto Costa Maya. Their plans originally expected diversions until at least 2009, but the central government <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> fund rebuilding of the destroyed concrete piers. By June 2008 they were rebuilt to accommodate even larger ships than before, and ships scheduled stops there for September 2008.|$|E

5|$|Crazy Kong {{was officially}} {{licensed}} from Nintendo and manufactured by Falcon for some non-US markets. Nevertheless, Crazy Kong machines {{found their way}} into some American arcades, often installed in cabinets marked as Congorilla. Nintendo <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> take legal action against those distributing the game in the US. Bootleg copies of Donkey Kong also appeared in both North America and France under the Crazy Kong, Konkey Kong or Donkey King names. The 1982 Logger arcade game from Century Electronics is a direct clone of Donkey Kong, with a large bird standing in for the ape and rolling logs instead of barrels.|$|E

He died in his {{hometown}} of Washington, D.C. after a year-long battle with consumption (tuberculosis), and is interred at Congressional Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{feature in}} many highly dramatized films. Hollywood <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> exploit the {{possibilities}} of deadly disease, mass infection and drastic government reaction, starting as early as 1922 with Nosferatu, in which a Dracula-like figure, Count Orlok, sleeps in unhallowed ground contaminated with the Black Death, which he brings with him wherever he goes. Another classic film, Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal, deals with the plague theme very differently, with the grim reaper directly represented by an actor in a hood. More recently, the 1971 The Andromeda Strain, based on a novel by Michael Crichton, portrayed an extraterrestrial microbe contaminating the Earth.|$|E

When subjects are subliminally primed with WHITE, they <b>are</b> <b>quicker</b> <b>to</b> react to white stereotypes, such as intelligent, ambitious, uptight and greedy.These tendencies are sometimes, but not always, associated with explicit stereotypes.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} arrival in Australia, it was {{reported}} in the British media that Fowler would be making a swift return to his homeland and sign for League One side Tranmere Rovers, who had just appointed Fowler's former Liverpool teammate John Barnes as manager. However, Fowler <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> dismiss talk of a quick return to England. When Barnes was dismissed three months later, it was reported that Tranmere had approached Fowler about becoming player-manager, but these reports too were dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Staszic was {{remembered by}} his contemporaries as a loner {{and not a}} person who <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> make friends. He has been {{described}} as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.|$|E
5|$|Taft upset some {{progressives}} {{by choosing}} Hitchcock as Chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), placing him {{in charge of}} the presidential campaign. Hitchcock <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> bring in men closely allied with big business. Taft took an August vacation in Hot Springs, Virginia, where he irritated political advisors by spending more time on golf than strategy. After seeing a newspaper photo of Taft taking a large swing at a golf ball, Roosevelt warned him against candid shots.|$|E

Cyberlink, which sells the PowerDVD player software, <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> deny that its software {{could be used to}} obtain keys. Corel was silent about the role its WinDVD software had played in the leaking of volume and title keys. Both companies have since released updates for their player software.|$|E
5|$|Upon his return, Darwin <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> {{take the}} coach home, {{arriving}} {{late at night}} on 4 October 1836 at The Mount House, the family home in Shrewsbury, Shropshire.

5|$|Van Rensselaer <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> {{take part}} in the new endeavor: on January 13, 1629, he sent {{notification}} to the Directors of the Company that he, in conjunction with fellow Company members Samuel Godyn and Samuel Blommaert, had sent Gillis Houset and Jacob Jansz Cuyper to determine satisfactory locations for settlement. This took place even before the Charter was ratified, but was done in accordance with a draft of the Charter from March 28, 1628.|$|E

5|$|Warner Bros. <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> team its two rising gangster stars—Edward G. Robinson and Cagney—for the 1931 film Smart Money. So keen was {{the studio}} to follow up the success of Robinson's Little Caesar that Cagney {{actually}} shot Smart Money (for which he received second billing in a supporting role) {{at the same time}} as The Public Enemy. As in The Public Enemy, Cagney was required to be physically violent to a woman on screen, a signal that Warner Bros. was keen to keep Cagney in the public eye. This time, he slapped co-star Evalyn Knapp.|$|E
5|$|For his {{services}} during the war, he was welcomed back to America {{with a large}} parade down Broadway in New York, along with other honors. Schwarzkopf led a highly publicized homecoming parade in Washington, D.C., on June 8, 1991, where he was greeted by Bush amid thousands of onlookers. His accomplishments were praised in a manner much differently from commanders who returned from the Vietnam and Korean Wars. He became an instant national celebrity {{and the source of}} great curiosity by the general public. He <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> award praise and medals to the troops, part of what he saw as restoring pride in the U.S. armed forces after the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{left the}} {{territory}} for business in Kentucky {{shortly after the}} meeting with Tecumseh, and secretary John Gibson was acting governor. Gibson, who had lived among the Miami tribe for many years, <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> learn of Tecumseh's plans for war; he immediately called out the territory's militia and sent emergency letters calling {{for the return of}} Harrison. By mid-September, most of the militia regiments had formed. By then, Harrison had returned, accompanied by a small force of army regulars, and had taken command of the militia. Harrison had already communicated with his superiors in Washington, D.C., and he had been authorized to march against the confederacy in a show of force, in the hopes that its members would accept peace.|$|E

5|$|He was {{a member}} of the Washington Light Infantry, a local Washington, D.C. militia, and played in many of their amateur {{baseball}} games throughout his life. When not playing, he tended to his bar. Noted for being a genial, friendly individual, he <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> make friends, and was a fan-favorite in his hometown of Washington, D.C. Kinslow was a heavy drinker however, which caused him to miss games and team movements on occasion. Late into his career, these alcohol issues were much less tolerated, eventually hastening his exit from the game. He died at the age of 35, after a year-long battle with tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dot of August 1959 was at {{its time}} the costliest {{tropical}} cyclone in Hawaiian history. Dot was first identified as a strong tropical storm southeast of Hawaii on August1. The storm was potentially a continuation of a previously unnamed tropical cyclone that was monitored west of the Baja California Peninsula from July24-27, but was never confirmed {{due to a lack}} of ship reports. Dot <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> intensify, reaching hurricane intensity six hours after naming. By August3, Dot reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds reaching 150mph (240km/h). Intensity leveled off afterwards as Dot tracked westward before making a curve towards the northwest on August5, after which the hurricane weakened at a faster clip. Dot made landfall the next day on Kauai as a minimal hurricane before dissipating west of the Hawaiian Islands on August8.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Simeon visited Constantinople, Constantine's mother Zoe {{returned}} to the palace on the insistence of the young emperor and immediately proceeded to eliminate the regents. Through a plot, she managed to assume power in February 914, practically removing Patriarch Nicholas from the government, disowning and obscuring his recognition of Simeon's imperial title, and rejecting the planned marriage of her son to one of Simeon's daughters. Simeon {{had to resort to}} war to achieve his goals. He invaded Thrace in the summer of 914 and captured Adrianople. Zoe <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> send Simeon numerous presents in order to conciliate him, and she managed to convince him to cede back Adrianople and withdraw his army. In the following years, Simeon's forces were engaged in the northwestern Byzantine provinces, around Drač (Durrës) and Thessaloniki, but did not make a move against Constantinople.|$|E
