The estate sold the team to a group of Larry MacPhail, Dan Topping, and Del Webb in 1945, and Barrow sold his 10% stake in the team to the group. Barrow remained as chairman of the board and an informal adviser. Though he signed a five-year contract to remain with the team, he exercised a clause in his contract to free himself as of December 31, 1946, in order to officially retire from baseball.

50|$|Barrow was {{commissioned}} for IUPUI in 2007. The sculpture was {{installed at the}} Herron School of Art on Wednesday, May 7, at noon. <b>Barrow</b> <b>will</b> remain on display for two years. Barrow was inspired by Viney's visits to caves and burial mounds in Ireland and France. The word barrow means a prehistoric burial mound used by Celtic people of France, England, Scotland, and Ireland. Viney's inspiration for the ceiling of Barrow came from her experience in an actual barrow in Ireland. While inside the mound's central rounded space, {{a beam of light}} came streaming in through a slot in the ceiling. These slots were used to chart the solstices, and the paths of the sun and moon. The space also had empty niches in the walls, resembling the entry ways in Barrow.|$|R

Barrow earned his bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s degree from UGA and his law degree from Harvard University, where {{he was one of the}} youngest members of his law school class. At this year 2 ̆ 7 s commencement, approximately 205 students will be honored for the completion of all requirements for a Juris Doctor degree. Additionally, 10 Master of Laws candidates, who have completed one year of graduate legal study, will be recognized.

40|$|WKU Libraries’ Far Away Places speaker series {{kicks off}} its spring season with Noah Ashley, Assistant Professor of Biology at WKU with “Arctic Songbirds of Alaska”. He talked about “Arctic Songbirds of Alaska” {{on the evening}} of February 23, 2017 at Barnes 2 ̆ 6 Noble Booksellers, Bowling Green, KY. Originally from Ohio, Ashley went to high school in Vermont before moving to Maine to attend Colby College. He earned his Ph. D. in Zoology at the University of Washington in Seattle {{studying}} the relationship between hormones and behavior of arctic songbirds. He has previously been a wildlife biologist in the North Slope Borough in northern Alaska, and has conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Alaska and Ohio State University on the circadian rhythms of Lapland longspurs and Siberian hamsters. He has been at WKU since 2012 where he has since been named the Lancaster Professor, and studies the immunological effects of sleep deprivation on mice and birds. In April, 2016 Ashley received a grant from the National Science Foundation to study the sleep patterns of arctic songbirds in Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost community in the United States. The grant enables Ashley to lead a team of researchers for five years to study the sleep patterns of two species of arctic songbirds, snow buntings and Lapland longspurs. While most mammals’ circadian rhythm is tuned to daylight-nighttime cycles, northern Alaskan summers can have perpetual daylight and these birds are active for over twenty hours a day for two months of the year. Ashley’s team will use transmitter harnesses to monitor bird activity, and will also give different groups of birds caffeine or melatonin to determine the impact on their sleep patterns and reproduction. The findings may have implications for human medical treatments and could yield new therapies or medicines. Ashley’s team includes WKU and Gatton Academy students who enrolled in a preparatory course in the spring and <b>will</b> travel to <b>Barrow</b> in June and July as part of a cross-cultural program with Native Alaskans conducting field research...|$|R
40|$|A single {{industry}} {{town and}} an important munitions centre, Barrow-in-Furness experienced {{the full force of}} industrial mobilisation, government intervention, and mass unemployment in the years between 1914 and 1926. In analysing the responses to these events, the thesis will give insights into their impact on a town dependent on industries stimulated by war and crippled in the post-war economic climate. The study comprises of two interrelated components. The first section establishes the socio-economic context at the outbreak of the war and examines the influence of war and depression on the occupational and social structure of the town, together with health trends and housing conditions. In doing so, the thesis will analyse the dual effects of higher wartime earnings and long term mass unemployment on popular health, and the role of housing reform in maintaining social stability. Having established the context in which ideology and social attitudes developed, the second section will interpret the impact of war and depression in terms of the pressures placed on industry, the local authority and the wider population. This section will address three key themes, beginning with an examination of the divisive impact of leftwing ideology on the Labour Party, political allegiances and the composition of local authority bodies. Moving on, the study will assess the implications of these developments for local authority policy and the material well-being of the unemployed, giving particular attention to the distinctive response of Barrow's Board of Guardians and the application of the Poor Law. Thirdly the thesis examines the strategies adopted by the wider community {{to meet the demands of}} the depression, beginning with key local organisations, but focussing closely on methods of working class self-sufficiency. The thesis will conclude by addressing three important questions which emerge from this study. Firstly, drawing the various themes together, the thesis will analyse the impact of war and depression on social perceptions and levels of social antagonism. In demonstrating that to focus on workplace militancy and 'class conflict' is to miss the thrust of local developments, the thesis will argue that the tensions, hardships and uncertainties of the period stimulated social cohesion rather than class conflict. Secondly, the thesis will examine the nature of the communal identity that emerged during these years, and finally, <b>will</b> determine whether <b>Barrow,</b> as a result of the town's distinctive response to the post-war crisis, can be included among the 'Little Moscows'of the period. By examining these salient themes, the thesis provides fresh insights into the nature of social relationships and levels of class antagonism throughout the period, and makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of the impact of war and depression, and the social dynamics of distress.
