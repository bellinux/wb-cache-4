5|$|Colt {{purchased}} a large {{tract of land}} beside the Connecticut River, where he built his first factory in 1848, a larger factory called the Colt Armory in 1855, a manor that he called Armsmear in 1856, and employee tenement housing. He established a ten-hour day for employees, installed washing stations in the factory, mandated a one-hour lunch break, and built the Charter Oak Hall, where employees could enjoy games, newspapers, and discussion rooms. Colt ran his plant with a military-like discipline, he <b>would</b> <b>fire</b> workers for tardiness, sub-par work or even suggesting improvements to his designs.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun {{with a bag of}} powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner <b>would</b> <b>fire</b> the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E
5|$|As the {{bombardment}} {{of the city}} proved to be unsuccessful, Montgomery then began to plan for an assault. Montgomery was to assault the Lower Town district, {{the part of the}} city near the river shore, while Arnold was to attack and take the Cape Diamond Bastion, a strong part of the city walls on the highest point of the rocky promontory. Montgomery believed that they should attack during a stormy night, therefore the British {{would not be able to}} see them. On December 27, the weather became stormy, and Montgomery ordered that the men prepare to attack. However, the storm soon subsided and Montgomery called off the attack. As Montgomery waited for a storm, he was forced to revise his plans, because a deserter communicated the original plan to the defenders. In the new plan, Montgomery would attack the Lower Town from the south and Arnold would attack the Lower Town from the north. After breaking through the walls, Montgomery and Arnold would meet up in the city and then attack and take the Upper Town, causing resistance to collapse. To increase their chance of surprise, Montgomery planned two feints. One detachment of troops (the 1st Canadian Regiment under James Livingston) would set fire to one of the gates while another (under the command of Jacob Brown) would engage the guard at Cape Diamond Bastion and fire rockets to signal the start of the attack. While the feints were conducted, artillery <b>would</b> <b>fire</b> into the city. Although Montgomery was reluctant to attack, enlistments for Arnold's men were expiring on January 1, and he was concerned about losing their services.|$|E

25|$|When {{passing the}} forts, the fleet was to form two columns. The {{starboard}} column <b>would</b> <b>fire</b> on Fort St. Philip, while the port column <b>would</b> <b>fire</b> on Fort Jackson. They {{were not to}} stop and slug {{it out with the}} forts, however, but to pass by as quickly as possible. Farragut hoped that the combination of darkness and smoke would obscure the aim of the gunners in the forts, and his vessels could pass by relatively unscathed.|$|E

25|$|The {{high level}} of {{organization}} and morale {{made it possible to}} base the combat tactics on close combat, rather than long-range shooting. A regular attack would look like the following: When the enemy musketeers started firing, at ranges up to 100 metres, the Swedish infantry would not answer but keep a swift marching pace, not stopping until the range was as little as 40 metres, where the musketeers {{in the back of the}} formation <b>would</b> <b>fire</b> their only salvo. At an even closer range, the musketeers in the front <b>would</b> <b>fire</b> their only salvo, and immediately after that, break into the enemy linesmusketeers using their swords, and pikemen using their pikes. This tactic would often result in a fleeing enemy force, which probably stood terrified when their opponent's companies were not stopped by continuous musket fire, but kept marching on towards them in sinister silence.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the first}} time two {{candidates}} were fired simultaneously, as usually Sir Alan <b>would</b> <b>fire</b> one candidate and then proceed to fire a second candidate; only the nature of this final created the situation for doing so.

50|$|Once {{formed in}} square, the {{infantry}} <b>would</b> volley <b>fire</b> at approaching cavalry, either by file or by rank.

The HSYNC <b>would</b> be <b>fired</b> by the sensor after every 640 x 3, 1920 PCLKs.

They took out four or five this way and all the time they were giving the rest of us a running commentary.|$|E

25|$|Najaden had a slab-sided {{hull and}} the typical Hohlenberg pinkie stern, with {{a place for}} two stern chaser guns. Gardiner {{suggests}} that the pinkie stern and increased tumblehome towards the stern permitted the vessel to fire over the quarters. Naval warfare in the Baltic made extensive use of oared gunboats, which <b>would</b> <b>fire</b> on becalmed vessels from the quarter, an angle that normally broadside guns could not cover. The pinkie stern was unpopular with the British, who removed it when they refitted her.|$|E
