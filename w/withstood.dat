5|$|The {{fortress}} was battle-tested in 1915 when Germany {{attacked the}} Russian Empire, and <b>withstood</b> eleven days of assault before capture. After World War I, the fortress' military importance declined as advances in weaponry rendered it increasingly obsolete. It {{was used by}} various civil institutions and as a garrison.|$|E
5|$|The species {{suffered}} heavy persecution by 18th century European {{landowners and}} gamekeepers, but <b>withstood</b> attempts to eradicate it. For example, {{on the estate}} at Sandringham in Norfolk, 1,645 'hawks' were killed between 1938 and 1950, with 1,115 taken between 1919–1926 at Langwell and Sandside in Caithness, Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} Western Chalukya monuments are temples {{built in}} the Shaiva, Vaishnava, and Jain religious traditions.

40|$|Abstract. Short-circuit <b>withstand</b> {{capability}} test of transformers is {{mechanical strength}} <b>withstand</b> test under strong current imposed on power transformers, {{which is a}} kind of assessment method of comprehensive technical capabilities and technological level of transformer manufacturing. This paper analyzes the theory basis of short-circuit <b>withstand</b> capability test and calculates the imposed short-circuit current value and provides experimental scheme which is verified by the testing. All is to verify the ability to <b>withstand</b> a short circuit of 110 kV power transformer...|$|R
50|$|Refractoriness — This {{refers to}} the sand's ability to <b>withstand</b> the {{temperature}} of the liquid metal being cast without breaking down. For example, some sands only need to <b>withstand</b> 650 C if casting aluminum alloys, whereas steel needs a sand that will <b>withstand</b> 1500 C.

5|$|In 750 a revolt, led by Majza'a ibn al-Kawthar and Umayyad pretender Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani, {{against the}} new Abbasid Caliphate swept across Syria; the tribes in Palmyra {{supported}} the rebels.

5|$|In October 1139, Talbot {{was once}} more in charge of Hereford and <b>withstood</b> an attack by Miles of Gloucester, at that time a {{supporter}} of King Stephen.

2500|$|The {{surge current}} {{refers to the}} peak current an RCD is {{designed}} to <b>withstand</b> using a test impulse of specified characteristics.

5|$|In the 17th {{century the}} grounds were {{turned into a}} garden. The castle's defences were {{enhanced}} in the 1640s to prepare the castle for action in the English Civil War. Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke, was a Parliamentarian, and Royalist forces laid siege to the castle. Warwick Castle <b>withstood</b> the siege and was later used to hold prisoners taken by the Parliamentarians.|$|E

Mdina has been on Malta's tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1998.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{were missing}} defender Sol Campbell from their team {{after the death}} of his father, and manager Arsène Wenger dropped wingers Robert Pirès and Sylvain Wiltord in favour of Ray Parlour and Fredrik Ljungberg, {{creating}} a more physical midfield. Wenger's tactics worked, as the Arsenal defence <b>withstood</b> the pressure from the Manchester United attack. United themselves were without Paul Scholes due to injury, and they played a 4–3–2–1 formation with Phil Neville, Roy Keane and Quinton Fortune completing a defensively minded midfield.|$|E
5|$|Bowes Castle was {{a medieval}} castle {{in the village}} of Bowes in County Durham, England. Built within the {{perimeter}} of the former Roman fort of Lavatrae, the early timber castle on the site was replaced by a more substantial stone structure between 1170 and 1174 on the orders of Henry II. A planned village was built alongside the castle. Bowes Castle <b>withstood</b> Scottish attack during the Great Revolt of 1173-74 but was successfully looted by rebels in 1322. The castle went into decline and was largely dismantled after the English Civil War. The ruins are now owned by English Heritage and run as a tourist attraction.|$|E

By the end of 5 August, they were completely exhausted; their depleted ranks stumbled back to their bivouac lines at Romani and Etmaler where they were ordered one day's rest.|$|E
5|$|In 1620 the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Osman II {{declared}} {{a war against}} the Commonwealth. At the disastrous Battle of Ţuţora Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski was killed and the Commonwealth's situation in respect to the Turkish-Tatar invasion forces became very precarious. A mobilization in Poland-Lithuania followed and when Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz's army <b>withstood</b> fierce enemy assaults at the Battle of Khotyn (1621), the situation improved on the southeastern front. More warfare with the Ottomans followed in 1633–1634 and vast expanses of the Commonwealth had been subjected to Tatar incursions and slave-taking expeditions throughout the period.|$|E
5|$|In January 1727, Spain {{declared}} the nullification of the Treaty of Utrecht's provisions relating to Gibraltar {{on the grounds}} that Britain had violated its terms by extending Gibraltar's fortifications beyond the permitted limits, allowing Jews and Moors to live there, failing to protect Catholics and harming Spain's revenues by allowing smuggling. Spanish forces began a siege and bombardment of Gibraltar the following month, causing severe damage through intensive cannon fire. The defenders <b>withstood</b> the threat and were reinforced and resupplied by a British naval force. Bad weather and supply problems caused the Spanish to call off the siege at the end of June.|$|E

5000|$|Apply VLF to XLPE cables in a {{monitored}} <b>withstand</b> approach where {{a diagnostic}} measurement is made {{before and during}} the course of the <b>withstand</b> test.

During the test measurement of a diagnostic parameter can be used to optimise test times. Test times can be shortened for cables with good diagnostic indications or lengthened for cables that show deteriorating diagnostic measurements during the test.|$|R
