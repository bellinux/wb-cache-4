5|$|Finally, Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) {{falls for}} a new staffer, a blind woman named Jennifer (Maria Thayer). Kenneth cannot bring himself to ask Jennifer out, so Tracy (Tracy Morgan) decides to help him. On their date, at the 30 Rock studios, Kenneth and Jennifer are joined by Tracyâ€”who does all the talking. Jennifer {{believes}} Kenneth is black, but Kenneth reveals he is white and expresses his feeling for her, and admits to her that Tracy <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> the talking. Jennifer tells him she does not mind of what has happened. However, after feeling Kenneth's face and comparing it to her own, she leaves, horrified at his appearance.|$|E
25|$|Several EU member states, {{including}} the UK and the Netherlands, made {{the surrender of}} Gotovina a precondition for Croatia's accession to the European Union. This stance was criticised by the Croatian government, which claimed ignorance of Gotovina's whereabouts {{but that he was}} probably outside the country and that it <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> it could to bring him to justice. Accession negotiations with the EU, scheduled to start on 17 March 2005, were postponed pending a resolution of the issue.|$|E

Niels Krogh Mortensen worked on Hugo between 1990 and 1998. During this time he usually directed and managed the projects; he also created storyboards and drew graphics. The Krogh Mortensen brothers and Jakob Steffensen left ITE in 1997 and founded their own company, Krogh Mortensen Animation A/S (KMA). KMA was later contracted to animate several more Hugo games.|$|E

He wrote in 1931 that, [...] "I believe that television is destined to become the greatest force in the world. I think it will have more influence over the lives of individuals {{than any other single}} force." [...] This remark has been quoted in several books about the history of television. [...] He at the same time proposed the censorship of television, in order that objectionable images not be seen and the amount of advertising not be excessive.|$|E
500|$|The album {{also helped}} the Red Hot Chili Peppers earn a {{dedicated}} cult fanbase in Los Angeles. [...] One of these fans was John Frusciante, {{who would later}} join the band as guitarist after Slovak's death. [...] Frusciante recalled: [...] "The first time I saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers live was at the Variety Arts Center, {{and that was really}} amazing ... They were going for this real hard sound. [...] Hillel <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> this awesome feedback and stuff. [...] It was the most magical experience I ever had in the experience of a show." [...] Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak's work, and explained, [...] "I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel's playing and I just took it sideways from there." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} two years, the band played {{throughout}} the Boston area. Eventually Godsmack's CD landed {{in the hands of}} Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station WAAF (FM). The radio station put [...] "Keep Away" [...] into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly. Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of [...] "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled [...] "Whatever", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM). In an interview Sully Erna stated, [...] "We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over a thousand records a week. (...)

500|$|As producer, Eno {{had most}} of the artistic control during the sessions, {{limiting}} U2's creative input on the recordings, which prompted The Edge to ensure extra work was put into arranging the song. He has said that along with [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] and [...] "Your Blue Room", [...] "Seibu" [...] {{was one of only}} three tracks from the album in which U2 [...] "really dug in [...] heels and did more work on and tried to craft". [...] By early July 1995, the band renamed the song [...] "Seibu/Slug", and Eno noted that the piece started to sound better and described it as a [...] "lovely song". During the final editing of the track, Eno became angry with U2 because they seemed unfocused and he felt he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> the work. Bono decided to completely deconstruct the mix of the song. Eno initially disapproved, but was satisfied after hearing the changes. The editing of the track was finalised on 10 July, and The Edge later said he felt his effort to put extra work into the song [...] "paid off". [...] It was released with the title [...] "Slug" [...] on 7November 1995, as the second track on the Passengers album Original Soundtracks1; out of the fourteen tracks on the album, it is one of six tracks to feature vocals. [...] Details of the song's recording sessions were documented in Eno's 1996 book, AYear with Swollen Appendices.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Ferman's son, Edward Ferman, was {{managing}} editor during Davidson's tenure as editor. [...] When Davidson left, Joseph Ferman {{took over the}} editorial chair, but in reality Edward Ferman <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> the editorial work, and by the May 1965 issue was in full control of the magazine. [...] It remained eclectic through the 1960s and 1970s, publishing work by New Wave writers such as Thomas Disch and John Sladek, along with new US writers such as Samuel Delany and Roger Zelazny, hard science fiction stories by Gregory Benford and John Varley, fantasies by Sterling Lanier and Tom Reamy, and horror by Charles L. Grant and Stephen King. [...] The mid-1960s saw {{an increase in the}} diversity of stories appearing elsewhere in the field; magazines like New Worlds and Science Fantasy published material that previously could only have appeared in F. [...] Sf author Christopher Priest, writing in 1978, commented that many writers later considered part of the New Wave soon found [...] "a natural home for their work" [...] in F. [...] In Ashley's view {{the rest of the field}} was starting to catch up to Fs open-mindedness, but this did not lead to a drop in Fs quality; the end of the 1960s saw Ferman printing some old-fashioned material such as John Christopher's novel about miniaturization, The Little People, alongside much of Roger Zelazny's early output, and [...] "anarchic and often indefinable" [...] stories by R.A. Lafferty, Harvey Jacobs, and others. [...] In 1968, Piers Anthony's early novel Sos the Rope was serialized; Anthony had won a competition sponsored in part by F.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1936 Churchill {{organised}} a deputation {{of senior}} Conservatives who shared his concern to see Baldwin, Chamberlain, and Halifax.

2500|$|But {{the issue}} {{had come to}} a head. Metro's funding ran out on August 1, 1971. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970 {{required}} D.C. officials to report by December 31, 1970, on the construction status of the Three Sisters Bridge and Inner Loop. Broyhill visited President Nixon on November 18, asking Nixon to make a public statement. Nixon did so the following day, arguing that the city <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> it could given the legal situation. He also warned Congress that delay threatened to kill the entire subway project and cost the country millions of dollars. Metro had an ally in the White House as well, presidential aide Egil [...] "Bud" [...] Krogh. Krogh enjoyed living in D.C., and was a strong advocate for Metro. Furthermore, Krogh was Deputy Counsel to the President, and Nixon's advisor on and liaison to the District of Columbia. [...] Working with Giaimo, Krogh helped put together a coalition of [...] "liberal Republicans and Democrats, White House loyalists, and the Congressional Black Caucus" [...] to oppose Natcher.|$|E
2500|$|On December 1, Arnold took a staff {{assignment}} {{as assistant}} to {{the new head of}} the Aeronautical Division in the Office of the Chief Signal Officer [...] in Washington, D.C. In the spring he was assigned the task of closing the flying school at College Park. [...] Although promoted to 1st lieutenant on April 10, 1913, Arnold was unhappy and requested a transfer to the Philippines. While awaiting a response, he received orders to the 9th Infantry on July 10. In August, still awaiting transfer, he testified before the House Military Affairs Committee against HR5304, a bill to remove aviation from the Signal Corps and make it a semi-autonomous [...] "Air Corps." [...] Arnold, like fellow flyer Capt. Benjamin Foulois, argued that the action was premature, and like his Signal Corps boss, Major Edgar Russel (a non-flyer), that the Signal Corps <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> that could be done to develop military use of the airplane. He was assigned to a company at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, on September 1, where he was stationed until transferred to the 13th Infantry on November 1.|$|E
2500|$|Maus {{was born}} and raised in Austin, Minnesota. As a teenager, he listened mainly to Nirvana and Syd Barrett. In 1998, he began his {{undergraduate}} in music composition at the California Institute of the Arts, by which time he had formed an appreciation for experimental music, such as the work of Michael Pisaro, as well as Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque music. When he befriended and began to work alongside classmate Ariel Pink (Ariel Rosenberg), he took a greater interest in pop music. The first time he heard Rosenberg play was at a concert put up by students from the visual arts department. He recalls thinking: [...] "You know, Okay, maybe Iâ€™m not going to do experimental music anymore, because I <b>was</b> ... <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> of these performances like [...] Feldman and [...] Cage. ... I left that aside and took up pop as the best bet, largely because of my encounter there with Ariel, and the early work he was doing." [...] After they became roommates, he recorded the material from his first album using a cassette multi-track recorder and an early 1990s synthesizer soundbank. He later completed his degree in experimental music composition in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|Unknown to Mosby as {{he headed}} east with hopes of a good {{position}} with the new administration, Alger <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> {{in his power to}} thwart the former Confederate guerrilla. His hatred for Mosby was personal. While Alger served with Sheridan in the Shenandoah in 1864, a number of his command had been caught burning homes in the Valley and had been executed by members of Mosby's command as war criminals. Alger never forgot nor forgave what had happened for though Mosby was not present {{at the time of the}} events, he had concurred with the actions of his men. So despite having been asked to send a list to the McKinley administration of what posts he desired, by the time he arrived from the west coast Mosby found that all had been [...] "unexpectedly" [...] given to someone else and he was forced to return to the west coast disappointed and unemployed. But Alger's involvement with the defeat of Mosby's hopes did not remain hidden. It was reported in the May 11, 1898, San Francisco Call under the headline [...] "Alger Dislikes Mosby" [...] and it is probable that until he read that article, the 65-year-old Mosby had no idea that his failure to obtain a position was anything other than bad luck.|$|E
2500|$|Luis Paez-Pumar of Rolling Stone {{described}} WrestleMania as [...] "two-faced as a Gemini"â€”the {{first half}} [...] "was a brisk hybrid of styles and matches {{that made you}} think that WWE knew what it <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> along with this lackluster build", but once Triple H appeared, {{the rest of the}} event [...] "was a slog of plodding wrestling, brief matches and boos". Paez-Pumar described that The Undertaker as [...] "should have retired when the Streak was broken", but [...] "lived on to pass the rub on to Reigns in the sloppiest, saddest manner possible". Paez-Pumar proclaimed that [...] "WWE has no idea how to handle Bray Wyatt", writing that Orton [...] "definitely did not need the title" [...] and ridiculing Wyatt's conjuring of [...] "projected video screen grossness" [...] as [...] "the dumbest crap". Paez-Pumar called for [...] "fresh blood or new ideas" [...] in both women's divisions and for Triple H to retire given that he [...] "has not put on a good Mania match" [...] since 2005 or 2006 once WrestleMania XXX was discounted. For the positives, Goldbergâ€“Lesnar was a [...] "revitalizing adrenaline shot to the spine", Cena's proposal was [...] "magic in a way that no other entertainment can match", The New Day [...] "were excellent hosts; funny when called upon and out of the way when not", while [...] "a stale-ass tag team division just became the most must-see part of Raw" [...] due to the return of the Hardys.|$|E
2500|$|Having safely {{withdrawn}} {{his army}} to Dalton, Georgia, General Bragg directed Cleburne's exhausted troops to camp at nearby Tunnel Hill, a town bearing {{the same name}} as the spot where they had made their stand atop Missionary Ridge. Private Matthews reports that the 33rd Alabama was given [...] "some cabins... above the tunnel... some were of round oak poles, others of split oak log, their cracks daubed with clay." [...] Captured shelter halves were used as doors, and the men wintered there as best they could. He writes that those who died here were buried nearby; the regiment would accompany them to their final resting place [...] "with arms [...] reversed, and sounded taps; however, [...] did not always fire blank cartridges from our guns, for fear of exciting other sick men in camp." [...] Though they worried about the nearly worthless currency they were being paid in, [...] "there was not as much complaint as one might suppose, as all realized that the [...] Government <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> it could for us." [...] Matthews blamed [...] "hospital rats" [...] {{for most of the}} grumbling, and observed that troops in winter quarters played cards, dominoes, dice or keno; those who had a dollar, said he, could go to minstrel shows. Not everyone in the camp had the best interests of their comrades at heart: [...] "two or more sharpers," [...] said he, would accost soldiers doing various chores and seek to con them out of their earnings. One regiment was assigned to twenty-four hours of guard duty every day; whenever the 33rd Alabama drew this duty, they would pack up their gear and march a mile or so to the front lines, leaving behind sick soldiers and a guard over their other property.|$|E
