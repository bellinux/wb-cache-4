5|$|A Turkish kilim is a flat-woven rug from Anatolia. Although {{the name}} kilim is {{sometimes}} used loosely in the West {{to include all}} type of rug such as cicim, palaz, soumak and zili, in fact any type other than pile carpets, the name kilim properly denotes a specific weaving technique. Cicim, palaz, soumak and zili are made using three groups of threads, namely longitudinal <b>warps,</b> crossing wefts, and wrapping coloured threads. The wrapping threads give these rugs additional thickness and strength. Kilim in contrast are woven flat, using only warp and weft threads. Kilim patterns are created by winding the weft threads, which are coloured, backwards and forwards around pairs of warp threads, leaving the resulting weave completely flat. Kilim are therefore called flatweave or flatware rugs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{tension of}} <b>warp</b> and weft {{run through the}} whole weaving process in knitted carpet weaving equipment. The {{performance}} of delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism and guiding weft mechanism {{in this kind of}} equipment influences the quality of carpet directly. A self-adjusting delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism is designed in this thesis, which is used in knitted carpet weaving equipment or other textile equipment that delivers <b>warp</b> by warp-spindle and demands even <b>warp</b> tension. The self-adjusting delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism consists of the device for setting and detecting <b>warp</b> tension, the device for driving warp-spindle in different speed, and the device for transmitting warp-spindle movement. The device for setting and detecting <b>warp</b> tension can determine initialization tension of <b>warp,</b> according to the technical requirements, can detect and feed back <b>warp</b> tension in real time. The device for driving warp-spindle in different speed makes the rotating speed of warp-spindle change according to the <b>warp</b> tension. The self-adjusting delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism realizes the function on controlling the rotating speed of warp-spindle in closed loop, and on stabilizing delivering <b>warp</b> tension...|$|R

(1) The tension of lifted <b>warp</b> is smaller than the tension of depressed <b>warp.</b> 	(2) The variety of depressed <b>warp</b> tension is more sudden than the variety of lifted <b>warp</b> tension. 	(3) The tappet whose dwell of small radius is 0 °，moves　most smoothly and keeps the most smooth variety 	to the <b>warp</b> tension. 	(4) The tappet whose dwell is small，reduce sboth the <b>warp</b> tension and the variety of <b>warp</b> tension.

5|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or {{spinster}} to teach reading, sewing and cooking.

They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the bandwin. Women also played an important part in the expanding textile industries, spinning and setting up <b>warps</b> for men to weave. There is evidence of single women engaging in independent economic activity, particularly for widows, who can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading. Some were highly successful, such as Janet Flockhart, an Edinburgh Wadwife or moneylender, who had been left a widow with seven children after her third husband's suicide, and who managed her business affairs so successfully that she amassed a moveable estate of £22,000 by her death in the late sixteenth century. Lower down the social scale, the rolls of poor relief indicate that large numbers of widows with children endured a marginal existence.|$|E

5|$|Each level {{contains}} various {{obstacles and}} enemies {{that the players}} must deal with. Players lose a segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments. Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues {{in which they can}} restart the game from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them. They can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes. Located throughout the game are lids (in the shape of manhole covers) in which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies.

5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm <b>warps</b> the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new image geometric transformation, named tearable image <b>warping,</b> for content-aware image retargeting and recomposition. In tearable image <b>warping,</b> an object is allowed to partially detached from the background during <b>warping,</b> which allows the background to <b>warp</b> more freely without distorting the object. The part of the object that is still attached to the background ensures that spatial semantics between the object and its environment is preserved. Compared to traditional non-homogeneous image <b>warping,</b> tearable <b>warping</b> produces retargeted results with less severe distortions, especially in cases of extreme retargeting. Compared to scene carving, tearable <b>warping</b> can better preserve the global context and achieve better scene consistency by preserving the semantic connectedness between an object and its environment. In addition, tearable <b>warping</b> is also able to alter the object-background relationship within the image, which makes it quite suitable for aesthetics-based image recomposition. We also show that tearable image <b>warping</b> is a unified approach of traditional non-homogeneous image <b>warping</b> and the cut-and-paste techniques...|$|R
