5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows more <b>white</b> <b>on</b> {{the head and neck}} than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more <b>white</b> <b>on</b> the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the <b>white</b> <b>on</b> the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.|$|E
5|$|Crystalline {{zinc oxide}} is thermochromic, {{changing}} from white to yellow when heated in air and reverting to <b>white</b> <b>on</b> cooling. This color change {{is caused by}} a small loss of oxygen to the environment at high temperatures to form the non-stoichiometric Zn1+xO, where at 800°C, x = 0.00007.|$|E

5|$|T. m. caurinus breeds in {{southeast}} Alaska through coastal British Columbia to Washington and northwest Oregon. It winters from southwest British Columbia south to {{central and southern}} California and east to northern Idaho. It is very slightly smaller than the nominate subspecies and very dark-headed. The <b>white</b> <b>on</b> {{the tips of the}} outer two tail feathers is restricted.|$|E
5|$|The adult California condor is {{a uniform}} black with the {{exception}} of large triangular patches or bands of <b>white</b> <b>on</b> the underside of the wings. It has gray legs and feet, an ivory-colored bill, a frill of black feathers surrounding the base of the neck, and brownish red eyes. The juvenile is mostly a mottled dark brown with blackish coloration on the head. It has mottled gray instead of <b>white</b> <b>on</b> the underside of its flight feathers.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} the Hydrobatidae {{are mostly}} dark in colour with varying amounts of <b>white</b> <b>on</b> the rump. Two species have {{different}} plumage entirely, the Hornby's storm petrel which has white undersides and facial markings, and the fork-tailed storm petrel which has pale grey plumage. This is a notoriously difficult group to identify at sea. Onley and Scofield (2007) state that much published information is incorrect, and that photographs in the major seabird books and websites are frequently incorrectly ascribed as to species. They also consider that several national bird lists include species which have been incorrectly identified or have been accepted on inadequate evidence.|$|E

5|$|E. c. albipennis was {{described}} by John Gould in 1841 and found in north Queensland, west though the Gulf of Carpentaria in the Northern Territory and across {{into the top of}} Western Australia. It has <b>white</b> <b>on</b> the wings and a discontinuous stripe on the nape. The wing patch is pure white {{in the western part of}} its range and is more cream towards the east. It has a longer bill and shorter tail than the nominate race. Birds also decrease in size with decreasing latitude, consistent with Bergmann's rule. Molecular work supports the current classification of this subspecies as distinct from the nominate subspecies cyanotis.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 {{there was}} a break in {{tradition}} when the Echo title-piece appeared reversed out in <b>white</b> <b>on</b> a red background, instead of the more familiar red or black lettering. The new title-piece was designed to give a greater impact to the colourful front page. It {{was the first in}} a series of changes which included dropping Sunderland from the title in 1990, the paper simply becoming The Echo. This change was reversed in 1997, with a return to the name Sunderland Echo.|$|E

50|$|The <b>white</b> mark <b>on</b> top of {{the head}} is distinctive.

5|$|In {{much of its}} range, Eurasian is {{the only}} {{nuthatch}} present. In southeast Europe and southwest Asia, the western and eastern rock nuthatches are larger and paler than the Eurasian species. They also lack white spots in the tail and are usually found in a different, stony habitat, and Krüper's nuthatch is small and has a black cap and reddish breast patch. In southwest China, the chestnut-vented nuthatch {{is very similar to}} the European bird, but is darker above, has less <b>white</b> <b>on</b> the face and has greyer underparts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Trent Richardson scored first on a one-yard {{touchdown}} run {{followed by a}} 39-yard McCarron touchdown pass to <b>White</b> <b>on</b> consecutive possessions. Following an unsuccessful extra point by Jeremy Shelley, Alabama led 27–0 entering the fourth quarter. Early in the fourth, DeMarcus Milliner intercepted a Jordan Rodgers pass and returned it 37-yards to the Commodores' 20-yard line. Three plays later, McCarron threw a 17-yard touchdown pass, his fourth of the day, to Darius Hanks to make the final score 34–0.|$|E
5|$|Masked shrikes {{are most}} similar in {{appearance}} to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults {{of the two}} species are easily distinguished, since the masked shrike has <b>white</b> <b>on</b> its head and a dark rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the masked shrike has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a sandy back and pale grey rump.|$|E

5|$|T. m. propinquus breeds from {{southeast}} British Columbia, southern Alberta, southwest Saskatchewan {{south to}} southern California and northern Baja California. It winters {{throughout much of}} the southern breeding range and south to Baja California. It is the same size as or slightly larger than nominate T. m. migratorius, but paler and tinged more heavily brownish-gray. It has very little <b>white</b> <b>on</b> the tip of the outermost tail feather. Some birds, probably females, lack almost any red below. Males are usually darker and may show pale or whitish sides to the head.|$|E
5|$|The {{brains of}} {{vertebrates}} {{are made of}} very soft tissue. Living brain tissue is pinkish {{on the outside and}} mostly <b>white</b> <b>on</b> the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).|$|E
5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} is, {{by a small}} margin, the largest member of its genus (Thomomys). The fur is a dull brown above and dark, leaden gray beneath. There are often patches of <b>white</b> <b>on</b> the chin, throat and around the anus, and it has blackish ear and nose markings. The {{external}} ear is a thickened rim of tissue. During the summer, the gopher's coat is short and coarse; winter pelage is longer and furrier. The coat of the young {{is similar to the}} adult summer coat, but with more sparsely distributed fur; the abdominal skin may be visible.|$|E

In summer, girls are required to wear a Black Watch tunic, short-sleeve white blouse, green blazer with tartan piping, short green socks and black leather shoes. The winter uniform consists of the tunic, long-sleeve white blouse, the blazer, green jumper or vest, Black Watch Tartan tie, Black Watch Tartan scarf and either green knee-high socks or black stockings. School pockets are awarded for student achievements, and are embroidered in red on the pockets of junior blazers (R10 girls), and <b>white</b> <b>on</b> the left-breast of senior blazers (1112 girls).|$|E
5|$|The modern {{version of}} the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps.
