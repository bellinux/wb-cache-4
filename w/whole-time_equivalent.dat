40|$|A {{standard}} liaison psychiatry service structure? A {{study of}} the liaison psychiatry services within six strategic health authorities AIMS AND METHOD We surveyed all psychiatric services in the six northeast strategic health authorities {{to determine how the}} provision of liaison psychiatry services related to College recom-mendations {{and the size of the}} general hospital trusts served. RESULTS Thirty-six (100 %) services provided usable data, 8 % of general hospital trusts had no liaison psychiatry service, 41 % of teams were not multidisciplinary with their only staff being nurses, only 38 % of services had dedicated consultant psychiatry time and only a quarter met the recommended minimum standard of 0. 5 <b>whole-time</b> <b>equivalents.</b> No teams contained clinical psychologists. Disorder-specific out-patient clinic provision was idiosyncratic. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS There is a lack of rational planning of liaison psychiatry services and as a result, many services are not needs-based and do not comply with College recommendations. One indication of this is the lack of multidisciplinary teams. General hospitals need good access to psychiatric services for two reasons. First, there is much psychopathology associated with physical illness. Second, many acute psychiatric presentations (including those following self-harm) are handled by the general hospital, especially their accident and emergency departments. Fo...|$|R
40|$|General medical {{practice}} has changed {{significantly in the}} past ten years, reflecting a range of innovations giving greater priority to health prevention and promotion and to primary health care generally. One consequence has been a rapid {{increase in the number of}} practice nurses. Since 1988 the number of <b>whole-time</b> <b>equivalents</b> has trebled and most practices now employ at least one nurse. Practice nurses make an increasingly important contribution to both the practice team and the delivery of primary health care. They undertake a wide range of activities, in the practice and the patient’s home, including traditional nursing tasks, chronic disease management, health promotion, new patient registration health checks, counselling, advice, investigation, treatment and health assessments of elderly people. There is, however, widespread uncertainty about their role and how it might develop. Cost has been largely ignored because where the money comes from, that is who bears the cost of practice nurses, is to a great extent divorced from the responsibility for their employment. General medical practitioners who employ nurses are usually reimbursed by Family Health Service Authorities for most of the nurse’s salary. This paper provides unit cost estimates of practice nurses and discusses the implications for their future role and deployment. As well as direct costs, it considers the wider opportunity cost associated with the growth in practice nurse numbers. nurse, primary care, general practice...|$|R

A month’s lead-in time for training and protocol development was allowed, which consisted of both shadowing the consultants in their elective clinics and condition-specific discussions.

30|$|The {{number of}} <b>whole-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> Consultant Radiologists (WTEs) {{required}} to service this accumulated hourly need (calculated {{on the basis}} of the standard contractual commitment of a 37 -h week—allowance was not made for the small number of Consultant Radiologists on contracts specifying different hourly commitments) was then subtracted from the total number of WTEs available for work within the department (e.g. a Consultant whose commitment to the department was 2  days per week was listed as 0.4 WTE), leaving the number of WTEs available to service the counted study numbers in Sect.  1. Whether or not an individual Consultant participated in the on-call rota was not relevant to this calculation (virtually all Consultants in public hospital departments share on-call commitments). The original Australian model, from which this calculation method was derived, was based on a 40 h/week commitment per WTE [2].|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The global {{economic}} crisis saw recessionary conditions in most EU countries. Ireland’s severe recession produced pro-cyclical health spending cuts. Yet, human resources for health (HRH) {{are the most}} critical of inputs into a health system and an important economic driver. The aim {{of this article is}} to evaluate how the Irish health system coped with austerity in relation to HRH and whether austerity allowed and/or facilitated the implementation of HRH policy. Methods The authors employed a quantitative longitudinal trend analysis over the period 2008 to 2014 with Health Service Executive (HSE) staff database as the principal source. For the purpose of this study, heath service employment is defined as directly employed <b>whole-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> public service staffing in the HSE and other government agencies. The authors also examined the heath sector pay bill and sought to establish linkages between the main staff database and pay expenditure, as given in the HSE Annual Accounts and Financial Statements (AFS), and key HRH policies. Results The actual cut in total <b>whole-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> (WTE) of directly employed health services human resources over the period 2008 to 2014 was 8027 WTE, a reduction of 7. 2 % but substantially less than government claims. There was a degree of relative protection for frontline staffing decreasing by 2. 9 % between 2008 and 2014 and far less than the 18. 5 % reduction in other staff. Staff exempted from the general moratorium also increased by a combined 12. 6 %. Counter to stated policy, the decline in staffing of non-acute care was over double than in acute care. Further, the reduction in directly employed staff was to a great extent matched by a marked increase in agency spending. Conclusions The cuts forced substantial HRH reductions and yet there was some success in pursuing policy goals, such as increasing the frontline workforce while reducing support staff and protection of some cadres. Nevertheless, other policies failed such as moving staff away from acute settings and the claimed financial savings were substantially offset by overtime payments ﻿and the need to hire more expensive agency workers. There was also substantial demotivation of staff as a consequence of the changes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{effectiveness}} {{and efficiency of}} memory assessment services (MASs) is unknown. Our aim {{was to determine if}} a typology can be constructed, based on shared structural and process characteristics, as a basis for a non-randomized evaluation of their {{effectiveness and}} cost-effectiveness. Methods Survey of random sample of 73 MASs in 2015; comparison of characteristics and investigation of inter-correlation. Results It was not possible to group characteristics to form the basis of a typology of MASs. However, there was considerable variation in staff numbers (20 -fold), new patients per <b>whole-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> (WTE) staff (20 -fold), skill mix and the nurse:doctor ratio (1 – 10). The operational performance also varied: first appointments (50 – 120 minutes); time for first follow-up (2 – 12 weeks); frequency of follow-up in first year (1 – 5). These differences were not associated with the number of new patients per WTE staff or the accreditation status of the MAS. Post diagnosis, all MASs provided pharmacological treatment but the availability of non-pharmacological support varied, with half providing none or only one intervention while others providing four or more. Conclusions In the absence of any clear typology, evaluation of MASs will need to focus on the impact of individual structural and process characteristics on outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To explore {{staffing}} and organisational {{characteristics of}} nursing care in cardiac intensive care units (CICUs) in Greece. Methodology: An exploratory descriptive survey design with additional cross-sectional comparisons was employed. A specifically developed survey-type questionnaire, addressed to nurse managers, was distributed to all CICUs in Greece. Results: The {{response rate was}} 76. 2 % (Ns 32 units). Nursing staff per bed ratios over 24 h (<b>whole-time</b> <b>equivalent)</b> were very low and exhibited a mean of 1. 25 (" 0. 53). The total registered nurse to assistance nurse (RNyAN) ratio was 2. 74, {{but a lot of}} variability was observed and in many units ANs operated in RNs positions. Only 42 % of the nurses had participated at in-service continuing education programs and a systematic training program in cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was provided in only 12 (37. 5 %) units. The reported frequencies at which specific technical tasks were performed autonomously by nurses varied substantially and reflected a medium to low level of practice autonomy; the most frequently reported tasks were: peripheral IV line insertion, CPR chest compression, titration of vasoactive drugs and administration of analgesics. Higher percentages of nurses had received in-service training associated with the likelihood of performance of several technical tasks (P- 0. 03). Conclusions: Future studies need to explore the effect of these organisational characteristics on patient outcomes. The endorsement of nation-wide standard...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that voluntary reform of the delivery of primary care services is more likely to occur in affluent areas. Health system reforms that include voluntary participation of GPs may therefore lead to a two-tier service in terms of access to and utilisation of medical services. New primary care organisations in Scotland (local health care co-operatives) were introduced in 1999. These are groups of general practices and membership was voluntary. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine whether the voluntary nature of membership was likely to exacerbate or reduce inequalities in the provision of primary care services. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify differences in population, practice, and GP characteristics between general practices that have joined a co-operative and those that have not. The results indicated that practices located in deprived areas and covering populations with high levels of morbidity were more likely to join a co-operative. High workload decreased the probability of membership. General practices that found it difficult to obtain access to local authority residential care homes were more likely to join a co-operative. The number of fee claims for minor surgery sessions per <b>whole-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> GP increased the probability of membership. There is therefore some evidence indicating that general practices located in areas of high need are more likely to join a co-operative. This suggests that voluntary participation in these new primary care organisations may reduce rather than exacerbate inequalities in the provision of primary care. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|SummaryPrevious smaller UK audits have {{demonstrated}} wide variation in organisation, resources, and process {{of care for}} acute {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) admissions. Smallest units appeared to do less well. UK acute hospitals supplied information on (1) resources and organisation of care, (2) clinical data on process of care and outcomes for up to 40 consecutive COPD admissions. Comparisons were made against national recommendations. Eight thousand and thirteen admissions involved 7529 patients from 233 units (93 % of UK acute Trusts). Twenty-six percent of units had at most one <b>whole-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> respiratory consultant while 12 % had at least four. Thirty percent patients were admitted under a respiratory specialist and 48 % discharged under their care whilst 28 % had no specialist input at all. Variation in care provision was wide across all hospitals but patients in smaller hospitals had less access to specialist respiratory or admission wards, pulmonary rehabilitation programs, speciality triage or an early discharge scheme. Six percent of units did not have access to NIV and 18 % to invasive ventilatory support. There remains wide variation in all aspects of acute hospital COPD care in the UK, with smaller hospitals offering fewest services. Those receiving specialist input {{are more likely to be}} offered interventions of proven effect. Management guidelines alone are insufficient to address inequalities of care and a clear statement of minimum national standards for resource provision and organisation of COPD care are required. This study provides a unique insight into the current state of care for patients admitted with COPD exacerbations in the UK...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{summarize}} trends {{over time}} {{in the percentage of}} British medical graduates who subsequently practise in Great Britain in the National Health Service (NHS), in Great Britain outside the NHS, outside Great Britain, or do not practise medicine. DESIGN: Questionnaire-based postal surveys and government employment records. SETTING: Great Britain. SUBJECTS: All British medical graduates of 1974, 1977, 1983, 1988, and 1993. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type and location of employment at successive years after graduation. RESULTS: Differences in career destination between cohorts were generally small. Combining data from all cohorts studied, 85 % of doctors were working in the NHS 2 years after graduation, 82 % after 5 and 10 years, 81 % after 15 years, and 77 % after 20 years. Part-time working was much higher among women than among men. Allowing for loss and part-time working, the <b>whole-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> available to the NHS at 15 years after graduation was 60 % of women and 80 % of men. More men than women worked in medicine outside the NHS in Britain and abroad. Loss from medicine altogether was small, and higher among women. CONCLUSIONS: Medical workforce planning in Great Britain should assume that 15 - 20 % of home-trained doctors will not be working in the NHS within a few years of graduation. Comparing cohorts at the same career stage showed no evidence of increased loss from the NHS in recent times. Although a higher percentage of women than men were not working in medicine at all, recent trends suggest that this percentage is falling...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To (1) {{examine the}} {{opinions}} of medical staff working in spinal cord injury (SCI) centres (SCICs); (2) evaluate their knowledge, attitudes and practices towards obesity prevention and management; (3) report the number of beds and dietitians available at each SCIC. Methods: A 37 -item questionnaire was sent to 23 SCICs in the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Republic of Ireland between September 2012 and January 2013. Results: Eighteen SCICs returned the questionnaires for analysis. All respondents stated that they {{had an interest in}} obesity treatment but only 2. 3 % of the respondents received training in obesity management. Sixty-one percent of staff did not consider body mass index (BMI) to be appropriate for use in SCI patients and subsequently {{less than half of the}} respondents use BMI routinely. The majority of respondents reported that they are confident in dealing with overweight (74. 5 %) and obese (66. 1 %) SCI adults, less than half (44. 1 %) are confident in treating overweight and obese SCI children. Respondents also indicated the need for nationally adopted guidelines and a lack of physical activity provision. There were 17. 5 <b>whole-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> (WTE) dietitians recorded in 22 SCICs, equivalent to 47. 8 beds per WTE dietitians (range 10 – 420). Non-UK SCIC dietitians are significantly better resourced than in UK SCICs (beds per WTE dietitian: 36 vs 124, P= 0. 035). Conclusion: Medical staff expressed the need to participate in obesity prevention and management. Appropriate training should be considered for all medical staff and the development of specific weight management guidelines and dietetic provision should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Has {{government}} expenditure on the National Health and Personal Social Services increased significantly {{in real terms}} over the past decade? If so, where has this growth in expenditure been utilised? This paper investigates claims of real increases in expenditure by examining trends in total expenditure on the NHS between 1979 and 1992, and disaggregating these trends to concentrate on different sectors, the influence of changes in NHS personnel, the revenue/capital split and the geographical distribution of expenditure increases. The {{total cost of the}} UK NHS has increased from approximately £ 9. 2 billion in 1978 / 79 to £ 37. 4 billion in 1991 / 92. Adjusting this figure to account for general inflation shows a real increase of 50. 4 % over this period. This gives a reflection of the increased cost of the NHS to the economy. However, adjusting the increases to account for changes in NHS pay and prices shows a smaller increase, of about 22 % over the period, an average annual increase of around 1. 5 %. As NHS costs are taken into account, this measures what the NHS is able to buy with the increased resources. Increases in expenditure have not been evenly distributed between different sectors. The smallest relative increases have been in the hospital sector, which have absorbed a decreasing proportion of overall NHS and PSS expenditure over the period. The relative restriction on hospital budgets during the 1980 s contributes greatly to the public perception of a parsimoniously funded health service. Expenditure on community health services has increased by the greatest proportion over the period, but this is still a small, though increasing, proportion of overall expenditure. The family health services budget (which funds primary care) has remained relatively stable as a proportion of overall expenditure over the 1980 s. This means that significant real increases have taken place. This is due largely to increases in general practitioner and other staffing. Between 1980 and 1991, the number of GPs increased by around 19 %, with average list sizes decreasing from 2, 247 to 1, 918. In addition, GPs have increasingly employed nursing and other support staff. There has also been increasing expenditure on pharmaceutical services (the government’s net expenditure on pharmaceuticals has increased by around 47 % over the period 1778 - 79 to 1991 - 92). Finally, expenditure on personal social services has increased at around the same rate as overall health and PSS expenditure. The NHS is a labour intensive service, and this means that changes in personnel have major expenditure implications. Over the period studied, numbers of <b>whole-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> medical (particularly senior medical) and nursing staff increased steadily, and these staff received significant real increases in salary levels. There were also increases in the number of professional and technical staff and administrative and managerial staff. Numbers of <b>whole-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> administrative and clerical staff increased from 105, 430 in 1980 to 129, 716 in 1990, i. e. by around 23 %. There were, however, significant reductions in numbers of directly employed works professional, maintenance and ancillary staff, due to government policies of contracting out these services. The resource consequences of the apparent shift towards relatively high paid staff are substantial, and if these trends continue the overall wage bill for the NHS will continue to increase considerably even if staff numbers do not. The majority of NHS expenditure is current expenditure, primarily on salaries and wages, with capital expenditure representing around 5 - 6 % of total NHS expenditure in England over this period. Geographical distribution of hospital and community health services expenditure has also changed relatively little, despite the implementation of the RAWP formula for HCHS in England and similar formulae subsequently and elsewhere in the UK. No attempt has yet been made to equalise primary care spending using a RAWP-type allocation formula. This is surprising given the government’s emphasis on the integration of primary and secondary care and the primacy given to the services managed by general practitioners. The ‘Waiting List Initiative’ and more recent government pledges in the ‘Patients’ Charter’ were aimed at reducing waiting times, particularly the number of long waits, with guarantees that no one should wait more than two years for a procedure. This goal has been achieved but, as ever, supply creates demand in the absence of agreed clinical practice guidelines and the number waiting have, as a consequence, grown to over one million. This policy concentrates on activity, which is an unsuitable goal and an unusable measure of success. In allocating resources to the NHS, as in all other policy areas, the appropriate target should be efficiency. Increasing activity, where this activity is often of unproven effectiveness is inefficient and inappropriate. The level of public expenditure devoted to the National Health Service is largely a political decision – the overall budget, as in all other departments, is determined by the political bargaining of the annual public expenditure round. The settlement for 1994 - 95 includes a real funding increase and meets the 1992 Conservative election pledge, provided the Treasury estimates of inflation are correct (which is rare!) However, to achieve efficiency in the NHS, expenditure increases must be directed to areas of proven cost-effectiveness. This goal would be assisted by publication of more detailed breakdowns of NHS expenditure increases and more economic evaluation of new and existing health care programmes. In future there will be increasing pressure on limited NHS resources due to demographic change and technological advance. The vague ways in which NHS expenditure is monitored and “value for money” determined will have to be replaced by more sophisticated monitoring of spending and the provision of cost effectiveness data to ensure society’s scarce health care resources are used effectively. There is evidence of considerable scope to improve the efficiency of resource allocation in the NHS and this may be best achieved by the ‘leverage’ of parsimonious funding. expenditure...|$|E
