5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{wrote that}} some Han thinkers {{believed}} that rain {{fell from the}} Heavens (i.e. where the stars were located). Wang argued that, although rain fell from above, this common theory was false. He agreed with another theory that stated clouds were formed by the evaporation of water on earth, and that since clouds disperse rain, clouds and rain are in fact one and the same; in essence, he accurately described the <b>water</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rain is {{liquid water}} {{in the form of}} {{droplets}} that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then becomes heavy enough to fall under gravity. Rain is a major component of the <b>water</b> <b>cycle</b> and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.|$|E
5|$|Water {{security}} and food security are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four {{times greater than}} the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the <b>water</b> <b>cycle</b> of rivers and lakes, affected their water quality and {{had a significant impact on}} the global <b>water</b> <b>cycle.</b> Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.|$|E

5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the <b>water</b> <b>cycle</b> of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E
5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global <b>water</b> <b>cycle</b> by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{radiation}} is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the <b>water</b> <b>cycle.</b> The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.|$|E

5|$|Water vapor {{generated}} through {{surface evaporation}} is transported by circulatory {{patterns in the}} atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This <b>water</b> <b>cycle</b> is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.|$|E
5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth. That might {{seem to suggest that}} Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid <b>water</b> <b>cycle,</b> conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipality}} {{aims for}} a coherent and holistic {{administration of the}} <b>water</b> <b>cycle</b> to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. The main issues are excessive nutrients, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change, and securing the water supply. These goals have manifested {{in a number of}} large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of sewage treatment plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025 as the treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are scheduled for expansion to take over all waste water treatment. They have already been refitted for biogas production to become net producers of electricity and heat. To aid the new treatment plants, and avoid floodings, sewage and stormwater throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems. Construction began in 2017 in several areas, but it is a long process and is scheduled to be finished by 2085.|$|E
40|$|The carbon (C) and <b>water</b> <b>cycles</b> {{are intimately}} linked in {{terrestrial}} ecosystems. Thus, an understanding o f the processes regulating transfers o f water in terrestrial ecosystems {{requires an understanding}} o f the carbon cycle, and in particular, the factors constraining carbon movement in the soii-piant-atmo sphere continuum and through trophic levels in ecosystems. The linkages between the C and the <b>water</b> <b>cycles</b> are mediated primarily through biological processes, and are bidirectional in nature. For example, precipitation (and hence ecosystem water avaiiabiiity) strongly regulates plant growth and biogeochemicai cycling in soils. Subsequently, plant growth and soil biogeochemistry strongly influence evaporation and atmospheric water vapor (and hence precipitation). Plant growth and soil processes are also cyciicaiiy linked. Thus, plant and soil interactions can have important implications fo r water cycling. However, while major climatic variables (including precipitation) may drive biological patterns and processes at large scales, other ecological interactions also regulate both plant and soil processes. An appreciation o f these ecological factors is important to understanding the relationship between C and water, and to predicting how global environmental change is likely to affect the interactions between the C and <b>water</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{scientific}} study of water and Earth's <b>water</b> <b>cycle</b> is hydrology; hydrodynamics studies the physics of water in motion. The more recent study of the sea in particular is oceanography. This began as {{the study of the}} shape of the ocean's currents but has since expanded into a large and multidisciplinary field: it examines the properties of seawater; studies waves, tides, and currents; charts coastlines and maps the seabeds; and studies marine life. The subfield dealing with the sea's motion, its forces, and the forces acting upon it is known as physical oceanography. Marine biology (biological oceanography) studies the plants, animals, and other organisms inhabiting marine ecosystems. Both are informed by chemical oceanography, which studies the behavior of elements and molecules within the oceans: particularly, at the moment, the ocean's role in the carbon cycle and carbon dioxide's role in the increasing acidification of seawater. Marine and maritime geography charts the shape and shaping of the sea, while marine geology (geological oceanography) has provided evidence of continental drift and the composition and structure of the Earth, clarified the process of sedimentation, and assisted the study of volcanism and earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The sea {{plays a part}} in the <b>water</b> <b>cycle,</b> {{in which}} water evaporates from the ocean, travels through the {{atmosphere}} as vapor, condenses, falls (usually as rain or snow) again, and then largely returns to the sea. Even in the Atacama Desert, where little rain ever falls, dense clouds of fog known as the camanchaca blow in from the sea and support plant life. In large land masses, geologic features can block the access of some regions to the main sea. These endorheic basins, particularly in central Asia, sometimes build up permanent salt lakes as inflowing waters evaporate and their dissolved minerals accumulate over time. The largest of these is the Caspian Sea, although it is sometimes counted as a proper sea owing to its basin of (now-landlocked) oceanic crust. Other notable examples include the Aral Sea in central Asia and the Great Salt Lake in the western United States. The waters of these basins still eventually return to the sea through evaporation, the flow of ground water, and (over geologic time) the opening up of the basins by continental drift.|$|E
5|$|Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is {{the salty}} {{water of the}} oceans and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet. The {{remaining}} freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the <b>water</b> <b>cycle,</b> fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however {{there is still a}} limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for ecosystem services has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world's wetlands have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water. Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.|$|E

40|$|Carbon (C) and <b>water</b> <b>cycles</b> of {{terrestrial}} ecosystems are two coupled ecological processes controlled partly by stomatal behavior. Water-use efficiency (WUE) reflects the coupling relationship to some extent. At stand and ecosystem levels, {{the variability of}} WUE results from the trade-off between water loss and C gain {{in the process of}} plant photosynthetic C assimilation. Continuous observations of C, water, and energy fluxes were made at three selected forest sites of ChinaFLUX with eddy covariance systems from 2003 to 2005. WUE at different temporal scales were defined and calculated with different C and water flux components. Variations in WUE were found among three sites. Average annual WUE was 9. 43 mg CO 2 g(- 1) H 2 O at Changbaishan temperate broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest, 9. 27 mg CO 2 g(- 1) H 2 O at Qianyanzhou subtropical coniferous plantation, and 6. 90 mg CO 2 g(- 1) H 2 O at Dinghushan subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest. It was also found that temperate and subtropical forest ecosystems had different relationships between gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). Variations in WUE indicated the difference in the coupling between C and <b>water</b> <b>cycles.</b> The asynchronous response of GPP and ET to climatic variables determined the coupling and decoupling between C and <b>water</b> <b>cycles</b> for the two regional forest ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The {{dust and}} <b>water</b> <b>cycles</b> are {{critical}} to the current Martian climate, and they {{interact with each other}} through cloud formation. Dust modulates the thermal structure of the atmosphere and thus greatly influences atmospheric circulation. Clouds provide radiative forcing and control the net hemispheric transport of water through the alteration of the vertical distributions of water and dust. Recent advancements in the quality and sophistication of both climate models and observations enable an increased understanding of how the coupling between the dust and <b>water</b> <b>cycles</b> (through cloud formation) impacts the dust and <b>water</b> <b>cycles.</b> We focus here on the effects of clouds on the vertical distributions of dust and water and how those vertical distributions control the net meridional transport of water. We utilize observations of temperature, dust and water ice from the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and the NASA ARC Mars Global Climate Model (MGCM) to show that the magnitude and nature of the hemispheric exchange of water during NH summer is sensitive to the vertical structure of the simulated aphelion cloud belt. Further, we investigate how clouds influence atmospheric temperatures and thus the vertical structure of the cloud belt. Our goal is to isolate and understand the importance of radiative/dynamic feedbacks due to the physical processes involved with cloud formation and evolution on the current climate of Mars...|$|R

40|$|Mars {{atmosphere}} is carbon dioxide dominated with non-negligible {{amounts of water}} vapor and suspended dust particles. The atmospheric dust {{plays an important role}} in the heating and cooling of the planet through absorption and emission of radiation. Small dust particles can potentially be carried to great altitudes and affect the temperatures there. Water vapor condensing onto the dust grains can affect the radiative properties of both, as well as their vertical extent. The condensation of water onto a dust grain will change the grain s fall speed and diminish the possibility of dust obtaining high altitudes. In this capacity, water becomes a controlling agent with regard to the vertical distribution of dust. Similarly, the atmosphere s water vapor holding capacity is affected by the amount of dust in the atmosphere. Dust is an excellent green house catalyst; it raises the temperature of the atmosphere, and thus, its water vapor holding capacity. There is, therefore, a potentially significant interplay between the Martian dust and <b>water</b> <b>cycles.</b> Previous research done using global, 3 -D computer modeling to better understand the Martian atmosphere treat the dust and the <b>water</b> <b>cycles</b> as two separate and independent processes. The existing Ames numerical model will be employed to simulate the relationship between the Martian dust and <b>water</b> <b>cycles</b> by actually coupling the two <b>cycles.</b> <b>Water</b> will condense onto the dust, allowing the particle's radiative characteristics, fall speeds, and as a result, their vertical distribution to change.
