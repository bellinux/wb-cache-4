25|$|D. sylvestris is also {{affected}} by parasites {{that influence the}} individual. These include both fungi and roundworms. In particular, the fungus Paecilomyces farinosus and the mermithid roundworm, Pheromermis pachysoma are known to parasitize the tree wasp. P. farinosus most often infects wasps and nests after death and therefore does not majorly influence {{the health of the}} colony. P. pachysoma typically infects flies and other insects when the roundworm eggs are eaten. The parasites then hatch in the insects and infects the wasp when the infected insects are fed to the wasp larvae. These roundworms usually do not kill the infected wasp but grow in their abdomen and can cause sexuals to become sterile. This has a negative impact on the individual as they are not able to reproduce and pass their genes on to the next generation. However, this is not likely to {{have a major impact on}} the colony since most <b>worker</b> <b>eggs</b> are policed and the queens typically only have a single mate.|$|E
25|$|In {{the tree}} wasp, {{as in other}} Hymenoptera species, males are {{produced}} from unfertilized haploid eggs, while females are from fertilized diploid eggs. This is a method of sex determination known as haplodiploidy. This leads to sisters having a relatedness of 0.75 because all sperm produced are identical and they receive half of their mother’s genes while brothers have a relatedness of 0.5. However, the diploid mother is related by 0.5 to both sons and daughters. In these species, there is often conflict between the queen and workers over the sex ratio because workers are more related to sisters then either brothers or their own daughters, meaning they want to push the sex ratio {{so that there are}} more females than males. At the same time it is most beneficial for the queen to keep the ratio 1:1 because she is equally related to both. The tree wasp police the male eggs laid by workers to keep the ratio more in favor of females, but they rarely interfere with the queens eggs. It is likely that this species is only able to distinguish queen eggs from <b>worker</b> <b>eggs,</b> but is unable to distinguish male and female eggs. As such, there is too much of a risk of destroying female eggs to interfere with queen laid eggs. This helps to keep the worker-queen conflict under control.|$|E
50|$|The life of all {{honey bees}} starts as an egg, which is laid by the queen {{in the bottom}} of a wax cell in the brood area of a hive. A <b>worker</b> <b>egg</b> hatches after three days into a larva. Nurse bees feed it royal jelly at first, then pollen and honey for six days. It then becomes an {{inactive}} pupa.|$|R
50|$|The queen briefly {{inspects}} {{the cell}} before inserting her metasoma. Usually, if a <b>worker</b> <b>egg</b> is found, it is eaten by the queen. The duration of queen oviposition is notably longer than worker oviposition, lasting {{an average of}} 24.5 seconds. After the queen has deposited an egg, there is usually a slight delay in M. quadrifasciata workers before operculation, or closing of the cell, occurs.|$|R
50|$|When a cell {{has been}} completed, the queen will fixate {{on the cell}} for {{inspection}} and push away workers from the cell. A worker will provision food into the cell and quickly escape. Sometimes, when the queen is not around, a worker will lay an egg in the cell and quickly escape from the area similar to when provisioning cells. During <b>worker</b> oviposition, or <b>egg</b> laying, the <b>worker</b> will be quiet with her wings closed and keep her body completely still as not to attract the queen. Worker oviposition will last an average of 7 seconds. A <b>worker's</b> <b>egg</b> is about 2/3 the size of eggs laid by the queen.|$|R
25|$|The colony cycle for D. sylvestris is {{typically}} about 3.5 months and occurs from May through August or September. Colonies are often initiated in mid-May {{by a single}} queen who quickly begins building the nest, and laying eggs in the cells as she builds. She often completes three envelopes in a single week. These workers take about 2.5 to 3.5 weeks to develop to adults from eggs. About 40 <b>worker</b> <b>eggs</b> are produced in the nest at this stage, but some do not mature fully due to limitations in resources provided by the queen. After this stage, known as the queen colony, comes the stage where small cells are built and more workers and the first males are reared. This stage goes on for a few weeks, typically until late June. Around this time, construction of large cells that house the rearing process of queens and more males begins. These individuals emerge as adults around mid-July. The colony develops until {{around the end of}} August at which time all of the sexuals (reproducing males and queens) have left and the original queen is dead. The social structure of the nest now collapses and the workers that remain typically die soon due to starvation or old age. The queens that leave go into hibernation and begin new colonies the following May. In a single mature tree wasp colony there is an average of nearly 800 cells in the nest and a total of 400 small cell adults and 300 large cell adults.|$|E
50|$|She fertilizes each egg (with stored sperm {{from the}} spermatheca) {{as it is}} laid in a worker-sized cell. Eggs laid in drone-sized (larger) cells are left unfertilized; these unfertilized eggs, with half as many genes as queen or <b>worker</b> <b>eggs,</b> develop into drones.|$|E

5000|$|Queen pheromones {{are among}} the most {{important}} chemical messages regulating insect societies but are yet to be isolated. [...] in natural colonies of the Saxon wasp, Dolichovespula saxonica, queens emit reliable chemical cues of their true fertility, but as the queen's signals decrease incidences of worker reproduction increases. In colonies of Bombus terrestris, the queen can control oogenesis and <b>worker</b> <b>egg</b> laying by regulating concentrations of juvenile hormone (JH) in workers. This is likely achieved through queen pheromones.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In most ants, bees, and wasps, {{the workers}} are capable of {{challenging}} the reproductive monopoly of the queen by laying unfertilized, male eggs. An important mechanism that can resolve this conflict is policing, whereby the queen or workers prevent successful worker reproduction by selectively eating worker-laid eggs or by attacking egglaying <b>workers.</b> <b>Egg</b> policing by <b>workers</b> has been shown Electronic supplementary material The online {{version of this article}} (doi: 10. 1007 /s 10886 - 011 - 0055 - 9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users...|$|R
50|$|Reproductive {{suppression}} {{is often}} used in social insect colonies by queens to maintain a genetic monopoly of the offspring in the nest. Some species suppress <b>worker</b> <b>egg</b> laying through pheromones and chemical control. However, in Xylocopa pubescens, the dominant female of the nest suppresses reproduction of any other females in the nest by preventing them access to the cell in the tunnels of the nest necessary for eggs. The only way that another female in the nest can reproduce is if she takes over the nest by force, or leaves to either take over another nest or found her own.|$|R
50|$|While {{the queen}} in a T. angustula hive will lay {{most of the}} eggs in a brood, some workers also {{have the ability to}} develop and lay eggs. Unlike {{reproductive}} eggs, these <b>worker</b> <b>eggs</b> do not have a reticulum and thus develop into males. The worker queen conflict arises over competition to lay eggs in the fixed number of cells in the nest. When the queen produces more eggs, there will be more workers to build more cells, and the workers will be able to lay an egg in the open cells. However the queen lays eggs irregularly throughout the year so the number of cells fluctuates.|$|E
50|$|Destroying eggs {{such that}} only one female's eggs survive is {{documented}} in cooperatively breeding birds such as acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus). About 25% of acorn woodpecker groups contain two or more joint-nesting females that cooperate to raise young, but cooperative female destroy each other's eggs prior to laying their own. These eggs are eaten by {{other members of the}} group, including the mother.In Cape honeybees (Apis mellifera capensis) the multiple mating of the queen and existence of half-siblings creates sub-families within the colony. Sometimes the queen fails to control worker reproduction. In response workers remove eggs laid by other workers leading to less than 1% of offspring being worker laid. Worker Policing of <b>worker</b> <b>eggs</b> occurs in the European hornet (Vespa crabo) honeybees and wasps.|$|E
50|$|Sex is {{determined}} through controlled fertilization of eggs. Drones are the fertilizers {{of the nest}} and will only fertilize the eggs laid by {{the queen of the}} colony. These fertilized eggs are heterozygous with complementary sex-determining loci and will always become female. Since drones do not fertilize the worker bees, the <b>worker</b> <b>eggs</b> are haploid, and they produce male offspring. However, workers are not always laying eggs. Thus, male production is limited to certain periods of time (see Male Production). While the workers of S. postica produce approximately 95% of all males, the queen still produces that remaining 5% of males. The queen will release some haploid eggs among her main diploid eggs. However, after the queen has produced a certain small number of male offspring, she will revert to producing females only.|$|E
50|$|Workers police each other's eggs. 88.5% of queens eggs {{survive to}} {{hatching}} vs 1.4% of worker’s. Worker reproduction is frequent in queen-right colonies {{in which the}} queen is alive. Both queen and <b>workers</b> replaced <b>workers</b> <b>eggs.</b> P. chinensis was studied alongside Polistes snelleni for comparison in this conflict. In P. snelleni, queens monopolize egg production. Queens contributed 2.4 times more to replacing than workers. Workers sequentially perform oophagy and oviposition in the same cells. The ratio of worker-produced eggs to eggs laid by the queen is 3 or 4 times to one in a colony having between 100 and 500 wasps.|$|R

50|$|Brood patternLaying <b>workers</b> lay <b>eggs</b> {{that lack}} the queen's egg {{recognition}} pheromone, meaning that other workers may remove the eggs. This {{results in a}} spotty brood pattern, in which empty cells are scattered heavily through capped brood.|$|R
5000|$|Inevitably, {{the queen}} begins to falter, and the bees decide {{to replace her}} by {{creating}} a new queen {{from one of her}} <b>worker</b> <b>eggs.</b> They may do this because she has been damaged (lost a leg or an antenna), because she has run out of sperm and cannot lay fertilized eggs (has become a [...] "drone laying queen"), or because her pheromones have dwindled to where they cannot control all the bees in the hive. At this juncture, the bees produce one or more queen cells by modifying existing worker cells that contain a normal female egg. They then pursue one of two ways to replace the queen: supersedure, replacing or superseding the queen without swarming, or swarm cell production, dividing the hive into two colonies through swarming.|$|E
5000|$|The genetic {{relatedness}} of individuals {{depends on the}} egg. The <b>worker</b> <b>eggs</b> are hemizygous, only containing genetic information from the worker. Thus, all offspring from one worker are genetically identical, also known as [...] "full sisters". The fertilized eggs of the queen contain genetic information from the queen and {{from one of the}} up to 6 mates of the female. This increases the genetic variance in the offspring. Furthermore, the drones mating with the queen are unrelated to her due to drifting of drones between colonies. This decreases the {{genetic relatedness}} between fertilized offspring.The overall genetic relatedness within a colony for S. postica is between approximately [...]70 and [...]85, averaging around [...]80. This suggests that while mainly workers produce males, queens also produce male offspring, not entirely losing in the conflict between workers and queens for male production.|$|E
50|$|Conflict {{exists between}} the {{egg-laying}} females in the colony. Workers can only produce males while the queen can produce females and males. Workers lay their eggs in cells after the queen has laid hers setting up a larval competition. <b>Worker</b> <b>eggs</b> are larger, more rounded, and laid on the upper inside wall of cells. If the queen does not re-check the cells, the eggs of the workers will produce males. However, if other workers or the queen checks on a cell and sees the unfertilized egg, they will eat it. This shows a competition between the egg-laying females of the colony. Furthermore, there is conflict between the larvae of both the worker and the queen. If there are two eggs in a cell, the larvae from the worker egg will develop more rapidly and devour that of the queen egg. The reciprocal has not been observed.|$|E

25|$|Nests of eusocial Hymenoptera {{including}} D. sylvestris {{often have}} conflict between {{workers and the}} queen over production of male eggs. Male eggs can be produced by workers that do not mate because these male eggs {{do not need to}} be fertilized. Both queen and worker share more genes with their own sons than each other’s so they benefit more from producing their own eggs. In nests of tree wasps about half of the male <b>eggs</b> are <b>worker</b> produced so there is the potential for a high level of worker-queen conflict. To help decrease this conflict, eggs that are produced by workers are destroyed in a process known as <b>worker</b> policing.

50|$|The main host of {{this species}} in Europe is D. saxonica {{but it will also}} {{parasitise}} D. norwegica. This species produces no <b>workers,</b> the <b>eggs</b> laid in the host's nest produce queens and males which are nurtured by the workers of the host species.|$|R

50|$|The rate of egg {{production}} fluctuates throughout the colony cycle. In May, the median egg count {{is greater than}} in early June. The yearly maximum point for the egg count occurs in July; {{egg production}} then decreases steadily to zero by September. Once the first brood of <b>worker</b> <b>eggs</b> has been laid, the queen decreases her rate of oviposition as this brood matures. Once they are mature, the queen stops laying eggs. In late June and July, the queen recommences laying eggs and her rate of oviposition increases once more. If the queen is killed, removed, or dies, workers can take over the responsibility of oviposition. In fact, 22% of an emerging brood comes from eggs that were not laid by the initial queen. Surprisingly, the final period of decreasing oviposition rate is not due to old age or mortality of the queen. It is actually due to ovarian diapause that occurs throughout the entire female population of the colony.|$|E
50|$|B. ternarius, as well {{as other}} members of the Bombus genus, live in eusocial colonies in which the {{individuals}} in the group act as a single multiorganismal superorganism. Eusociality may have evolved in the bumblebee ancestor as a result of offspring remaining in the nest as adults to help rear their mother's young. The evolution of eusociality can be explained by Hamilton's inclusive fitness theory. The mostly sterile workers forage for food {{and take care of the}} colony's needs, while the queen is in charge of reproducing and creating new generations of workers. Toward the end of the colony lifecycle, workers jostle the queen, eat her eggs, and attempt to lay eggs of their own. The workers are not completely sterile, despite their inability to mate, since they have ovaries. <b>Worker</b> <b>eggs</b> always develop into males. The queen usually retaliates by acting aggressively toward the workers and trying to eat the workers’ eggs. However, the queen's retaliation proves insufficient in some cases and the aggressive reproductive bumblebee workers kill her.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharaoh ant}} queen can lay {{hundreds}} of eggs in her lifetime. Most lay 10 to 12 eggs per batch {{in the early}} days of egg production and only four to seven eggs per batch later. At 27°C (80°F) and 80 percent relative humidity, eggs hatch in five to seven days. The larval period is 18 to 19 days, pre-pupal period three days and pupal period nine days. About four more days are required to produce sexual female and male forms. From egg to sexual maturity, it takes the pharaoh ant about 38 to 45 days, depending on temperature and relative humidity.
