5|$|Feminist economists' work on {{globalization}} is diverse and multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} globalization affects <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.|$|E

25|$|Some women self-select out {{of higher}} status positions, {{choosing}} instead {{to have more}} time to spend at home and with their families. According to Sarah Damaske, this choice is often made because high status positions do not allow time for the heavy domestic workload that many women expect to take on due to the gendered division of labor in the home.

25|$|A {{prolific}} writer, Rebecca Harding Davis {{is credited}} with over 500 published works. Despite her outpouring of literary works, she was almost entirely forgotten {{by the time of}} her death in 1910. However, Davis was rediscovered in the very early 1970s by the feminist writer Tillie Olsen, who found a collection of Davis's works in a junk shop. Olsen quickly recognized the talent and significance of Davis's writings, and personally endeavored to reintroduce Davis's work. In 1972, The Feminist Press published Life in the Iron Mills with Olsen's own biographical interpretation of Davis's life in relation to a selection of her published works. Olsen's non-fiction volume, titled Silences, was an analysis of authors' silent periods in literature, including writer's blocks, unpublished work, and the problems that working-class writers, and <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> have in finding the time to concentrate on their art, and {{the second part of the}} book was a study of the work of Davis.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{individuals}} may actually {{find it easier}} to escape situations of abuse in the United States than they would have in their countries of origin. Among some immigrants there is much criticism {{of the way in which}} <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> have been changed by American culture. Women may be seen as too Americanized because of the way they dress or their lack of deference to men. The general support for gender equality within American society can undermine traditional power hierarchies within the family in which men had control over the actions of women. One of the ways that such power is undermined is through the presence of laws against domestic violence. In some patriarchal societies, husbands may have complete control over their wives, including control over their bodies. U.S. laws do not support this sort of arrangement and women who are aware of their rights can utilize formal legal institutions to combat such gender imbalances within the family. The ability of government authorities to intervene in the realm of the family can undermine the traditional power balance and leave men feeling dispossessed.|$|E

500|$|Though {{television}} did {{not begin}} to use recurring homosexual characters until the late 1980s, some early situation comedies used a stock character that author Stephen Tropiano calls [...] "gay-straight": supporting characters who were quirky, did not comply with gender norms, or had ambiguous personal lives, that [...] "for all purposes should be gay". These included Zelda from The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, Miss Hathaway from The Beverly Hillbillies, and Jo from The Facts of Life. In the mid-1980s through the 1990s, sitcoms frequently employed a [...] "coming out" [...] episode, where a friend {{of one of the}} stars admits she is a lesbian, forcing the cast to deal with the issue.

Her work was mainly with poor women, many of whom lived in unsanitary conditions and had inadequate diets. The social mores of the time often kept young women ignorant of matters dealing with sex and pregnancy.

500|$|In the mid-1930s Knight befriended {{and painted}} groups of Gypsies at the Epsom and Ascot racecourses.

500|$|The {{conflict}} between {{the culture of the}} Alds and that of Ansul features through the story. The Alds emphasize their perceived cultural superiority to control the city, a practice commentators have described as common in colonialism. The movement of <b>women,</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> is very restricted: Memer and Gry must dress as men in order to roam the streets. Yet the prejudices of the Alds also allow Gry and Memer to subvert their laws: Gry suggests that because the Alds see women and [...] "unbelievers" [...] as inferior, they will be unable to recognize her for what she is. The supposed superiority of the Alds' beliefs affects Memer as well. As a child she ventures into {{the far end of the}} secret room, where the Oracle books are kept, and sees one of them oozing blood. Though she tries to rationalize her fear away by likening it to the Alds' fear of books, she also questions her own position as the reader of the Oracle, asking Sulter whether there are in fact demons within the room, as the Alds maintain.|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} effort to give women {{the right to}} vote in all non-federal {{elections}} attempted to amend the state constitution. It passed by both houses of the state legislature in 1881; however, the bill failed to pass in the next legislative session in 1883 as state law required. Temperance efforts fared little better. In 1881 the Indiana chapter of the WCTU, along with organizations participating in the Indiana Grand Council of Temperance, successfully lobbied the Indiana General Assembly to pass an amendment to the state constitution to prohibit the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages in the state, but the Indiana Liquor League and a Democratic majority in the state legislature killed the bill in the legislative session in 1883. Following these legislative defeats women's suffrage and prohibition became sensitive issues in local politics as the Democrats rallied the opposition. In German strongholds such as Fort Wayne, opposition to prohibition and women's suffrage was strong until World War I. As one historian notes, [...] "within German working-class family traditions, <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> were sharply defined in terms of family responsibilities. Suffrage and women's rights ran counter to deep social and religious traditions that placed women in a subservient relationship to men." [...] Renewed interest in women's suffrage did not occur {{until the end of the}} century, while prohibition crusaders continued to press for legislative action.|$|E
500|$|The Cassandra Cain {{version of}} Batgirl, {{depicted}} as a biracial character (Half White and half Chinese), is notable {{as one of the}} most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comic books. Jeffrey A. Brown states that while her ethnicity is rarely mentioned in the comic books, Asian women have had a long history in comics of being portrayed as martial artists and are often exploited as sex objects. However, in the case of Batgirl, [...] "Cassandra's racial identity is treated more implicitly than explicitly. Her costume design actually conceals her entire body so that while in her guise as Batgirl her ethnicity is completely unapparent." [...] The fact that her sexuality is also understated represents a shift away from the typical portrayals of women, and Asian <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular.</b> The most controversial aspect of her character came about during the One Year Later event, when she is reintroduced as a villain. The abrupt shift in her character brought about negative criticism from readership. When questioned about the change in characterization, writer Adam Beechen stated: [...] "They didn't present me with a rationale as to why Cassandra was going to change, or a motivating factor. That was left for me to come up with and them to approve. And we did that. But as far as to why the editors and writers and whoever else made the decision decided that was a good direction, I honestly couldn't answer." ...|$|E
