The InP ridge structures that contain the wires are selectively grown by chemical beam epitaxy (CBE) on pre-patterned InP substrates.

40|$|Yarn-based supercapacitors have {{received}} considerable attention recently, offering unprecedented opportunities for future wearable electronic devices (e. g., smart clothes). However, {{the reliability and}} lifespan of yarn-based supercapacitors can be seriously limited by accidental mechanical damage during practical applications. Therefore, a supercapacitor endowed with mechanically and electrically self-healing properties is a brilliant solution to the challenge. Compared with the conventional planar-like or large wire-like structure, the reconnection of the broken yarn electrode composed of multiple tiny fibers (diameter < 20 m) {{is much more difficult}} and challenging, which directly affects the restoration of electrical conductivity after damage. Herein, a self-healable yarn-based supercapacitor that ensures the reconnection of broken electrodes has been successfully developed by <b>wrapping</b> magnetic <b>electrodes</b> around a self-healing polymer shell. The strong force from magnetic attraction between the broken yarn electrodes benefits reconnection of fibers in the yarn electrodes during self-healing and thus offers an effective strategy for the restoration of electric conductivity, whereas the polymer shell recovers the configuration integrity and mechanical strength. With the design, the specific capacitance of our prototype can be restored up to 71. 8 % even after four breaking/healing cycles with great maintenance of the whole devices mechanical properties.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{implanted}} vagal nerve stimulators is growing {{and the need}} for removal or revision of the devices will become even more frequent. A significant concern about Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) therapy is the presence of the spiral stimulating <b>electrodes,</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the nerve, once treatment is considered ineffective or is no longer desired. Our purpose is to demonstrate the feasibility of complete removal and replacement of the vagal nerve stimulator electrodes using microsurgical technique even after a long period, without damaging the nerve. We attempted removal and replacement of spiral stimulating electrodes from a patient who received a 10 -year long VNS therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy. Our results indicate that the spiral electrodes may be safely removed from the vagus nerve, even after several years. The reversibility of lead implantation may enhance the attractiveness of VNS therapy. Furthermore, with a correct microsurgical technique, it is possible to respect the normal anatomy and functionality of vagal nerve and to reimplant a new VNS system with all its components, maintaining the same therapeutic efficacy after many years...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates novel {{electrical}} nanowire characterization {{tools and}} devices. Conventional characterization methods, long available to bulk semiconductor samples, have been adapted {{and transferred to}} the nanowire geometry. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes the development of Hall effect measurements, an entirely new characterization tool for nanowires. It is shown that Hall effect measurements can be performed on InP core-shell nanowires using a self-aligned lifting layer. By combining experimental data with results from simulations of band diagrams and current distribution under the influence of a magnetic field, the carrier density in the n-type nanowire shell can be determined. We found that the nanowire shell exhibits a doping gradient {{along the length of the}} nanowire. This doping inhomogeneity is important to account for and engineer when making devices using InP nanowires. The second part of the thesis demonstrates how capacitance-voltage measurements can be performed on arrays of InAs nanowires. Using a novel device structure, the capacitance signal from the nanowires can be distinguished from parasitic capacitances. A model was developed to simulate the capacitance-voltage behavior of the nanowires and was fitted to the experimental data to extract the doping concentration. Furthermore, the hysteresis observed in the capacitance-voltage sweeps was used to calculate the trap density close to the InAs-HfO 2 dielectric interface. Finally, studies of gate effects in nanowires are presented. We demonstrate how the gating efficiency is improved by means of wrapped or semiwrapped gates on nanowires. Field-effect transistors made from InP nanowires are described that exhibit both ambipolar behavior and gating efficiency only 13 % lower than the theoretical limit. These properties were used to fabricate a field-effect diode, a device in which a p-n junction is formed without any doping incorporation in the active region. We also demonstrate how nanowires positioned laterally on a substrate can be equipped with a fully <b>wrapped</b> gate <b>electrode.</b> This device was developed as part of a platform to perform basic research in which a uniform gating effect is desired...|$|R

The objective for my MS Thesis {{was to develop}} a stable electrical stimulation and recording preparation for the vagus nerve in guinea pigs so that ultrasound stimulation on this pathway can be studied robustly. In particular, the plan was to electrically stimulate the vagus nerve and characterize the response patterns (i. e., different components and peaks of the evoked compound action potential corresponding to different subpopulation of fibers) using <b>electrodes</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the nerve. Ultrasound stimulation of the vagus nerve can then be performed and the corresponding response patterns can be compared with those caused by electrical stimulation to assess how ultrasound is activating the vagus nerve. Ultrasound stimulation will also be performed while electrically stimulating the vagus nerve to assess suppressive or modulatory effects of ultrasound. To further demonstrate proof-of-concept of US neuromodulation in a simplified preparation, I assessed how ultrasound stimulation with electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve modulates the heart rate in guinea pigs. The long term goal is to develop a non-invasive method for modulating vagus nerve activity that can have clinical applications for treating inflammatory disorders, seizures, depression, tinnitus, and other conditions that may be modulated by the vagus nerve...|$|R
40|$|Pneumococcal {{otitis media}} is most {{frequent}} {{in young children}} and {{is a matter of}} concern in cochlear implantation. In the course of the 'implantation surgery the physiological barrier between the middle ear and inner ear is broken down by incising the round window membrane or by fenestration of the cochlear wall. It is feared that the insertion of an electrode array into the scala tympani could provide a pathway for microorganisms and toxins to enter the cochlea, resulting in labyrinthitis. To assess the actual risk of, secondary inner ear infection post implantation we developed a cat animal model of otitis media. In addition we examined the, effectiveness of different sealing strategies compared to the alternative of leaving the electrode entry point unprotected. For sealing of the cochlea fibrous tissue or gelatine foam was <b>wrapped</b> around the <b>electrode</b> in the round window niche. 22 kittens (44 ears) were used for this study 32, ears were implanted at 2 months of age, and all 44 ears were inoculated after 2 months with a broth of, streptococcus pneumoniae and the animals sacrificed one week later. The bullae of the animals were swabbed and the cochleas processed and examined under light microscopy. Histological analysis of the cochleas showed,the� highest incidence (45 %) of labyrinthine spread of infection in the unimplanted control group. Suppurative or serous labyrinthitis was found in only one third (33. 3 %) of the implanted and unsealed cochleas. In contrast only one of 16 sealed cochleas, (6. 2 %) showed labyrinthine signs of acute inflammation. Experimental pneumococcal otitis media could be reliably established in all animals and proved to be a valuable animal model for the testing of the intracochlear spread of infection. We conclude that a cochlear implant electrode inserted via the round window does not increase the risk of tympanogenic abyrinthitis. Our results indicate that grafting of the electrode entry point results in significant protection of the inner ear against labyrinthine spread of ototis media along the leadwire of the cochlear implant. 24 - 27 SeptemberOpen Acces...|$|R
40|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO), {{more than}} 50 {{million people in}} Bangladesh drink arsenic-laden water, making it the largest case of mass {{poisoning}} in human history. Many methods of arsenic removal (mostly using chemical adsorbents) have been studied, {{but most of these}} are too expensive and impractical to be implemented in poor countries such as Bangladesh. This project investigates ElectroChemical Arsenic Remediation (ECAR) as an affordable means of removing arsenic. Experiments were performed on site in Bangladesh using a prototype termed “sushi”. This device consists of carbon steel sheets that serve as <b>electrodes</b> <b>wrapped</b> into a cylinder, separated by plastic mesh and surrounded by a tube-like container that serves as a holding cell in which the water is treated electrochemically. During the electrochemical process, current is applied to both electrodes causing iron to oxidize to various forms of iron (hydr) oxides. These species bind to arsenic(V) with very high affi nity. ECAR also has the advantage that As(III), the more toxic form of arsenic, oxidizes to As(V) in situ. Only As(V) is known to complex with iron (hydr) oxides. One of the main objectives of this research is to demonstrate the ability of the new prototype to reduce arsenic concentrations in Bangladesh groundwater from > 200 ppb to below the WHO limit of 10 ppb. In addition, varying fl ow rate and dosage and the effect on arsenic removal was investigated. Experiments showed that ECAR reduced Bangladeshi water with an initial arsenic concentration as high as 250 ppb to below 10 ppb. ECAR proved to be effective at dosages as high as 810 Coulombs/Liter (C/L) and as low as 386 C/L (current 1 A, voltage 12 V). These results are encouraging and provide great promise that ECAR is an effi cient method in the remediation of arsenic from contaminated groundwater. A preliminary investigation of arsenic removal trends with varying Coulombic dosage, complexation time and fi ltration methods is also presented...|$|R
40|$|Lithium ion {{batteries}} (LIBs) play {{an essential}} role in modern life. Although relatively unknown throughout past decades, LIBs have supplanted several categories of chemically rechargeable batteries including lead-acid, nickel-cadmium and nickel-hydrogen batteries. Nowadays, LIBs dominate the market of portable electronic devices such as mobile phones, digital cameras and laptops. As the price of petroleum keeps increasing, electrically powered or assisted vehicles using LIBs are similarly gaining in the automotive market. However, current state-of-art LIBs using graphite as their electrical anode and Li metal oxides as the cathode are facing major challenges. For example, the current LIBs are approaching their capacity limit. Batteries that can maintain high charge and discharge rates are in great demand, which has not been adequately addressed by modern LIBs. Safety issues with these current batteries are being reported even from some market leaders such as Boeing and Tesla. Herein, several categories of novel anode materials have been investigated in a search for promising candidates to enable evolution of the next generation of lithium ion batteries. This research included silicon-carbon based materials, especially silicon-graphene (Si-G) materials and their derivatives, and transitional metal based materials, e. g., cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4). In this proposed work, Si-G composites were synthesized via a freeze-drying method; the conditions of the synthesis were controlled and adjusted to obtain a Si-G composite with the most promising morphology as well as battery performance. Based on preliminary results, graphene <b>wrapped</b> silicon <b>electrodes</b> showed significantly improved cycling performance than bare silicon electrodes. At high charge and discharge rates it was found that Si-G composites also showed superior stability and capacity retention over bare silicon electrodes. After 200 cycles, the optimized Si-G composite maintained a capacity retention close to 100 %, with a capacity of 800 mAh g- 1 at a 0. 2 C rate and 600 mAh g- 1 at a 1 C rate. This observation was a prominent increase from the performance of commercial graphite-based batteries at a theoretical capacity 372 mAh g- 1. Considering the facile fabrication method and increasing use of commercial silicon nano-particles (Si-NPs) into account, Si-G composites could be a promising candidate for the anode material in LIBs. Extended work on the Si-G project also involved further decorations based on the Si-G composite synthesized from the method previously mentioned, as well as improvement on the synthesis method to make it more applicable for industrial purposes. Cobalt Oxide (Co 3 O 4), a transitional metal oxide which has a theoretical capacity of 890 mAh g- 1, draws attention as an anode material in LIBs due to its capacity compared to graphite and heavily reduced degradation compared to silicon. A novel electrode fabrication procedure was adopted in this research together with a simple material-synthesizing methodology. Similar to common silicon electrodes, Co 3 O 4 suffers from poor electron conductivity volume change upon cycling. Herein the Co 3 O 4 active material is directly deposited on stainless steel mesh, serving as both a current collector and a substrate for the active material. Through adapting the electrode fabrication process by directly depositing on the stainless steel electron conductor, the traditional conductive carbon material and binder requirements can be avoided. As a result, the process is reduced in both cost and complexity. The presented novel electrode design facilitates both ion diffusion and electron transportation, improving the overall performance of the material in LIBs. After 100 cycles of charge and discharge, Co 3 O 4 on stainless steel mesh shows a capacity around 770 mAh g- 1, which is more than twice that of graphite. The capacity retention was around 90 % in this case. 4 month...|$|R
