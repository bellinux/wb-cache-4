5000|$|The school badge depicts paschal lamb {{supporting}} a cross atop {{a strip of}} blue and white <b>wavy</b> <b>lines.</b> In itself atop a shield decorated with blue and white <b>wavy</b> <b>lines.</b> The {{top half of the}} emblem (the lamb on the strip of blue and white <b>wavy</b> <b>lines)</b> is borrowed from the crest of the London Borough of Lambeth in which the school was situated. The only difference being that the Lambeth crest has a Pennon flowing from the cross, whereas Tulse Hill School's emblem has no pennon. The lower half (shield decorated with blue and white <b>wavy</b> <b>lines)</b> is the bottom half of London County Council's Arms. The blue and white <b>wavy</b> <b>lines</b> represent the River Thames (with which the Borough has considerable frontage); the paschal lamb with cross has always formed part of the seal of Lambeth (be it the late Vestry or the Borough Council), and in heraldic terms is a [...] "canting" [...] or punning reference to the name of the Borough.|$|R
5000|$|All the printings of {{the essays}} and the stamps of [...] "large Hermes head" [...] {{have the first}} <b>wavy</b> <b>line</b> broken at their base in the north-west {{spandrel}}.It's also {{the case for the}} tenth <b>wavy</b> <b>line</b> of the same spandrel (see the illustration below).|$|R

50|$|Dotted <b>wavy</b> <b>line</b> {{pottery and}} fishing {{cultures}} {{have also been}} located in the Lake Turkana region in poorly dated contexts. By 3,000 BCE, {{it does not appear}} that the Turkana Basin was populated with harpoon and dotted <b>wavy</b> <b>line</b> pottery users, but fishing remained an important part of peoples' diets into the late Holocene.|$|R

40|$|Wilson loops {{which are}} small {{deviations}} from straight, infinite <b>lines,</b> called <b>wavy</b> <b>lines,</b> are {{considered in the}} context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. A single <b>wavy</b> <b>line</b> and the connected correlation function of a straight and <b>wavy</b> <b>line</b> are considered. It is argued that, to leading order in ``waviness'', the functional form of the loop is universal and the coefficient, which is a function of the 't Hooft coupling, is found in weak coupling perturbation theory and the strong coupling limit using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Supersymmetric arguments are used to simplify the computation and to show that the straight line obeys the Migdal-Makeenko loop equation...|$|R

The logo depicts a house and waterwheel above a <b>wavy</b> <b>line</b> and was designed by Cosmas Kösters from Kirchheim in a school competition. The <b>wavy</b> <b>line</b> symbolizes the Eckbach, the stylized house with a water wheel represents a mill.|$|R
5000|$|In {{most modern}} musical notation, a trill is {{generally}} indicated {{with the letters}} [...] (or sometimes simply [...] ) above the trilled note. This has sometimes been followed by a <b>wavy</b> <b>line,</b> and sometimes, in the baroque and early classical periods, the <b>wavy</b> <b>line</b> was used on its own.

40|$|As I get older, I seem to {{have more}} {{problems}} reading words I have written quickly, as sequences like 2 ̆ 2 muvuw 2 ̆ 2 become just one <b>wavy</b> <b>line.</b> I wondered what was the longest word that I would represent as a <b>wavy</b> <b>line,</b> {{and what was the}} longest wavy-line sequence as part of a word. The letters involved are those with no ascendents or descenders, i. e. aceimnorsuvwxzs. (Actually, I write 2 ̆ 7 z 2 ̆ 7 with a descender, but that 2 ̆ 7 s not how it 2 ̆ 7 s printed.) The 2 ̆ 7 i 2 ̆ 7 is included despite the giveaway dot because, in hurried writing, the dot appears in a rather random position above the <b>wavy</b> <b>line,</b> giving a false clue...|$|R
