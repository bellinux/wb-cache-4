2500|$|On immigration, Carswell {{appears to}} favour {{moderate}} levels of immigration based on skill and work-capacity. Shortly after joining UKIP, Carswell wrote on his blog: [...] "On {{the subject of}} immigration, let me make it absolutely clear: I'm not against immigration. The one thing more ugly than nativism is angry nativism." [...] He has also said: [...] "We should welcome those that <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to contribute ... There's hardly a hospital, GP surgery or supermarket {{in the country that}} could run without that skill and drive." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2008 Ehud Barak, the Israeli defense minister and former prime minister said that [...] "Jews {{know that they can}} land on their feet in any corner of the world. The real test for us is to make Israel such an attractive place—cutting edge in science, education, culture, quality of life— that even American Jewish young people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here.</b> If we cannot do this, even those who were born here will consciously decide to go to other places. This is a real problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having played what is {{generally}} considered their debut first-class match against Lancashire in 1882, Somerset were stripped of their first-class status following the 1885 season, after a string of heavy losses and matches {{in which they could}} not field eleven men. [...] Meetings were held at Somerset, and Henry Murray-Anderdon took over as secretary of the club. [...] Under his leadership, the club acquired a ground in Taunton, variously known as the 'Athletic Ground' and 'Rack Field'. [...] The land was extensively worked on until Murray-Anderdon announced that [...] "opponents will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> and play". [...] In addition to improving the ground, the secretary targeted the universities to add talent to the team, and added two professional bowlers, George Nichols and Ted Tyler.|$|E

6000|$|... "Where is this?" [...] he rasped {{through his}} parched throat. [...] "It's a damn farm {{in an old}} field. What'd you bring me here for--say?

6000|$|... "Yes, I know. She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> and I mean to {{have her}} before the long {{vacation}} for a little while.

2500|$|On June 8, 2014, Jerad and Amanda Miller {{killed two}} Las Vegas police {{officers}} and a civilian before Amanda Miller took her life. Jerad Miller was fatally wounded and died during a shootout with police. During the attacks, they shouted [...] "this is a revolution", and they covered {{the bodies of the}} officers in a Gadsden flag and left a copy of a manifesto bearing a swastika. Their original plan may have been to take over a courthouse and execute public officials. The Millers had moved from Indiana to the Las Vegas area in January. They were quoted on Reno television KRNV: [...] "I feel sorry for any federal agents that <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> and try to push around or anything like that. I really don't want violence toward them but if they're gonna come and bring violence to us, well, if that's the language they want to speak, we'll learn it." [...] Miller commented on the issues involved in greater length in social media, and interviewed other protesters at the Bundy ranch.|$|E

6000|$|... 'That's all. We needn't {{argue about}} it. If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> and have supper, I can't stop you. But I'm {{not going to}} have the place turned into a night-club.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please don't {{be angry}} with me," [...] she said. [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> and see you, to--to ask your advice. The boat was lying there, and it looked such a very short {{distance}} across, and directly I had started the big waves began <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in and I was frightened." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'It's {{nothing of}} the sort. It's the beastliest hole in existence. It's {{absolutely}} chronic. Perhaps you wonder why I'm here. Don't think I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here.</b> Not me! I was sent. It was like this.' She gave him a rapid summary of her troubles. 'There! Don't you call it a bit thick?' she concluded.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{who chose}} the house? Did I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here?</b> But {{it is not}} that. If you are not happy here, what could you have in any other house to make you happy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll do {{what they}} please. I believe half of these Filipinos think the Americans are nothing but cut-throats. They can't {{conceive}} that we should <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> and govern them for their own good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, perfectly! I think New York {{agrees with}} us both wonderfully. I never knew such air. And {{to think of}} our not having snow yet! I should think {{everybody}} would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here!</b> Why don't you come, Mr. Beaton?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Miss Vincent," [...] said I, [...] "you do not {{understand}} at all why I am here--why I have been here so much--why I {{did not go to}} Europe. The truth is, I could not leave. I do not wish to be away; I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> and live here always--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should have}} left me alone," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> but when you insisted I did it to oblige you.

6000|$|... "For my part," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine, [...] "I don't {{see what}} they've {{got to find}} fault with, anyway. I look on this {{as part of the}} passage. To be sure, we ain't movin' a bit on our way to Japan, but that's not my fault, nor yet yours, Mrs. Lecks, nor yours, Mr. Craig. We paid our passage to go to Japan, and if the ship was steered wrong and got sunk, we hadn't {{anything}} to do with it. We didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> but here we are, and I'd like to know who's got any right to find fault with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prut!" [...] said she, [...] "and is that so! Why, I {{thought that}} thou wert a great tall fellow at least, and here thou art {{a little boy}} no older than Carl Max, the gooseherd."
