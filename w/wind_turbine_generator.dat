40|$|Abstract In this paper, a {{simulation}} study on dynamic characteristics of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>generators</b> is performed. The {{generation of electricity}} using <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> is being recently spotlighted as a renewable way. The wind is an infinite primary energy source.
