5|$|An Egyptian historian, {{known by}} his Greek name as Manetho (c. 3rd century BC), {{was the first}} to compile a {{comprehensive}} history of Egypt. Manetho was active during the reign of Ptolemy II (r. 283–246 BC) and used The Histories by the Greek Herodotus (c. 484 BC–c. 425 BC) as his main source of inspiration for a history of Egypt written in Greek.

Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, who felt a great spiritual affinity for El Greco, called his autobiography Report to Greco and wrote a tribute to the Cretan-born artist.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to counting degree-three curves on a quintic three-fold, Candelas {{and his collaborators}} obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which went far beyond the results obtained by mathematicians.

In particular, the enumerative predictions of mirror symmetry have now been rigorously proven.|$|E

5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} <b>work</b> <b>were</b> {{the traditional}} {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E

Although formally congratulated by the regime, Agârbiceanu fell out with its censorship apparatus. According to various accounts, he allowed the censors to operate multiple changes, {{as long as the}} substance of his writing was not itself altered. Portions of his <b>work</b> <b>were</b> cut out during reediting, and a novel, Prăbușirea ("The Downfall"), serialized in Gazeta Literară, was so crudely handled that seven of its pages were lost forever.|$|E

In 1834, the tower was one of only four buildings to survive a terrible fire in Westminster, and in the aftermath the records were moved to a new, purpose-built archive.|$|E

5|$|By 1947, when John Crichton-Stuart, {{the fifth}} marquess, {{inherited}} the castle, the Bute family had divested itself {{of most of}} its land in South Wales. John sold off the family's remaining property interests and in 1950 he gave Caerphilly Castle to the state.

5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the <b>work</b> <b>were</b> perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|During the Northern Song (960–1126 CE), a {{new class}} of scholar-artists emerged who did not possess the tromp l'oiel skills of the academy {{painters}} nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters. The literati's painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled, yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self-expression. The scholar-artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, worst of all, who accepted monetary payment for their <b>work</b> <b>were</b> no better than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace. They were not to be considered real artists.|$|E
