6000|$|That the man Odin, {{speaking}} with a Hero's voice and heart, as with an impressiveness out of Heaven, told his People the infinite importance of Valor, how man thereby became a god; {{and that his}} People, feeling a response to it in their own hearts, believed this message of his, and thought it a message out of Heaven, and him a Divinity for telling it them: this {{seems to me the}} primary seed-grain of the Norse Religion, from which all manner of mythologies, symbolic practices, speculations, allegories, songs and sagas would naturally grow. Grow,--how strangely! I called it a small light shining and shaping in the huge vortex of Norse darkness. Yet the darkness itself was alive; consider that. It was the eager inarticulate uninstructed Mind of the whole Norse People, longing only to become articulate, to go on articulating ever farther! The living doctrine grows, grows;--like a Banyan-tree; the first seed is the essential thing: any branch strikes itself down into the earth, becomes a new root; and so, in endless complexity, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> wood, a whole jungle, one seed the parent of it all. Was not the whole Norse Religion, accordingly, in some sense, what we called [...] "the enormous shadow of this man's likeness"? Critics trace some affinity in some Norse mythuses, of the Creation and such like, with those of the Hindoos. The Cow Adumbla, [...] "licking the rime from the rocks," [...] has a kind of Hindoo look. A Hindoo Cow, transported into frosty countries. Probably enough; indeed we may say undoubtedly, these things will have a kindred with the remotest lands, with the earliest times. Thought does not die, but only is changed. The first man that began to think in this Planet of ours, he was the beginner of all. And then the second man, and the third man;--nay, every true Thinker to this hour is a kind of Odin, teaches men his way of thought, spreads a shadow of his own likeness over sections of the History of the World.|$|E

30|$|A {{software}} update payload {{does not have}} to hold a complete program. In the mobile network of the deployment chain, we need {{to take into account the}} different levels of fragmented binary code: (1) diff’ed binary code and (2) packet fragments. Depending on the size of changes from the old version, we first choose either a whole program or a set of fragments of changed parts, called “diff,” to transmit. The diffs are fragments of the binary code com from the different position of the program. The deployment chain then splits the binary object into packets to deliver them through mobile networks. Thus, when we check the integrity of {{software update}}s in the middle of networks, we need to inspect the binary fragments. Fortunately, CodeDog injects the semantics markers in the binary code itself. We can verify control flow semantics without knowledge of the whole program. It is incremental: as we collect more semantics markers, we can verify more control flows. When <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> program code, CodeDog can prevent attacks from all the modification of control flows.|$|E
3000|$|A more {{practical}} alternative {{is the so-called}} DG enhancement. For details on this, we refer the reader to [30] or to a comprehensive recent overview in [38, Section 2]. Here is the main idea. In the derived category case, one observes for any two objects c,c' ∈ C_· (C), <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> complex of morphisms Hom^· (c,c'). Maps in H(C) correspond to degree- 0 cohomology classes of this complex. One axiomatizes the situation by introducing a notion of a DG category C_· that by definition has a complex C_· (c,c') of morphisms for any two objects. Taking degree- 0 cohomology of these complexes, we obtain a category H^ 0 (C_· [...]). One distinguishes a class of pretriangulated DG categories C_· for which H^ 0 (C_· [...]) has a natural triangulated structure. One says that a DG functor F:C_·→C_· ' is a quasi-equivalence if F:C_· (c,c') →C'_· (F(c),F(c') is a quasiisomorphism for any c,c' ∈C, and the induced functor H^ 0 (F):H^ 0 (C_· [...]) → H^ 0 (C'_· [...]) is an equivalence. Then a DG enhancement of a triangulated category D is a pretriangulated DG category D_· equipped with an equivalence H^ 0 (D_· [...]) D, considered up to a quasiequivalence.|$|E
40|$|When {{the matrix}} A is {{symmetric}} and positive definite, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> {{new class of}} algorithms for solving Ax ∗ = b. Consider the function f(x) = 1 2 xT Ax − x T b. Notice that in one dimension, this defines a parabola, and if x is a 2 -vector, it defines a bowl-shaped function with elliptical horozontal cross sections. (The bowl fails to hold water if any eigenvalue of A is negative.) The {{solution to the problem}} is given by the vector satisfying min x f(x) (1) ∇f(x) = Ax − b = 0. (Note that f(x) is the negative of what we have been calling the residual.) Thus, the solution to problem (1) is precisely the vector we seek in solving the linear system Ax ∗ = b. 1 The Steepest Descent Algorithm Recall from calculus that the gradient, ∇f(x), is the direction in which the function f is most rapidly increasing, and −∇f(x) is the direction of steepest descent. Thus, if we want to minimize f, we might think of taking a guess at x ∗, evaluating the gradient, and taking a step in the opposite direction until the function stops decreasing. Then we can repeat the process. This gives the following algorithm. 1. Pick x 0. 2. For k = 0, 1, [...] ., (a) Evaluate pk = −∇f(xk) = rk. 1 (b) Let xk+ 1 = xk +αkpk, where αk is the minimizer of minα f(xk +αpk). End For. To visualize the algorithm, picture an elliptical valley surrounded by mountains. Level surfaces of the terrain are shown in Figure 1, as they might appear on a topographical map. If a person is at point x 0 in the fog and wants to reach the pit of the valley, she might follow an algorithm of picking the direction of steepest descent, following the straight path until it starts to rise, and then picking the new steepest descent direction. In that case, she follows the zigzag path indicated in the figure. (See how relevant numerical analysis can be in real life?) We can find an analytic formula for αk. For fixed xk and pk, f(xk + αpk) = 1 2 (xk + αpk) T A(xk + αpk) − (xk + αpk) T b = 1 2 α 2 p T k Apk + αp T k Axk + −αp T k b + constant. The minimum of f with respect to α occurs when the derivative is zero: p T k Axk + αp T k Apk − p T k b = 0 (2) so α = − pT k (Axk − b) p T k Apk = pT k r...|$|E
