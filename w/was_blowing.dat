Rain had been falling for several hours, turning the field into a muddy mess that would hinder play throughout the game. 62,850 tickets were sold for the game, and that number was given as the official attendance. Real attendance estimates range from 40,000-50,000, due to the poor weather {{and the fact that}} the stadium was half-empty through much of the game.|$|E
5|$|In agriculture, the {{increased}} usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun. In addition, the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff for spinning wool, tripling production. A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily {{life was the}} use of buttons as closures for garments, which allowed for better fitting without having to lace clothing on the wearer. Windmills were refined with the creation of the tower mill, allowing {{the upper part of the}} windmill to be spun around to face the direction from which the wind <b>was</b> <b>blowing.</b> The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden, increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality. The first patent law in 1447 in Venice protected the rights of inventors to their inventions.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1878, voices sounded for Reitz {{to run for}} the presidency, but President Brand's {{position}} was still very strong and Reitz openly praised his qualities and refused to stand against him. In the late 1870s and early 1880s the political temperature ran high in the Orange Free State. The annexation of the South African Republic (Transvaal) by the British in 1877 and the First Anglo-Boer War of 1880–1881 in which that republic regained its autonomy impacted deeply on political sentiments in the Orange Free State. On the one hand there were those who propagated caution in the relationship with the British, on the other there developed a political movement that strongly propagated a (reawakened) Afrikaner national consciousness. Reitz was part of the latter, and together with C.L.F. Borckenhagen, editor of the Bloemfontein Express newspaper, he wrote a constitution for the Afrikaner Bond (Afrikaner Union), a political party originally set up by leading Afrikaner politicians in the Cape Colony, like Rev S.J. du Toit and his Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners ('Society of True Afrikaners') and Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr and the Zuidafrikaansche Boeren Beschermings Vereeniging ('South African Boer Protection Association'). Among the supporters of this new Afrikaner nationalism in the Orange Free State was also Reitz's successor, M.T. Steyn, then still a young lawyer. The constitution was presented in April 1881, and several months later Reitz became the chairman of the Bond. His overt political activities earned Reitz criticism from those who feared a breakdown of relations with the British. It is obvious, however, that a wind of change <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> through the Boer republics and among the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony, which was to change Anglo-Boer relations drastically.|$|E

25|$|There {{was heavy}} weather {{along the coast}} {{in the latter part}} of October 1836, and when the Royal Tar left Eastport on the evening of the 21st, the wind <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> so hard from the westward that the steamer put into Little River for safety. The gale {{continued}} for three days, but on the afternoon of the 24th, another attempt was made to resume the voyage. Finding a heavy sea outside and the wind still from the westward, the steamer put into Machias Bay and again came to anchor, remaining until midnight, when the wind shifted to the northwest and the voyage was again resumed.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{effectiveness}} of electronic deer whistles in scaring away sika deer {{that are likely to}} run onto roads, resulting in accidents. These whistles have been used in the U. S. A. and other countries. In this study, two types of deer whistles were tested: one that has a continuous tone with a fixed frequency (Whistle A) and the other that has an intermittent tone with a modulated frequency (Whistle B). To assess {{the effectiveness of}} the whistles in alerting deer, the deer's reactions to the whistles <b>were</b> observed by <b>blowing</b> the whistle from a fixed place that is visible to the deer when they appear by the roadside. For the control sample, deer's behavior when no whistle <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>was</b> observed. When no whistle <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> 51 % of the deer were on alert about the observers. When Whistle A <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> 67 % of the deer were on alert; this figure increased to 95 % when Whistle B <b>was</b> <b>blown.</b> The time durations for which the deer were alert when no whistle <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> Whistle A <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> and Whistle B <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>were</b> 20 %, 42 %, and 73 %, respectively. These results indicated that the deer whistles are effective in alerting deer, and that Whistle B is more effective than Whistle A. Vehicles can be equipped with deer whistles to alert deer about on-coming vehicles so as to prevent them from crossing roads, and consequently reduce deer-vehicle collisions. [URL]...|$|R
25|$|Those who {{witnessed}} the apparition stood in the pouring rain {{for up to two}} hours reciting the Rosary, a series of traditional Catholic prayers. When the apparition began there was good light, but although it then became very dark, witnesses could still see the figures very clearly – they appeared to be the colour of a bright whitish light. The apparition did not flicker or move in any way. The witnesses reported that the ground around the figures remained completely dry during the apparition although the wind <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> from the south. Afterwards, however the ground at the gable became wet and the gable dark.|$|E
25|$|The Allies mounted more gas attacks {{than the}} Germans in 1917 and 1918 {{because of a}} marked {{increase}} in production of gas from the Allied nations. Germany was unable {{to keep up with}} this pace despite creating various new gases for use in battle, mostly as a result of very costly methods of production. Entry into the war by the United States allowed the Allies to increase mustard gas production far more than Germany. Also the prevailing wind on the Western Front <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> from west to east, which meant the British more frequently had favorable conditions for a gas release than did the Germans.|$|E
25|$|The New Course started just {{downstream}} of Temple Island, on the Buckinghamshire {{side and}} finished opposite the upstream end of Phyllis Court, {{very close to}} the current finish line. There were two slight bends (at Remenham and just after Fawley) and a staggered start to compensate for them. The course was also piled for the first time, although not boomed. Unfortunately, it became apparent that in trying to eliminate the unfairness of the Old Course, a new problem had been introduced. Downstream of Fawley, bushes grew alongside the Buckinghamshire bank and provided shelter from the prevailing wind. The course now ran close to this bank and crew on the Buckinghamshire station gained the advantage of shelter whenever a ‘Bushes Wind’ <b>was</b> <b>blowing.</b> From 1886 to 1905, Bucks took 59% of wins against 41% on Berks.|$|E

25|$|Tank {{introduced}} a further refinement to this basic concept. He suggested placing {{most of the}} airflow components on the propeller, {{in the form of}} a oversized propeller spinner whose outside diameter was the same as the engine. The cowl around the engine proper was greatly simplified, essentially a basic cylinder. Air entered through a small hole at the centre of the spinner, and was directed through ductwork in the spinner so it <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> rearward along the cylinder heads. To provide enough airflow, an internal cone was placed in the centre of the hole, over the propeller hub, which was intended to compress the airflow and allow a smaller opening to be used. In theory, the tight-fitting cowling also provided some thrust due to the compression and heating of air as it flowed through the cowling.|$|E
25|$|He {{went into}} law {{after the war}} and in 1921 set up his own practice. During {{the early years of the}} Austrian First Republic, he was close to the Fatherland Front. A {{successful}} lawyer, he was invited to join the cabinet of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss in 1933. Following Dollfuss' murder in 1934, he became a State Councillor from 1937 under Kurt Schuschnigg. A keen mountaineer, Seyss-Inquart became the head of the German-Austrian Alpine Club. He later became a devotee of Heinrich Himmler's concepts of racial purity and sponsored various expeditions to Tibet and other parts of Asia in hopes of proving Aryan racial concepts and theories. He was not initially a member of the Austrian National Socialist party, though he was sympathetic to many of their views and actions. By 1938, however, Seyss-Inquart knew which way the political wind <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> and became a respectable frontman for the Austrian National Socialists.|$|E
25|$|Dartmouth {{is a small}} port on {{the west}} side of the natural harbour formed by the River Dart. In the 1860s the Dartmouth and Torbay Railway {{established}} more quays on the opposite bank at Kingswear. The RNLI approved that Dartmouth Lifeboat Station be established at Dartmouth in July 1876 but it was 1878 before a lifeboat arrived. During the summer the lifeboat was kept in a boat house at Sand Quay, but during the winter it was kept afloat in Warfleet Creek where it was quicker to respond to any ships in distress. It would prove difficult for the rowing lifeboat to leave the estuary of the Dart if the wind <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> from the sea unless a tug was able to help. The station was closed in 1896 and during all that time just one effective service was provided. That was on 20 September 1887 when the crew attended a trawler near Kingswear Castle. The boat house is now used by the Dartmouth Amateur Rowing Club.|$|E
25|$|Flutes can {{be played}} with several {{different}} air sources. Conventional flutes <b>are</b> <b>blown</b> with the mouth, although some cultures use nose flutes. The flue pipes of organs, which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, <b>are</b> <b>blown</b> by bellows or fans.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{instruments}} {{can be used}} to measure wind direction, such as the windsock and wind vane. Both of these instruments work by moving to minimize air resistance. The way a weather vane is pointed by prevailing winds indicates the direction from which the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b> The larger opening of a windsock faces the direction that the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> from; its tail, with the smaller opening, points in the direction the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b>|$|R

25|$|Duncan, {{with the}} main body of the fleet, was at the time lying at Great Yarmouth revictualling, the Texel being watched by a small {{squadron}} under Captain Henry Trollope in HMS Russell, from whom he received early information of the Dutch being at sea. He at once weighed anchor, and with a fair wind approached the Dutch coast, saw that the fleet was not returned to the Texel, and steering towards the south sighted it on the morning of 11 October about seven miles from the shore and nearly halfway between the villages of Egmont and Camperdown. The wind <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> straight on shore, and though the Dutch forming their line to the north preserved a bold front, it was clear that if the attack was not made promptly they would speedily get into shoal water, where no attack would be possible. Duncan at once realised the necessity of cutting off their retreat by getting between them and the land. At first he was anxious to bring up his fleet in a compact body, for his numbers were at best equal to those of the Dutch; but seeing the absolute necessity of immediate action, without waiting for the ships astern to come up, without waiting to form line of battle, and with the fleet in very irregular order of sailing, in two groups, led respectively by himself in Venerable and Vice-admiral Richard Onslow in Monarch, he made the signal to pass through the enemy's line and engage to leeward.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the next}} seven years he {{continued}} his research and lecture tours assisted and encouraged by his wife and children. All this came to an end on July 16, 1917, however, when Lomax was fired along with six other faculty members {{as the result of a}} political battle between Governor James E. Ferguson and the University President, Dr. R. E. Vinson. Lomax moved to Chicago to take a job selling bonds at Lee, Higginson & Co; a bond brokerage firm run by the son of his old professor Barrett Wendell. A few months later, Ferguson was impeached and the Board of Regents rescinded its dismissal of the faculty. Lomax judged that it would be wrong to leave his post at Lee, Higginson & Co so soon after arriving, especially with regards to his friendship with the family of Barrett Wendell, so he remained in Chicago for eighteen months until the war ended. There he struck up a what turned out to be a lifelong friendship with Chicago poet Carl Sandburg, who frequently mentions him in his book, American Songbag (1927). In 1919, his next book, Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp, an anthology of cowboy poetry, was published by Macmillan. That year Lomax returned to Texas to be secretary of the Texas Exes, which had become financially independent of the University, so as to avoid further interference from politicians. Nevertheless, interference struck, when Ferguson, whom the law prohibited from holding office, ran his wife, Miriam A. Ferguson, as his surrogate. As governor, Mrs. Ferguson was able to pack the board of regents and oust John from his job as editor of The Alcade, which during his tenure was a 100-page long publication. Seeing how the wind <b>was</b> <b>blowing,</b> Lomax resigned his secretaryship and joined the Republic Bank of Dallas in 1925. The economic crash of 1929 presaged bad things for the bank, however.|$|E
