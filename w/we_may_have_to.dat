Sorry to have to be so blunt, but the country is in mortal danger from our present {{government}} and our liberty is already near dead because of this government. If you are too stupid to turn things around with your vote, there are people out here like me who are willing to turn things around with guns, force and violence. We hope our method does not become necessary.|$|E
500|$|Because Mackintosh had {{intended}} to use Aurora as the party's main living quarters, most of the shore party's personal gear, food, equipment and fuel was still aboard when the ship departed. Although the sledging rations intended for Shackleton's depots had been landed, the ten stranded men were left with [...] "only the clothes on their backs". [...] Mackintosh [...] summarised their situation: [...] "We {{have to face the}} possibility that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stay here, unsupported, for two years. [...] We cannot expect rescue before then, and so we must conserve and economize on what we have, and we must seek and apply what substitutes we can gather". Their first recourse was to the food and materials from supplies left behind by Scott's and Shackleton's earlier expeditions. [...] These supplies provided a harvest of material, which enabled clothing, footwear and equipment to be improvised, while the party used seal meat and blubber as extra sources of food and fuel. [...] "Joyce's Famous Tailoring Shop" [...] fashioned clothes from a large canvas tent abandoned by Scott's expedition. Even a brand of tobacco—"Hut Point Mixture"—was concocted by Ernest Wild from sawdust, tea, coffee and a few dried herbs. [...] By these means the party equipped itself for the sledging journeys that lay ahead in the second season. On the last day of August Mackintosh recorded in his diary the work that had been completed during the winter, and ended: [...] "Tomorrow we start for Hut Point".|$|E

[...] "Good Lord!" [...] said Virginian Senator Thomas S. Martin. [...] "You're not going to send soldiers over there, are you?"

2500|$|Most of {{the support}} for the Quantification Settlement Agreement has been {{associated}} with government agencies, on both the state and federal level. Numerous government agencies produced press releases that touted the benefits of the agreement. Many of these releases noted that this was the largest water transfer agreement in American history. Although residents of the Imperial Valley have been the main opponents of this measure, some observers have embraced the agreement, arguing that it is the most realistic and pragmatic solution to the water crisis in the area. Brad Jennings, a tentative supporter of the agreement, notes that [...] "There are things most agree on: The Salton Sea must be saved. No matter how you feel about water transfers you know that a dead Sea would be an environmental disaster for us. And our water rights and water allotment must be protected. That means <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give some up, which is what the QSA was designed to do." [...] He also argued that the measure would likely prevent federal intervention, a concern of many residents of the Imperial Valley.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011 Wal-Mart {{recalled}} {{a quantity of}} infant formula after a baby died in Missouri. [...] "We extend our deepest condolences to this baby boy's family {{as they try to}} come to grips with their loss," [...] said Dianna Gee, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. [...] "As soon as we heard what happened, we immediately reached out to the manufacturer of the formula and to the Department of Health and Senior Services to provide any information <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> help with the investigation." [...] Wal-Mart said it pulled a batch of Enfamil from its stores nationwide that matched the size and lot number ZP1k7G of the formula that may have sickened the baby in Missouri, Gee said. The baby formula was purchased from a Wal-Mart in Lebanon, Missouri. After the purchase, a 10-day-old infant died from a rare bacterial infection, CNN affiliate KYTV reported. Authorities ran tests to determine if the death came from the formula, the water to make the formula or any other factor, said Mead Johnson Nutrition, the company that makes Enfamil. [...] "We are highly confident in the safety and quality of our products – and the rigorous testing we put them through," [...] said Chris Perille, a Mead Johnson Nutrition spokesman.|$|E

2500|$|On 23 November FIFA {{announced}} that the FIFA executive committee would hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on 2 December in Cape Town, where members were already due to meet to discuss the seedings for the World Cup, {{in order to discuss}} various recent incidents affecting the world game. According to BBC Radio 5 Live sports news correspondent Gordon Farquhar, the Henry incident would be [...] "high on the agenda". Gordon Smith, {{the chief executive of the}} Scottish Football Association and a member of the International Football Association Board, believed that introduction of AARs in time for the World Cup would be pressed for at the EGM by UEFA president Michel Platini, who had been a long-time supporter of the concept; Smith said of the proposal, [...] "I feel that it has its advantages at the highest levels of the games. When there's massive TV coverage the problems are highlighted all over the world so this is something <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look at." [...] The FAI was to be given the chance to present their views at the EGM, with Delaney hoping it would not be a [...] "token" [...] gesture, criticising the lack of direct contact from FIFA. FIFA President Sepp Blatter confirmed on 30 November that the EGM would consider the use of AARs and goal-line technology in the 2010 World Cup, and changing the two-legged play-off qualification format, possibly in favour of a single game played at a neutral venue.|$|E
2500|$|The Soviet {{threat to}} send troops to Egypt to fight the Allies led Eisenhower to fear {{that this might be}} the {{beginning}} of World War III. One of Eisenhower's aides Emmet Hughes recalled that the reaction at the White House to the Bulganin letters was [...] "sombre" [...] as there was fear that this was the beginning to the countdown to World War III, a war that if it occurred would kill hundreds of millions of people. In private, Eisenhower told Undersecretary of State Herbert Hoover Jr. of his fears that: [...] If the Soviet Union did go to war with NATO allies Britain and France, then the United States would be unable to remain neutral, because the United States' obligations under NATO would come into effect, requiring them {{to go to war with}} the Soviet Union in defense of Britain and France. Likewise, if the Soviet Union attacked Israel, though there was no formal American commitment to defend Israel, the Eisenhower administration would come under heavy domestic pressure to intervene. From Eisenhower's viewpoint, it was better to end the war against Egypt rather than run the risk of this escalating into the Third World War, in case Khrushchev was serious about going to war in defense of Egypt as he insisted in public that he was. Eisenhower's reaction to these threats from the Soviet Union was: [...] "If those fellows start something, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hit 'em — and, if necessary, with everything in the bucket." [...] Eisenhower immediately ordered the U-2s into action over Syria and Israel to search for any Soviet air forces on Syrian bases, so the British and French could destroy them. He told Hoover and CIA director Allan Dulles, [...] "If the Soviets attack the French and British directly, we would be in a war and we would be justified in taking military action even if Congress were not in session." [...] (The Americans excluded Israel from the guarantee against Soviet attack, however, alarming the Israeli government.) ...|$|E
