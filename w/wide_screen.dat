500|$|In 1967, {{the episode}} was {{received}} positively {{by members of}} the voice cast and their families, who had attended a preview screening at Century 21 Studios. Francis Matthews, who provided the voice of Captain Scarlet, recalls that [...] "the moment we heard, 'This is the voice of the Mysterons,' my eldest son ran screaming from the room, but my other son just sat there riveted," [...] and adds, [...] "Reg [...] said, 'Oh my God, what have we done? We've made a series that no children are going to watch!'" [...] The episode was given a cinematic presentation at the Columbia Theatre on London's Shaftesbury Avenue, which Gary Files, a voice actor for later Captain Scarlet episodes, warmly remembers: [...] "I looked at [...] with total and utter amazement... Boy, you should have seen it on the <b>wide</b> <b>screen!</b> They had laid in an incredible soundtrack to go with it... We all tottered out into the night, convinced that we were on to a winner."

500|$|The {{story was}} {{initially}} {{supposed to be}} [...] "fluid" [...] and did not fit into the chronology of the Kingdom Hearts series, but later developers tied the games final chapters into Birth by Sleep and 358/2 Days. The development team planned {{to make use of}} mobile phones communication abilities to facilitate interaction between players. Coded was developed with 3D and 2D graphics to have the game available on a range of mobile phones for distribution overseas. The game was designed around hardware that was more powerful than any yet available, like Final Fantasy Agito, but developer were not as aggressive with this boundary-pushing with Coded to help it spread to overseas markets where mobile phones were not very powerful in terms of hardware. Early screenshots showed the game in a <b>wide</b> <b>screen</b> format, {{based on the idea that}} more future models will feature a swivel screen. Few mobile phones, however, were able to support the games technical specifications, so the planned expansion to other Japanese phone carriers and to the United States were not possible.|$|E
500|$|Until {{the start}} of the fourth season, the series was shot on {{traditional}} film stock. It (the first three seasons) were shot on <b>wide</b> <b>screen</b> 35mm film with and an aspect ratio of 1.78:1, and it was 3-perf Super 35mm film. After Rush began testing a Sony digital camera on the standing sets for two days prior to production on [...] "" [...] and demonstrated the footage to Braga and Berman, {{the decision was made to}} switch to digital production. Rush felt that the audience wouldn't see a great deal of difference as the footage can be shot in a way to look the same as the earlier seasons, but felt that the filming in high definition would be a benefit because of the additional detail that could be seen on screen. At the time this was cutting edge for a TV show, with allowing the production team improved low-light performance and it enabled shooting more compared to chemical films. The actual camera used was the Sony HDW-F900 CineAlta High-Definition camera, and the recording technology also used Sony' CineAlta 24P, a trademarked name of that company. The decision to move to Sony's technology was a triple agreement of the three executive producers of the show, and also supported by the Directory of Photography. Season four's Blu-ray release of Enterprise in 1080p has been praised as sharp and with satisfying color, and the best looking of the seasons. The fourth season has been released multiple times, with latest as a combined full-series set in January 2017.|$|E

An early photograph that appears in Saving The Indian Hills depicts Fields at age 16, {{standing in front of}} the Indian Hills Theater, which housed the largest indoor movie screen ever constructed. Designed by the architect Richard L. Crowther, the Cinerama theater was considered his greatest achievement. Its unique curved screen provided a 3-D effect that caused moviegoers to feel themselves immersed in the film—especially <b>wide</b> <b>screen</b> movies such as Lawrence of Arabia, Dr. Zhivago and Star Wars.|$|E
2500|$|Often, {{the vast}} {{landscape}} becomes {{more than a}} vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various <b>wide</b> <b>screen</b> formats such as Cinemascope (1953) and VistaVision used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. John Ford's use of Monument Valley as an expressive landscape in his films from Stagecoach (1939) to Cheyenne Autumn (1965) [...] "present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans".|$|E
2500|$|The {{second season}} was {{released}} {{under the title}} [...] as a <b>wide</b> <b>screen</b> seven-disc Region 1 DVD box set on September 5, 2006.

Again, the season was initially delivered in two sets for Region 2: the first twelve episodes were released as a widescreen four-disc DVD box set on July 17, 2006, while the remaining episodes of season 2 were released as a four-disc DVD box set on October 2, 2006. The set was released in Region 4 on October 4, 2006.|$|E
50|$|Finally, the 2nd {{approach}} also better utilizes modern wide-screen computer displays. In {{the past}} screens {{were limited to}} 40 or 80 characters.

2500|$|There is a {{trend in}} academia for {{universities}} to be their own drug discovery enterprise. These facilities, which normally are found only in industry, are now increasingly found at universities as well. UCLA, for example, features an open access HTS laboratory Molecular Screening Shared Resources (MSSR, UCLA), which can screen more than 100,000 compounds a day on a routine basis. The open access policy ensures that researchers {{from all over the}} world can take advantage of this facility without lengthy intellectual property negotiations. With a compound library of over 200,000 small molecules, the MSSR has one of the largest compound deck of all universities on the west coast. Also, the MSSR features full functional genomics capabilities (genome wide siRNA, shRNA, cDNA and CRISPR) which are complementary to small molecule efforts: Functional genomics leverages HTS capabilities to execute genome wide screens which examine the function of each gene in the context of interest by either knocking each gene out or overexpressing it. Parallel access to high-throughput small molecule screen and a genome <b>wide</b> <b>screen</b> enables researcher to perform target identification and validation for given disease or the mode of action determination on a small molecule. The most accurate results can be obtained by use of [...] "arrayed" [...] functional genomics libraries, i.e. each library contains a single construct such as a single siRNA or cDNA. Functional genomics is typically paired with high content screening using e.g. epifluorescent miscroscopy or laser scanning cytometry.|$|E
2500|$|By 1953, and {{especially}} {{with the introduction of}} anamorphic <b>wide</b> <b>screen</b> CinemaScope, Eastmancolor became a marketing imperative as CinemaScope was incompatible with Technicolor's Three-Strip camera and lenses. Indeed, Technicolor Corp became one of the best, if not the best, processor of Eastmancolor negative, especially for so-called [...] "wide gauge" [...] negatives (65mm, 8-perf 35mm, 6-perf 35mm), yet it far preferred its own 35mm dye-transfer printing process for Eastmancolor-originated films with a print run that exceeded 500 prints, not withstanding the significant [...] "loss of register" [...] that occurred in such prints that were expanded by CinemaScope's 2X horizontal factor, and, to a lesser extent, with so-called [...] "flat wide screen" [...] (variously 1.66:1 or 1.85:1, but spherical and not anamorphic). This nearly fatal flaw was not corrected until 1955 and caused numerous features initially printed by Technicolor to be scrapped and reprinted by DeLuxe Labs. (These features are often billed as [...] "Color by Technicolor-DeLuxe".) Indeed, some Eastmancolor-originated films billed as [...] "Color by Technicolor" [...] were never actually printed using the dye-transfer process, {{due in part to the}} throughput limitations of Technicolor's dye-transfer printing process, and competitor DeLuxe's superior throughput. Incredibly, DeLuxe once had a license to install a Technicolor-type dye-transfer printing line, but as the [...] "loss of register" [...] problems became apparent in Fox's CinemaScope features that were printed by Technicolor, after Fox had become an all-CinemaScope producer, Fox-owned DeLuxe Labs abandoned its plans for dye-transfer printing and became, and remained, an all-Eastmancolor shop, as Technicolor itself later became.|$|E

50|$|Beyond direct binding of dCas9 to transcriptionally {{sensitive}} {{positions of}} loci, dCas9 can be fused {{to a variety}} of modulatory protein domains to carry out a myriad of functions. Recently, dCas9 has been fused to chromatin remodeling proteins(HDACs/HATs) to reorganize the chromatin structure around various loci. This is an important in targeting various eukaryotic genes of interest as heterochromatin structures hinder Cas9 binding. Furthermore, because Cas9 can react to heterochromatin, it is theorized that this enzyme can be further applied to studying the chromatin structure of various loci. Additionally, dCas9 has been employed in genome <b>wide</b> <b>screens</b> of gene repression.
