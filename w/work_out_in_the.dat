500|$|Michael Schumacher {{admitted}} to having mixed feelings after the race, having been in second position until the race's last laps. The Mercedes driver stated: [...] "I would obviously have loved to finish there [...] and be on the podium again. But {{even if it did}} not <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very end, we can be happy about the result and the big fight we put in." [...] Kobayashi, placed second at the restart, shared similar feelings to Schumacher about finishing in a lower position: [...] "Originally I qualified 13th so then it is not bad to finish seventh, {{but on the other hand}} I started second after the long red flag and looking from there the result is disappointing." ...|$|E
500|$|Risto Uimonen, an {{election}} {{analyst for the}} Finnish Broadcasting Company, predicted [...] "the toughest negotiations on government formation since the 1970s", as the three biggest parties have differing stances on many issues. Some analysts said that government formation talks could take weeks or even months due to disparities {{on such issues as}} the eurozone bail-outs, taxation, pension reform, foreign aid and immigration. Pasi Saukkonen, {{a political scientist at the}} University of Helsinki, made a comparison between similar EU referendums in Denmark and Ireland (following which a similar referendum passed the measure, though it was in turn followed by a similar proposed measure) where the smaller EU member states wielded immense influence; though he said that such controversial matters usually <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end.|$|E
500|$|Even before {{viewing the}} script, Reznor and Ross opted {{to use a}} redolent {{approach}} to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively. He was filming at {{this time last year}} and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was {{directed}} by Michael Haussman, and is a lavish period-style piece filmed from November 3–8, 1994 in Ronda and in the bullring of Antequera, Spain. In the video Madonna wore a fitted, classic suit by British fashion designer John Galliano. The costumes worn by Madonna in the video were created by stylist Lori Goldstein who received the VH1 Fashion and Media award for best styling. Other designers who provided clothing included Donatella Versace and a then-unknown Christian Louboutin. Madonna had a 1940s style on her, with tight corset, silk dresses and a black-veiled hat. The plot of the video was set in the 1940s, depicting Madonna as a neglected lover of a bullfighter, played by real-life Spanish actor and bullfighter Emilio Muñoz. Madonna's character yearns for the bullfighter's presence, with erotic heartbreak. In an interview with MTV's Kurt Loder {{on the set of}} the music video, Madonna said that when she was initially writing [...] "Take a Bow" [...] the inspiration for the song was an actor, but she wanted the male character in the video to be a matador instead because she wanted the video to be about an [...] "obsessive, tragic love story that doesn't <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end" [...] and a matador would be more visually effective in expressing the emotion of the song.|$|E

And the song succeeds almost despite itself." ...|$|E

60|$|In both cases, therefore, {{the grand}} {{outline of the}} villa is the same; but in one we have it set off by contrast, in the other by assimilation; and we must <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{architecture}} of each edifice the principle on which we have begun. Commencing with that {{in which we are}} to work by contrast: the vertical crags must be the result of violence, and the influence of destruction, of distortion, of torture, to speak strongly, must be evident in their every line. We free the building from this influence, and give it repose, gracefulness, and ease; and we have a contrast of feeling as well as of line, by which the desirable attributes are rendered evident in both objects, while the duration of neither energy being allowed, there can be no disagreeable effect upon the spectator, who will not shrink from the terror of the crags, nor feel a want of excitement in the gentleness of the building.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the next}} day but one Sir Marmaduke came to him. He {{was sitting at the}} office of the D. R., in a very small and dirty room {{at the back of the}} house, and Sir Marmaduke found his way thither through a {{confused}} crowd of compositors, pressmen, and printers' boys. He thought that he had never before been in a place so foul, so dark, so crowded, and so comfortless. He himself was accustomed to do his <b>work,</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Islands, with many of the appanages of vice-royalty around him. He had his secretary, and his private secretary, and his inner-room, and his waiting-room; and not unfrequently he had the honour of a dusky sentinel walking before the door through which he was to be approached. He had an idea that all gentlemen at their work had comfortable appurtenances around them,--such as carpets, dispatch-boxes, unlimited stationery, easy chairs for temporary leisure, big table-space, and a small world of books around them to give at least a look of erudition to their pursuits. There was nothing of the kind in the miserably dark room occupied by Stanbury. He was sitting at a wretched little table on which there was nothing but a morsel of blotting paper, a small ink-bottle, and the paper on which he was scribbling. There was no carpet there, and no dispatch-box, and the only book in the room was a little dog's-eared dictionary. [...] "Sir Marmaduke, I am so much obliged to you for coming," [...] said Hugh. [...] "I fear you will find this place a little rough, but we shall be all alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|Three nights after when I {{was in bed}} I {{became very}} lucidly awake--it must have been {{about two or three}} in the morning--and the vision of life {{returned}} to me, with that same effect of enlargement and illumination. It was as if the great stillness that is behind and above and around the world of sense did in some way communicate with me. It bade me rouse my spirit and go on with the thoughts and purposes that had been stirring and proliferating in my mind when I had returned to England from the Cape. [...] "Dismiss your passion." [...] But I urged that that I could not do; there was the thought of Mary subjugated and weeping, the smarting memory of injury and defeat, the stains of subterfuge and discovery, the aching separation. No matter, the stillness answered, in the end all that is just to temper you for your greater uses.... I cannot forget, I insisted. Do not forget, but for the present this leads you no whither; this chapter has ended; dismiss it and turn to those other things. You are not only Stephen Stratton who fell into adultery; in these silences he is a little thing and far away; here and with me you are Man--Everyman--in this round world in which your lot has fallen. But Mary, I urged, to forget Mary is a treason, an ingratitude, seeing that she loved me. But the stillness did not command me to forget her, but only to turn my face now to the great work that lies before mankind. And that work? That work, so far as your share goes, is first to understand, to solve, and then to achieve, to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> measure of yourself that torment of pity and that desire for order and justice which together saturate your soul. Go about the world, embrue yourself with life, make use of that confusedly striving brain that I have lifted so painfully out of the deadness of matter....|$|E
