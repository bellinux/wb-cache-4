"Yes," [...] replied Eleanor, with an {{unconscious}} shade of defiance, [...] "people want to know, Mr. Dodder,--they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> And {{if you consider}} the preponderance of {{the evidence of the}} Gospels themselves--my brother-in-law says--you will find that the miraculous birth has very little to stand on.

The {{greatest}} problem {{which we had}} to face, in arranging this little escapade, was how we should keep you silent after your release.

There are five men, each of them {{men who have been}} ruined by the operations of your company, who have sworn to take your lives if you should divulge the truth as to your detention here. They are men of their word and they will do it. That is the position, gentlemen. I will not detain you any longer." ...|$|E

Pity he could not take you, too, since you would have known so well where to find them, if they are there at all. Now please talk no more nonsense to us, which it makes us sick to hear, and don't think that you can slip away because we are only two, for you know our roers are loaded with slugs, and we have orders to use them." ...|$|E

He did not really mean to lie to me when he said that I had not seen him talking to Black Meg, he only meant to contradict, or perhaps to hide something up. As a matter of fact, if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> I believe that the old witch took notes for him to some young lady, and that Hague Simon supplied him with rats for his hawks." ...|$|E

6000|$|Philip {{had nothing}} to say. He walked silently by the master's side. He felt horribly sick. It had never struck him that Foinet would wish to see his things there and then; he meant, {{so that he might}} have time to prepare himself, to ask him if he would mind coming at some future date or whether he might bring them to Foinet's studio. He was {{trembling}} with anxiety. In his heart he hoped that Foinet would look at his picture, and that rare smile would come into his face, and he would shake Philip's hand and say: [...] "Pas mal. Go on, my lad. You have talent, real talent." [...] Philip's heart swelled at the thought. It was such a relief, such a joy! Now he could go on with courage; and what did hardship matter, privation, and disappointment, if he arrived at last? He had worked very hard, it would be too cruel if all that industry were futile. And then with a start he remembered that he had heard Fanny Price say just that. They arrived at the house, and Philip was seized with fear. If he had dared he would have asked Foinet to go away. He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> They went in and the concierge handed him a letter as they passed. He glanced at the envelope and recognised his uncle's handwriting. Foinet followed him up the stairs. Philip could think of nothing to say; Foinet was mute, and the silence got on his nerves. The professor sat down; and Philip without a word placed before him the picture which the Salon had rejected; Foinet nodded but did not speak; then Philip showed him the two portraits he had made of Ruth Chalice, two or three landscapes which he had painted at Moret, and a number of sketches.|$|E

That seems so extraordinary to me that for that alone I should have had to write to you. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> of that. I never see any advertisement of Stratton & Co. or get any inkling {{of what it is}} you publish. Are you the power behind the respectable Murgatroyd and the honest Milvain? I know them both and neither has the slightest appearance of being animated by you. And equally perplexing is your being mixed up with an American like that man Gidding in Peace Conferences and Social Reform Congresses and so forth. It's so--Carnegieish. There I'm surer because I've seen your name in reports of meetings and I've read your last two papers in the Fortnightly. I can't imagine you of all people, with your touch of reserve, launching into movements and rubbing shoulders with faddists. What does it mean, Stephen? I had expected to find you coming back into English politics--speaking and writing on the lines of your old beginning, taking up that work you dropped--it's six years now ago. I've been accumulating disappointment for two years.

Weston Massinghay was comparing them the other night, at a dinner at the Clynes', to a crowded piratical galley trying to get alongside a good seaman in rough weather. He was very funny about Leo Maxse in the poop, white and shrieking with passion and the motion, and all the capitalists armed to the teeth and hiding snug in the hold until the grappling-irons were fixed....

And I tell you another thing. She means to do it while there's a Radical Government in power here, and before Russia {{finishes}} her reorganisation scheme. I am not a soldier, Hebblethwaite, but the fellows we've got up at the top--not the soldiers themselves but the chaps like old Busby and Simons--are simply out and out rotters. That's plain speaking, isn't it, but you and I are the two men concerned {{in the government of}} this country who do talk common sense to one another. We've fine soldiers and fine organisers, but they've been given the go-by simply because they know their job and would insist upon doing it thoroughly, if at all. Russia will have another four million men ready to be called up by the end of 1915, and not only that, but what is more important, is that she'll have the arms and the uniforms for them. Germany isn't going to wait for that. I've thought it all out. We are going to get it in the neck before seven or eight months have passed, and if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> Hebblethwaite, that's why I have taken a risk and ordered these ships. The navy is my care, and it's my job to see that we keep it up to the proper standard. Whose votes rob me of my extra battleships? Why, just a handful of Labour men and Irishmen and cocoa Liberals, who haven't an Imperial idea in their brains, who think war belongs to the horrors of the past, and think they're doing their duty by what they call 'keeping down expenses.' Hang it, Hebblethwaite, it's worse than a man who won't pay fire insurance for his house in a dangerous neighbourhood, so as to save a bit of money! What I've done I stick to. Split on me, if you want to." ...|$|E
