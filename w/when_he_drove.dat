5|$|Although {{its surface}} {{circulation}} had dissipated, its circulation aloft remained intact {{and led to}} a burst of rainfall early on August 20. The 11.94inches/303.3mm that fell at Miller became the wettest Missouri rainfall total associated with a tropical cyclone, or its remains, since at least 1972. One person died in Sleeper <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> into flood waters which had swept away a bridge he was attempting to navigate onto. Nine water rescues occurred along the I-44 corridor, mostly caused by Erin's rainfall. Damage totaled about $19.8million (2007USD) in the state, primarily in Polk County.|$|E

5|$|The band's road manager, Brian Maguire {{stated that}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> away from Banbridge in the lead, {{a few minutes}} ahead of the band's minibus, he passed through {{security}} barriers manned by the RUC. As Maguire continued ahead, up the by-pass towards Newry, he noticed a blue Triumph 2000 pulling-out from {{where it had been}} parked in a lay-by. Maguire recalled that the car first slowed down, then it accelerated, flashing its lights. Two men had been observed acting suspiciously inside the Castle Ballroom during the band's performance that night, suggesting that the Miami Showband's movements were being carefully monitored.|$|E
5|$|Further north, minor {{flooding}} {{was reported}} in Jalisco. Statewide, four people were killed. A 26-year-old man died after being swept away by {{in the village of}} Juanacatlan while a 12-year-old boy drowned after falling in a dam in the municipality of Teocuitatlan de Corona. Another man perished <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> his car into a ravine in Cuautitlan de Garcia Barragan. Fifteen hundred people were evacuated from their homes. Classes were briefly cancelled in 588schools, leaving over 40,000pupils home. Bridges collapsed in the Jalisco towns of Zacoalco de Torres and Tamazula de Gordiano. The worst-hit areas in the state were the southern and coastal areas of the state, as well as the Guadalajara area, where flooding and landslides occurred in some neighborhoods. Through Jalisco, 56municipalities sustained damage.|$|E
5|$|Since his death, {{multiple}} {{people have}} been arrested for helping Clemmons {{during and after the}} Lakewood shooting. Authorities claim the accomplices misled police about his whereabouts, gave him cell phones and money, applied first aid to his gunshot wounds and tried to help him leave the state. Among those arrested were Clemmons' sister, who bandaged his wounds and provided him transportation. Authorities arrested five other people for assisting Clemmons: Letricia Nelson, Quiana Williams, Douglas Davis, Eddie Davis, and Ricky Hinton. Darcus Allen {{was arrested and charged with}} aggravated first-degree murder for his alleged role as Clemmons' getaway driver. Allen claims he did not know Clemmons' plans <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> him to the coffee shop, but authorities argued he had known for days that Clemmons planned to murder police officers.|$|E
5000|$|Le Mesurier's first aerial victory came on 3 June 1917 when, with {{observer}} Flight Sub-Lieutenant R.G. St. John, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> {{down out}} of control an Albatros D.III west of Bruges.

5|$|In El Dorado, Sinaloa, {{near where}} the storm made landfall, the {{hurricane}} washed out away roads and destroyed many flimsy homes. Strong winds knocked down electricity towers, trees, and traffic signs, leaving many without power. In Mazatlán, to the southeast of where Lane moved ashore, the hurricane produced strong winds and heavy rains, causing street flooding and power outages. The threat of the hurricane forced the cancellation of an Independence Day Parade. Between Mazatlán and the state capital, Culiacán, the hurricane destroyed a bridge, leaving dozens of trucks stranded. In Culiacán, one person died <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> his car into a river, while several streets were flooded from the storm. Throughout Sinaloa, several damaged roads left many communities {{cut off from the}} rest of the country. Lane caused severe agricultural damage in the state, possibly reaching as high as $600million (2006MXN, $55million 2006USD). The hurricane also damaged water treatment facilities and distribution systems in multiple communities, prompting the Secretariat of Health to declare a sanitary alert in Sinaloa. Damage in Sinaloa totaled to around $1.2billion (2006MXN), $109.3million (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|On 8 June he {{made his}} first {{official}} observer qualifying sortie which he passed. At this time the German Luftstreitkräfte (Air Service) introduced the Fokker Eindecker fighter equipped with Synchronization gear. Firing through the propeller, the Germans had a machine that soon became a serious threat to McCudden's unit. The enemy succeeded establishing a period of air superiority at this time. McCudden still flew regularly as an observer with the new commanding Officer, Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt, who had taken over command on 20 November 1915. He recorded a flight of 2 hours 40 minutes on the 27 November which included an abortive chase after a Albatros C.I reconnaissance aircraft. On 16 December 1915 he acted as aerial gunner, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> off an attack on his flight by the German ace Max Immelmann. While firing at the Fokker, McCudden witnessed a piece of paper or fabric fall off the German machine. Although the ground was diligently searched, no trace of it was found. On 19 January 1916, McCudden exchanged fire with another German observer without result.|$|E
5|$|Sorenson {{ran into}} the {{rear-end}} of Dale Jarrett's car, who spun backwards into the turn four wall, prompting the third caution. Jarrett retired from the race <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> into his garage. All drivers elected to make pit stops for fuel under caution. Riggs maintained his lead at the lap-39 restart, followed by Kahne and Bowyer. Johnson got ahead of Sadler to move into eighth on lap 44. On lap 46, a fourth caution was given; after leaving turn two, Todd Kluever was hit by teammate Greg Biffle and spun on the backstretch, causing Ken Schrader and Petty to collide with Kluever. Michael Waltrip hit the wall in avoidance. Most drivers (including Riggs) chose to make pit stops for fuel. Earnhardt led at the lap-53 restart with the non-stopping cars of Edwards, Newman, Biffle and Sorenson following him. Riggs moved back into third place on lap 59 after passing Biffle and Newman. By lap 66, Earnhardt held a 1.78-second advantage over Edwards. Two laps later, Riggs passed Edwards to take over second place. Riggs closed the gap to Earnhardt, and was 1.5 seconds behind by lap 75. Green-flag pit stops began three laps later, with Earnhardt stopping on lap 79, giving the lead back to Riggs. Kahne and Riggs made pit stops on the 85th lap for scuffed right-hand tires.|$|E
50|$|James {{took out}} an {{insurance}} policy on his nephew Cornelius Wright, a young sailor. James invited Wright to visit {{him while he was}} on leave. During the subsequent visit, James allowed his nephew to use his car. Wright thereafter died <b>when</b> <b>he</b> purportedly <b>drove</b> the car off a cliff. The mechanic who towed the wreck back to James told him that something was wrong with the steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|Shahan was {{attracted}} to speed {{at a very young}} age - watching Formula 1 on television and collecting pictures of cars and engines ever since he was only four years old. <b>When</b> seven-years old, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> a recreational go-kart in Hyderabad and was then encouraged to take up competitive motorsport.|$|R
2500|$|The retreat caused Sir John French to {{question}} the competence of his Allies resulting in further indecision and led to his decision to withdraw the BEF south of the Seine. On 1 September, Lord Kitchener intervened by visiting French and ordering him to re-enter the battle and coordinate with Joffre's forces. The battle to defend Paris began on 5 September and {{became known as the}} first Battle of the Marne. Haig had wanted to rest his corps but was happy to resume the offensive <b>when</b> ordered. <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> on his subordinates, including Ivor Maxse, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> thought them lacking in [...] "fighting spirit". Although Sir John French praised Haig's leadership of his corps, Haig was privately contemptuous of French's overconfidence prior to Mons and excessive caution thereafter.|$|R
5|$|In {{spite of}} this, Morris started {{the new season}} consistently, scoring four fifties in his first five innings, {{including}} 55 and 39 in his state's victory over the touring South Africans ahead of the Tests. The on-field action against the South Africans brought no immediate upturn in Morris' Test fortunes. He made only one half-century {{and a total of}} 149 runs in the first three Tests as Australia took the series lead 2–1. In the Second Test, he had progressed to 42 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> Hugh Tayfield into a close fielder. The ball ballooned to mid-off and Tayfield ran back and dived parallel to the ball's trajectory and caught it. By the standards of the era, the catch was regarded as miraculous. He ended the series strongly, with 77 in the second innings of the Fourth Test in Adelaide, before making his best performances of 99 and 44 in Melbourne in the Fifth Test, which Australia lost by six wickets. Morris' 99 occurred when he was involved in a mix-up while batting with debutant Ian Craig, Australia's youngest ever Test cricketer. Morris decided to sacrifice his wicket for Craig's in a run out. His action meant that he had not scored a Test century for two years, and would have to wait another two years to reach the milestone again. Morris was widely praised for his unselfishness and his sacrifice for his new teammate. He ended the series with 370 runs at 41.11 and took his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide, that of John Watkins. The series ended 2–2, the first Test series in Morris' career that Australia had not won. Morris ended the season with 105 in a warm-up match before the tour of England and totalled 913 runs at 45.65 for the summer.|$|E
25|$|He {{would not}} score again until 18 January 1918, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> another {{two-seater}} {{down out of}} control, still using B2451. In February, he would use Camel B9131 to drive down an Albatros two-seater.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, Duesenberg {{provided}} the pace {{car for the}} Indy 500, driven by Fred Duesenberg. In 1923, Jimmy Murphy became the first American to win the French Grand Prix <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> a Duesenberg to victory at Le Mans.|$|E
50|$|Flying a Bristol F.2 two-seater, with Captain John Lloyd-Williams as his observer/gunner, Peck's first aerial victory came on 30 October 1917, forcing down a Type C {{reconnaissance}} aircraft north-west of Al-Khalasa, {{which was then}} captured. On 6 November he and Williams forced a Rumpler C to land at Um Dabkal, and on 8 November they shot down in flames an Albatros D.III over Hulayqat. On 17 November Peck was recommended for a Military Cross, following an action on 29 October <b>when</b> <b>he</b> single-handedly <b>drove</b> off three enemy {{reconnaissance aircraft}} over the Gaza Front.|$|R
60|$|One {{reason in}} fact why Beechnut had {{directed}} Stuyvesant not {{to open his}} note until he should reach the cars, was to give him something to occupy his attention and amuse his thoughts on first going away from home. The feeling of loneliness and home-sickness to be apprehended in traveling under such circumstances, is always much greater when first setting out on the journey than afterward, and Beechnut being aware of this, thought it desirable to give Stuyvesant something to think of <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>drove</b> away from the door.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996 he {{returned}} to Network Ten to be their [...] "motorsport expert" [...] for their coverage of the CART Series & Australian Super Touring Championship for which they had just gained the broadcasting rights, and which would also end up including Formula One. Crompton was a regular presenter of Ten's popular motoring magazine program, RPM, and after his racing career wound {{down at the end}} of 2002 until the end of 2006, he was the expert commentator on Ten's coverage of the V8 Supercars (after being lead commentator throughout 2001 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> only <b>drove</b> in endurance races).|$|R
25|$|He {{served on}} the Belgian Coast, first with 5 Naval Wing, then with 8 Naval Squadron from May through October 1916, and further inland for another year, through November 1917.

25|$|The 2006 {{season was}} one of {{numerous}} milestones for Jones. On June 10, he became the Atlanta Braves' all-time RBI leader <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> in his 1,144th run against the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park, passing former outfielder Dale Murphy and placing Jones third on the franchise's all-time list (including Braves teams based in Boston and Milwaukee), behind Hank Aaron (2,202) and Eddie Mathews (1,388).|$|E
25|$|On 22 February 1918, Forrest was {{promoted}} to captain. Forrest began his string of aerial victories on 22 March 1918, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> down a German two-seater reconnaissance aircraft out of control, followed by the destruction of two Albatros D.V fighters over Bullecourt. The next day, he set a German reconnaissance aircraft afire northeast of Bapaume. A week later, he drove down another over Le Quesnel to become an ace.|$|E
50|$|After Dillinger's death, Winstead helped {{track down}} Dillinger's former gang mate Lester Gillis/Baby Face Nelson, {{narrowly}} missing {{a confrontation with}} Nelson <b>when</b> <b>he</b> and Nelson <b>drove</b> past each other on a rural Illinois road.

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> {{had made}} his breakfast he, however, became {{sensible}} of a certain pique against both Mrs. Hastings and the girl, which led him to remember {{that he had no}} hired man, and that there was a good deal to be done.

His doubts and irritation grew weaker as he did so, and <b>when</b> at length <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> into sight of Hastings's homestead, his buoyant temperament was commencing to reassert itself. Clear sunshine streamed down upon the prairie out of a vault of cloudless blue, and he felt that after all any faint shadow that might have arisen between him and the girl could be readily swept away.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> {{had eaten}} his breakfast, however, he became {{sensible}} {{of a certain}} pique against both Mrs. Hastings and Agatha.

He decided that it might be well to wait until the afternoon before he called on Agatha, and for several hours <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> his team through the crackling stubble. His doubts and irritation grew weaker as <b>he</b> worked, and <b>when,</b> later, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> into sight of the Hastings homestead, his buoyant temperament was beginning to reassert itself. Clear sunshine streamed down upon the prairie out of a vault of cloudless blue, and he felt that any faint shadow that might have arisen between him and the girl could be readily swept away. He was a little less sure of this <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saw Agatha, who sat near an open window, in a scantily furnished match-boarded room. She had not slept at all. Her eyes were heavy, but there was a look of resolution in them which seemed out of place just then, and it struck him that she had lost the freshness which had been her distinguishing charm in England.|$|R
25|$|Jim Clark {{made his}} Brands Hatch debut at the Boxing Day event, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> the Border Reivers-entered Lotus Elite into second place behind Colin Chapman.

50|$|God's {{purpose in}} {{creating}} the world was {{so that he could}} reside amongst his creations. And, before Adam's sin, God did just that.

When Kayin (Cain) sinned, God ascended higher still, and so on due to the sins of the generation of Enosh, the generation of the flood, the generation of the Tower of Bavel, the Sodomites, and the Egyptians. In all, God ascended to the seventh heaven.|$|R
