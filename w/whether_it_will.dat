5|$|The Pleasure Beach Bridge is a movable Warren through-truss {{bridge in}} Bridgeport, Connecticut. Completed in 1927, it {{functioned as a}} toll bridge until the Great Depression, when it was {{transferred}} to the city of Bridgeport. Its service life came to an end after it was badly damaged by fire in 1996, cutting off access to Pleasure Beach. In the decade following the fire, several bonds to fund a new bridge were proposed, but ultimately fell through. Pleasure Beach has become the subject of debate, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> become an undisturbed protected salt marsh or be revitalized. An alternate method of access via water taxi service, first made possible by a grant in 2009, was not realized until 2013.|$|E

60|$|Nor <b>will</b> man miss <b>it.</b> For {{what man}} has sought for is, indeed, neither pain nor pleasure, but simply Life. Man {{has sought to}} live intensely, fully, perfectly. When he can do so without exercising {{restraint}} on others, or suffering it ever, and his activities are all pleasurable to him, he will be saner, healthier, more civilised, more himself. Pleasure is Nature's test, her sign of approval. When man is happy, he is in harmony with himself and his environment. The new Individualism, for whose service Socialism, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>wills</b> <b>it</b> or not, is working, will be perfect harmony. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> be what the Greeks sought for, but could not, except in Thought, realise completely, because they had slaves, and fed them; <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be what the Renaissance sought for, but could not realise completely except in Art, because they had slaves, and starved them. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> be complete, and through <b>it</b> each man <b>will</b> attain to his perfection.

50|$|One of {{the goals}} of weather {{forecasting}} is to help obtain better probability estimates for the occurrence of adverse events, so that the decisions made in the cost loss model are more informed and have higher quality. Examples include predicting <b>whether</b> or not <b>it</b> <b>will</b> rain, <b>whether</b> or not <b>it</b> <b>will</b> snow, and <b>whether</b> there will be a hurricane, cyclone, blizzard, tornado, heavy winds or extreme temperatures. The ability of decision makers to translate probabilistic information provided by forecasts into good decisions is therefore a measure of the utility of weather forecasting.|$|R

25|$|With {{regard to}} a ligand field and ligand field theory, {{the change in}} spin state is a {{transition}} from a low spin (LS) ground state electron configuration to a high spin (HS) ground state electron configuration of the metal’s d atomic orbitals (AOs), or vice versa. The magnitude of the ligand field splitting along with the pairing energy of the complex determines <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> have a LS or HS electron configuration. A LS state occurs because the ligand field splitting (Δ) {{is greater than the}} pairing energy of the complex (which is an unfavorable process).|$|E

25|$|The city {{is waiting}} to hear <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be {{selected}} by the Government of Ontario as the area for testing driverless cars on public roads. The entire city would become a test centre; this would require the installation of a major new digital infrastructure to enable communications between vehicles, with the roadway and with traffic signals. Preliminary testing of driverless cars has been done here already, by the Waterloo's Centre for Automotive Research, affiliated with the University, but the decision as to where the multimillion-dollar technology grid will be installed {{has not yet been}} made by the Province. The city's free Wi-Fi network may be of value to IT industries and is an indicator of its serious interest in advanced technology.|$|E
25|$|A solvent {{can carry}} a {{supersaturated}} load of gas in solution. <b>Whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> come out of solution in {{the bulk of the}} solvent to form bubbles will depend on a number of factors. Something which reduces surface tension, or adsorbs gas molecules, or locally reduces solubility of the gas, or causes a local reduction in static pressure in a fluid may result in a bubble nucleation or growth. This may include velocity changes and turbulence in fluids and local tensile loads in solids and semi-solids. Lipids and other hydrophobic surfaces may reduce surface tension (blood vessel walls may have this effect). Dehydration may reduce gas solubility in a tissue due to higher concentration of other solutes, and less solvent to hold the gas.|$|E
25|$|The town has, {{in recent}} years, raised the {{possibility}} of paving it, saying it would be cheaper to maintain and silts up a paralleling brook through erosion. This has divided residents along Old Albany Post Road. Opponents point to its historic designation, character and rural charm, which would be lost if it were surfaced. Proponents, many near the road's southern end, cite public safety concerns such as inaccessibility for police and fire vehicles during washouts in heavy storms like the April 2007 Nor'easter, which left craters four feet (1.3 m) deep in front of some driveways. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has given the town a grant to repair it, although it has not been decided <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be used for pavement or not.|$|E

25|$|A solvent {{can carry}} a {{supersaturated}} load of gas in solution. <b>Whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> come out of solution in {{the bulk of the}} solvent to form bubbles will depend on a number of factors. Something which reduces surface tension, or adsorbs gas molecules, or locally reduces solubility of the gas, or causes a local reduction in static pressure in a fluid may result in a bubble nucleation or growth.

Lipids and other hydrophobic surfaces may reduce surface tension (blood vessel walls may have this effect). Dehydration may reduce gas solubility in a tissue due to higher concentration of other solutes, and less solvent to hold the gas. Another theory presumes that microscopic bubble nuclei always exist in aqueous media, including living tissues. These bubble nuclei are spherical gas phases that are small enough to remain in suspension yet strong enough to resist collapse, their stability being provided by an elastic surface layer consisting of surface-active molecules which resists the effect of surface tension.|$|E
25|$|At common law, as for {{all forms}} of misrepresentation, {{innocent}} misrepresentation {{gave rise to the}} right to rescind a contract. It was not possible to get damages, but so long as one was not confronted by a bar to rescission, the misrepresentee had a right to escape the contract. When the Misrepresentation Act 1967 was passed, it was decided that this right to rescission could be used {{in a way that was}} unfair on a misrepresentor. So section 2(2) gives the court a discretion about <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> allow rescission of a contract, or substitute an appropriate award of damages in lieu (instead). In William Sindall plc v Cambridgeshire CC William Sindall plc claimed rescission of a land purchase from Cambridgeshire County Council on the ground that the council falsely (but innocently) stated there were no sewage pipes on the property. This would have cost £18,000 to remove, and the land had been bought for £5m. The real reason that William Sindall wanted to escape from the contract was that land prices had just crashed. The court held that in fact the contract had made the buyer assume any risk of such representations and there was no right to rescind. But if there had been, it would have exercised its discretion under s 2(2) to award a small sum of damages.|$|E

Giddens said, [...] "although {{some of the reasons}} for the events in the film were changed, the main storyline remained unchanged". Asked if he was pressured by the recent success of Taiwanese films at the box office, he replied [...] "No, I am more pressured by whether the film is nice to watch, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> succeed in the box office, and <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> become an embarrassment for me.
