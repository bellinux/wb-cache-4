25|$|The Second Estate (the nobility) {{consisted}} of approximately 1.5% of France's population, and was exempt from almost all taxes, including the Corvée Royale, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> mandatory service {{in which the}} roads would be repaired and built by those subject to the corvée. In practice, anyone who paid a small fee could escape the corvee, so this burden of labor fell only to the poorest in France. The Second Estate was also exempt from the Gabelle, which was the unpopular tax on salt, and also the Taille, the oldest form of taxation in France.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{found no}} {{evidence}} that by leaving the Amish community without two additional years of schooling, young Amish children would become burdens on society. To the contrary, the Court argued that they had good vocational background to rely upon. It was the State’s mistaken assumption that Amish children were ignorant. Compulsory education after elementary school <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> movement that developed in the early 20th century in order to prevent child labor and keep children of certain ages in school. The State of Wisconsin’s arguments about compelling the school attendance were therefore less substantial.|$|E
25|$|The Babylonians {{may have}} known the general rules for {{measuring}} areas and volumes. They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth {{the square of the}} circumference, which would be correct if π is estimated as 3. The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the base and the height, however, the volume of the frustum of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases. The Pythagorean theorem was also known to the Babylonians. Also, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> discovery in which a tablet used π as 3 and 1/8. The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile, which was a measure of distance equal to about seven miles today. This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time. There have been recent discoveries showing that ancient Babylonians may have discovered astronomical geometry nearly 1400 years before Europeans did.|$|E

25|$|Although less parsimonious than recent gene flow, the {{observation}} {{may have been}} due to ancient population sub-structure in Africa, causing incomplete genetic homogenization within modern humans when Neanderthals diverged while early ancestors of Eurasians were still more closely related to Neanderthals than those of Africans to Neanderthals. On the basis of allele frequency spectrum, it was shown that the recent admixture model had the best fit to the results while the ancient population sub-structure model had no fit–demonstrating that the best model <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> admixture event that was preceded by a bottleneck event among modern humans—thus confirming recent admixture as the most parsimonious and plausible explanation for the observed excess of genetic similarities between modern non-African humans and Neanderthals. On the basis of linkage disequilibrium patterns, a recent admixture event is likewise confirmed by the data. From the extent of linkage disequilibrium, it was estimated that the last Neanderthal gene flow into early ancestors of Europeans occurred 47,000–65,000 years BP. In conjunction with archaeological and fossil evidence, the gene flow is thought likely to have occurred somewhere in Western Eurasia, possibly the Middle East. Through another approach—using one genome each of a Neanderthal, Eurasian, African, and chimpanzee (outgroup), and dividing it into non-recombining short sequence blocks—to estimate genome-wide maximum-likelihood under different models, an ancient population sub-structure in Africa was ruled out and a Neanderthal admixture event was confirmed.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Graeme married Henry Fergusson on April 21, 1772 {{without her}} father's consent. This caused quite {{a problem for}} the newlyweds. Henry and Elizabeth had been {{introduced}} to each other by Dr. Benjamin Rush, a founding father of Pennsylvania, on December 7, 1771 at one of the salons hosted by Elizabeth and Dr. Graeme. Fergusson <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> and penniless Scottish Immigrant and he was eleven years younger than Elizabeth. Both of these qualities made him a less than ideal suitor for Elizabeth's hand in marriage and Dr. Graeme forbade that they marry. Four months after they met, Henry and Elizabeth married secretly in Old Swede's Church. Only their close friends attended, including Benjamin Rush, Provost William Smith and his wife. Despite her father's disapproval, Elizabeth had vowed to let her marriage be known. Ironically, the day on which she decided to tell him the news was the day that he suffered his fatal heart attack, with Elizabeth watching him approach Graeme Park through a window of the mansion. Elizabeth was never able to tell of her marriage. She was Dr. Graeme's only living heir, she inherited Graeme Park and by right of marriage Henry Fergusson gained title to the property. With his sudden new fortune Henry Fergusson was able to quickly ascend the Philadelphia society ladder. He traveled to England twice, became director of a prominent Philadelphia library and was awarded the title magistrate in Philadelphia. He was the last magistrate of Philadelphia under British colonial rule. He sailed once more for England in late 1775 just as the American Revolution was beginning to gather steam. He returned to Philadelphia by way of New York City as a loyalist with Sir William Howe commander of the British forces in American. With Howe, Fergusson witnessed the Battle of Brandywine and the occupation of Philadelphia during the Philadelphia campaign. Fergusson involved his wife in his activities by sending her as a messenger to General George Washington to ask for his surrender and to present a bribe to a major in the Continental Army. Both of these incidents caused the Patriots of Philadelphia to doubt her loyalty. There was no doubt about where Henry Fergusson's loyalties lay. He was found a traitor by the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania and Graeme Park was seized under the Confiscation Act of 1778.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century the Spanish colonies, {{in what is}} known as the Latin American wars of independence, began to revolt against Spanish rule. Antonio Valero de Bernabé was a Puerto Rican {{military}} leader known in Latin America as the [...] "Liberator from Puerto Rico". Valero <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> graduate of the Spanish Military Academy when Napoleon Bonaparte convinced King Charles IV of Spain to permit him to pass through Spanish soil with the sole purpose of attacking Portugal. When Napoleon refused to leave, the Spanish government declared war. Valero joined the Spanish Army and helped defeat Napoleon's army at the Siege of Saragossa. Valero became a hero; he was promoted to the rank of colonel and was awarded many decorations.|$|E

500|$|Jennens's {{letter to}} Holdsworth of 10 July 1741, {{in which he}} first {{mentions}} Messiah, suggests that the text <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> work, probably assembled earlier that summer. As a devout Anglican and believer in scriptural authority, Jennens intended to challenge advocates of Deism, who rejected the doctrine of divine intervention in human affairs. Shaw describes the text as [...] "a meditation of our Lord as Messiah in Christian thought and belief", and despite his reservations on Jennens's character, concedes that the finished wordbook [...] "amounts to little short {{of a work of}} genius". There is no evidence that Handel played any active role in the selection or preparation of the text, such as he did in the case of Saul; it seems, rather, that he saw no need to make any significant amendment to Jennens's work.|$|E
500|$|The reliquary exuberantly {{exploits}} the ronde bosse or [...] "encrusted" [...] enamelling technique, {{which involves}} creating small three-dimensional figures coated in enamel {{on a metal}} core, often just gold wire. [...] The technique <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> innovation which the goldsmiths working for the Valois were pushing to its limits {{at the end of}} the 14th century. [...] The main colour of enamel used is a lead-based white, which had also only been developed a decade or two at most before the date of the reliquary, and was evidently very fashionable {{at the end of the}} century. [...] White dominates the few surviving large enamels in ronde bosse dated to the period beginning about 1380 and ending about 1410, used as here for both the clothes and flesh of the figures. [...] Gold is used for their hair, and other enamel colours are mostly used at the neck and cuffs to demarcate between white robes and white flesh; [...] "throughout, colour is used in a very considered way"; [...] "a controlled use of red includes the alternation of rubies and pearls", except where [...] "a single sapphire interrupts this rhythm" [...] above God the Father. [...] Blue, an important enamel colour in other works, is almost entirely absent here, perhaps so as not to overshadow the large sapphires.|$|E
500|$|The three {{producers}} sought Chinese, or {{at least}} Asian, actors to fill the cast, an idea that was, at the time, considered [...] "very risky". [...] In the 1950s, there were relatively few Asian-American actors; Rodgers believed that Asians avoided acting because of shyness. [...] Critics note, in any case, that Asian-Americans [...] "had found few opportunities in mainstream theatre." [...] Joshua Logan recommended a young Japanese actress, Miyoshi Umeki, whom he had discovered and cast the previous year opposite Marlon Brando in the film Sayonara (for which she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar); she was cast as Mei Li. [...] They cast Keye Luke, well known as Charlie Chan's Number One Son, as Master Wang. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein considered young talent from The King and I who might fit the parts, {{and came up with}} teenager Patrick Adiarte, a Filipino-American who had played several of the young princes as he grew up, before finishing as the crown prince, Chulalongkorn. [...] A talented dancer, he was cast as Wang San, Ta's thoroughly Americanized younger brother. [...] Pat Suzuki, a Japanese-American who had been interned during World War II, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> arrival in New York who had made strong positive impressions for her singing on such television programs as The Tonight Show (with Jack Paar) and The Ed Sullivan Show.
