5|$|Duchesne {{now called}} on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd {{to counter the}} defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had {{suddenly}} abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane {{and said that he}} was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant.</b> Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able {{to understand the nature of}} what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.|$|E

500|$|Although Karofsky {{begins the}} second season as an {{ordinary}} jock bully, Murphy hinted to Adler {{that there would be}} more in store for the character. According to Adler, Murphy approached him at {{the second season}} premiere and said, we just wrote some really good stuff for you for episode six'." [...] The actor recalls, [...] "I had no idea <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant,</b> until I read it!" [...] Adler had long wondered why his character behaved the way he did: [...] "I thought there's got to be a reason why he's so angry, why he's such a bully, why he's going {{out of his way to}} make other people's lives a living hell". Although he had considered various ideas for Karofsky—"maybe he was jealous of the glee club, maybe he was gay, maybe a million different things"—when he got the script for that episode he [...] "was just as shocked as anybody else" [...] when his character kissed Kurt, though he [...] "thought it was so awesome that they would allow this character to go there." ...|$|E

500|$|James {{had several}} unique {{experiences}} while {{living with the}} Smith family in Nauvoo. She recorded that often, as she went about doing the washing and cleaning for the Smiths, either Emma (Joseph's wife) or Lucy (Joseph's mother) would stop her and talk with her. One day while James was in Joseph's mother's room, the woman told her to [...] "bring me that bundle from the bureau and sit down here." [...] According to Jane, she was shown the Urim and Thummim, the tools used by Joseph Smith to translate the Book of Mormon. Lucy then said to her, [...] "You will live long after I am dead and gone {{and you can tell}} the Latter-day Saints that you was permitted to handle the Urim and Thummim". Another time, Emma asked James if she would like to be adopted by and sealed to her and Joseph. Not understanding at the time, James said nothing. Emma encouraged her to think about it. Two weeks later, she asked James again, at which time she said [...] "no m'am". James would say later that she did not understand <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant,</b> or she would have taken the couple up on their offer. This early decision {{had a significant impact on}} James' later life as a member of the Latter Day Saint church.|$|E
500|$|Featured music {{includes}} The Dixie Chicks' [...] "Lullaby", Tegan and Sara's [...] "Take Me Anywhere", Sleeping at Last's [...] "Quicksand", Emilíana Torrini's [...] "Nothing Brings Me Down", Gnarls Barkley's [...] "Gone Daddy Gone", Grant Lee Phillips's [...] "Under the Milky Way" [...] and Matt Kearney's [...] "All I Need". Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel like so much happened {{at the end of last}} season that I owe it to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And I owe it to the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant,</b> and she never had a chance to put those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It was mean to bring us to a place where we can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. Just remember that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{decision}} was overruled, one aspect of it survived Rodriguez de Quijas: Reed's dictum that [...] "manifest disregard" [...] for the law {{would be enough to}} justify a court's overturning an arbitral award. Later courts and commentators have puzzled over <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> and whether it arose from the text of the FAA or independently. The Court itself would face that question in the 2008 Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., although without resolving it to much satisfaction.|$|E
2500|$|Gaye {{was still}} working on the track when David Ritz, then a {{reviewer}} for Rolling Stone, arrived at Ostend to locate Gaye's whereabouts, despite Gaye's and Couseart's rules that no musical critic {{would be allowed to}} talk to the singer. The story has been disputed on how the lyrics to [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] were devised. Ritz claims that Gaye had been viewing sadomasochism comic books and advised Gaye he needed [...] "sexual healing". When Ritz further explained to Gaye <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant,</b> Gaye told him to [...] "write a poem" [...] while Gaye came up with the melody. However, Gaye's closest friends dispute that claim.|$|E

He completed Edmunds High School (now Sumter High School) class of 1947 in Sumter, South Carolina, where he once again lived with his mother. Recounting this period in his life, he once said, [...] "In the place where I was a child, there were no artists {{and there was no}} art, so I really didn't know <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant.</b> I think I thought it meant that I would be in a situation different than the one that I was in." ...|$|E

[...] Speaking for myself, in certain spots I do not look without a little sadness on a new red-tiled tavern, remembering a loam cottage with a moss-covered thatched roof that used to be there. [...] Since then there have come beet-sugar factories, railways, agricultural developments of the heath, etc., which is infinitely less picturesque." ...|$|E

I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out.

And, of course, <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E

[...] He then criticised Ben Ali's comments as the protesters were [...] "claiming their civil rights, and there is no terrorist act...no religious slogans," [...] while accusing Ben Ali of [...] "looking for scapegoats."

2500|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by Wilson, who intended to encapsulate {{the feel of the}} Drifters' version of [...] "On Broadway". The instrumental was made on April 6, 1965 at United Western Recorders, requiring 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players. The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "You're Grass and I'm a Power Mower". Wilson remembers: [...] "When we got into the studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl’s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant.</b> 'Can he play it in the booth?' Chuck said. I had never thought about that before, but {{it seemed like a good}} idea.
