5|$|Hundreds of books, {{articles}} and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS {{recognized as an}} important subgroup. <b>Whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be seen as distinct from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study, and {{there are questions about}} the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. In 2013, DSM-5 eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis, folding it into the autism spectrum on a severity scale.|$|E

High numbers (95% according to the Home Office) of street prostitutes in the United Kingdom {{have a history of}} substance abuse, and prostitution is one means of funding addiction, known to have been used by all five of the victims.|$|E
5|$|The state {{government}} {{made the decision}} to decommission Fremantle Prison in 1983, but it remained in operation until 30 November 1991. Prisoners were moved to a new metropolitan maximum security prison at Casuarina. There were divergent views in the community over the site's future, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be preserved or redeveloped. The ultimate decision was for conservation of the prison, but allowing for the buildings to be adapted for reuse by the community.|$|E
50|$|Lane {{splitting}} {{is controversial}} in the United States, and is sometimes {{an issue in}} other countries. People debate <b>whether</b> or not <b>it</b> is legal, <b>whether</b> or not <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be legal, and <b>whether</b> or not <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be practiced regardless of legality. Bills to legalize lane splitting have been introduced in state legislatures around the US over {{the last twenty years}} but none had been enacted until California's legislature passed such a bill in August, 2016.|$|R

The Central University's endowment, {{along with some of}} the colleges', is managed by the university's wholly owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007. The university has substantial investments in fossil fuel companies, and in 2014 began consultations on <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> follow some US universities which have committed to sell off their fossil fuel investments.|$|E
5|$|A {{parliamentary}} {{inquiry and}} media reports {{indicated that the}} Indigenous traditional owners of Muckaty Station were divided over <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> host a radioactive waste facility. Some members of the Ngapa clan supported hosting the facility, while other traditional owners of Muckaty opposed it. There were also claims that {{some members of the}} Ngapa clan were among those who had signed a petition opposing the facility. Political scientist Rebecca Stringer criticised the federal government's approach to the siting of the waste facility, arguing that it undermined the Indigenous owners' sovereignty and control of their own lands. Environmental organisations and the Australian Greens are opposed to using the site for a dump.|$|E
5|$|The Levels were {{frequently}} flooded {{by the sea}} during high tides, a problem that was not resolved until the sea defences were enhanced in the early 20thcentury. In addition, the problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by the unrestricted entry of the tide along the Parrett, {{which is the only}} river in the Levels and Moors that does not have a clyse on it. Discussions on whether a clyse is needed for the Parrett and <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be sited at Bridgwater or nearer the mouth of the river date back to 1939, at the start of World War II, and have not been resolved.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} met in Limoges {{and then}} withdrew to Poitiers and Bordeaux, {{but as the}} French military situation deteriorated, became split over what should happen. The government was split between those who supported staying in France or staying with the French government and those who supported withdrawing to the United Kingdom. Pierlot supported retreating to London, but was keen to preserve the unity of his government, most of which supported remaining in France. Hoping to keep the Belgian Congo under Belgian sovereignty, Pierlot allowed the Minister of the Colonies, Albert de Vleeschauwer, to leave France while the government met to consider <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> resign {{to make way for}} a new constitutional authority in occupied Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle was {{increasingly}} resembling a private house, rather than purely a fortification, and {{this led to}} arguments in 1829 as to <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be subject to local taxation as a private dwelling, or continue to be exempt as a military site. The captaincy had long since become an honorary position, given out as a reward by the Crown. In 1898, the War Office agreed that the Office of Works should be consulted over any external alterations to the historic castle, and that the Office of Works {{would be responsible for}} paying for any resulting work. The War Office finally concluded in 1904 that the castle no longer had any value either as a defence or as a barracks, and transferred it entirely to the Office of Works. When the captain was not in residence it was opened to visitors.|$|E
5|$|The British {{decided to}} {{despatch}} {{one of their}} Commonwealth ministers to Rhodesia for talks during early July, but debated for a while over <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be Bottomley or his deputy, Cledwyn Hughes, who should be sent. Wilson considered this a matter of urgency as he had heard a rumour that Rhodesia might declare independence on its main national holiday, Rhodes' Day (that year 12 July), but this proved false. On 15 July, Britain's High Commissioner to Rhodesia, John Baines Johnston, was instructed to propose a week-long round of talks between Smith and Hughes in Salisbury. Johnston was given permission to cave if the Rhodesian Prime Minister insisted on meeting with Bottomley, but this did not prove necessary: Smith cabled back on the 18th accepting Hughes' visit. The British delegation arrived in Salisbury four days later.|$|E

5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

They had recorded 18 songs, enough material to possibly release as double-album. Having previously released the double-LP London Calling (1979) and the triple-LP Sandinista!

25|$|In the 1990s {{there was}} a debate among Kvens whether they should be {{considered}} as an ethnic group of their own, or whether they were Finnish Norwegians.

40|$|A central {{controversy}} in the debate about Medicare is whether the program spends too much money or <b>whether</b> instead <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be expanded to cover more. I consider the value of increased Medicare spending. I argue that on average Medicare spending is worth it: the health gains brought by medicare have been greater than their cost. At the margin, however, services are overused and have low value. Medicare reforms need to promote the high average value of care while eliminating care of low value. Many of the proposed reforms fall short of this goal. ...|$|R
