5|$|There was {{a simpler}} {{performance}} on tape {{and a more}} difficult one, with Mariah singing out more, with more licks. But we chose a happy medium. The song really calls for not anything really fancy. But she's always fighting the forces inside of her because she's her own devil's advocate. She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that's so {{over the top and}} use her talents and the voice she has. But she also knows she has to restrain herself and do what the music really calls for.|$|E

One day, after being {{rejected}} by the citizens of Ritardando, because average people think the magic disease is contagious, she decides that she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> with her life before it ends. The initial party wants to find out why the mineral powder is so cheap compared to the floral powder and to stop the mining of Mt. Rock to acquire it because the mining damages Agogo Forest. As they progress, the party learns that the mineral powder has fatal side effects that would aid Forte's insurrection against its enemy, Baroque. Realising this, the party heads for Forte, but are stopped and taken into the Forte dungeon because Forte was alerted to the planned arrival of the rebellion group, Andantino. Shortly after escaping, the party unites with Andantino and are spotted by the same Forte personnel south of Fort Fermata (which is a short walk from Forte), and fall off a bridge into a river. Half of the party, along with Andantino, go through poisonous swamps to Andante, the hideout of Andantino. The other half of the party were saved by Prince Crescendo of Baroque, with his ship. They encounter pirates and defeat them shortly thereafter. After getting safely into Baroque, the party discuss the situation. Forte is threatening a war, but Baroque wants peace. Crescendo thinks of the plan to assassinate Count Waltz of Forte, but the plan is quickly discarded.|$|E

He explained: [...] "We've {{held back}} on the reissues of those albums because of the current Sabbath thing with Ozzy Osbourne, but they will certainly be happening... I'd {{like to do a}} couple of new tracks for those releases with Tony Martin... I'll also be looking at working on Cross Purposes and Forbidden." [...] Martin has suggested that this could coincide with the 30th anniversary of The Eternal Idol, in 2017. In an interview that August, Martin added [...] " [...] still has his cancer issues of course and that may well stop it all from happening but if he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> I am ready."

6000|$|The next act {{closed the}} ceremonies, {{and was a}} moving surprise. It may be that you have discovered, before this, that the rigors of {{military}} law and custom melt insensibly away and disappear when a soldier or a regiment or the garrison <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that will please Cathy. The bands conceived the idea of stirring her soldierly heart with a farewell which would remain in her memory always, beautiful and unfading, and bring back the past and its love for her whenever she should think of it; so they got their project placed before General Burnaby, my successor, who is Cathy's newest slave, {{and in spite of}} poverty of precedents they got his permission.

Their {{newspapers}} shout you down. It's such a damned fine world for the few: never mind the many. My father was a farm labourer: and all his life he never earned more than thirteen and sixpence a week. I left when I was twelve {{and went into the}} mines. There were six of us children; and my mother brought us up healthy and decent. She fed us and clothed us and sent us to school; and when she died we buried her with the money she had put by for the purpose; and never a penny of charity had ever soiled her hands. I can see them now. Talk of your Chancellors of the Exchequer and their problems! She worked herself to death, of course. Well, that's all right. One doesn't mind that where one loves. If they would only let you. She had no opposition to contend with--no thwarting and hampering at every turn--the very people you are working for hounded on against you. The difficulty of a man like myself, who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> who could do something, is that for the best part of his life he is fighting to be allowed to do it. By the time I've lived down their lies and got my chance, my energy will be gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... § 10. I {{separate}} these classes, {{in order}} that their character may be clearly understood; but of course they are united each to the other by imperceptible transitions, and the same mind, according to the influences {{to which it is}} subjected, passes at different times into the various states. Still, the difference between the great and less man is, on the whole, chiefly in this point of alterability. That is to say, the one knows too much, and perceives and feels too much of the past and future, and of all things beside and around that which immediately affects him, to be in any wise shaken by it. His mind is made up; his thoughts have an accustomed current; his ways are steadfast; it is not this or that new sight which will at once unbalance him. He is tender to impression at the surface, like a rock with deep moss upon it; but there is too much mass of him to be moved. The smaller man, with the same degree of sensibility, is at once carried off his feet; he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> {{he did not want to}} do before; he views all the universe in a new light through his tears; he is gay or enthusiastic, melancholy or passionate, as things come and go to him. Therefore the high creative poet might even be thought, to a great extent, impassive (as shallow people think Dante stern), receiving indeed all feelings to the full, but having a great centre of reflection and knowledge in which he stands serene, and watches the feeling, as it were, from far off.|$|E
