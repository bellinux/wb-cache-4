Daniels was already sure of his sexuality in his teens, {{although he did not}} discuss the matter with his parents because they did not have a very close emotional relationship. He was [...] "cautious about mentioning it when I left drama school, because AIDS <b>was</b> <b>terrifying</b> everyone and there was a huge homophobic backlash". He decided to come out at the age of 24, while appearing in an all-star benefit performance of Martin Sherman's Bent.|$|E
500|$|A 1997 {{review in}} Salon {{stated that the}} novel could almost be {{described}} as propaganda, and <b>was</b> <b>terrifying</b> as a result, particularly in its belief that the boot camp had to be an ingredient of any civilization. This {{was described as a}} highly unusual utopian vision. [...] Moorcock stated that the lessons Rico learns in boot camp: [...] "wars are inevitable, [...] that the army is always right". In discussing the book's utility in classroom discussions of the form of government, Alan Myers stated that its depiction of the military was of an [...] "unashamedly Earth-chauvinist nature". In the words of science fiction scholar Darko Suvin, Starship Troopers was an [...] "unsubtle but powerful black-and-white paean to combat life", and an example of agitprop in favor of military values.|$|E

When we finished, {{she told me she}} had never been that nervous before. That was crazy to me -- I was thinking, 'You're Madonna, you're on stage all the time!'". She returned to Europe and sang the song Sanremo Music Festival. At the end of the performance, she thanked the audience in Italian language, and received standing ovation. Madonna did rehearse the song for 2004's Re-Invention World Tour, but it was ultimately cut from the setlist and not included in the show.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the park}} and Twitter posts {{selected}} by news media, public response during the soft opening was positive; Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults. On Coaster101.com [...] "Ashley" [...] said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: [...] "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach {{at the top of the}} tower, you take it with you to the bottom." [...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>terrifying</b> and thrilling and I held on as hard as I could and yelled and closed my eyes and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E

They became her [...] "fantasy friends" [...] whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously, helping her through a difficult marriage, and a longing for a life she did not feel she was free to live. [...] "I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, and I was going to make it a good thing," [...] she remembered. Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing Odd Girl Out, she set out to gain what she termed [...] "fieldwork experience" [...] in her trips to Greenwich Village, and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern California. But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very Victorian wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.' As easy as it might be if you were a young woman in today's generation to think that was exaggerating, it wasn't. It <b>was</b> <b>terrifying.</b>|$|E

500|$|IGN's Matt Fowler {{wrote in}} his review, [...] "At this point, {{it seems like the}} pattern {{when it comes to the}} ninth episode of a given season of Game of Thrones is tragic death, amazing battle, tragic death, amazing battle, and so on. And this being Season 6, it was time to land on a phenomenal clash of swords and shields - and 'Battle of the Bastards' {{certainly}} delivered." [...] He continued, [...] "Game of Thrones did not disappoint when it came to this season's great northern battle, as Jon and Sansa's differences were spectacularly highlighted in a savagely strong war chapter that saw House Stark overcome huge odds to reclaim their home. Plus, Daenerys got to soar, as her dragons quickly stopped a violent siege with fury and fire." [...] Fowler gave the episode a top score of 10. Jeremy Egner of The New York Times also praised the episode: [...] "As directed by Miguel Sapochnik, who also oversaw last season's terrific 'Hardhome' episode, the lengthy sequence <b>was</b> <b>terrifying,</b> gripping and exhilarating, sometimes all at once, a sweeping display of all the different ways one can die on the battlefield." [...] Egner called Ramsay's death an episode highlight ("Ramsay Bolton's demise was arguably the most eagerly anticipated death ever on Game of Thrones and the show handled it with flair, dispatching him in a poetic, canine-fueled fashion that was no less satisfying for being telegraphed early on"), and concluded about Daenerys's scene: [...] "Daenerys Stormborn had a few words for the slave masters who launched their attack last week. Those words included 'surrender or die' and 'thanks for the ships', as we saw another thrilling action sequence that I believe reunited the dragon triplets for the first time since they were quite young." [...] Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{wrote in his}} review, [...] "This battle works as a climactic moment for Game of Thrones as a cultural event, selling us on the scale and ambition of the producers and their production teams, all who should be commended for the accomplishments from a technical perspective." [...] According to James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Was this the show's best episode? It's hard to immediately process that question. Maybe? Probably. It's almost certainly the most exciting hour and had the most jaw-dropping battle sequence we've seen yet on TV." ...|$|E

He would rampage through the newsroom with his arms flailing like a windmill, scratching himself manically as he fired himself up."

2500|$|For lead actor Jeremy Irvine, {{starring}} {{in his first}} film role, the filming process was intense at times, in particular the scene where the British cavalry, 130 horses in total and many hundreds of extras, charged the German machine gun lines. He explained: [...] "It’s the weapons of the old world—our men on horses—meeting the absolute destruction of these tools of mass slaughter. There was this line of machine guns and there’s this wall of lead coming out of these guns. There were real explosions at my feet, bodies flying through the air, stunt men getting shot at. It <b>was</b> <b>terrifying.</b> The smoke and the smell and {{the taste of the}} guns firing. It’s not difficult to act scared in that situation. There’s no doubt this was deliberate: not only to have the film look great, but to have that effect on the actors. It was an eye-opening scene." ...|$|E

Michael's single, [...] "Jesus to a Child", is a tribute to Feleppa (Michael consistently dedicated it to him before performing it live), as is his album Older (1996). In 2008, speaking about the loss of his partner Feleppa, Michael said: [...] "It was a terribly depressing time. It took about three years to grieve, then after that I lost my mother.
