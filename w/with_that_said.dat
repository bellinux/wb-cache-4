Catastrophic loss of honeybees could have significant impact, therefore; {{it is estimated that}} seven out of the 60 major agricultural crops in North American economy would be lost, and this is only for one region of the world. Farms that have intensive systems (high density of crops) will be impacted the most compared to non-intensive systems (small local gardens that depend on wild bees) because of dependence on honeybees. These types of farms have a high demand for honeybee pollination services, which in the U.S. alone costs $1.25 billion annually. This cost is offset, however, as honeybees as pollinators generate 22.8 to 57 billion Euros globally.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{attention}} it received after its rediscovery, the Astronomica has never been as widely studied as other classical Latin poems. <b>With</b> <b>that</b> <b>said,</b> interest in the poem developed {{in the second half}} of the 20th century when scholars began to study Manilius's philosophical and scientific ideas. The first full-length English monograph on Manilius and the Astronomica was Volk's Manilius and His Intellectual Background, which was published in 2009. Two years later, Volk and Green edited Forgotten Stars: Rediscovering Manilius' Astronomica with essays from scholars worldwide. The book's purpose was to [...] "encourage readers to discover Manilius" [...] and expand scholarly interest in the Astronomica, since previous research of the work's poetic, scientific, and philosophical themes had been primarily limited to Germany, France, and Italy. And while Manilius and his poem have been analyzed by scholars, many lay readers find the Astronomica confusing and overly technical. According to Kristine Louise Haugen, [...] "The ambiguous phrases and extravagant circumlocutions necessitated by Manilius's hexameter verse must often have made the Astronomica seem, as it does today, rather like a trigonometry textbook rendered as a Saturday New York Times crossword." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Free Free" [...] was written, composed, arranged, {{produced}} and recorded by Nakata himself. Musically, [...] "Free Free" [...] {{is the creation}} of a newly founded genre by Nakata titled Eropop, which he generated by combining 1980s pop, house and disco music; furthermore, the single also incorporates influences of contemporary EDM. In a review by CD Journal, an editor agreed, and also noted the songs style as [...] "80s nostalgic" [...] and [...] "ultra-pop". Conversely, Kyle from Arama Japan noticed its strong influence of house music, and branded it a [...] "J-electro" [...] track. The track was recorded with [...] "Super Music Maker" [...] between June–July 2007 at Nakata's home studio and Avex Studios in Tokyo, Japan, and was co-distributed by Nakata's record label Contemode, which was owned by Avex and Yamaha. Suzuki's vocals were processed with pro-tools such as autotune and vocoder, all programmed and managed to Nakata. The lyrical content of the recording is based on the theme of freedom and having fun. <b>With</b> <b>that</b> <b>said,</b> erotica is another factor that inspired the tracks lyrics and Suzuki's image for the track; she commented [...] "the theme [...] is to sound erotic,". Additionally, it is the singer's first English language track, whereas minor Japanese sentences were added into the pre-chorus section.|$|E
500|$|According to Volk, [...] "The basic {{tenet of}} {{what we might call}} Manilius' natural {{philosophy}} is the idea that the universe is divine". <b>With</b> <b>that</b> <b>said,</b> she contends that the poet is inconsistent {{when it comes to the}} location of this divinity. For instance, in his first book, Manilius claims that the perfectly regular movement of the heavenly bodies is proof that the universe is the product of a god, but at the same time he asserts that the universe itself is also a god (mundum ... ipsum esse deum). Later in the same book, Manilius once again argues that the universe is the [...] "work of a great divinity" [...] (magni ... numinis ordo). Concerning this vacillation, Volk writes: [...] "It is clear that there is a certain elasticity to Manilius' concept of the divinity of the universe ... Is the world simply ruled by a diuinum numen (cf. 1.484) or is it a deus (cf 1.485) itself?" [...] Volk answers that in the cosmology of the Astronomica, [...] "God can be understood as the soul or breath ... present within the world [...] since this divine entity completely pervades the cosmos, it makes equally much sense to call the cosmos itself a god." [...] According to Volk, this interpretation of the universewhich states that it has a sense of intellect and that it operates in an orderly waythus allows Manilius to contend both that there is an unbroken chain of cause and effect impacting everything within the cosmos, [...] and that fate rules all.|$|E

The singer also discussed the meaning of the song by saying, [...] "What I love about this song is, it takes you through this journey. You're flirting and you're talking all of your arrogant [...] Then you climax, and then you have your cigarette... This song actually is about singing from the heart, and harmonies and adlibs and arrangement". During the same video, she praised Timberlake and Miguel's work; the clip also showed footage of Beyoncé recording the song in the studio.|$|E

2500|$|The ethical and/or moral {{premises}} of healthcare {{are complex and}} intricate.

It is an institution of which we are all a part whether we like it or not. At some point in every person's life, a decision has to be made regarding one's healthcare. Can they afford it? Do they deserve it? Do they need it? Where should they go to get it? Do they even want it? And it is this last question which poses the biggest dilemma facing a person. After weighing all of the costs and benefits of her healthcare situation, the person has to decide if the costs of healthcare outweigh the benefits. More than basic economic issues are at stake in this conundrum. In fact, a person must decide whether or not their life is ending or if it is worth salvaging. Of course, in instances where the patient is unable to decide due to medical complications, like a coma, then the decision must come from elsewhere. And defining that [...] "elsewhere" [...] has proven to be a very difficult endeavor in healthcare philosophy.|$|E

2500|$|Contemporary sociolinguistic {{studies suggest}} that styles are learned, rather than {{assigned}} {{at the time of}} birth. <b>With</b> <b>that</b> <b>said,</b> identities emerge in a time series of social practice, through the combined effects of structure and agency. Because social identities are not static, the speech community model, which was traditionally employed as a sociolinguistic framework in the study of language and gender, is not as reliable as the community of practice model, the new framework emerged from practice theory. Also because social identities are not static, speech styles are actively subject to change, such that one's speech styles have different social meanings across time. Similarly, it is possible for an individual to engage in multiple identity practices simultaneously, and move from one identity to another unconsciously and automatically, and thus the term polyphonous identity. Podesva (2004) is a paper that studies recordings of a gay medical student, whom he called [...] "Heath", as he moved through different situations {{in the course of his}} everyday life. The fact that Heath's pronunciation of the voiceless alveolar stop, /t/, varies when he deals with different groups of people suggest not only some of gay people's speech features, but also the multiplicity of a person's social identity. Furthermore, Podesva also examined the relationship between the California Vowel Shift (CVS) and the gay identity, again by investigating intra-speaker patterns in a single individual, Regan, as opposed to inter-speaker variation, and found that Regan, who is a self-identified gay Asian American, realized CVS differently depending on the context, whether it be a [...] "boys' night out," [...] "dinner with friend," [...] or [...] "meeting with supervisor". This cross-situational patterns are critical in the sense that an individual's speech styles can change not only across time, but also across space, depending on which social identity the individual is attempting to engage in under a given situation. Over-generalizations of social identity, however, overlook this intra-speaker variability.|$|E
