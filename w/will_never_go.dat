500|$|David Calvert-Smith, for the prosecution, {{alleged that}} the detectives' {{supposedly}} contemporaneous notes of the fifth interview with Silcott had been altered after the fact to include the self-incriminating remarks. Silcott had refused to answer questions during the first four interviews. During the fifth, when told there were witness statements that he had struck Blakelock with a machete or similar, the notes show him saying: [...] "Those kids <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> to court.

Those kids <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> to court. You wait and see. No one else will talk to you. You can't keep me away from them." [...] The notes show him saying of the murder weapons: [...] "You're too slow, man, they gone."

500|$|The {{tribes of}} Southern Saudi Arabia and Northern Yemen were closely linked, and the Saudis enticed {{thousands}} of Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia {{to assist the}} royalist cause. In addition to the Saudis and British, the Iraqis also sent plane loads of Baathist Yemenis to undermine Sallal's regime. The royalists fought for the Imam despite his father's unpopularity. One sheik said [...] "The Imams have ruled us for a thousand years. Some were good and some bad. We killed the bad ones sooner or later, and we prospered under the good ones". The hill tribes were Shia, like the Imam, while the Yemenis of the coast and the south were Sunni, as were most Egyptians. President Sallal was himself a mountain Shia fighting with lowland Sunnis. Al-Badr himself was convinced that he was Nasser's biggest target, saying [...] "Now I'm getting my reward for befriending Nasser. We were brothers, but when I refused to become his stooge, he used Sallal against me. I will never stop fighting. I <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> into exile.

500|$|According {{to former}} {{president}} Victor Yushchenko the March 9, 2010 parliamentary amendment {{that made it}} possible for individual members of a parliamentary faction to join a coalition violated the Ukrainian Constitution, former Minister of Internal Affairs Yuriy Lutsenko accused Yanukovych of [...] "trying to buy members of parliament for a new coalition" [...] (President Viktor Yanukovych accused Lutsenko of badly handling the affairs at the Ministry of Internal Affairs before appointing Anatolii Mohyliov to Lutsenko's old position.) and Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc lawmaker Serhiy Mishchenko stated [...] "that the Verkhovna Rada had shown to the average citizen a bad example of how to violate the country’s laws and Constitution". Yushchenko did sent a letter to Yanukovych with a request to veto the law on March 10. Yanukovych signed the law nevertheless. 56 lawmakers filed a challenge to the law who made these amendments possible on March 11, 2010 at the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. On March 16, 2010 Minister of Justice Oleksandr Lavrynovych stated that even if the Constitutional Court rules the amendments unconstitutional the format of the Ukrainian parliamentary coalition will remain unchanged because [...] "the Constitutional Court's ruling becomes valid on the day of its announcement, not yesterday or the day before yesterday" [...] and the Constitutional Court's ruling will apply only to measures intended to establish a new coalition in Ukraine in the future. On March 26, 2010 President Yanukovych told a delegation from the European Parliament [...] "If the decision of the Constitutional Court will be that the coalition was formed illegally, then I will take a decision on a snap election, I <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> down the path of breaching the constitution that is in force". The Constitutional Court reviewing the case late March 2010. On urgent matters the court rules within weeks but on matters deemed less urgent it can take months or even longer. On March 29, 2010 former premier and Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc leader Yulia Tymoshenko accused [...] "Representatives of Yanukovych" [...] of trying to bribe and blackmail Constitutional Court judges {{in order to get a}} ruling that legitimates the coalition and the government.

2500|$|Some {{credit for}} the {{emergence}} of a world market must also go to the dynasty. It {{played a significant role in}} linking the markets of China to the rest of the world. The market structure and economic policies of the Chola dynasty were more conducive to a large-scale, cross-regional market trade than those enacted by the Chinese Song Dynasty. A Chola record gives their rationale for engagement in foreign trade: [...] "Make the merchants of distant foreign countries who import elephants and good horses attach to yourself by providing them with villages and decent dwellings in the city, by affording them daily audience, presents and allowing them profits.

2500|$|According to Fossey's letters, ORTPN (the Rwandan {{national}} park system), the World Wildlife Fund, African Wildlife Foundation, Fauna Preservation Society, the Mountain Gorilla Project {{and some of}} her former students tried to wrest control of the Karisoke research center from her for the purpose of tourism, by portraying her as unstable. In her last two years, Fossey claims not to have lost any gorillas to poachers; however, the Mountain Gorilla Project, which was supposed to patrol the Mount Sabyinyo area, tried to cover up gorilla deaths caused by poaching and diseases transmitted through tourists. Nevertheless, these organizations received most of the public donations directed toward gorilla conservation. The public often believed their money would go to Fossey, who was struggling to finance her anti-poaching and bushmeat hunting patrols, while organizations collecting in her name put it into tourism projects and as she put it [...] "to pay the airfare of so-called conservationists who <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> on anti-poaching patrols in their life."

2500|$|Beginning in 1990, Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Taylor {{would fight}} over Ridge's affection for years. In 2013, Tylo {{revealed}} {{that she and}} Lang would distance themselves from each other to make their on-screen rivalry convincing: [...] "We cannot look comfortable with each other. [...] We need to look like {{we are in a}} place of competition." [...] In 2007, Brooke and Taylor's rivalry intensified when Brooke begins pursuing Nick Marone (Jack Wagner) while he is married to Taylor. Soap Opera Digest noted that the women were [...] "crossing swords once again for the same man". Tylo observed that both Brooke and Taylor were being written with [...] "more intelligence" [...] this time around, and was happy in revisiting the rivalry between them as [...] "long as it wasn't over Ridge" [...] again. Taylor becomes pregnant with Nick's child through In vitro fertilisation (IVF), having struggled to conceive a child, and gives birth to Jack Marone. However, because of a mistake that Bridget had made in the lab, it was Brooke's eggs which were implanted in Taylor and not the donor's; making Brooke Jack's biological mother. She fears that her baby will be drawn to Brooke. Taylor begins drinking and becomes mentally unstable, with her parental rights being taken away. The scenes where Taylor loses custody and suffers a breakdown in court were filmed shortly after Tylo's own son died. Tylo told On-Air On-Soaps: [...] "I got a lot of emails from people worrying. They would go from worrying about me to saying, 'Was I okay with those scenes and after them?'" [...] The actress said that she tapped into her own tragedy when portraying those scenes, and allowed herself to feel the [...] "feeling that <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> away which is, 'It's not fair'". Taylor is soon awarded joint custody of Jack when she passes a mental health evaluation. However, she cannot bond with him and ends up giving Jack to Brooke in the end.|$|E
2500|$|Wilhelm Pauk {{wrote in}} 1931 (Karl Barth Prophet Of A New Christianity) that Kierkegaard's {{use of the}} Latin phrase Finitum Non Capax Infiniti (the finite does not (or cannot) {{comprehend}} the infinite) summed up Barth's system. David G. Kingman and Adolph Keller each discussed Barth's relationship to Kierkegaard in their books, The Religious Educational Values in Karl Barth's Teachings (1934) and Karl Barth and Christian Unity (1933). Keller notes the splits that happen when a new teaching is introduced and some assume a higher knowledge from a higher source than others. But Kierkegaard always referred to the equality of all {{in the world of}} the spirit where there is neither [...] "sport" [...] nor [...] "spook" [...] or anyone who can shut you out of the world of the spirit except yourself. All are chosen by God and equal in His sight. The Expectancy of Faith," [...] Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith. Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law. You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. The Bible – NIV" [...] Galatians 3:23–29; [...] "In the world of spirit to become one’s own master, is the highest – and in love to help someone toward that, to become himself, free, independent, his own master, to help him stand alone – that is the greatest beneficence. The greatest beneficence, to help the other to stand alone, cannot be done directly." [...] "If a person always keeps his soul sober and alert in this idea, he <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> astray in his outlook on life and people or [...] "combine respect for status of persons with his faith." [...] Show no partiality as you hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. (James 2.1) Then he will direct his thoughts toward God, and his eye will not make the mistake of looking for differences in the world instead of likeness with God.|$|E
