5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1778, George Washington ordered Major Benjamin Tallmadge to form the Culper Ring. This group was {{composed}} of a select few trustworthy individuals whose purpose was to collect information about the British movements and activities in New York City. The Ring is famous for uncovering Benedict Arnold's intentions of treason, which shocked Washington because Arnold <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> had {{contributed significantly to the}} war effort. Arnold was embittered by his dealings with Congress over rank and finances, as well as the alliance with France, so he conspired with the British in a plan to seize the post that he commanded at West Point. Washington just missed apprehending him, but did capture his co-conspirator Major John André, a British intelligence officer under Clinton who was hanged by order of a court-martial called by Washington.|$|E

500|$|Creator Matthew Weiner {{conceived}} {{the script for}} [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] in 2000, while he {{was working as a}} writer for the sitcom Becker. The first draft of the episode was written as a spec script and was titled [...] "The Division". Two years later, Weiner sent the script to David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, although Weiner's agents insisted that he not proceed with his plans. Chase later recruited him upon first glance. [...] "It was what you’re always hoping to see," [...] he recalled. [...] "It was lively and it had something new to say. Here <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> had written a story about advertising in the 1960s, and was looking at recent American history through that prism." [...] Weiner set the pilot script aside for the next seven years to focus on The Sopranos. Neither HBO nor Showtime expressed interest in the project until the commencement of The Sopranos final season. During that time, AMC began looking into the television market for new programming. [...] "The network was looking for distinction in launching its first original series," [...] according to AMC Networks president Ed Carroll, [...] "and we took a bet that quality would win out over formulaic mass appeal." ...|$|E
500|$|Ally MacLeod had an {{immediate}} impact as Scotland manager, winning against England at Wembley. His team then {{qualified for the}} 1978 FIFA World Cup by defeating Wales at Anfield, although Scotland were controversially given a penalty kick. MacLeod was confident about the team's prospects, quipping that his plan for after the World Cup was to [...] "retain it". The supporters shared in this enthusiasm, as Hampden Park was packed for a farewell parade before the team flew to the tournament, hosted by Argentina. MacLeod dismissed his first two opponents, Peru and Iran, as [...] "old men" [...] and [...] "minnows" [...] respectively. A defeat by Peru and a draw with Iran left Scotland needing to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to qualify. MacLeod {{made a number of}} contested selection decisions, preferring the out of form Don Masson and Bruce Rioch to Graeme Souness. Winger Willie Johnston failed a drugs test after the Peru match and was sent home. Scotland produced an outstanding performance against the Netherlands and won 3–2, but were eliminated on goal difference. MacLeod stayed on as Scotland manager after the World Cup, but resigned after a defeat by Austria in September 1978. Writers have since considered the question of whether MacLeod was the cause of a lack of Scottish self-confidence, or <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> tried to counter it.|$|E

500|$|Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg: The German army Colonel who was {{instrumental}} in the conspiracy to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Bryan Singer saw von Stauffenberg as [...] "very much a humanist", saying, [...] "He understood his role as a colonel, but he also understood that the Nazis were doing terrible, terrible, terrible things." [...] Having directed Superman Returns, Singer compared von Stauffenberg's dual identity as loyal colonel and conspirator to Superman and his civilian identity Clark Kent. Cruise had wanted to work with Singer since they met at the premiere for , and the actor was enticed by the script's background, the truth of which struck him as a surprise. The actor described von Stauffenberg's heroism, [...] "I thought of it in terms of what [...] Stauffenberg represents. He <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> realized that he had to take the steps that ultimately cost him his life.... He recognized what was at stake." [...] Cruise felt von Stauffenberg did not think of himself as a hero. The actor prepared for the role for eight months by hiring a researcher, studying history books, and speaking with some of von Stauffenberg's family. Since von Stauffenberg lost his left eye, right hand and two fingers on his left hand in an Allied attack in Tunisia, Cruise affected the same disabilities to practice dressing, moving items and writing. Cruise initially found the eyepatch difficult to work with but acknowledged that von Stauffenberg had to live with this discomfort.|$|E

2500|$|What the Aztec priests were {{referring}} to {{was a central}} Mesoamerican belief: that a great, continuing sacrifice of the gods sustains the Universe.

[...] Rabbi Ishmael said that a [...] "soothsayer" [...] <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> passed {{something}} over his eye. Rabbi Akiva said that soothsayers calculated the seasons, as did those who declared that the years prior to the seventh year produced good wheat or bad beans. The Sages said soothsayers were those who performed illusions. The Sifre defined [...] "diviners" [...] as people who said that something could be divined from, for example, bread falling from someone's mouth, a staff falling from someone's hand, a snake passing on one's right or a fox on one's left, a deer stopping on the way before someone, or the coming of the new moon. The Sifre taught that a [...] "sorcerer" [...] <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> actually carried out a deed, not merely performing an illusion.|$|E

2500|$|In ancient Rome, {{according}} to Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, {{what is now}} called sexual harassment was then any of accosting, stalking, and abducting. Accosting was [...] "harassment through attempted seduction" [...] or [...] another's chastity with smooth talk... contrary to good morals", which was more than the lesser offense(s) of [...] "obscene speech, dirty jokes, and the like", [...] "foul language", and [...] "clamor", with the accosting of [...] "respectable young girls" [...] who however were dressed in slaves' clothing being a lesser offense and the accosting of [...] "women... dressed as prostitutes" [...] being an even lesser offense. Stalking was [...] "silently, persistently pursuing" [...] if it was [...] "contrary to good morals", because a pursuer's [...] "ceaseless presence virtually ensures appreciable disrepute". Abducting an attendant, who <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> follows someone else as a companion and could be a slave, was [...] "successfully forcing or persuading the attendant to leave the side of the intended target", but abducting while the woman [...] "has not been wearing respectable clothing" [...] was a lesser offense.|$|E
