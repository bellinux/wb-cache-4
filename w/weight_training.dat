5|$|In 1992, {{three years}} after his Oscar win, The Last of the Mohicans was released. Day-Lewis's {{character}} research for this film was well-publicised; he reportedly underwent rigorous <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> and learned to live off the land and forest where his character lived, camping, hunting and fishing. Day-Lewis also added to his wood-working skills and {{learned how to make}} canoes. He carried a long rifle at all times during filming to remain in character and learned how to skin animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is complemented at the University by its predecessors the Henry Crown Field House {{and the modern}} incarnation of Stagg Field, which will continue to augment the athletic facilities needs of the campus patrons.

50|$|The current plans include six arenas {{and a huge}} <b>weights</b> <b>training</b> gym for up to 1,500 elite athletes. The 60,000-seat main stadium {{will cover}} a plot of nine {{hectares}} and house a football pitch and running track.|$|R
5|$|A Canadian mutant {{and future}} X-Men member and often {{referred}} as Jimmy by Victor Creed. Jackman, who played Wolverine {{in the previous}} films, has also become producer of the film via his company Seed Productions, and earned $25million for the film. Jackman underwent a high intensity <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> regimen to improve his physique for the role. He altered the program to shock his body into change and also performed cardiovascular workouts. Jackman noted no digital touches were applied to his physique in a shot of him rising from the tank within which Wolverine has his bones infused with adamantium.|$|E
5|$|Frankie dies next at a drive-through, when {{a runaway}} truck crashes {{into the back}} of Kevin's truck and the engine fan blows out. The next day, Wendy and Kevin try to save Lewis at the gym; he tells them that he does not believe them shortly before two weights from the <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> machine he is using swing down and decapitate him. Ian and Erin are working at a {{hardware}} store; Wendy saves Ian from being impaled by falling planks of wood, causing Death to skip him and move onto Erin, who falls onto a nail gun and is shot repeatedly in the head. Though questioned by the police after Erin's death, both Wendy and Kevin are let go. Assuming that whoever was next must be dead, they decide to ensure their own safety. While leaving the police station, Wendy is stalked by a grief-stricken Ian.|$|E
5|$|To {{make her}} {{performances}} {{as a female}} boxer look realistic, Oreiro trained regularly with the renowned boxer Marcela Acuña and her coach Ramón Chaparro. They taught Oreiro how to stand and move in the ring {{and how to make}} various types of strokes, and she underwent cardiovascular and <b>weight</b> <b>training.</b> Acuña commented that Oreiro mastered the basic techniques more quickly than most beginner boxers. For this training, Oreiro temporarily gave up her vegetarian diet. Another plot required the characters to fly a Piper Tomahawk airplane and make an emergency landing. This was risky filming, and Arana and Oreiro did not use stunt doubles for it. The scene, which was {{the first of its kind}} in a daily Argentine telenovela, required four professional pilots, five special effects experts, and two additional aircraft used for filming the main aircraft from the outside. Arana was advised by the pilot Alberto Di Giorgio.|$|E
25|$|Pratt was {{averse to}} <b>weights</b> <b>training,</b> believing {{that it took}} away from the athleticism {{required}} to play football. Instead, he trained with professional sprinters, which he believed helped him as it built his initial acceleration (essential to any footballer) and aided his kicking accuracy.|$|R
50|$|Fat: The Fight of My Life is a {{television}} series where obese people lose weight. Each episode follows {{a year in}} the life of an obese person trying to lose <b>weight.</b> <b>Trained</b> by host Jessie Pavelka. It was originally aired in the United Kingdom.|$|R

25|$|Health and Physical Education {{courses are}} also required, with {{activities}} including step aerobics, <b>weight</b> <b>training,</b> basketball, skating, team handball, fitness, and yoga.|$|E
25|$|Fitness was {{an early}} hobby with him being on the track team at 8 years old. His {{specialties}} were 100 meter, 200 meter, 400 meter and triple jump. He was on the basketball team, volleyball team, gymnastics throughout high school. Tyler became interested in maximizing his performance through proper nutrition and <b>weight</b> <b>training.</b> When he was young, he lived on a farm until he was 16. Spending the time working on the farm developed his physique. When his parents divorced his step father had a gym, it was then he began a lifelong commitment to <b>weight</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E

50|$|Another {{consideration}} is the maximum <b>weight</b> of a <b>train.</b> A maximum length train in Europe, 750 m long can have 50 container cars {{with a total}} weight of 2250 t, and more if 20 ft containers are included. This is not {{so far from the}} limit using standard European couplers. Double-stacking requires allowing higher <b>train</b> <b>weight</b> to be meaningful, since it is higher <b>train</b> <b>weights</b> that saves costs. In the U.S., the AAR coupler used allows much higher <b>train</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|R
25|$|Tyler {{tries to}} keep up a healthy work-life balance by doing yoga, <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> and running daily. He is {{co-owner}} of a yoga clothing company called Aumnie. Tyler has no children and is married to ex model Karina Smith, who now works with Tyler.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 {{the school}} opened the {{refurbished}} McCarthy Gymnasium, including updated facilities for the basketball, wrestling, and volleyball programs.

50|$|Wilder's {{training}} {{consists of}} simple compound movements with mostly {{using a combination}} of free weights, machines, and a few cable exercises. Latisha <b>weight</b> <b>trains</b> five days a week (2 days on, 1 day off, 3 days on, 1 day off) focusing on her chest, back, and legs during her training split; she uses up to 16 sets per bodypart (even biceps, triceps) using relatively heavyweights, while keeping her reps between 10-15 range. She typically does extensive cardio sessions 6 days a week in the off-season for 30-45 minutes in the morning hours, plus an additional 45 minutes after any lifting session on days that she <b>weight</b> <b>trains</b> (usually two body parts per day off-season, and only one body part per day the on-season; when she is getting ready for a contest). In addition to that she also takes a Boot Camp class twice a week.|$|R
50|$|The cast {{visited a}} strip club to see what this world was like and the dance {{routines}} and to get information on the backstage life. To prepare for the role, McConaughey went in a Los Angeles strip mall {{to get used to}} regular waxing. Matt Bomer had to put on about 15 pounds for his part. Adam Rodriguez went through a cardio and <b>weights</b> <b>training.</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{current study}} {{examined}} how different training affects the kinematics and applied moments {{at the knee}} during sporting maneuvers and the potential to reduce loading of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The training programs were 1) machine weights, 2) free <b>weights,</b> 3) balance <b>training,</b> and 4) machine <b>weights</b> + balance <b>training.</b> METHODS: Fifty healthy male subjects were allocated either to a control group or to one of four 12 -wk training programs. Subjects were tested before and after training, performing running and cutting maneuvers from which knee angle and applied knee moments were assessed. Data analyzed were peak applied flexion/extension, varus/valgus, and internal/external rotation moments, as well as knee flexion angles during specific phases of stance during the maneuvers. Results: The balance training group decreased their peak valgus and peak internal rotation moments during weight acceptance in all maneuvers. This group also lowered their flexion moments during the sidestep to 60 degrees. Free <b>weights</b> <b>training</b> induced increases in the internal rotation moment and decreases in knee flexion angle in the peak push-off phase of stance. Machine <b>weights</b> <b>training</b> elicited increases in the flexion moment and reduced peak valgus moments in weight acceptance. Machine <b>weights</b> + balance <b>training</b> resulted in no changes to the variables assessed. Conclusions: Balance training produced reductions in peak valgus and internal rotation moments, which could lower ACL injury risk during sporting maneuvers. Strength training tended to increase the applied knee loading known to place strain on the ACL, with the free weights group also decreasing the amount of knee flexion. It is recommended that balance training be implemented because it may {{reduce the risk of}} ACL injury. 10 page(s...|$|R
