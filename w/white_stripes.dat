40|$|The global poultry {{industry}} has been faced with emerging broiler breast meat quality issues known as <b>white</b> <b>striping</b> and woody breast. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate effects of <b>white</b> <b>striping</b> and woody breast hardness on meat quality traits in broiler breast fillets. Birds were processed at 8 wk (Exp. 1) and at 6 and 9 wk of age (Exp. 2), whereas deboning was carried out at 4 and 2 h postmortem in Exp. 1 and 2, respectively. Fillets were categorized as: normal for both <b>white</b> <b>striping</b> and woody breast (NORM); mild for <b>white</b> <b>striping</b> and woody breast (MILD); severe for <b>white</b> <b>striping</b> and mild for woody breast (WS); severe for woody breast and mild for <b>white</b> <b>striping</b> (WB); or severe for both <b>white</b> <b>striping</b> and woody breast (BOTH).

If the alignment is vertical, the <b>white</b> <b>stripe</b> should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the <b>white</b> <b>stripe</b> should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the <b>white</b> <b>stripe</b> should be placed over the heart.|$|R
