50|$|Below {{are some}} common wrench sizes for metric screw threads. Hex head widths (<b>width</b> <b>across</b> <b>flats,</b> wrench size) are for DIN 934 hex nuts and hex head bolts. Other (usually smaller) sizes may occur {{for reasons of}} weight and cost reduction.|$|E
5000|$|Metric hexagon bolts, {{screws and}} nuts are specified, for example, in British Standard BS 4190 (general purpose screws) and BS 3692 (precision screws). The {{following}} table lists the relationship given in these standards between the thread {{size and the}} maximal <b>width</b> <b>across</b> the hexagonal <b>flats</b> (wrench size): ...|$|R
5000|$|... (To simplify matters, {{the term}} hexagon {{will be used}} in this {{paragraph}} to denote either bolt head or nut.) Whitworth (spanner) markings refer to the bolt diameter rather than the distance <b>across</b> the <b>flats</b> of the hexagon (A/F) as in other standards. Confusion also arises because BSF hexagon sizes can be one size smaller than the corresponding Whitworth hexagon. This leads to instances where a spanner (wrench) marked 7/16BSF is the same size as one marked 3/8W. In both cases the spanner jaw width of 0.710 in, the <b>width</b> <b>across</b> the hexagon <b>flat,</b> is the same. However, in World War II the size of the Whitworth hexagon was reduced to {{the same size as the}} equivalent BSF hexagon purely to save metal during the war and they never went back to the old sizes afterwards. Thus it is today uncommon to encounter a Whitworth hexagon which takes the nominally correct spanner. Spanners in this case may be marked 7/16BS to indicate that they have a jaw size of 0.710 in and are designed to take either the (later) 7/16 BSW or 7/16 BSF hexagon.|$|R
