With that said, she contends that the poet is inconsistent {{when it comes to the}} location of this divinity. For instance, in his first book, Manilius claims that the perfectly regular movement of the heavenly bodies is proof that the universe is the product of a god, but at the same time he asserts that the universe itself is also a god (mundum ... ipsum esse deum). Later in the same book, Manilius once again argues that the universe is the [...] "work of a great divinity" [...] (magni ... numinis ordo). Concerning this vacillation, Volk writes: [...] "It is clear that there is a certain elasticity to Manilius' concept of the divinity of the universe ... Is the world simply ruled by a diuinum numen (cf. 1.484) or is it a deus (cf 1.485) itself?" [...] Volk answers that in the cosmology of the Astronomica, [...] "God can be understood as the soul or breath ... present within the world [...] since this divine entity completely pervades the cosmos, it makes equally much sense to call the cosmos itself a god." [...] According to Volk, this interpretation of the universewhich states that it has a sense of intellect and that it operates in an orderly waythus allows Manilius to contend both that there is an unbroken chain of cause and effect impacting everything within the cosmos, [...] and that fate rules all.|$|E
