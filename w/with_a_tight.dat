5|$|Modeled on The Lord of the Rings, the Ice and Fire {{story begins}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> {{focus on a}} small group (with {{everyone}} in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning point in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin {{is said to have}} reached the turning point in A Dance with Dragons, or to not quite have reached it yet in the books. The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by Wild Cards, a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.|$|E
5|$|The 2008–09 season {{would be}} almost as {{successful}} for Martin. He once again qualified for the Brier, winning the Alberta provincial championship, and then once again went 13–0 in the 2009 Tim Hortons Brier. He knocked off Glenn Howard 7–6 followed by Jeff Stoughton in the final by a 7–4 result. A week later, at the 2009 Canada Cup of Curling, Martin won his third title, defeating fellow Edmonton rink Randy Ferbey in the final. At the 2009 Ford World Men's Curling Championship, Martin won 10 straight games until he met Scotland {{in the final round}} robin game. Martin lost to Scotland and then lost to them again in the 1–2 page playoff game. Martin rebounded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> semifinal victory over Switzerland, but had to face Scotland in a third matchup in the final. The game was tied going into the last end with Martin having the last rock advantage. Before his first rock, Martin was lying one in a complicated setup. After spending about six minutes trying to decide which shot to try, he went against the wishes of his teammates and threw away his shot, forcing Scotland's David Murdoch to make a double-tap to sit shot. Murdoch made his shot, leaving Martin with a short-raise double, which he missed, losing the championship to Scotland, 7–6.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E

25|$|Days of Heaven was Malick's second feature film, {{after the}} enthusiastically {{received}} Badlands (1973), and was produced {{on a budget}} of $3,000,000. Production was particularly troublesome, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> shooting schedule and significant budget constraints. Additionally, editing took Malick a lengthy three years, due to difficulty with achieving a general flow and assembly of the scenes. This was eventually solved with an added, improvised narration by Linda Manz. The film was scored by Ennio Morricone and photographed by Nestor Almendros and Haskell Wexler.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most thermoplastics, {{polycarbonate}} can undergo large plastic deformations without cracking or breaking. As a result, it can {{be processed}} and formed at room temperature using sheet metal techniques, such as bending on a brake. Even for sharp angle bends <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> radius, heating may not be necessary. This makes it valuable in prototyping applications where transparent or electrically non-conductive parts are needed, which cannot be made from sheet metal. PMMA/Acrylic, which is similar in appearance to polycarbonate, is brittle and cannot be bent at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, pop rappers such as The Fresh Prince, Kid 'n Play, and Left Eye of TLC popularized {{baseball}} caps and bright, often neon-colored, clothing. TLC and late R singer Aaliyah created a fashion trend among women. Wearing over-sized pants and big flannel shirts, they would couple the over-sized clothing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> shirt usually a sports bra underneath their big shirts. This {{was to show}} {{their own version of}} femininity, everything {{does not have to be}} form fitting and tight in order to be sexy.|$|E

25|$|Trisha had {{aspired to}} become a {{criminal}} psychologist initially, and resisted the thought of pursuing acting, as she wanted to complete her studies first. She also appeared in Falguni Pathak's music video Meri Chunar Udd Udd Jaye as Ayesha Takia's friend. She was later approached for an acting role in Tamil movie Lesa Lesa by Indian film director Priyadarshan, which {{marked the beginning of}} her professional career as an actress. During her college course, she had occupied herself <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> shooting schedule, which made it difficult to continue with her education. However, she compensated by attending summer classes.|$|E
25|$|The 1968–69 {{campaign}} was a frustrating season that saw Luton finish third, narrowly {{missing out on}} a second consecutive promotion. Brown resigned as manager in December 1968 {{under pressure from the}} board, and was replaced by Alec Stock, who brought Malcolm Macdonald to the club in the summer of 1969. Macdonald was moved from defence to centre-forward with marvellous success, scoring 25 goals as Luton stormed to a second-place finish in 1969–70. Comedian Eric Morecambe became a director of the club in 1970, and promotion back to the Second Division was clinched {{on the final day of}} the season <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> 1–0 win over Southport.|$|E
25|$|Jo-Wilfried's Rogers Cup {{campaign}} {{was an extremely}} short affair with a second-round loss to fellow Frenchman Jérémy Chardy. He also crashed out {{in the second round}} of the 2012 US Open, after a defeat by No. 52 Martin Kližan. After a short break for recovery, Jo was back in France for the 2012 Moselle Open. Tsonga rolled to a semifinal berth with Russian Nikolay Davydenko. The Frenchman had never beaten Davydenko in two previous attempts, but made sure that run was not extended to three <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> three-set win. The final was an easy two-set win over Andreas Seppi, Tsonga's ninth ATP career title.|$|E
50|$|Vegetable flannel {{is a type}} of flannel using fibres {{from the}} Scots pine, or pinus sylvestris, rather than {{traditional}} woollen fibres. It is described as having a hemp like appearance, but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tighter,</b> softer texture. In addition to this, the term can also describe coarse linen used for underclothing.|$|R

25|$|A small flip tap {{and a short}} spout is the {{standard}} neck for dispensing cask ale. An alternative is a long spout <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> 180° turn, called a swan-neck, {{which is designed to}} force the beer into the glass, agitating it so that a fuller head is created. Some drinkers disapprove of swan-necks, believing that flavour is reduced. In some pubs a small device or cap, known as a sparkler, is fitted {{to the end of the}} spout and acts like a sprinkler at the end of a hose pipe. This can be twisted to regulate the flow of the beer. When the sparkler is tight, the beer is severely agitated resulting in a creamy head; it is softer and creamier with less bitterness.|$|E
25|$|The win granted him a {{challenge}} title match in September 1995 against the King of Pancrase Minoru Suzuki, which was their rematch from the fight {{at the beginning}} of their careers. The match was long and intense, as Suzuki rode Rutten for most of their exchanges in the bout, and actually managed to force him to spend a rope escape <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> kneebar. Rutten held his own through his defensive acumen, occasionally countering with guillotine chokes and a surprising rolling kneebar from standing, until the match came to its last minutes. After getting from under a mount, Rutten threw a front kick to the body which downed Suzuki and followed with a guillotine choke, making the King of Pancrase tap out.|$|E
25|$|On 22 November, Arsenal's {{first home}} defeat saw them lose {{successive}} Premier League {{games for the}} first time in the season. The returning Olivier Giroud's late shot proved consolation after an own goal from Kieran Gibbs and a finish by Wayne Rooney saw Arsenal defeated 2-1 by a depleted Manchester United side, including inexperienced players such as Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett. The defeat not only dented Arsenal's Premier League title hopes, but saw Jack Wilshere injured, sidelining the midfielder for five months. Four days later, Arsenal progressed to the next round of the Champions League with a convincing 2–0 home win against Dortmund. Yaya Sanogo scored his first competitive goal for Arsenal after two minutes of the game and Alexis Sánchez netted in his twelfth goal for the club. Arsenal ended the month <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> 1-0 win at West Brom, courtesy of a Danny Welbeck header.|$|E

500|$|On the Blond Ambition World Tour, {{the song}} was {{performed}} as the third song of the set list. The outfit she wore for the performance was described by Carol Clerk, author of Madonnastyle, [...] as the [...] "perfect visual combination of masculine and feminine". It consisted of a double-breasted suit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> jacket, which was cut in slits, allowing her conical bra to point through. She also wore her characteristic monocle chain. Madonna wore heavy makeup with thick, blackened eyebrows and heavy application of dark liner. As she finished the performance of [...] "Open Your Heart", Madonna opened the jacket and started to simulate sexual intercourse {{with one of her}} dancers while playing the dominant role. It was followed by an exhibitionist dance routine with a chair as a prop and Madonna singing the song. The performance ended with Madonna wrestling with her female backup singers. Two different performances [...] were released on video: the Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E
