5|$|The {{information}} sharing model assumes that individuals search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while the producer-scrounger model {{assumes that the}} search modes are mutually exclusive. Hopping <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> facing up and downward are observed to be statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the availability of seeds, the relative frequency of hopping <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> up changed accordingly. When the seed distribution made the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> up diminished and appears to support the predictions of the producer-scrounger model.|$|E

5|$|A mermaid is {{a legendary}} aquatic {{creature}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and upper {{body of a}} female human and {{the tail of a}} fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.|$|E

5|$|Bovidae have {{featured}} in stories {{since at least}} the time of Aesop's fables from Ancient Greece around 600 BC. Fables by Aesop include The Crow and the Sheep, The Frog and the Ox, and The Wolf and the Lamb. The mythological creature Chimera, depicted as a lion, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of a goat arising from its back, and a tail that might end with a snake's head, was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and a sibling of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra.

5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in {{the cracks in the}} ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} in a power struggle <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of the Judenrat, Anatol Friend.

Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because he lived in the ghetto when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E

Dio further comments that Macrinus hosted a dinner for the residents of Apamea in honour of Diadumenian.
