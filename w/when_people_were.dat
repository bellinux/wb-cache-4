5|$|On May 2, 1947, General Douglas MacArthur {{lifted the}} {{restrictions}} on displaying the Hinomaru in {{the grounds of the}} National Diet Building, on the Imperial Palace, on the Prime Minister's residence and on the Supreme Court building with the ratification of the new Constitution of Japan. Those restrictions were further relaxed in 1948, <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> allowed to fly the flag on national holidays. In January 1949, the restrictions were abolished and anyone could fly the Hinomaru at any time without permission. As a result, schools and homes were encouraged to fly the Hinomaru until the early 1950s.|$|E

50|$|Exposure therapy {{alone is}} mildly {{effective}} in treating social anxiety. There are larger decreases in anxiety and fear <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> also told to stop themselves from using safety behaviors during therapy than <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> encouraged to use safety behaviors. These decreases <b>are</b> largest <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> told {{to stop using}} safety behaviors and disconfirm the thoughts that the threatening situation will most likely not happen even if the safety behaviors are stopped.

Private ownership of apartments was limited until the 1990s, <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> permitted to secure property rights to the places they inhabited. Since the Soviet era, estate owners have had to pay the service charge for their residences, a fixed amount based on persons per living area.|$|E
25|$|Wald was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for community support. Much of the Henry Street Settlement's initial success was from Wald's diligent and persistent work at cultivating personal relationships with the Settlement's donors. Wald was also a strong advocate for the social benefit of having donors who dwelled within the community. These benefits included the temporary break-up of families <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> forced {{to spend time in}} the hospital, improved the quality of at-home-care, and reduced medical expenses by offering an alternative to hospital stays.|$|E
25|$|The Turkmens are {{descendants}} of Turkic migrants to Iraq {{dating back to}} the Umayyads and Abbasid eras, when they arrived as military recruits. Considerable Turcoman settlement began during the Seljuq era when Toghrul entered Iraq in 1055 with his army composed mostly of Oghuz Turks. Kirkuk remained {{under the control of the}} Seljuq Empire for 63 years. The Turcoman settlement in Kirkuk was further expanded later during the Ottoman Era, <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> brought to the city from there. Kirkuk had a population near 30,000 in the late 1910s, Turkmens were majority in the city center, dominating the political and economic life of the area.|$|E

25|$|To this day, {{the death}} toll has been in dispute. About 5,000 bodies were {{recovered}} from the debris and represent the total of legally certified deaths but does not include those who were missing and never recovered. Reports have numbered the dead anywhere from 5,000 to 30,000 (claimed {{by a number of}} citizens' groups) to 45,000 claimed by the National Seismological Service. However, the most commonly cited figures are around 10,000. While high as an absolute number, it compares to other earthquakes of similar strength in Asia and other parts of Latin America where death tolls have run between 66,000 and 242,000 for earthquakes of magnitude 7.8 or above. Part of the explanation for that was the hour in which the earthquake struck, approximately 7:20am, <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> awake but not in the many schools and office buildings that were severely damaged.|$|E
25|$|Tashman died {{of cancer}} at Doctor's Hospital in New York City on March 21, 1934 {{at the age of}} 37. Her funeral was held on March 22 in New York City synagogue Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue with Sophie Tucker, Mary Pickford, Fanny Brice, Cecil Beaton, Jack Benny, and other {{distinguished}} celebrities in attendance. Eddie Cantor delivered the eulogy. The burial in Brooklyn's Washington Cemetery attracted 10,000 fans, mourners, and curious onlookers; it became a near riot <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> injured and a gravestone was toppled. Tashman left no will, but the distribution of her $31,000 in cash and $121,000 in furs and jewels provoked contentious discussion among her husband and sisters, Hattie and Jennie. Her last film, Frankie and Johnny, was released posthumously in May 1936 with her role as Nellie Bly cut to a cameo.|$|E
25|$|Two plebeian tribunes, Favonius and Cato, led the {{opposition}} to the steps of the consuls. However, they did not get far, due to popular support for the measures. Favonius was given little time to speak before the plebeian council, and Cato applied obstructionist tactics that did not work. He was led away from the assembly, but he kept returning and he was eventually arrested. Gallus, a senator, slept in the senate house intending to join the proceedings in the morning. Trebonius locked the doors and kept him there for most of the day. The comitia (the meeting place of for the assembly) was blocked by a cordon of men. An attempt to pass through was repulsed violently and there were casualties. <b>When</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> leaving after the vote Gallus, who had been let out of the senate house, was hit when he tried to pass through the cordon. He was presented covered with blood to the crowd. People were upset. The consuls stepped in with a large and intimidating bodyguard, called a meeting and put the measure in favour of Caesar to the vote. It was passed.|$|E

500|$|The April 10 {{show was}} the second of four concerts Davis played at the Fillmore West that month {{and one of his}} first concerts in a rock venue, having {{performed}} at New York City's Fillmore East a month earlier. His change to rock venues, suggested by Columbia Records president Clive Davis, helped the label market Bitches Brew to the counterculture audience. According to Holland, Davis' music around this time became well received by the rock audiences they encountered. [...] "I heard quite recently from one of the [...] ex-members that they were very nervous that they had to play up next to Miles", he said. [...] "It was a time <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> not that worried about musical categories. And this was some pretty strong in-your-face music. People loved it." [...] Davis said the Fillmore West shows were an [...] "eye-opening experience" [...] for him. While he became friendly with Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia, who was a fan of Davis' music, there were several thousands of mostly young, white hippies who were generally unfamiliar with him, Davis recalled.|$|E
500|$|Despite the record's darker themes, many {{lyrics are}} more flippant and sexual {{than those from}} the band's {{previous}} work. This reflects the group's revisiting some of the Dadaist characters and stage antics they dabbled with in the late 1970s as teenagers but abandoned for more literal themes in the 1980s. While the band had previously been opposed to materialism, they examined and flirted with this value on the album and the Zoo TV Tour. The title and lyrics of [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing" [...] are [...] "reflective of the times [...] were living in, <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> no longer looking for the truth, [...] were all looking for instant gratification". [...] "Trashy" [...] and [...] "throwaway" [...] were among the band's buzzwords during recording, leading to many tracks in this vein. The chorus of [...] "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] features the pop lyrical cliché [...] "baby, baby, baby", juxtaposed against the dark lyrics in the verses. Bono wrote the lyrics to [...] "The Fly" [...] in character as the song's eponymous persona by composing a sequence of aphorisms. He called the song [...] "like a crank call from Hell... but [...] likes it there".|$|E
500|$|A 2003 {{survey of}} {{residents}} living around Scotland's 10 existing wind farms found {{high levels of}} community acceptance and strong support for wind power, with much support from those who lived closest to the wind farms. The results of this survey support those of an earlier Scottish Executive survey 'Public attitudes to the Environment in Scotland 2002', which found that the Scottish public would prefer {{the majority of their}} electric power to come from renewables, and which rated wind power as the cleanest source of renewable energy. A survey conducted in 2005 showed that 74% of people in Scotland agree that wind farms are necessary to meet current and future energy needs. <b>When</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> asked the same question in a Scottish renewables study conducted in 2010, 78% agreed. The increase is significant as there were twice as many wind farms in 2010 as there were in 2005. The 2010 survey also showed that 52% disagreed with the statement that wind farms are [...] "ugly and a blot on the landscape". 59% agreed that wind farms were necessary and that how they looked was unimportant. Regarding tourism, query responders consider power pylons, cell phone towers, quarries and plantations more negatively than wind farms. Scotland is planning to obtain 100% of electric power from renewable sources by 2020.|$|E

500|$|By {{at least}} July 1999, Monolith {{has decided to}} {{introduce}} many major changes to the game; the main reason being that the gaming press unexpectedly started comparing the game to James Bond games, like GoldenEye 007 (1997). Hubbard mentioned that their intention was to [...] "make a 60s spy game", and that they [...] "didn't {{want to make a}} 'Bond' style game, so <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> obviously drawing that comparison, we decided to rework things a bit. We wanted {{to get away from the}} Bond comparisons that people were making, so we've changed the main character and the back-story a fair amount." [...] As a result, the player controls a female protagonist in the final game, Cate Archer, who works for an organization called UNITY. Changing the main character to a woman not only helped the separation of the game from the Bond franchise, but also allowed for [...] "more interesting dramatic possibilities", and the [...] "list of gadgets got a lot more visually interesting". As Hubbard said, before switching to a female protagonist, he had been [...] "struggling with trying to distinguish him from all the other male superspies from the era—extraordinarily handsome, intelligent, knowledgeable, resourceful, and so on. But a woman with those same characteristics immediately stood out because of the social climate of the time. No matter how qualified she might be, she'd have to overcome some serious barriers just to get a chance to prove herself. And if things didn't go flawlessly on a mission, she'd catch more heat than she deserved." ...|$|E
500|$|Margaret Eagar {{also noted}} that Olga was bright but said she had little {{experience}} with the world because of her sheltered life. She and her sisters had little understanding of money because they had not {{had an opportunity to}} shop in stores or to see money exchange hands. Young Olga once thought that a hat maker who came to the palace had given her a new hat as a present. Olga was once frightened when she witnessed a policeman arresting someone on the street. She thought the policeman would come to arrest her because she had behaved badly for Miss Eagar. When reading a history lesson, she remarked that she was glad she lived in current times, <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> good and not as evil as they had been in the past. When she was eight, in November 1903, Olga learned about death first hand when her first cousin, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine, died of typhoid fever while on a visit to the Romanovs at their Polish estate. [...] "My children talked much of cousin Ella and how God had taken her spirit, and they understood that later God would take her body also to heaven", wrote Eagar. [...] "On Christmas morning when Olga awoke, she exclaimed at once, 'Did God send for cousin Ella's body in the night?' I felt startled at such a question on Christmas morning, but answered, 'Oh, no, dear, not yet.' She was greatly disappointed, and said, 'I thought He would have sent for her to keep Christmas with Him.'" ...|$|E
