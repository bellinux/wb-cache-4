40|$|Drought {{stress is}} one of the main {{environmental}} factors limiting crop yields. Choice of drought-resistant cultivars may minimise yield-losses under water-limited conditions. The development of a deeper root system contributes to increased drought resistance. Based on this information, the genotypic variation in root system distribution in winter wheat was examined in a field experiment either under natural rainfed conditions or with an induced water deficit. The distribution of roots was quantified at the <b>wax-ripe</b> <b>stage</b> (EC 83). Root length densities were highest in the top 20 cm. Drought-stressed plants tended to produce less overall root length, and cultivars differed significantly in overall root lengths produced. Cultivars seemed to differ in their reaction to drought stress, but the difference was not significant. In conclusion, data from additional growing seasons will be necessary to confirm variation in root distribution between cultivars in their response to drought-stress...|$|E
