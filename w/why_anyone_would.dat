25|$|In Nabokov's 1962 novel Pale Fire, the titular poem by fictional John Shade {{mentions}} Hurricane Lolita {{coming up}} the American east coast in 1958, and narrator Charles Kinbote (in the commentary later in the book) notes it, questioning <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> have chosen an obscure Spanish nickname for a hurricane.

Katz described ferrets as [...] "having claws like hypodermic needles and teeth like number 16 carpet tacks". James Howard of The Fresno Bee said Katz failed to explain <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> {{want to participate}} in a sport such as ferret-legging, but the article [...] "offers a glimpse into the human need to challenge the edges of human endurance".|$|E

500|$|Donkey Kong Jr. Math had a poor {{reception}} from IGN, with Lucas M. Thomas {{finding its}} controls poor and its execution to be bland and flawed, while AU's Cam Shea {{said it would}} be [...] "too expensive if it was free". Shea also included it on his list of the worst Virtual Console games, finding it difficult to imagine any reason <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> want to buy it. GameSpot's Frank Provo found that it became boring quickly, also criticizing the mathematics problems for being either too easy for young children or too boring for older ones. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead commented that it gave him an [...] "ironic smile" [...] as a reminder of the NES era, though he could not justify paying five dollars for it.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] storyline led the {{character}} away {{from many of}} the philosophical concepts previously espoused, but the primary theme of the collection remained anti-statism. New emphasis was placed on previously unexplored themes, including the mind, consciousness and bicameralism. Anarky's characterization was also expanded to present him as an atheist and rationalist. A recurring theme in [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] was a scene of Anarky expounding philosophy to his pet dog, and indirectly to the reader, for a single page in each part of the story, for a total of four pages. These monologues included an explanation of bicameralism, a comparative summary of the political philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, a description of the concept of economic [...] "parasites," [...] and a final description of how the elimination of irrationality would allow society to progress. Another important theme to the final storyline is a discourse on the nature of evil, as a subplot of the story. Anarky's pursuit, as Grant put it, [...] "...is to find out <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> make the decision to be evil." [...] To that end, Grant pitted Anarky against Etrigan and Darkseid with the intention of providing a setting for a series of dialogues on the topic.|$|E
500|$|The episode also riffs {{on other}} science fiction shows. Early in the episode, Dr. Jackson asks <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> {{make a movie}} version of a TV series that lasted only three episodes—Teal'c {{responds}} that it had strong DVD sales. This is {{a reference to the}} series Firefly, which Fox executives decided to cancel after airing only three episodes (although 14 episodes had been filmed, and 11 of them were actually aired—8 more after the cancellation announcement had been made). The high number of DVDs of these episodes that sold afterwards justified making a feature film based on the series, Serenity. (Firefly is again referenced when Lloyd refuses to use footage from the Wormhole X-Treme series for the movie, saying that [...] "it's a movie, not a clip show." [...] This is an allusion to Joss Whedon's insistence that the movie Firefly would not use footage from the original series because it is [...] "not a clip show".) In addition, one of the sequences is a parody of the original Star Trek series, with SG-1 standing in for the crew of the Enterprise. Brad Wright, the co-creator of the series, fills in as the engineer Montgomery Scott. The episode also pokes good-humored fun at the series Farscape, including its habit of inventing swear words. The Farscape sequence itself is an in-joke, since the Stargate: SG-1 actors Ben Browder and Claudia Black had both starred in the earlier series (and indeed Black reprises her original role of Aeryn Sun, though Browder plays a different character, Stark, while Michael Shanks portrays Browder's Farscape character, John Crichton). Several other shows and movies are parodied, including The Wizard of Oz (the story is re-told with the members of the SG-1 team as the adventurers in Oz. The writers based the parody on a fan painting they had hanging in their office). The episode also makes fun of 24s [...] "ticking clock of jeopardy", and an entire sequence is enacted with all the characters played by marionettes, in the style of Thunderbirds and [...]|$|E

2500|$|The Fence – In {{the early}} days of Carnegie Tech, there was a single bridge which {{connected}} Margaret Morrison Women's College with the Carnegie Institute of Technology. The bridge was a meeting place for students. In 1916, the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area. The administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place. The students did not understand <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> want to meet at a fence. Administration was about to give up and tear it down but that night a fraternity, as a prank, painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party. Ever since, painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition. The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus, in the area known as [...] "the Cut." [...] Students guard the fence 24 hours a day, and, as long as two vigils are maintained, no other student may [...] "take" [...] the fence. The fence can then be painted by the group that has it, but only between midnight and 6am. Only hand brushes may be used; the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine. The previous paint cannot be stripped, and each new painting adds a new layer. The original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1' of surrounding paint, and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete. Today the fence is considered [...] "the world's most painted object," [...] by the Guinness Book of World Records.|$|E
