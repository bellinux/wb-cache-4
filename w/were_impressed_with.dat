5|$|Bradley Pierce as Chip – Mrs. Potts' son, who {{has been}} turned into a teacup. Originally {{intended}} to only have one line, the filmmakers <b>were</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> Pierce's performance and expanded the character's role significantly, eschewing a mute Music Box character. Pruiksma also served as the supervising animator for Chip.|$|E

5|$|Karas won the Best Original Video at the 2006 Tokyo Anime Award competition, {{and most}} reviewers <b>were</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> the images {{produced}} by fusing 2D and 3D art techniques. The story presents themes on the conflicts between cultural traditions and modern society, {{and the relationship}} between people. Reviewers, however, found its presentation was too confusing to follow; several of them felt it worsened the show by detracting from the strength of its art.|$|E
5|$|After their {{expulsion}} from Mecca, the Muslims fought the Meccan Quraysh at the Battle of Badr in 624, {{and at the}} Battle of Uhud in 625. Although the Muslims neither won nor were defeated at the Battle of Uhud, their military strength was gradually growing. In April 626 Muhammad raised a force of 300 men and 10 horses to meet the Quraysh army of 1,000 at Badr for the second time. Although no fighting occurred, the coastal tribes <b>were</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> Muslim power. Muhammad also tried, with limited success, to break up many alliances against the Muslim expansion. Nevertheless, {{he was unable to}} prevent the Meccan one.|$|E
5|$|Although {{conceived}} by the show's creators to be American, Charlotte's nationality {{was changed to}} British after the producers <b>were</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> English actress Rebecca Mader's audition. She was supposed to feature in just eight episodes of season four, but after the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike the role was expanded, which resulted in her starring in fifteen episodes over {{the fourth and fifth}} seasons. Charlotte's introduction, along with the three other new characters from the freighter introduced in season four, was well received, but her storylines in later episodes had a mixed reception, though Mader's acting was praised.|$|E

5|$|However, not {{all forms}} of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several {{complaints}} regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked {{the view of the}} coast. In 1981, an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals, they <b>were</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> the portion that had already been completed. Art Cole, the artist, stepped forward to the department, and was allowed to finish the mural of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, when {{analysts were}} given {{a tour of the}} Enron Energy Services office, they <b>were</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> how the {{employees}} were working so vigorously. In reality, Skilling had moved other employees to the office from other departments (instructing them to pretend to work hard) to create the appearance that the division was larger than it was. This ruse was used several times to fool analysts about the progress of different areas of Enron to help improve the stock price.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Charlene {{acted as a}} backing singer for Scott and Mike Young's band. Scott and Mike entered a demo tape into a song competition, and the judges, Molly Meldrum and Brian Hanson (Jon Finlayson), sought out Charlene as they <b>were</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> her vocal ability. Molly and Brian invited Charlene to their music studio to record some tracks, but she soon realises {{that she is not}} {{interested}} in singing and wants to complete her HSC instead. Scott also apologised to Charlene for being jealous of her talent.|$|E

5|$|Later volumes {{were also}} praised; Otaku USAs Joseph Luster {{appreciated}} the series' battles and Allen's development. The revelation that Allen {{would be an}} enemy of the Order and the 14th Noah was well received by Grant Goodman of Pop Culture Shock and Chris Beveridge of the Fandom Post. However, Goodman criticized early-volume reliance on comedy rather than plot. Beveridge and Erkael of Manga News <b>were</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> Kanda's dark past. Douresseaux liked Allen's situation in volume 21 (due to the character's connections with the Noah), and wanted to see more of that and less of Kanda's fight with Alma Karma.|$|E
5|$|Walton-based {{building}} firm Kelly Brothers {{were instructed}} to erect two uncovered stands that could each accommodate 4,000 spectators. A third covered stand accommodating 3,000 spectators was also requested. The combined cost of these stands was £1,640. Everton inserted a penalty clause into the contract in case the work was not completed by its 31 July deadline. Everton officials <b>were</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> the builder's workmanship and agreed two further contracts: exterior hoardings were constructed {{at a cost of}} £150 and 12 turnstiles were installed at a cost of £7 each. In 1894, Benjamin Kelly of Kelly Brothers was appointed as a director of Everton.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of an {{artificial}} leg, Fox was walking three weeks after the amputation. He then progressed to playing golf with his father. Doctors <b>were</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> Fox's positive outlook, stating it contributed to his rapid recovery. He endured sixteen months of chemotherapy and found the time he spent in the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency facility difficult as he watched fellow cancer patients suffer and die from the disease. Fox ended his treatment with new purpose: he felt he owed his survival to medical advances and wished to live his life {{in a way that would}} help others find courage.|$|E

5|$|A {{petition}} {{was filed}} by King David Kalakaua and his sisters and brother-in-law, Lydia K. Dominis, Miriam K. Cleghorn and Archibald Scott Cleghorn, with a hearing set by Justice Lawrence McCully. In July 1878, Justices Harris, Judd and McCully heard Kalakaua's appeal. While the Justices {{felt that the}} claim of Kalakaua and his sisters had not been proven, they <b>were</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> that of Kilinahe (Kanaʻina's first cousin) and other claimants based on testimony and witnesses. The court decreed that the estate be split into four equal shares: one quarter to go to Haalilio (k), Haalelea (k) and Kahukaiola (k); one quarter each to Pahua (w) and Kaahua (k); and one quarter to the widow and children of Kilinahe, who had died before the adjudication of his claim.|$|E
5|$|As {{a first-time}} novelist, Niffenegger had trouble finding a {{literary}} agent. She eventually sent the novel to MacAdam/Cage unsolicited and, after an auction took {{place for the}} rights, Niffenegger selected them as her publishers. The book became a bestseller after an endorsement from author and family friend Scott Turow on The Today Show, and as of March 2009 had sold nearly 2.5 million copies in the United States and the United Kingdom. Many reviewers <b>were</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> Niffenegger's unique perspectives on time travel. Some praised her characterization of the couple, applauding their emotional depth; others criticized her writing style as melodramatic and the plot as emotionally trite. The novel won the Exclusive Books Boeke Prize and a British Book Award. A film version was released in August 2009.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, the Liberal Party had {{considered}} Howe {{as a potential}} candidate for the House of Commons. The Liberals were then in opposition. The public was angry over the inability of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett and his Conservative (or Tory) government {{to deal with the}} Depression, and the Liberals were considered likely to return to office at the next election, due by 1935. Howe, feeling political activism was bad for business, had not publicly expressed political views. Norman Platt Lambert, a Liberal Party official and friend of Howe, brought him to a meeting with Liberal Party leader and former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 20 January 1934. The two men <b>were</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> each other, but each felt the other should make the next move. According to Lambert in his diary, Howe wanted a guaranteed Cabinet position were he to run in the new riding of Port Arthur.|$|E
