5|$|After a spell in {{civilian}} life following the war, Malley joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1925, serving with No.3 Squadron. He became an aviation adviser to China in 1931, and {{worked closely with}} Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, from 1937. Malley was able to observe air tactics in the Sino-Japanese War at first hand, though his reports were given little <b>weight</b> <b>in</b> Australia. Returning home in 1940, he served in intelligence roles with the RAAF and later the Commonwealth government. After the war he bought a plantation in Fiji, where he died in 1961.|$|E
