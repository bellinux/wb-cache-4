25|$|Let no man <b>write</b> <b>my</b> epitaph; for as no man {{who knows}} my motives dare now vindicate them, let not {{prejudice}} or ignorance, asperse them. Let them and me rest in obscurity and peace, and my tomb remain uninscribed, and my memory in oblivion, until other times and other men can do justice to my character. When my country takes her place among {{the nations of the}} earth, then and not till then, let my epitaph be written. I have done.|$|E
25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to <b>write</b> <b>my</b> way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E

25|$|I am {{forced to}} the appalling {{conclusion}} that I {{would never have}} become a writer but for Joan's death, and to a realization {{of the extent to}} which this event has motivated and formulated my writing. I live with the constant threat of possession, and a constant need to escape from possession, from control. So the death of Joan brought me in contact with the invader, the Ugly Spirit, and maneuvered me into a life long struggle, in which I have had no choice except to <b>write</b> <b>my</b> way out. The 25th anniversary edition of Queer published in 2010, edited by Oliver Harris, called into question Burroughs's claim, and clarified the importance for Queer of Burroughs's traumatic relationship with the boyfriend fictionalized in the story as Eugene Allerton, rather than the shooting of Vollmer.|$|E
500|$|Furtado said in {{her diary}} on her {{official}} website that she recorded a remix of [...] "Maneater" [...] with rapper Lil Wayne; it was only released {{as part of a}} compilation album, Timbaland's Remix & Soundtrack Collection, she also used the instrumental of the song during many television performances of [...] "Maneater". A version of [...] "All Good Things (Come to an End)" [...] featuring vocals by Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin, who co-wrote the song, was not released after a request from Martin's label, EMI. The song was released on the album, but only Furtado's vocals are featured. Furtado explained that [...] "Loose was 90 percent written with a beat first, and then I’d <b>write</b> <b>my</b> melodies and songs to the beat." ...|$|E
500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be." [...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I <b>write</b> <b>my</b> thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E

I {{want it to be}} an attack, an assault on the issue because I think, {{especially}} in today's music, everything gets kind of washy sometimes and the message gets hidden in the lyrical play. Harkening back to the early '90s, when Madonna, En Vogue, Whitney Houston and TLC were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities, the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said, 'That's the kind of record I need to make. That's the record that's going to shake up the industry.' It's not about the track. It's not about the production. It's about the song. Anyone could sing 'Born This Way'. It could've been anyone." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1898 Dresser {{reported}} that nearly one million copies of sheet music would soon be sold, making [...] "Wabash" [...] a [...] "sensation", the [...] "great hit of the day." [...] In a newspaper interview Dresser said, [...] "I can’t tell you just how much I have cleared off of the song, but the $50,000 estimate I have seen in some papers is very modest. You see I am a publisher {{as well as a}} composer and have a big printing house of my own in New York. I also write the words for all my songs, dictate the circumstances and stage settings for their public introductions, <b>write</b> <b>my</b> own ads, and sometimes sing my own songs. Now {{what do you think of}} that for a monopoly. Eh?" [...] Dresser earned a substantial income from the song, including royalties through the sale of sheet music.|$|E
500|$|Following their signing to Interscope, Brand New stopped touring to work {{on their}} third album and major label debut. In this time, little to no {{interviews}} or updates came from the band. In 2004, Jesse Lacey told Chart magazine that he had written a [...] "few songs" [...] for the next album, commenting that [...] "the other guys love it already". He made mention of the pressure he felt with the [...] "loads of anticipation building up on my shoulders," [...] saying that he suffered from depression because of this; [...] "I'm getting depressed with all of the anxiety about the album and they say I <b>write</b> <b>my</b> best stuff when I'm in that state. Great, I'll spend the next six months all depressed and the rest of band will be excited, so that some good (material) might come out. And then I have to contend with how it's received." [...] Lacey also said that the album would [...] "move into new territory for Brand New".|$|E

500|$|Ravel took few pupils, and {{was known}} as a {{demanding}} taskmaster for those he agreed to teach. Vaughan Williams spent three months in Paris in the winter of 1907–08, working with him four or five times each week. There is little documentation of Vaughan Williams's time with Ravel; the musicologist Byron Adams advises caution in relying on Vaughan Williams's recollections in the Musical Autobiography written forty-three years after the event. The degree to which the French composer influenced the Englishman's style is debated. Ravel declared Vaughan Williams to be [...] "my only pupil who does not <b>write</b> <b>my</b> music"; nevertheless, commentators including Kennedy, Adams, Hugh Ottaway and Alain Frogley find Vaughan Williams's instrumental textures lighter and sharper in the music written after his return from Paris, such as the String Quartet in G minor, On Wenlock Edge, the Overture to The Wasps and A Sea Symphony. Vaughan Williams himself said that Ravel had helped him escape from [...] "the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner".|$|E
500|$|... “I didn't <b>write</b> <b>my</b> raps {{down for}} my first four albums — like at all, I did it from the head {{straight}} to the booth. But on this last album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, I wrote it. I really put myself in the zone that my life was dependent {{on the success of}} this album. With that being the case, I said, ‘You know what? No matter what anybody says about me, they won’t — I can write something that can make someone that hates me the most have to really respect or love the song.’ So even a song like ‘Power,’ I spent 5,000 hours writing it, and it’s really the psychology behind the lyrics; it’s not just blatantly, ‘I’ve got all the power’ — ‘No one man should have all that power.’ It’s worded it in a really sensitive way that opens it up for everyone. Even if I use first person and say ‘I, I, I,’ it’s always for everyone." ...|$|E
500|$|For the album, Shakira wrote all the lyrics, and the {{majority}} of the music. [...] "To start seeing people's first reactions, and how people start relating to these songs and appreciating every single piece of work I have done over the past two years, is the best reward an artist can have after so much hard work," [...] says Shakira. [...] "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It was painful at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." [...] While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, [...] "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I <b>write</b> <b>my</b> own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in touch with my own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as good as I can say I am today, and I am still not good enough. There is a long way to go." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics and the style {{has been compared}} to that of West's The College Dropout album. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breiham praised the song, saying [...] "Jay and Kanye trade off verses and never pause for a chorus, each one building on whatever the last one said-- an old-school rap-collab style you almost never hear anymore. And since these guys are working loose and casual, it gives them chances to show how funny and clever they are without telegraphing their own importance. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone gave the song a four stars rating out of five wrote that [...] "West twists a few seconds of Otis Redding's [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] into a Blueprint-style barrage, setting the stage for some slick collar-popping from Jay-Z ("Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth / I'm about to call the paparazzi on myself"). Jay's performance, in turn, inspires Ye to step up his wordplay ("Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses / Sophisticated ignorance, <b>write</b> <b>my</b> curses in cursive"); the younger star sounds like he pulled an all-nighter trying to outdo his mentor's rhymes." [...] Frank Berg of NME gave the song a mostly positive review, stating that [...] "What we have here are two titans of black music duetting with another from beyond the grave. For that reason, it's unquestionably An Event", though feeling [...] "In all honesty, if this winds up being the highlight of Watch the Throne we'll all be a bit disappointed." ...|$|E
