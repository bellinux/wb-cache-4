40|$|The {{title of}} this {{monograph}}y is Discourses of Writing in the Curriculum of the A-course in Swedish. The aim of this monograph is to find wich forms and discourses of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> are emphasized and premiered in the curriculum for the first course in Swedish during secondary education in Sweden, grades 10 - 12. What kind of writing are presented to the students and what potentially miss due to the selection? Is any form of writing presented more thoroughly or as {{more important than any}} other in the curriculum? The professor of linguistics, Roz Ivanic, has formed different discourses of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> she has found being used in education of writing. With these discourses of writing  I have applied them on the curriculum and then been able to see wich forms of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> are premiered. By using close reading as a method of analyze I have been able to interpret the curriculum. I have connected close reading as a method with the hermeneutic analysis tradition. The discourses of writing is my tool and my theory wich holds different forms of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> are connected to earlier science of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> I present as a background in the monograph. The conclusion I have reached are that the curriculum holds four discourses of <b>writing.</b> <b>That</b> means that the form of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> are presented to the students are a writing to imitate other types of texts, a grammatical correct spelling, a thotoughly processed text and knowledge about their own mental process that is activated during writing. The diskourse of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> is presented as the most important in the curriculum is the skills discourse of <b>writing.</b> <b>That</b> leads to a form of writing in grammatically correct writing and prepares the students to adjust to a <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> is presented mainly in higher forms of education...|$|R
