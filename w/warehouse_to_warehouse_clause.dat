40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} CAVE-based virtual reality {{simulation}} system for safety enhancement of forklift truck operations in <b>warehouses</b> <b>to</b> improve <b>warehousing</b> management. The system provides a virtual {{environment in which}} drivers can fully immerse to practise forklift truck manoeuvres and pallet operations. Truck drivers can easily review and rectify their driving techniques, and more importantly, "virtual accidents" can be created and visualised to enhance safety awareness without any real dangers. As a result, they would become more vigilant and skilful in handling adverse conditions; warehouses would become safer, more efficient and cost-effective to manage. The paper first discusses the design {{and implementation of the}} simulation algorithms in the CAVE system; it then describes the integration with an intuitive human-machine interface (HMI) based on the infra-red motion tracking system to enhance driving operations and user experiences.

40|$|Abstract. Music Information Retrieval has {{received}} increasing attention {{from both the}} industrial and the research communities in recent years. Many audio extraction techniques providing content-based music information have been developed, sparking the need for intelligent storage and retrieval facilities. This paper proposes to satisfy this need by extending technology from business-oriented data <b>warehouses</b> <b>to</b> so-called music <b>warehouses</b> that integrate a large variety of music-related information, including both low-level features and high-level musical information. Music <b>warehouses</b> thus help <b>to</b> close the “semantic gap ” by supporting integrated querying of these two kinds of music data. This paper presents {{a number of new}} challenges for the database community that must be taken up to meet the particular demands of music warehouses. ...|$|R

This system allows a rapid dispatch at the time of inventory shortage.|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{the concept}} of {{distribution}} channel re-engineering stands for a restructuring of distribution activities where the physical distribution and sales functions are organizationally separated from each other. The objective of the re-engineering process is primarily to reach dramatic improvements in operational efficiency. Our study indicates improvements in the distribution process in terms of: (1) economies of scale; (2) specialization and increased expertise; and (3) coordination and control. Altogether, the competitive outcomes of distribution channel re-engineering can be dramatic improvements both in cost efficiency and customer services. Modern information technology is the necessary vehicle both for a successful organizational separation of functions, including an efficient coordination between functions, {{and at the same}} time a closer integration within each function. Distribution channel re-engineering is probably the most important key to a successful restructuring of distribution channels of standardized products on the European market. In a case study of a multinational tool manufacturer, the improvements in terms of decreased costs and increased customer services have been remarkable. Traditional distribution structures, building chains of warehouses from factories through central <b>warehouses</b> <b>to</b> national <b>warehouses</b> at the sales company level, have been replaced with distribution structures of centralized <b>warehousing</b> <b>to</b> one single distribution centre and also of centralized administration from sales companies to one single administrative centre covering the European market...|$|R

Fuzzy supply chain {{management}} is one of the modern attitudes that lead to reduce system costs, food spoilage, losses in shipping products and to reduce inventory levels. Management of fixed costs including the cost of distribution centers construction and variable costs such as transportation costs, maintenance, shortages, manpower, deterioration of food products and others will be concluded. Queue model structure which used in this study obeys from M/G/ 1 queue that arrival rate Poisson probability distribution function and the service rate have the general probability distribution function. In this study, fuzzy supply chain has been analyzed in three levels. The suppliers are in first level, the distribution centers are in second level and the local warehouse (consumer) is located in third level.
