Authors Don and Jeff Breithaupt define progressive pop in the 1970s and 1980s as a [...] "leaner breed of pomp rock" [...] that was derivative of the Beatles. Musician Alan Parsons, {{who worked as}} an engineer on the Beatles' album Abbey Road (1969), remembers that even though he considered some of his songs [...] "pure pop", others continued to categorize his band (the Alan Parsons Project) under the [...] "progressive rock" [...] label. Parsons thought [...] "progressive pop" [...] was a better name, explaining that [...] "what made [...] progressive was the epic sound and the orchestration which very few people <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> at the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Lewis's piano playing is {{commonly}} labelled boogie woogie, gospel music was another major {{influence in the}} formation of his technique. [...] In Joe Bonomo's 2009 book Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found, Memphis producer and musician Jim Dickinson calls Lewis's occasional penchant for interrupting the standard boogie woogie left-hand progression by omitting the seventh and repeating the fifth and sixth, creating a repetitive, driving, quasi-menacing momentum, [...] "revolutionary, almost inexplicable. [...] Maybe Ella Mae Morse, maybe Moon Mullican had done it, but not in a way that became the propelling force of the song. [...] Rock and roll piano up to that point had been defined by Rosco Gordon, Ike Turner, and to an extent, Ray Charles. [...] None of them <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> [...] Even Little Richard, as primitive as he plays, wasn't doing that shuffle...There was something in Jerry Lee that didn't want to play that seventh, and that's the church. [...] Certainly in white spiritual music you avoid sevenths." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{a hearing}} before the Joint Economic Committee October 4, 2011, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said, [...] "eople are quite unhappy {{with the state of}} the economy and what’s happening. They blame, with some justification, the {{problems}} in the financial sector for getting us into this mess, and they’re dissatisfied with the policy response here in Washington. And at some level, I can’t blame them. Certainly, 9 percent unemployment and very slow growth is not a good situation." [...] On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided. “The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,” he said. “A very simplistic interpretation of that [...] was that we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> because we wanted to preserve banker salaries. That was obviously not the case.” Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard W. Fisher said that he was [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to the views of the protesters, and added, [...] "We have too many people out of work. We have a very uneven distribution of income. We have a very frustrated people, and I can understand their frustration." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 February 2013, {{speaking}} at the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden said that the Obama Administration [...] "would be prepared to meet bilaterally with the Iranian leadership. We would not make it a secret that we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> We would let our partners know if that occasion presented itself. That offer stands, {{but it must be}} real and tangible, and {{there has to be an}} agenda that they’re prepared to speak to. We are not just prepared to do it for the exercise." [...] A few days later Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected the offer and added ambiguously: [...] "The U.S. policies in the Middle East have failed and the Americans are in need of a winning hand. That is bringing Iran to the negotiating table." [...] On 4 February the Italian news-wire [...] "Agenzia Nova", citing [...] "sources in Teheran," [...] reported that [...] "from the beginning of the year Ali Larijani, Speaker of the (Iranian) Parliament, secretly traveled twice to the United States" [...] to launch direct negotiations with the Obama Administration. The Italian Agency explained that U.S. diplomacy was waiting for the Presidential election in Iran, that most probably will see a dramatic change in Iranian approach. It was reported on 17 June Iran’s newly elected president Hassan Rohani had expressed readiness for bilateral talks with Washington, with conditions.|$|E

60|$|LUBIN. Yes. It {{occurred}} quite at {{the beginning}} of my career. I was asked to deliver an address to the students at the Working Men's College; and I was strongly advised to comply, as Gladstone and Morley and others <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> sort of thing at the moment. It was rather a troublesome job, because I had not gone into political economy at the time. As you know, at the university I was a classical scholar; and my profession was the Law. But I looked up the text-books, and got up the case most carefully. I found that the correct view is that all this Trade Unionism and Socialism and so forth is founded on the ignorant delusion that wages and the production and distribution of wealth can be controlled by legislation or by any human action whatever. They obey fixed scientific laws, which have been ascertained and settled finally by the highest economic authorities. Naturally I do not at this distance of time remember the exact process of reasoning; but I can get up the case again at any time in a couple of days; and you may rely on me absolutely, should the occasion arise, to deal with all these ignorant and unpractical people in a conclusive and convincing way, except, of course, as far as it may be advisable to indulge and flatter them a little so as to let them down without creating ill feeling in the working-class electorate. In short, I can get that lecture up again almost at a moment's notice.|$|E
60|$|He {{learned from}} his {{companion}} that the new play, the thing they were rehearsing, was an old play, a romantic drama of thirty years before, very frequently revived and threadbare with honourable service. Dashwood had a part in it, {{but there was an}} act in which he didn't appear, and this was the act they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> morning. Yolande had done all Yolande could do; the visitor was mistaken if he supposed Yolande such a tremendous hit. It had done very well, it had run three months, but they were by no means coining money with it. It wouldn't take them {{to the end of the}} season; they had seen for a month past that they would have to put on something else. Miss Rooth, moreover, wanted a new part; she was above all impatient to show her big range. She had grand ideas; she thought herself very good-natured to repeat the same stuff for three months. The young man lighted another cigarette and described to his listener some of Miss Rooth's ideas. He abounded in information about her--about her character, her temper, her peculiarities, her little ways, her manner of producing some of her effects. He spoke with familiarity and confidence, as if knowing more about her than any one else--as if he had invented or discovered her, were in a sense her proprietor or guarantor. It was the talk of the shop, both with a native sharpness and a touching young candour; the expansion of the commercial spirit when it relaxes and generalises, is conscious of safety with another member of the guild.|$|E
60|$|If I {{have lost}} the sense of what we <b>were</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>that</b> could at all suffer commemoration, at Montepulciano, so I sit {{helpless}} before the memory of small stewing Torrita, which we must somehow have expected to yield, under our confidence, a view of shy charms, but which did n't yield, to my recollection, even anything that could fairly be called a breakfast or a dinner. There {{may have been in}} the neighbourhood a rumour of Etruscan tombs; the neighbourhood, however, was vast, and that possibility not to be verified, in the conditions, save after due refreshment. Then it was, doubtless, that the question of refreshment so beckoned us, by a direct appeal, straight across country, from Perugia, that, casting consistency, if not to the winds, since alas there were none, but to the lifeless air, we made the sweltering best of our way (and it took, for the distance, a terrible time) to the Grand Hotel of that city. This course shines for me, in the retrospect, with a light even more shameless than that in which my rueful conscience then saw it; since we thus exchanged again, at a stroke, the tousled bonne fille of our vacational Tuscany for the formal and figged-out presence of Italy on her good behaviour. We had never seen her conform more to all the proprieties, we felt, than under this aspect of lavish hospitality to that now apparently quite inveterate swarm of pampered forestieri, English and Americans in especial, who, having had Roman palaces and villas deliciously to linger in, break the northward journey, when once they decide to take it, in the Umbrian paradise. They were, goodness knows, within their rights, and we profited, as anyone may easily and cannily profit at that time, by the sophistications paraded for them; only I feel, as I pleasantly recover it all, that though we had arrived perhaps at the most poetical of watering-places we had lost our finer clue. (The difference from other days was immense, all the span of evolution from the ancient malodorous inn which somehow did n't matter, to that new type of polyglot caravanserai which everywhere insists on mattering--mattering, even in places where other interests abound, so much more than anything else.) That clue, the finer as I say, I would fain at any rate to-day pick up for its close attachment to another Tuscan city or two--for a felt pull from strange little San Gimignano delle belle Torre in especial; by which I mean from the memory of a summer Sunday spent there during a stay at Siena. But I have already superabounded, for mere love of my general present rubric--the real thickness of experience having a good deal evaporated, so that the Tiny Town of the Many Towers hangs before me, not to say, rather, far behind me, after the manner of an object directly meeting the wrong or diminishing lens of one's telescope.|$|E
