The system-which consisted of felling, delimbing, bucking, hauling, and transporting activities- involves a combination of stress factors e. q. difficult work postures, generation of force, and lifting techniques. In the other hand, combination of the three is well associated with high risk of work-related musculoskeletal injuries (MSIs), including musculoskeletal disorders. This research aimed to assess difficult work posture on felling, delimbing, bucking, and manually short <b>wood</b> <b>hauling</b> by employing rapid entire body assessment (REBA) technique and muscular pain scoring based on the worker's perceive. It was revealed that felling and manual hauling were scored 4 in the REBA action level, indicated very high MSIs risk level, and categorized as “necessary now” for an injury risk preventive action.

O ciclo operacional de transporte de madeira é ordenado pelas atividades de carregamento de madeira no campo, viagem carregada, descarregamento no depósito e viagem vazia. Utilizou-se a Rede de Petri Temporal, por trabalhar com dois tempos duração de sensibilização. Realizaram-se simulações com os softwares JARP e ARP, a fim de simular, analisar e avaliar o desempenho operacional. As variações empregadas em cada cenário se devem à qualidade da estrada, sob as condições atuais quanto à geometria {{vertical}} e horizontal e ao quociente de irregularidade, em cada depósito para os diferentes tipos de veículo e forma de carregamento da madeira adotado. Nas regiões de topografia acidentada, a melhoria das estradas alterando seu nível de qualidade tem maior influência para o aumento do desempenho dos veículos, e os veículos 4 x 2 e 6 x 2 apresentaram os melhores resultados. Nas regiões de planícies, a escolha do veículo tem maior influência no aumento do desempenho do transporte, já que a topografia e qualidade das estradas atuais já contribuem para isso. Nesses casos, a relação tonelada transportada por distância e tempo será maior para os veículos com capacidade de carga líquida maior. This study {{aimed at}} applying {{the model of}} logistic performance evaluation of productive chains (ADELCAP), based on the times {{of the elements of}} the operational cycle of wood transport from areas of fomentation of a cellulose producing company in the State of Espírito Santo, to indicate means of optimizing physical resources, guaranteeing a flow of uninterrupted provisioning and appropriate volume of wood entrance in the regional deposits. The operational cycle of wood transport is organized by the activities of wood loading in the field, <b>wood</b> <b>hauling,</b> wood unloading in the deposit and unhauling. The Temporal Petri Net was used, because it works with two times - sensitization duration. Simulations were carried out with the ARP and ARP software systems, in order to simulate, analyze and evaluate the operational performance. The variations employed in each scenery are due {{to the quality of the}} highway, under the current conditions, as for the vertical and horizontal geometry and the irregularity quotient, in each deposit, for the different types of vehicle and form of the adopted wood loading. In the areas of uneven topography, the improvement of the highways altering their quality level has a higher influence for the increase in the performance of the vehicles, and Toco and Truck presented better results. In the areas of plains, the choice of the vehicle has a higher influence in the increase of the performance of the transport, since the topography and the quality of the current highways already contribute to the performance. In these cases, the relation between transported ton and distance and time will be higher for the vehicles with higher capacity of liquid load...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho teve por objetivo utilizar o modelo de avaliação do desempenho logístico de cadeias produtivas (ADELCAP) centrado nos tempos dos elementos do ciclo operacional do transporte de madeira, visando otimizar os recursos, garantir um fluxo contínuo de abastecimento e assegurar um volume adequado de entrada de madeira na fábrica. O ciclo operacional de transporte de madeira é composto pelo carregamento de madeira no campo, viagem carregada, descarregamento, garagem e viagem vazia. Para tanto, utilizou-se como estudo de caso uma empresa produtora de celulose do Estado de Minas Gerais. Nesse modelo de cadeia logística de transporte de madeira, utilizou-se a Rede de Petri Temporal, por trabalhar com dois tempos que correspondem a uma duração de sensibilização. Criaram-se cenários com as mesmas variações nas duas regionais estudadas e realizaram-se simulações com os softwares JARP e ARP, a fim de avaliar o desempenho operacional e econômico. As variações aplicadas nos cenários foram: melhoria das estradas florestais; aumento do número de carregadores; e melhoria da eficiência da garagem. Em ambas as regionais, o cenário com as três variações (Cenário 7) apresentou a maior redução nos tempos dos ciclos de transporte de madeira em relação à situação atual, sendo 19, 24 e 21, 48 %, respectivamente, para Rio Doce e Cocais das Estrelas. Considerando-se apenas como custo operacional o valor pago pelo frete, não estando incluso o custo referente a investimentos, tanto na {{regional}} do Rio Doce quanto em Cocais das Estrelas, ele apresentou maior redução no cenário 7 (20, 09 e 21, 22 %, respectivamente). The present work {{aimed at}} using {{the model of}} logistic performance evaluation of productive chains (ADELCAP) centered in the operational cycle time elements of wood transport, seeking to optimize the resources, to guarantee a continuous flow of supplying and to assure an appropriate volume of wood entrance in the industry. The wood transport cycle time consists of wood loading, <b>wood</b> <b>hauling,</b> wood unloading, garage and wood unhauling. A cellulose producing company in the State of Minas Gerais was used as case study. Initially, the logistics and supply chain of the company was diagnosed to know the main existent obstacles along the chain; defining their preliminary vary key parameters, based on the characterization of their structure and operation; finally, the main directors that condition their efficiency and competitiveness were identified and evaluated. The model of chain logistics of wood transport used the Temporal Petri Net for working with two times that correspond to a sensitization period. Their properties are as follows: simulation (working with hypothetical scenarios), dynamic (exit values depend on the entrance values); determinist (exit variables are not random); continuous (time is measured by real numbers); and temporal in the transitions. Scenarios, with the same variations in the two wood-producing regionals were created, and simulations with the JARP and ARP software were carried out to evaluate the operational and economic performance. The variations applied to the scenarios were: improvement of the forest roads; increase of loader numbers, and improvement of garage efficiency. For both regionals, the scenario with the three variations (Scenario 7) presented the largest reduction in cycle times of wood transport {{in relation to the}} current situation, being 19. 24 % and 21. 48 %, respectively, for Rio Doce and Cocais das Estrelas. The analyzed operational cost is the value paid for the freight, not including the investment costs. Both regionals, Rio Doce and Cocais das Estrelas, presented a larger reduction in the Scenario 7, of 20. 09 % and 21. 22 %, respectively...|$|E

The threat of violence was such that Bishop Fleming intervened, and persuaded them to adopt a common flag, on which the pink and green would be separated by a white stripe to symbolize peace. The pink symbolized the Tudor Rose of England (The Protestants) and the Green symbolized St. Patrick's Emblem of Ireland (The Catholics).

2500|$|A popular legend {{presented}} in the July 1976 issue of the Roman Catholic archdiocese's newsletter [...] "The Monitor" [...] is commonly though incorrectly believed as giving {{the origins of the}} flag. [...] The legend tells that the flag was created in 1843 by Bishop Michael Anthony Fleming and is supposedly symbolic of a tradition between local Protestants and Catholics. [...] The annual <b>wood</b> <b>hauls</b> of firewood by sealers, waiting for their vessels to leave the port of St. John's, would get embroiled in a competition to supply wood to the Anglican cathedral, Roman Catholic cathedral, schools and other charity institutions. The Protestant English marked their wood piles with the rose flag of the Natives' Society, while the Catholic Irish used green banners. The threat of violence was such that the Speaker of the House, William Carson, suggested that Bishop Fleming should be enlisted as a peacemaker. Rather than simply preaching sermons, it was decided that Fleming would try to unite the sides. [...] To that end, Bishop Fleming persuaded the two factions to adopt a common flag, tying together the rose and green flags of the two groups with a white handkerchief, which was to symbolize peace. The rose-colour is said to have symbolized the Protestant English and was taken from the Tudor rose, though this has been questioned as the Tudor Rose is actually red and white, not pink, while the green symbolized the Catholic Irish.
