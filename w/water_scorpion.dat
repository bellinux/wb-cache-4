50|$|A few insects such as <b>water</b> <b>scorpions</b> and {{mosquito}} larvae have breathing tubes ("siphons") {{with the}} opening surrounded by hydrofuge hairs, allowing them to breathe without having to leave the water.|$|R
50|$|A phylogenetically diverse {{range of}} other native {{arthropods}} including fishing spiders, <b>water</b> beetles, <b>water</b> <b>scorpions</b> and dragonfly nymphs have also been observed to prey on cane toads metamorphs. In particular, dragonfly nymphs and fishing spiders selectively attack toads over native frog species.|$|R
50|$|Water scorpion: The <b>water</b> <b>scorpion</b> {{is found}} {{primarily}} {{at the edge}} of the wetland. A reclusive hunter, it hides in the leaves waiting for its prey to pass.|$|E
50|$|Laccotrephes pfeiferiae is {{a species}} of <b>water</b> <b>scorpion</b> {{belonging}} to the family Nepidae. It was until 1999 considered synonym of Laccotrephes robustus; records of L. robustus outside the Philippines refer to this species.|$|E
50|$|The rhynes contain rare {{plants such}} as frogbit and rootless duckweed, along with many scarce {{invertebrates}} such as the hairy dragonfly and <b>water</b> <b>scorpion.</b> Birds seen at the site include; skylark, reed and sedge warblers, whimbrel, whitethroat and reed bunting.|$|E
50|$|It is likely, therefore, that Palaeophonus and its {{relatives}} were <b>water</b> <b>scorpions,</b> {{living in the}} estuaries to hunt small prey. In any case, it is highly likely that these animals reached {{from time to time}} the mainland and would have preyed upon small creatures that lived alongside it, including primitive springtails and millipedes.|$|R
25|$|The {{geographical}} distribution of {{many species of}} invertebrate in the river reflects the geology of the catchment area. Viviparid snails and <b>water</b> <b>scorpions</b> (of the genus Nepidae) are commonly found where the river runs over the London Clay. Crayfish are common in areas associated with high alkalinity particularly around Brockham and the tributaries which run over the Wealden Clay provide an excellent habitat for stoneflies, caddisflies, fast swimming mayflies and riffle beetles.|$|R
5000|$|Ranatra is a genus of {{generally}} slender predatory {{members of}} the family Nepidae, known as <b>water</b> <b>scorpions</b> or <b>water</b> stick-insects. [...] Their front legs are strong and are used to grasp prey. They breathe through a pair of long breathing pipes extending from their tails. They eat tadpoles, small fish and other insects, which they pierce with their beak and inject a saliva which both sedates and begins to digest their prey.|$|R
50|$|Laccotrephes is a genus of <b>water</b> <b>scorpion</b> {{belonging}} to the family Nepidae. They are carnivorous insects that hunt near the water surface. They are not aggressive, but may inflict a painful bite if not handled carefully, which may cause a local reaction.|$|E
50|$|Most of the zoo's {{invertebrates}} {{are found}} in the Monsanto Insectarium. Represented species include leafcutter ant, flower mantis, Vietnamese walking stick, Atlas beetle, American burying beetle, sunburst diving beetle, <b>water</b> <b>scorpion,</b> brown widow spider, brown recluse spider, yellow garden spiders, Platymeris biguttatus, cobalt blue tarantula, Texas brown tarantula, and Egyptian fattail scorpion.|$|E
50|$|The Well {{measures}} 386 ft {{in diameter}} from rim to rim and contains a near-constant volume of spring water even {{in times of}} severe drought. The water is highly carbonated and contains high levels of arsenic. At least five endemic species are found exclusively in Montezuma Well: a diatom, the Montezuma Well springsnail, a <b>water</b> <b>scorpion,</b> the Hyalella montezuma amphipod, and the Motobdella montezuma leech — the most endemic species in any spring in the southwestern United States.|$|E
50|$|Forty-eight species, {{among them}} leeches, spiders, <b>water</b> <b>scorpions</b> and other insects, were found inside the cave, of which 33 are endemic. The food chain {{is based on}} {{chemosynthesis}} {{in the form of}} methane- and sulfur-oxidising bacteria, which in turn release nutrients for fungi and other bacteria. This forms microbial mats on the cave walls and the surface of lakes and ponds which are grazed on by some of the animals. The grazers are then preyed on by predatory species.|$|R
25|$|The {{most diverse}} group of animals on earth, the insects, are {{included}} in a larger taxon known as hexapods, {{most of which are}} hexapedal, walking and standing on six legs. Exceptions among the insects include praying mantises and <b>water</b> <b>scorpions,</b> which are quadrupeds with their front two legs modified for grasping, some butterflies such as the Lycaenidae (blues and hairstreaks) which use only four legs, and some kinds of insect larvae that may have no legs (e.g., maggots), or additional prolegs (e.g., caterpillars).|$|R
50|$|Several {{families}} of Heteroptera are water bugs, adapted to an aquatic lifestyle, {{such as the}} water boatmen (Corixidae), <b>water</b> <b>scorpions</b> (Nepidae), and backswimmers (Notonectidae). They are mostly predatory, and have legs adapted as paddles to help the animal move through the water. The pondskaters or water striders (Gerridae) are also associated with water, but use the surface tension of standing water to keep them above the surface; they include the sea skaters in the genus Halobates, the only truly marine group of insects.|$|R

50|$|Nearby is Puxton Moor, a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is a {{large area}} of pasture land {{networked}} with species-rich rhynes, now owned and managed as a nature reserve by Avon Wildlife Trust. The rhynes contain rare plants such as frogbit and rootless duckweed, along with many scarce invertebrates such as the hairy dragonfly and <b>water</b> <b>scorpion.</b> Birds seen at the site include; skylark, reed and sedge warblers, whimbrel, whitethroat and reed bunting. The site also contains a relict Roman landscape which is evident {{in many of the}} fields; Medieval earthworks are also present.|$|E
50|$|The larvae {{are called}} bloodworms because some larva are bright red, {{but they can}} also be found in brown and almost black. When the larva pupate, they drift towards the surface, making them {{vulnerable}} to many types of fish. Other common predators include the common backswimmer (Notonecta glauca), common pondskater (Gerris lacustris), common toad (Bufo bufo), lesser water boatman (Corixa punctata), dragonflies, damselflies, great crested newt (Triturus cristatus), great diving beetle (Dytiscus marginalis), redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), smooth newt (Triturus vulgaris), <b>water</b> <b>scorpion</b> (Nepa cinerea) and other midges such as Anatopynia plumipes.|$|E
50|$|The reserve has boasted 27 {{different}} varieties of butterfly including the large skipper, the speckled wood, white-letter hairstreak, small copper, holly blue and the brown argus. The reservoir is stocked with trout {{and is available}} for angling {{between the end of}} March and the middle of December. One reason for the plentiful fish might be the large abundance of aquatic invertebrates - including dragonfly larvae, water boatman, great diving beetles (and larvae), pond skaters, <b>water</b> <b>scorpions</b> and silver diving beetles.|$|R
50|$|Some adult insects which spend {{considerable}} time underwater have an abdominal breathing tube. For example adult <b>water</b> <b>scorpions</b> have the caudal process {{which consists of}} a pair of half-tubes capable of being locked together to form a siphon by means of which air is conducted to the tracheae at the apex of the abdomen when the tip of the tube is thrust above the surface of the water. In immature forms the siphon is undeveloped and breathing takes place through six pairs of abdominal sperms.|$|R
60|$|We {{have already}} noted {{the size of}} the earlier <b>water</b> <b>scorpions.</b> For long ages such creatures were the supreme lords of life. Then {19} in a {{division}} of these Palæozoic rocks called the Silurian division, which many geologists now suppose to be as old as five hundred million years, there appears a new type of being, equipped with eyes and teeth and swimming powers of an altogether more powerful kind. These were the first known backboned animals, the earliest fishes, the first known Vertebrata.|$|R
50|$|During the Silurian Period {{most of the}} Australian {{continent}} in {{the west}} and centre was dry land. However, from Geraldton north to Exmouth Gulf along the far Western Australian coast a fluvial sediment basin existed. Near Kalbarri on the Murchison River the footprints of a giant <b>water</b> <b>scorpion</b> were found on land, the first animal to walk on the Australian continent. A gulf linked to the sea existed under what is now the Great Sandy Desert. Meanwhile, in the east there were volcanic arcs in New England, also west of Townsville and Cairns, and in NSW and Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. Deep water sediments formed in the Cowra, Tumut and Hillend Troughs. The Yass Molong rise was a row of volcanoes. Granite intrusions formed in New South Wales and Victoria from 435 to 425 Mya, with the Bega batholith as young as 400 Mya. In NSW granites the distinction between I-type and S-type granites was discovered.|$|E
5000|$|Liu An's (c. 139 BCE) Huainanzi uses bianhua 17 times. For instance, this hunchback {{story about}} Ziqiu 子求 [...] "Master Seek", {{adapted from the}} Zhuangzi (6, tr. Mair 1994:58) {{description}} of Ziyu 子輿 [...] "Master Chariot".Ziqiu had lived for fifty-four years when an injury made him hunchbacked. The arch of his spine was higher than his forehead; his chin pressed down on his chest; his two buttocks were on top; his rectum pointed to the sky. He crawled over to peer at himself in a well: [...] "Amazing! That which fashions and transforms us! How has it turned me into this crumpled thing?" [...] This shows that from his viewpoint, alterations and transformation bianhua are the same. (7, tr. Major et al. 2010: 252) The Huainanzi describes transformations in nature (tr. Major et al. 2010: 399): [...] "Now the frog becomes a quail, and the <b>water</b> <b>scorpion</b> becomes the dragonfly. These give rise to what is not their own kind. Only the sage understands their transformations." [...] To know the bianhua of things {{is the hallmark of}} spiritual knowledge (Robinet 1993: 155).|$|E
40|$|Tadpoles {{have adopted}} {{different}} strategies to escape predators. In {{this study we}} examine tadpole response to predators. Hyperolius spinigularis {{was found in a}} pond and Rana angolensis and Bufo brauni were collected from a stream. All tadpoles were exposed to a pond predator (<b>water</b> <b>scorpion)</b> and a stream and pond predator (dragonfly larvae). H. spinigularis reacted to the <b>water</b> <b>scorpion</b> by lowering its activity level whereas B. brauni reacted by raising its activity level. R. angolensis did not respond to the <b>water</b> <b>scorpion.</b> H. spinigularis and B. brauni are both found in ponds with water scorpions and it is therefore no surprise that both species react to this predator. R. angolensis is never found in ponds and has no adaptations to the predator. No tadpoles changed their activity level {{in the presence of the}} dragonfly larvae. It is possible that dragonflies are too common or to rare for the tadpoles to evolve any specific adaptation to this predator...|$|E

50|$|With {{the arrival}} at Constantinople of Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol, U.S. High Commissioner to the Ottoman Empire and Senior U.S. Naval Officer in Turkish <b>Waters,</b> <b>Scorpion</b> assumed duties as {{flagship}} and dispatch vessel, continuing, {{at the same}} time, her station ship and relief work. Redesignated PY-3 in 1920 when the U.S. Navy instituted its alphanumeric hull classification system, she shifted to Phaleron Bay, Greece, in November 1923 and took up duties as station ship in the eastern Mediterranean. In late 1926, Commander Moses B. Byington took command. On 16 June 1927, she departed the Mediterranean under Commander Byington and steamed west {{to return to the}} U.S. On 11 July, she arrived at Philadelphia.|$|R
