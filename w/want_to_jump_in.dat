5000|$|Local MPs have criticised SWERDA for {{interfering in}} the private sector, and said there may be ulterior motives. Andrew George, MP for St Ives, said, [...] "The RDA’s antics {{are at odds with}} the claims made to me by the Minister in Parliament and in a letter that the RDA 'will be {{informed}} by the outcome of public consultation. I am astounded that a public body can be acting in such a predatory manner. The RDA seems to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> where it is not wanted and yet it doesn’t intervene where it is. There are places like the Union Hotel in Penzance where the owner and local applicants would be grateful if the RDA were able to step in and purchase but the RDA says that it must be market tested first. Yet when they are faced with a Mine where the owners want to do something constructive, the RDA seem keen to intervene. The public sector has a role in supporting the private sector when projects are not able to be self sustaining. Public money and resources should not be used to undermine the efforts of the private sector".|$|E

40|$|Many {{would hold}} the First World {{responsible}} for Third World poverty. Much was written about exploitation of their colonies by the metropolis, {{and it is}} worth quickly reviewing this and other more recent points of contention. These have included pushing the colonies towards specialization {{in the production of}} tropical raw materials, development of synthetic substitutes as the colonies became restless and then declared independence, handling of loans to the Third World, copyright and other means of protection of intellectual property, environmental protection. While differences between the First and Third Worlds along these lines persist and are still prominent in discussion, yet they may be less important than something quite different that is holding back the world's poor. That is the example that the First World sets in technology, and that the Third World strives to emulate. Large projects [...] steel mills, aircraft factories, an elaborately automated textile industry, are not without their attractiveness to the elite of a poor country, as a sign that it is catching up, that it need not replicate the labor intensive aspects of the Industrial Revolution as it was played through in the West. Yet putting its scarce capital into these is a great deal short of optimum allocation from a social point of view. Plants built for show played no part in the success of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan since World War II; on the other hand they did play a part in the Iran of Shah Pahlevi, and led to the displacement of the forward-looking, westernizing Shah by the backward-looking Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. How did the Shah accomplish this unintended outcome of his high-technology programs? He did it by devoting too little attention to the little people. He disposed of exceptionally large amounts of capital, but it was not enough to create employment opportunities for all at the level of technology <b>to</b> which he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> one stride. Capital was far less available to Japan in the 1950 s, but what it had it used to make labor productive [...] starting with agriculture where as in any country {{a large part of the}} labor is located at the start of industrialization. By raising productivity across the board, encouraging artisan industry in the countryside and the city alike, rather than concentrating on a few high-tech labor-saving plants, East Asian countries could get their whole population into the act, and ultimately progress to a point that in many respects is ahead of the West. What we know from Iran, Algeria, Egypt, the Philippines, and to some extent Latin America is that concentration of production may more quickly attain the appearance of development, but the process is unstable.

40|$|This paper {{integrates}} exchange-rate policy into a {{model of}} exchange- rate behavior, and examines the data econometrically to infer hypotheses about policy behavior in the 1970 s. The model shows how unanticipated movements in money, the current account, and relative price levels will cause first a <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> the exchange rate, and then a movement along a "saddle path" to the new long run equilibrium. Here the role of "news" in moving the exchange rate is clear. The model is {{used to analyze the}} options available to the central bank that <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> reduce the <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> the exchange rate following a real or monetary disturbance. The distinction is made between monetary policy and sterilized intervention, and a regime in which the domestic interest rate is used as the policy variable is also studied. Systems of vector autoregressions (VARs) for each of four countries [...] the U. S., the U. K., Germany, and Japan [...] are estimated, and the correlations among their residuals are studied. These represent the "innovations," or "news" in the time series. A clear pattern emerges in these correlations, in which policy in the U. S. {{and to a lesser extent}} Japan, drives exchange rates, and policy in Germany and the U. K. reacts. It appears that U. S. monetary policy is essentially determined by domestic considerations, with the exchange rate moving as a consequence. In Japan, interest rates are varied in response to movement in the current-account and relative price levels, and the effects on the exchange rate are partially neutralized by sterilized intervention. Germany and the U. K. react to movements in their exchange rates by moving interest rates, and sterilized intervention. ...|$|R

40|$|During the 1970 s an {{extensive}} theoretical literature has developed analyzing market determination of freely floating exchange rates. At the same time, {{there has been}} extensive and continuous intervention in the market by central banks. Exchange rates have not been floating freely;they have been managed, or manipulated, by central banks. However, most of the description of exchange rate policy, as actually practiced, has been informal, or "literary," not integrated with the formal theoretical literature. Recent examples are the surveys in Branson (l 98 la) and Mussa (1981). In this paper I integrate exchange-rate policy into a model of exchange-rate behavior, and examine the monthly data from the 1970 s econometrically,to infer hypotheses about policy behavior. I focus on four major currencies, the U. S. dollar, the Deutschemark, Sterling, and the Japanese yen,and analyze movements in their effective (weighted) exchange rates as calculated by the IMF. In section II a model of market determination of a floating exchange-rateis laid out. It is a rational-expectations version of the model in Branson(1977), and it draws {{on the model of}} Kouri (1978). It {{is the same as the}} model in Branson (1983). The model shows how unanticipated movements in money, the current account, and relative price levels will cause first a <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> the exchange rate, and then a movement along a "saddle path" tothe new long run equilibrium. Here the role of "news" in moving the exchangerate, as recently emphasized by Dornbusch (1980) and Frenkel (1981), is clear. The model emphasizes imperfect substitutability between domestic and foreign bonds, in order to prepare for the analysis of intervention policy in section III. Exchange-rate policy is introduced in section III. We analyze the options available to the central bank that <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> reduce the <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> the exchangerate following a real or monetary disturbance-"news" about the current account, relative prices, or money. This is the policy characterized as"leaning against the wind" in Branson (1976). The distinction ismade between monetary policy and sterilized intervention. In section IV we turn to the monthly data. The quarterly data were analyzed in Branson (1983). Systems of vector autoregressions (VARs) are estimated for each of the countries, and the correlations among their residuals are studied. These represent the "innovations," or "news" in the time series. A clear pattern emerges in these correlations, in which policy inthe U. S. and Japan drives exchange rates, and policy in Germany and the U. K. reacts by moving interest rates, and by sterilized intervention. This is essentially the same result that appeared on the quarterly data in Branson (1983). Thus the analyses tend to reinforce each other; both datasets tell basically the same story. ...|$|R
