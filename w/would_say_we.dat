I'm not going to suggest that it's easy, but we have not found the formula as a country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hill {{said in an}} {{interview}} on April 21, 2008 in the Seattle Times that the United States' relationship with China is the most important bilateral relationship in the world. [...] "I would say the China relationship is the most important bilateral relationship we have in the world", says Hill. [...] "We have some 57 dialogues with Chinese counterparts, ranging from global warming to economic and trade issues. I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> {{spend a great deal of}} time and attention on things Chinese with the understanding that in the long run we have to have a good working relationship with 1.3 billion people." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{seven years}} after Shahak's death, the {{controversy}} of religious interpretation continued when Rabbi Shmuley Boteach doubted the veracity of Shahak's report of Jewish injustice against a non-Jew: [...] "From the beginning, the story was curious. What prohibition could there possibly be, in allowing someone else to use one's phone on the Sabbath?" [...] In support, he cited Eli Beer, the chief coordinator of Israel's volunteer ambulance service (1,100 medical personnel, 60 per cent Orthodox), who said, [...] "If someone <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> won't save a non-Jewish life on the Sabbath, he is a liar. If he is Jewish, Christian, or Muslim we save everyone's life on {{any day of the}} year, including the Sabbath and Yom Kippur, and I have done so myself. Indeed, as an Orthodox Jew it is my greatest honor {{to save the life of}} a non-Jew, and I would violate any of the Jewish holy days to do so." ...|$|E

50|$|A key {{aspect of}} Liberal Theism {{is the idea}} that {{classical}} theism can be modified.

6000|$|For {{presently}} they {{that had}} heard what was said, flew about the town; one crying one thing, and another the quite contrary, {{and both were}} sure enough they told the truth, for they did hear, they said, with their ears what was said, and therefore could not be deceived. One <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>We</b> must all be killed; another <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>We</b> must all be saved; and a third {{would say that the}} Prince would not be concerned with Mansoul; and a fourth that the prisoners must be suddenly put to death. And as I said, every one stood to it that he told his tale the rightest, and that all others but he were out. Wherefore Mansoul had now molestation upon molestation, nor could any man know on what to rest the sole of his foot; for one would go by now, and as he went, if he heard his neighbour tell his tale, to be sure he would tell the quite contrary, and both would stand in it that he told the truth. Nay, some of them had got this story by the end, that the Prince did intend to put Mansoul to the sword. And now it began to be dark; wherefore poor Mansoul was in sad perplexity all that night until the morning.[188] ...|$|E
5000|$|The slight {{discrepancy}} (by one) in {{the number}} of Allied burials (WW1=2,128 & WW2=7; total = 2,135 v 2,134) is because there is one non-combatant buried in Mont-Huon. Mrs Gertrude Chambers, who died 1st December 1918 aged 27 is interred in Mont-Huon.

500|$|Once Iñárritu {{agreed to}} direct, {{he began working}} with Smith on script rewrites. In an {{interview}} with Creative Screenwriting, Smith admitted during this process he was unsure if Iñárritu would {{even be able to}} film some of the sequences they wrote. He recalled, [...] "He would have some ideas and I <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'Alejandro, <b>we</b> can’t pull this off.

6000|$|Innocent alike of all {{knowledge}} of the serious reason for fear which did really exist, Mrs. Ellmother and Alban felt, nevertheless, the same vague distrust of an intimacy between the two girls. Idle, vain, malicious, false--to know that Francine's character presented these faults, without any discoverable merits to set against them, was surely enough to justify a gloomy view of the prospect, if she succeeded in winning the position of Emily's friend. Alban reasoned it out logically in this way--without satisfying himself, and without accounting for the remembrance that haunted him of Mrs. Ellmother's farewell look. [...] "A commonplace man <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> are both in a morbid state of mind," [...] he thought; [...] "and sometimes commonplace men {{turn out to be}} right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would have}} more than the charm of novelty," [...] the hero said, and the witness trembled again for the convenances which one so often sees {{offended}} on the benches in the Park. But then he remembered that these young people were avowedly nice, {{and that they were}} morally incapable of misbehavior. [...] "And for a time, at least, I believe you--I believe we, for I must necessarily be engaged with you--would succeed. The difficulty would be to get the notion of our employment to the authors." [...] It was on the listener's tongue to say that he thought he could manage that, when the hero arrested him with the sad misgiving, [...] "But they <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> were commonplace, and that would kill the chance of our ever having a run." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{those of}} us who are still left of that band of {{children}} who played long years ago in the old orchard and walked the golden road together in joyous companionship, foregather now and again in our busy lives and talk over the events of those many merry moons--there are some of our adventures that gleam out more vividly in memory than the others, and are oftener discussed. The time we bought God's picture from Jerry Cowan--the time Dan ate the poison berries--the time we heard the ghostly bell ring--the bewitchment of Paddy--the visit of the Governor's wife--and the night we were lost in the storm--all awaken reminiscent jest and laughter; but none more than the recollection of the Sunday Peg Bowen came to church and sat in our pew. Though goodness knows, as Felicity <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>we</b> did not think it any matter for laughter at the time--far from it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, 'tis a pity she's so headstrong," [...] {{the first}} <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> [...] "But <b>we</b> {{ought to be}} proud of her here--she lightens up the old place. 'Tis such a shapely maid, however, that she'll soon get picked up." ...|$|R
40|$|Democracies {{often fail}} to {{aggregate}} information, while speculative markets excel at this task. We consider {{a new form of}} governance, wherein voters <b>would</b> <b>say</b> what <b>we</b> want, but speculators <b>would</b> <b>say</b> how to get it. Elected representatives would oversee the after-the-fact measurement of national welfare, while market speculators <b>would</b> <b>say</b> which policies they expect to raise national welfare. Those who recommend policies that regressions suggest will raise GDP should be willing to endorse similar market advice. Using a qualitative engineering-style approach, we present three scenarios, consider thirty-three design issues, and finally a more specific design responding to those concerns...|$|R
60|$|Many people <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that <b>we</b> {{were two}} fools to {{encounter}} such poverty together. I can only reply that {{since that day}} I have never been without money in my pocket, and that I soon acquired the means of paying what I owed. Nevertheless, more than twelve years had to pass over our heads before I received any payment for any literary work which afforded an appreciable increase to our income.|$|R
