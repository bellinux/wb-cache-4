5|$|As {{measured}} on women undergoing in vitro fertilization, a longer menstrual cycle length {{is associated with}} higher pregnancy and delivery rates, even after age adjustment. Delivery rates after IVF have been estimated to be almost doubled for <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared with <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days. A longer menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and embryo quality.|$|E

Management of intrauterine fetal {{death in the}} second or third trimester of pregnancy in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> incarcerated uterus is challenging. We report a case of successful vaginal delivery following intrauterine fetal death by expectant management in <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> incarcerated uterus. In cases of intrauterine fetal death in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> incarcerated uterus, vaginal delivery may be possible if the incarceration is successfully reduced. If the reduction is impossible, expectant management can reduce uterine retroversion, thereby leading to spontaneous reduction of the incarcerated uterus. Thereafter, vaginal delivery may be possible...|$|R

5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated phallic {{festivals and}} built a shrine with an erect phallus to honor Hermes, {{messenger}} of the gods. Those figures {{may be related to}} the ancient Egyptian deity Min who was depicted holding his erect phallus. Figures of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> phallus for a head have been found across Greece and Yugoslavia. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architectural tradition of ancient Babylon. The Romans, who were deeply superstitious, also often used phallic imagery in their architecture and domestic items. The ancient cultures of many parts of the Far East, including Indonesia, India (such as the Lingam), Korea and Japan, used the phallus as a symbol of fertility in motifs on their temples and in other areas of everyday life.|$|E

5|$|The {{tumor marker}} CA-125 is {{frequently}} elevated in endometrial cancer {{and can be}} used to monitor response to treatment, particularly in serous cell cancer or advanced disease. Periodic MRIs or CT scans may be recommended in advanced disease and <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of endometrial cancer should receive more frequent pelvic examinations for the five years following treatment. Examinations conducted every three to four months are recommended for the first two years following treatment, and every six months for the next three years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{family history}} of endometrial cancer are at higher risk. Two genes most {{commonly}} associated with some other women's cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2, do not cause endometrial cancer. There is an apparent link with these genes but it is attributable {{to the use of}} tamoxifen, a drug that itself can cause endometrial cancer, in breast and ovarian cancers. The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause endometrial cancer. Women with this disorder have a 5–10%lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer, compared to the 2–3%risk for unaffected women.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer appears most {{frequently}} during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63years of age; in the United States, the average age of diagnosis is 60years of age. White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than black American <b>women,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.|$|E

25|$|Vaginally dosed {{progesterone}} {{is being}} investigated as potentially beneficial in preventing preterm birth in women at risk for preterm birth. The initial study by Fonseca suggested that vaginal progesterone could prevent preterm birth in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of preterm birth. According to a recent study, <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> short cervix that received hormonal treatment with a progesterone gel had their risk of prematurely giving birth reduced. The hormone treatment was administered vaginally every day {{during the second half}} of a pregnancy. A subsequent and larger study showed that vaginal progesterone was no better than placebo in preventing recurrent preterm birth in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of a previous preterm birth, but a planned secondary analysis of the data in this trial showed that <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> short cervix at baseline in the trial had benefit in two ways: a reduction in births less than 32 weeks and a reduction in both the frequency and the time their babies were in intensive care.|$|E
