He left Microsoft in 2002 to co-found, with business partner Gregor Kiczales, a company called Intentional Software. This company markets the intentional programming concepts Simonyi developed at Microsoft Research. In this approach to software, a programmer first builds a language environment specific to a given problem domain (such as life insurance). Domain experts, aided by the programmer, then describe the program's intended behavior in a What You See Is <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Get</b> (WYSIWYG)-like manner. An automated system uses the program description and the language to generate the final program. Successive changes are only done at the WYSIWYG level.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of Manson's album, his {{rendition}} of [...] "Cease to Exist" [...] was regarded as [...] "one of Manson's signature performances, and has justifiably invited comparison with Jim Croce and José Feliciano". Critic Michael Little considers Manson's version superior to the Beach Boys', having praise especially for Manson's vocals. Naturally, Little attests, [...] "you expect a tattered, raw, and raggedy voice, {{with a touch of}} lunatic rage, but <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> is a smooth-voiced folk singer". He also wrote that Manson's raw, stripped-down take [...] "gives the song an impressive lo-fi immediacy that is a million miles away from the Beach Boys' treatment".|$|E
500|$|Among other Harrison biographers' {{interpretations of}} the lyrics, Ian Inglis writes of Harrison's unwelcome [...] "evangelical" [...] message {{regarding}} [...] "the consequences of a life of selfishness and greed which finds no place for 'the Lord'". In contrast, Leng views the verses as [...] "the singer's inner conversation", in which Harrison acknowledges the futility of his own existence, {{at a time when}} he felt overwhelmed by his success as a solo artist following the Beatles' break-up in 1970. Of the apparent sermonising in the choruses, Leng concludes: [...] "'The Lord Loves the One' conveys the same basic message as 'what you put in is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> out,' so, at one level, it's more a matter of common sense than divine revelation." ...|$|E

500|$|Andy Patrizio of IGN {{awarded the}} DVD {{six out of}} ten commenting, [...] "Tom Araya lost his {{piercing}} shriek that opens 'Angel of Death' {{and the end of}} 'Necrophobic'", praising Lombardo's return by saying the drummer [...] "...hasn't lost a step at all. With barely any breathing time between songs, the underground drum legend shows that an impending 40th birthday (next month) isn't going to slow him down." [...] Patrizio stated the production was not of the highest caliber, as the rapid [...] "MTV-style" [...] cuts were distracting, as was the switch from black and white to color shots. Patrizio ended the review with the comment, [...] "This is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> for letting Uwe Boll direct your music video", Boll being a heavily criticized film director.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene of}} the crime was visited by Father Michael Lewis of the Stella Maris Church, who was {{accompanied}} by Williamson's sister Gradryn Williams; she was convinced not to look at the body by Williamson's friends. Crowds assembled outside the apartment block, made up of individuals who were laughing and celebrating Williamson's death.

[...] ("Faggots should die!"). Others sang [...] "Boom Bye Bye", a line from a dancehall song by Buju Banton that discusses shooting and burning gay men.

500|$|The musical {{structuring}} of [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] {{uses the}} AABA form, {{in which the}} song's title serves as {{the main source of}} needed repetition. When used to the maximum, this structuring, also known as the thirty-two-bar form, has the title repeat itself in the same place, in {{at least two of the}} three A verses. Author Sheila Davis' book, The Craft of Lyric Writing, notes that [...] "the repeated title line simultaneously outlines the framework of the design and drives home the main point of the lyric". Jackson's [...] "She's Out of My Life" [...] also uses this musical structuring, as does [...] "Body and Soul", [...] "Oh, Lady Be Good!" [...] and [...] "Try a Little Tenderness". The musical chords in [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] are seen in several songs written by Jackson. [...] "That's <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Get</b> for Being Polite", from The Jacksons' Destiny album, and two unreleased songs ("Why Can't I Be" [...] and [...] "Thank You for Life") used the chords before [...] "The Girl Is Mine".|$|E
500|$|BBC America {{described}} Gilly {{on their}} official website stating: [...] "His most endearing quality is his honesty {{and despite his}} countless flaws, {{what you see is}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get.</b> He's hardly a ladykiller but what he lacks in appearance he makes up for with charisma." [...] E4 publicity describe Gilly as fun-loving and always trying to woo females but hardly manages to impress them and has also been described as unlucky-in-love after his failed relationships. Initially he failed to impress females and didn't have much in common with them. Gilly has been portrayed as a strong supporter of Manchester City F.C., it was this single thing that drew him and Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan) together. Gilly was later made a fool by Beth and his best friend Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) after they continued an affair despite the fact they were siblings, they split, Beth subsequently died and due to Gilly's forgiving personality he later forgave Rhys. Holy Soap opined that this was a stand out moment of the character's duration. Another storyline showing his timid personality was when he was mugged by a group of teenagers and was left fearing for his safety and even let them pick on him on the streets. In a further twist Gilly was left feeling so ashamed of the attack he pretended it was adult attackers fearing what people would think of him.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A superb episode. Some colorful background for Homer and Marge (and a glimpse of Homer and Barney's schooldays) plus our introduction {{to the world of}} the McBain films. Excellent." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought the episode was a [...] "fine program", and added that Lovitz made Artie [...] "amusingly annoying". Jacobson thought the episode captured the [...] "tone of the mid-Seventies with warmth and insight", and the courtship [...] "seemed charming but not sappy, and the show worked well overall." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was Grampa's advice to Homer about Marge, [...] "Oh, son, don’t overreach! Go for the dented car, the dead-end job, the less attractive girl!" [...] When Homer arrives at the Bouvier house to pick up Marge for the prom, Selma tells Patty [...] "Marge's dates get homelier all the time," [...] to which Patty replies [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> when you don't put out." [...] Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought these were the best lines of the episode. IGN ranked Lovitz as the eighth best guest star in the show's history.|$|E
500|$|In 1966, Jennings {{released}} his debut album for RCA Folk-Country, followed by Leavin' Town and Nashville Rebel. Leavin' Town resulted in significant chart success {{as the first}} two singles [...] "Anita, You're Dreaming" [...] and [...] "Time to Burn Again" [...] both peaked at no. 17 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The album's third single, a cover of Gordon Lightfoot's [...] "(That's <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Get)</b> For Lovin' Me", became Jennings's first top 10 single, peaking at no. 9. Nashville Rebel was the soundtrack to an independent film of the same name, starring Jennings. The single [...] "Green River" [...] charted on Billboard country singles at #11. In 1967, Jennings released a hit single, [...] "Just to Satisfy You". During an interview, Jennings remarked that the song was a [...] "pretty good example" [...] {{of the influence of}} his work with Buddy Holly and rockabilly music. Jennings produced midchart albums that sold well, including Just to Satisfy You, that included the same-named hit single of 1967. Jennings's singles enjoyed success. [...] "The Chokin' Kind" [...] peaked at number eight on Billboard's Hot Country Singles in 1967, while [...] "Only Daddy That'll Walk the Line" [...] hit number two the following year. In 1969, his collaboration with The Kimberlys on the single [...] "MacArthur Park" [...] earned a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group.

500|$|In 1969, the Revue's {{profile in}} their home country was raised after opening for the Rolling Stones on their US tour. In 1970, they {{performed}} on The Ed Sullivan Show. The tour's success resulted in the Revue signing with Liberty Records, where they released two albums, Come Together and Workin' Together, released in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Come Together produced the duo's first top 40 single with their cover of Sly and the Family Stone's [...] "I Want to Take You Higher." [...] Come Together marked {{a turning point in}} their careers in which they switched from their usual R repertoire to incorporate more rock tunes. In early 1971, their cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's [...] "Proud Mary" [...] became their biggest hit, reaching number 4 on the Hot 100 and selling over a million copies, winning them a Grammy for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group. Later in 1971, their live album, What You Hear Is <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Get,</b> taken from a performance at Carnegie Hall, was their first to be certified gold. In 1972, Ike Turner created the studio, Bolic Sounds, near their home in Inglewood. After Liberty was bought by United Artists Records, the duo was assigned to that label, releasing ten albums in a three-year period. The duo's final major hit single, [...] "Nutbush City Limits", was released in 1973, reaching number 22 on the Hot 100, and peaking at number 4 in the UK. In 1974, Tina released her first solo album, Tina Turns the Country On!, winning a Grammy nomination.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were created using mostly {{practical}} effects, supplemented by computer-generated imagery (CGI) created by Hammerhead VFX for about 15% of the film's special effects, {{such as the}} transformations. Wirkola said: [...] "I’m {{a big believer in}} just using CGI to polish <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> on camera. For me that’s the ideal use of CGI. We have a troll in the film that is animatronic. I loved him. It took some convincing to get the studio along with the animatronic creature. There have been bad experiences with animatronics throughout various productions but I saw this company Spectral Motion. They did the Hellboy movies and I just loved it." [...] Wirkola added: [...] "I come from Norway where we can’t afford CGI. But this is a fantastical world of witches and trolls and I wanted to ground the movie where I could. The blood should look real." [...] Janssen, however, despite Wirkola's warnings, [...] "was not entirely prepared for how involved and long that was going to be" [...] and [...] "actually wanted to burn the prosthetic make-up {{by the end of the}} movie." [...] She recalled being [...] "so overwhelmed by what this prosthetic business was all about", saying: [...] "Acting has been so specific for me and what I've learned - eyes, facial expressions, all of that stuff - and with something like this, you're robbed of all of this. Or I could no [...] rely on things I've done in the past. It was different and frustrating at times because I had this circus of people around me in case something became unglued." [...] Muriel and the other principal witches were prepared by Mike Elizalde's Spectral Motion, who also created and handled the animatronic troll. Jon Farhat was the visual effects supervisor and aerial second unit director.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews echoed {{complaints}} about the similarity of Blue Shift to previous games. GameSpy's reviewer Jamie Madigan stated that [...] "what really pulls the game down is the 'more of the same' factor". Although writing that the game [...] "feels like {{just a few more}} levels for the original game", he noted that this is what Blue Shift was designed to be, given its origins as an add-on for a Dreamcast version of Half-Life. Madigan described the single-player campaign as [...] "decent" [...] and commented that the High Definition pack made the game [...] "worthy of consideration". Eurogamer echoed criticism on the game's length; reviewer Tom Bradwell commented that [...] "although I'm hard pressed to criticize <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get,</b> the complete absence of everything we've learnt from the likes of Counter-Strike and everything since is frankly bizarre". Bradwell did, however, criticize the game's artificial intelligence and the occasional bug that caused a player to get stuck on a wall. PC Zones Mark Hill was more lenient in his comments, praising the game's artificial intelligence as [...] "intelligent as you could hope an AI enemy to be". In addition, Hill praised the game for showing more activity in the base, noting that [...] "a whole world goes on around you, with people eating at a cantina and scientists doing their laundry. The complex is more alive than ever before". Hill also praised the focus [...] "on a greater interaction with scientists as proper people rather than the two or three models that were cloned throughout the facility who kept repeating the same phrases", describing this as Blue Shifts [...] "greatest achievement". PC Zones review closed by commenting that [...] "as a Dreamcast extra it works perfectly, but as a standalone PC title there's not nearly enough to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{not widely}} reviewed, but yielded a {{generally}} positive response from critics. Steve Huey of AllMusic, who rated the album {{four out of}} five stars, said that [...] " [...] an intriguing and unexpected departure from Frusciante's work with the Chili Peppers", and that [...] "the sparse arrangements of the first half help {{set the stage for the}} gossamer guitar work later on." [...] He went on to say that Usually Just a T-Shirt—the latter half of the album—contained [...] "pleasant psychedelic instrumentals with plenty of backward-guitar effects." [...] Ned Raggett, also of AllMusic, noted that [...] "there's nothing quite so stunning as [...] magnificent remake of Bad Brains' 'The Big Takeover'." [...] Adam Williams of PopMatters said the album [...] "fall somewhere between madness and brilliance". He went on to compare Frusciante to Syd Barrett, and felt it was a [...] "hint at a deeply cerebral artist looking within for inspiration and creativity." [...] High Times Tim Kenneally saw the record as [...] "a revelation, both disturbingly intimate and cryptically veiled. Ladeled straight out of the guitarist's stream of consciousness, it's worlds away from the up-front, balls-out funk assault of his former band," [...] with [...] "an ethereal, otherworldly quality." [...] The album received its share of negative criticism as well. Rolling Stone's Christian Hoard felt [...] "Frusciante's eccentricities run seriously amok", and that [...] " [...] sounds like a string of four-track demos. The first part of the album is slightly more tuneful than the more ambient, experimental second section Mostly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> are Frusciante's acoustic-guitar scratchings and stream-of-conscious ramblings." [...] The first Rolling Stone review of the record, however, was positive: [...] "All in all, [...] a mess—but definitely a fascinating, often lovely mess. As one might expect of an album titled Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-shirt this is twisted, cool stuff." [...] The Boston Herald said that while the album was [...] "a stark display of Frusciante's acoustic guitar virtuosity" [...] and [...] "eerily beautiful", the singing was [...] "terrible; his high notes will drive the neighborhood dogs into a frenzy." ...|$|E
