5|$|The stadium {{eventually}} cost R$965million, 15% {{more than}} originally estimated. The two-year delay in receiving BNDES funds caused {{an increase of}} R$108million to the cost because {{of the difference in}} interest between loans taken from regular banks and from the government agency. Temporary structures were included in the total cost, currently estimated to be R$77million. After the sale of the tax credits received, Corinthians <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> between R$700 and R$750million spread over 12 years. Aníbal Coutinho projected the stadium to generate R$150million per year. Andres Sanchez expects revenue to reach R$200million per year and expenses to be up to R$35million per year. Revenue will come from ticket sales and commercial properties in the arena, especially corporate conventions, fairs and events. On 25 August 2013, Andres said that out of 16 naming rights properties, he had already secured seven buyers, although no deals had yet been formalised. The club plans to sell the stadium naming rights for R$400million for 20 years.|$|E

This {{supersedes}} the HK$82,000 price per sq.ft. record set by Swire Properties’ Opus Hong Kong and throughout Asia in 2012. Although it was sold at a higher price of HK$439 million in 2009, the lower stamp duty rate at the time resulted in a lower price per square foot. The buyer is confirmed to be a non-Hong Kong resident and therefore the stamp duty payable represents a total of 23.5%, which means the buyer <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> over HK$100 million in stamp duty expenses.|$|E

25|$|Juan Jimenez, {{software}} {{manager for}} Sony Spain, told Spanish gaming site The Vault that Uncharted 3 would {{make use of}} the PlayStation Network Pass, making it the second game to carry the feature following Resistance 3. As is standard, a one-time code will be provided with copies of Uncharted 3 for first time buyers giving them immediate access to online multiplayer features, whereas second-hand purchasers of the title <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> extra for online play. When asked why the developers implemented the pass system, game director Justin Richmond replied, that without the money from Sony's PSN Pass it wouldn't be able to afford to include as much online content as it has with Uncharted 3, and would possibly have to separate the online and offline content into separate products.|$|E
25|$|Belle {{has learned}} that the monster that took Robin was a Fury. Someone had used magic in Camelot to save Robin and did not pay the price, which is a life, and the monster has arrived to collect Robin's soul as payment. It {{will return to the}} Underworld when the moon reaches its zenith, but can be stopped if someone gives their life in his place. Regina confronts Emma, believing that she had summoned the Fury, but Emma reveals that Regina was the one {{responsible}} for its appearance. That night near the pond, the Fury begins pulling out Robin's soul, and Charon the boatman appears as the moon reaches its zenith. Regina sacrifices herself for Robin, and is joined by Mary Margaret, David, Leroy and Arthur. As all five band together, they successfully pull Robin from the Fury (and since the price of a single soul was equally divided among them), which disappears back into the underworld with Charon. While everyone celebrates this latest victory at Granny's, a worried Mary Margaret notes that if they win, Emma will lose. At Granny's, Henry introduces himself to Violet again and shows her what a jukebox is, and plays the same song he had played in Camelot, which, somehow, seems familiar to her. At her house, Emma opens the locked door and goes downstairs, at the behest of Rumplestiltskin's manifestation, revealing the stone with the sword Excalibur in it. Rumplestiltskin, the manifestation of her darkness, says that she can make it whole again and use it to vanquish all of the light forever. Emma tries to pull the sword from the stone but fails, being repelled by the sword's magic. After this failed attempt, the Dark One taunts her, and tells her that in order to complete the task, she <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the price, and it will cost someone dearly.|$|E
