500|$|The Joker's unpredictable, homicidal nature {{makes him}} one of the most feared supervillains in the DC Universe; the Trickster says in the 2005 mini-series Underworld Unleashed, [...] "When super-villains <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> each other, they tell Joker stories". Gotham's villains also feel {{threatened}} by the character; depending on the circumstances, he is as likely to fight with his rivals for control of the city as he is to join them for an entertaining outcome. The Joker interacts with other supervillains who oppose Batman, whether he is on the streets or in Arkham Asylum. He has collaborated with criminals like the Penguin, the Riddler and Two-Face, although these partnerships rarely end well due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos, and uses his stature to lead others (such as Killer Croc and the Scarecrow). The Joker's greatest rival is the smartest man in the world, Lex Luthor. Although they have a friendly partnership in 1950's World's Finest Comics #88, later unions emphasized their mutual hostility and clashing egos.|$|E

His emotional state {{has an effect}} on Kirsty and she kisses him. Hayes told TV Week that as Kirsty's feelings [...] "take over in the moment", Miles is left surprised because he had been harbouring feelings for her too.

6000|$|... "I'm doubtful," [...] Jim replied. [...] "Somehow I {{feel the}} fellow was bluffing; he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> me so I'd agree to his terms. Although I reckon {{he meant to}} charge me high when I came to him next time, I don't think he sent the log down. I haven't much ground for the conclusion, but there it is." ...|$|R

"It's not Myra; I asked her, and {{she turned}} pale at the mere idea of going {{anywhere}} alone after dark, and said cook had seen a banshee gliding down the Lady's Walk one night, when she got up for camphor, having the face-ache.

They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> everyone off so they could dig it out and take it away.

Joe and I blow in there to see if there's {{anything}} for us, and there's a tall guy in tortoise-shell cheaters sitting in Ike's office. Said he was the author and was engaging the principals. We told him who we were, and it didn't make any hit with him at all. He said he had never heard of us. And, when we explained, he said no, there wasn't going to be any of our sort of work in the show. Said he was making an effort to give the public something rather better than the usual sort of thing. No specialities required. He said it was an effort to restore the Gilbert and Sullivan tradition. Say, who are these Gilbert and Sullivan guys, anyway? They get written up in the papers all the time and I never met any one who'd run across them. If you want my opinion, that show down there is a comic opera!" ...|$|E

25|$|On 5 September 1975, a bomb {{exploded}} in the delicatessen, destroying it and the adjacent wine bar which was crowded with customers.

However, despite the publicity and major changes it brought, the bomb-blast storyline resulted in only a temporary boost to the program's ratings figures.|$|R

50|$|The {{governor}} of Nuevo León, Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz, {{reported that the}} first five individuals suspected of starting the casino fire were arrested on August 29. The five of them confessed to having participated in the crime which led to 52 deaths, but stated {{that they had not}} intended to kill anyone, only <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> the owners of the building because they had refused to pay a weekly fee of 130,000 pesos (roughly US$10,000 to $11,000, Aug 2011) to be allowed to operate.

5000|$|One storyline, {{which ran}} {{the week before}} Halloween in 1989 (Oct 23 to Oct 28), is unique among Garfield strips {{in that it is}} not meant to be humorous.

In Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection, in which the strips are reprinted, Jim Davis discusses the genesis for this series: [...] During a writing session for Halloween, I got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> people. And what do people fear most? Why, being alone. We carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers.
