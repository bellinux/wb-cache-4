40|$|We studied how {{value for}} {{instrumental}} action is discounted by predicted effort and delay. The monkeys {{were trained to}} perform instrumental trials that required a bar release when a visual target changed from red-to-green. There were two trial conditions. In delay trials, after the monkeys performed one instrumental trial correctly a reward was delivered 0 – 7 seconds later. In <b>work</b> <b>trials,</b> the monkeys had to perform 0, 1, or 2 additional instrumental trials to obtain a reward. The lengths of trials in delay matched {{the time it took}} to complete <b>work</b> <b>trials.</b> The length of delay or number of trials was indicated by a visual cue presented throughout the trial. Our hypothesis was that the monkeys would all show temporal discounting of reward in the delay trials, and that in the <b>work</b> <b>trials</b> the monkeys ’ performance might reflect an additional cost due to working. The error rate increased linearly as remaining cost increased for all 8 monkeys. For 4 monkeys the error rate was significantly larger in <b>work</b> <b>trials</b> than in delay trials (effort sensitive monkeys). For the other 4 monkeys {{there was no significant difference}} in error rate (effort insensitive monkeys). Since the error rate has an inverse relation with value for action, these results suggest that value is discounted hyperbolically by effort as well as by delay. Error rates generally increased as the testing sessions progressed and the total reward accumulated (i. e., effect of reward devaluation). The relative impact of delay and effort on error rates was reasonably stable within subjects. Thus, within the monkey population there seems to be a significant dichotomy in the sensitivity governing whether working is more costly than waiting, possibl...|$|E

Early reperfusion of coronary artery occlusion has greatly improved mortality, though restoration of blood supply may perpetuate cell death through reperfusion injury. Preconditioning is a potent endogenous form of cardioprotection triggered through preceding brief nonperfusion of the heart’s blood supply. In remote conditioning it is triggered by intermittent tourniquet ischaemia of a limb.

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that plate gaps are {{sometimes}} unequal in two-zoned low consistency refiners and that unequal gaps render unevenly refined pulp. It is also known that optimisation of plate gap in low consistency refining leads to improved energy efficiency. In this <b>work,</b> <b>trials</b> were made in mill scale in a modern TMP line equipped with a prototype 72 inch TwinFlo low consistency refiner in second stage. The study was designed to investigate the development of pulp properties from different rotor positions by means of altering the outlet flow rate ratio. The specific energy consumption was calculated for each refining zone and setting, based on flow rate and temperature increase. In order to produce homogenous pulp, it was found that uneven plate gaps need to be compensated in low consistency refiners with dual refining zones. Results from the different flow rate adjustments indicated that the control setting with similar plate gap gave the most homogenous pulp. However, further studies are needed to find an adequate rotor control strategy. The temperature increase in each refining zone seems to correlate well with the applied specific energy consumption in each refining zone.

40|$|Past {{investigations}} of {{performance on a}} conjunctive physical persistence task have yielded consistent evidence of motivation gains in the less able worker - a pattern first seen in data collected over 70 years ago (Köhler, 1926, 1927). Moreover, recent work indicates that these gains are due to the increased instrumentality of the weaker participant's efforts. The present study sought to demonstrate that another potential factor in the work context - the sex composition of the group, which is known to moderate self-presentation concerns - could also affect such motivation gains. Male and female members of work teams performed a physical persistence task. In one condition they performed <b>work</b> <b>trials</b> as individuals. In others, they first worked on the task alone and then were paired with a more capable same- or other-sexed teammate to perform the task conjunctively - i. e., this trial was over as soon as either person stopped.

However, also as predicted, males tended to show even greater motivation gain when paired with a more capable female, while females' efforts tended to vary the most when they were paired with a male.

Purpose: To {{investigate whether}} oxygen uptake (O 2) kinetics and simulated 4 -km cycling performance are synergistically improved by prior ‘priming’ exercise and an all-out starting strategy. Methods: Nine males completed four target <b>work</b> <b>trials</b> (114 ± 17 kJ) to assess O 2 kinetics and cycling {{performance in a}} repeated-measures, cross-over experimental design. Trials were initiated with either a 12 -s all-out start or a self-selected start and preceded by prior severe-intensity (70 %Δ) priming exercise or no priming exercise. Results: The O 2 MRT was lower (indicative of faster O 2 kinetics) in the all-out primed condition (20 ± 6 s) compared to the all-out unprimed (23 ± 6 s), self-paced-unprimed (42 ± 13 s) and self-paced-primed (42 ± 11 s) trials (P< 0. 05), with the O 2 MRT also lower in the all-out unprimed compared to self-paced-unprimed and self-paced-primed trials (P< 0. 05). Trial completion time was shorter (performance was enhanced) in the all-out primed trial (402 ± 14 s) compared to the all-out unprimed (408 ± 14 s), self-paced-unprimed (411 ± 16 s) and self-paced-primed (411 ± 19 s) trials (P< 0. 05) with no differences between the latter three trials. Conclusions: The {{findings from this study}} suggest that combining severe-intensity priming exercise with a short-duration all-out starting strategy can expedite the adjustment of O 2 and lower completion time during a cycling performance trial {{to a greater extent than}} either intervention administered independently. These results might have implications for optimising performance in short-duration high-intensity competitive events such as a 4 -km cycling time trial...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{pre-concentration}} of Run of Mine (ROM) ore {{can offer}} huge benefits to mining operations. The ability {{to upgrade the}} ore and maintain a high recovery can provide huge economic benefits to either greenfield projects or existing plants. To {{be able to perform}} this task at a low operating cost and for a low capital outlay can provide a new lease of life to low grade, previously uneconomic ore bodies. Gekko Systems ’ InLine Pressure Jig (IPJ) has been successfully used on various types of ores in the past, however mainly for the concentration of gold and high value minerals. Gekko Systems have recently made several modifications to the IPJ to enable the unit to be used in high mass yield pre-concentration applications. Modifications, including coarse screens, larger spools and alternative control systems have been introduced in order to achieve high mass yields to sink, making the IPJ suitable for in particular diamond pre-concentration applications. The IPJ is currently utilised in over 10 different pre-concentration applications for diamonds. Gekko Systems have been working closely with the diamond industry, especially to pre-concentrate diamond bearing ore using the InLine Pressure Jig in order to provide higher grade material to downstream processes. The benefits of pre-concentration are numerous including; lower operating costs, lower capital outlay for large tonnage operations, power savings, Ferro-silicon reagent savings, security and more importantly the environmental benefits of reducing Ferro losses to the environment. Results to date from several installations and pilot test <b>work</b> <b>trials</b> indicate that the IPJ is ideal to pre-concentrate diamond ores including tailings, marine gravels and alluvial material to very low mass yields of between 10 - 30 % and still maintain very high recovery of diamonds of 95 - 100 %. 1...|$|E

The report draws on research conducted {{during the first year of}} the pilot including: depth interviews with clients, Personal Advisers, and employers, a survey of clients and non-participants and labour market studies. Research is ongoing and further findings will be published in the future. The main findings were An active Personal Adviser Service had been established in each pilot area, and much has been achieved. There was evidence that take-up and awareness of the service could be increased. About a third of clients reported a mental health condition as their main health problem, and the same proportion had been out of the labour market for 5 years or more. Clients differ in terms of their motivation and readiness for work. High levels of satisfaction were recorded among clients though not all clients felt they were part of an ongoing programme of action. Clients appreciated the opportunity to discuss their employment prospects with experts, and welcomed the access to training, work experience and other services made available throughout the service. Communications between Personal Advisers were generally good, though sometimes clients felt frustrated when they thought they had received inadequate benefits advice or the options suggested were unsuitable. Employers said they required specialist advice, financial support, in work support and opportunities for <b>work</b> <b>trials</b> from the Personal Adviser Service.

40|$|Economic {{evaluation}} is the systematic {{assessment of the}} costs and consequences of alternative courses of action. In health and healthcare, {{the results can be}} used to inform clinicians and policy makers about the relative cost-effectiveness of options under consideration [1]. Many economic evaluations are undertaken alongside randomised controlled trials (RCTs); the advantages of this approach are that i) prospective, accurate data can be collected on costs and effects and ii) appropriate outcome measures for use in economic evaluation can be chosen. The outcome of an economic {{evaluation is}} usually described as a ratio of the costs and effects ? often called the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The ICER is determined by calculating the differences in the costs and effects of both intervention and control groups and dividing the former by the latter. In designing an economic evaluation, the important questions to resolve are: which costs should be included and which outcome measures are most appropriate for estimating the cost-effectiveness ratio? In 2005, the Australian Technology Network of Universities funded the Centre for Metabolic Fitness (CMF) through a competitive, peer-reviewed process. The aims of the centre are to develop and evaluate diet and exercise interventions to counteract metabolic syndrome and assess their acceptability by target community groups. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of metabolically determined risk factors associated with obesity (e. g. hypertension, impaired blood glucose etc). A number of collaborative projects have been developed within the centre, one of which is the CHOOSE HEALTH project. As part of this project, the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an intervention for overweight or obese adolescents has been trialled at the University of RMIT by Leah Brennan and the University of South Australia by Margarita Tsiros, as part of their post-graduate studies 1. Subsequently, it has been decided to add an economic component to this <b>work.</b> <b>Trials</b> of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different means of delivering cognitive behaviourally based weight management programs are planned 2. This paper reports the results of investigations into the two questions which need to be addressed prior to undertaking a formal economic evaluation of the CHOOSE HEALTH program: i) what costs should be included and ii) which measures of outcome are suitable for estimating an ICER in this context. The paper is organised in four sections. Following the introduction (section 1) and brief descriptions of the background to and context in which the program was planned (section 2), details of the RMIT trial design and results are provided in section 3. In the final section (section 4), a cost model is presented and the implications of the outcomes used in the initial trials of the effectiveness are discussed in relation to designing a prospective economic evaluation of the CHOOSE HEALTH program. costs, economic evaluation, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), adolescent obesity, Australia...|$|E
