Several members of Presley's band later stated that Parker had no idea just how bad the situation was, although others have stood by the suggestion that Parker just didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> {{there was such a}} problem because he didn't {{know how to deal with}} it and was worried about any negative publicity it would create.

It doesn't fit with {{what seems to be the}} goal of his presidency—social transformation—the restructuring of American society." [...] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, [...] "t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers. Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay, instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer." ...|$|E

500|$|Fagan {{believes}} that the song expresses [...] "the hesitancy savvy women everywhere feel when trying to stop themselves from falling head over heels". Gantz described the Muses' line [...] "Face it like a grown-up/When ya gonna own up/That ya got got got it bad?" [...] as [...] "admonishing". Calling the song a [...] "self-aware ballad", The Oxford Companion to the American Musical: Theatre, Film, and Television author Thomas S. Hischak observed that its lyrics are [...] "filled with sly anachronisms". Meanwhile, in his book The Disney Song Encyclopedia, Hischak referred to [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] as a [...] "contradictory love song ... in which Meg denies her true feelings yet admits that she is quite taken with the brawny and naive hero Hercules", additionally observing the Muses' [...] "oohs" [...] and [...] "ahs." [...] According to D23, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] is a love song [...] "For those who don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> their hearts’ desires," [...] as the protagonist refuses to admit her true feelings for her love interest until the very last lyric.

[...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound."

Woodburne explained [...] "She's working 24 hours a day {{to try to get the}} paper to take on a different form and is running herself into the ground.

[...] Susan Hill of the Daily Star reported Susan refuses to turn to Karl, who always helped her with an episode, and instead she relies on help from Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber). Woodburne revealed Karl asks Susan to slow down, but she ignores him. The actress said Karl is looking at the situation from the perspective of an ex-husband who has feelings for her, but also as a doctor. Susan finds herself unable to do the housework, but Rhys understands that she wants to keep her independence. A spokesperson told Hill [...] "She always knew it was going to be hard living alone but Karl is the last person she wants to turn to.

Natasha later asks Andrew if he loves her, {{but he does}} not reply. In December 2010, Summer and Andrew give into their feelings for each other and have sex. Novakovic said Natasha would be [...] "devastated" [...] if she knew what had happened and that she would not let Andrew and Summer off lightly. Andrew tells Natasha {{that he is going to}} business meeting, but he meets Summer instead. While they are together in Summer's house, a fire breaks out.

Andrew and Summer are rescued separately, and Natasha has no idea of the reason why Andrew was in the house - he was cheating on her with Summer!" [...] After the rescue, Natasha has to come to terms with the fact she will be scarred from a burn she sustains on her neck. Novakovic said that it is a [...] "big deal" [...] for Natasha, as she aspires to be a model and this could ruin her chances. Novakovic also opines that Summer wants nothing more than to be with Andrew, but how can she take him when Natasha tried to save her?

2500|$|The most {{controversial}} such reference occurred during a 1935 lecture {{which was published}} in 1953 as part of the book Introduction to Metaphysics.

However, it subsequently transpired that this qualification had not been made during the original lecture, although Heidegger claimed that it had been. This has led scholars to argue that Heidegger still supported the Nazi party in 1935 but that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> this after the war, and so he attempted to silently correct his earlier statement.|$|E

Tricia suffered serious injuries, and although she was stabilized in theatre by Diane Lloyd, her condition soon thereafter worsened, leaving Mark and Chrissie conflicted over how to continue with her treatment. [...] Maughan explained: [...] "Mark and Chrissie have completely opposing views.
