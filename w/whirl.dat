5|$|Some Muslims {{are also}} opposed to men having long hair {{as it is}} also {{important}} in Islam to have clear differences (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short hair. The Taliban in Afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts, although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair. The Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for his long hair. Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have long hair and <b>whirl</b> it around during rituals.|$|E

5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead {{a search for the}} fabled Knights of Cybertron in the hope that they can help restore order to Cybertron. Taking to the stars on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, Swerve, Brainstorm, Rung, <b>Whirl</b> and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil a twisted plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by original sin.|$|E
25|$|This {{seasonal}} behaviour of the Great <b>Whirl</b> {{affects the}} local coastal ocean flows {{and thus the}} Arabian Sea ecosystem: During the summer season, coastal upwelling currents strongly dependent on the shape and behaviour of the eddy are observed to the northwest of the Great <b>Whirl.</b> Not only does the biological productivity of the region depend on these upwelling currents, they (and thus, the Great <b>Whirl</b> itself) also play a large part in regulating the heat flux budget of the North Indian Ocean.|$|E

40|$|A unique {{supersonic}} compressor rotor with high pressure ratio, termed the Rampressor, is presented by Ramgen Power Systems, Inc. (RPS). In {{order to obtain}} the excitation characteristic and performance of Rampressor inlet flow field under external excitation, compression inlet flow of Rampressor is studied with considering Rampressor rotor <b>whirling.</b> Flow excitation characteristics and performance of Rampressor inlet are analyzed under different frequency and amplitude of Rampressor rotor <b>whirling.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} rotor <b>whirling</b> has a significant effect for flow excitation characteristics and performance of Rampressor inlet. The effect of rotor <b>whirling</b> on the different inlet location excitation has a definite phase difference. Inlet excitation becomes more complex along with the inlet flow path. More frequency components appear in the excitation spectrum of Rampressor inlet with considering Rampressor rotor <b>whirling.</b> The main frequency component is the fundamental frequency, which is caused by the rotor <b>whirling.</b> Besides the fundamental frequency, the double frequency components are generated due to the coupling between inlet compression flow of Rampressor rotor and rotor <b>whirling,</b> especially in the subsonic diffuser of Rampressor rotor inlet. With the increment of rotor <b>whirling</b> frequency and <b>whirling</b> amplitude, the complexity of Rampressor inlet excitation increases, and the stability of Rampressor inlet performance deteriorates...|$|R

25|$|The Great <b>Whirl</b> {{is a huge}} anti-cyclonic eddy {{generated}} by the Somali current flowing in (northern) summer, {{and one of the}} two gigantic Indian Ocean Gyres (the other is the Socotra Gyre). The Great <b>Whirl</b> can be observed between 5-10°N and 52-57°E off the Somali coast in the summer season, a location typically around 200km southwest of the Socotra Gyre (between June to September). However, in the past both the Great <b>Whirl</b> and the Socotra Gyre have been known to occasionally collapse, and their exact locations differ from year to year. The Great Whirl's typical size is 400–600km in horizontal diameter, and typical surface current velocity is 1.5-2.0m/s.|$|E
25|$|Since the Somali current changes seasonally, the Great <b>Whirl</b> also {{displays}} seasonal behaviour {{in keeping}} with the monsoon cycle. The eddy is usually evident between June and September, however e.g. in 1995, the Somali Current did not develop in June at all, so that during that time the eddy was severely weakened and of very small size - a prolonged onset phase. As the Somali Current developed through the summer, it was only in September that the Great <b>Whirl</b> finally maximized and began to disperse, entering the winter season (the wane). Conversely, the Great <b>Whirl</b> may also continue to exist until mid-October, still exhibiting large size and its curl structure may remain evident even longer, underneath the winter Somali Current.|$|E
25|$|How the Great <b>Whirl</b> forms exactly isn't {{yet fully}} understood, but the {{analytical}} approach of applying Rossby wave theory can explain its basic formation mechanism. By observation {{and analysis of}} , the summer monsoon develops suddenly during June–July, and drives westward water flow in the location. Schott and Quadfasel applied first-mode Rossby waves to the water flows, and concluded that “the formation of the Great <b>Whirl</b> {{is a response to}} the very strong anti-cyclonic wind-stress curl”.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the works}} of Friedrich A. Schott and Julian P. McCreary Jr., the Northeastward Somali current has the {{following}} two sub-season periods. During June–July, the Great <b>Whirl</b> grows at 4-10°N, and a cold wedge shape water mass develops to the offshore at latitude 10-12°N. The size and strength of the Great <b>Whirl</b> during the summer monsoon is measured as 10cm/s velocity at about 1000 m depth, while some visible gyre structure is observed at further depth. The upper layer Somali Current flows northwards along the East African coast, and finally enters the Gulf of Aden between the Socotra Archipelago and the Horn of Africa. The mean flow velocity of this outgoing current is about 5 Sv.|$|E
25|$|The {{period between}} August–September is the late {{phase of the}} summer monsoon. During this period, the Great <b>Whirl</b> almost forms a closed circulation, and strong {{upwelling}} streams (colder than 17°C, typical upwelling water temperature ~ 19-23°C) develop near the Northern Somali coast.|$|E
25|$|After {{the summer}} monsoon recedes (Oct-Nov): During this period, the {{southwest}} monsoon winds continually weaken, so the Northward Somali Current (extension {{flow of the}} EACC) no longer crosses the equator, turning instead to the east at around 3°N. However, the Great <b>Whirl</b> still remains.|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{experiments}} with steady-state ground water flow models show that spiraling flow lines occur in layered aquifers that have different anisotropic horizontal hydraulic conductivities in adjacent layers.

The number of <b>whirls</b> depends on the number of interfaces between layers with different anisotropic properties. For flow to a well in an aquifer consisting of two anisotropic layers, with perpendicular major principal directions, <b>whirls</b> are found to occur in quadrants that are bounded by the principal directions of the hydraulic conductivity.
