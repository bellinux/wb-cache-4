25|$|After {{saying that}} he {{considered}} the referendum valid and binding, Puigdemont chose to use the wording “I assume {{the mandate of the}} people for Catalonia to become an independent state {{in the shape of a}} republic”, before adding that he would “ask Parliament to suspend the effects of the declaration of independence so that in the coming <b>weeks</b> <b>we</b> can undertake a dialogue”.|$|E
25|$|We clam {{up and get}} tense. But I {{think the}} {{national}} show will improve {{in the next few}} <b>weeks.</b> <b>We</b> want to include the best segments of IMT in the national show. IMT is a lot more spontaneous than the national show – we've run up to an hour overtime. We like to get the audience to participate and if we can find someone interesting in the studio audience we throw away our scripts and just adlib.|$|E
25|$|After {{the intense}} touring {{that had been}} taking place through the first two albums, working almost 24 hours a day, basically, we managed to stop and have a proper break, {{a couple of months}} as opposed to a couple of <b>weeks.</b> <b>We</b> decided to go off and rent a cottage to provide a {{contrast}} to motel rooms. Obviously, it had quite an effect on the material that was written... It was the tranquility of the place that set the tone of the album. Obviously, we weren't crashing away at 100 watt Marshall stacks. Having played acoustic and being interested in classical guitar, anyway, being in a cottage without electricity, it was acoustic guitar time... After all the heavy, intense vibe of touring which is reflected in the raw energy of the second album, it was just a totally different feeling.|$|E

25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for <b>weeks.</b> <b>We</b> don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} few <b>weeks</b> <b>we</b> got twice as many {{requests}} for [...] "Another One Rides the Bus" [...] as for everything else put together. Thank goodness I had a tape rolling! We even got it in stereo. Over {{the next couple of}} months that tape was duplicated and re-duplicated all over the world, as the song took on a life of its own. [...] The Dr. Demento Show gained a couple of dozen new station affiliates just because of that song.|$|E
500|$|Arriving in Alexandria, the {{refugees}} gratefully devoured the food {{provided by the}} British military, but learned that the swastika was now flying over the Acropolis. Manning's first impressions of Egypt were of squalor and unreality: [...] "For <b>weeks</b> <b>we</b> lived {{in a state of}} recoil". From Alexandria they went by train to Cairo, where they renewed contact with Adam Watson, who was now Second Secretary at the British Embassy. He invited them to stay at his Garden City flat that overlooked the embassy.|$|E
40|$|Iowa corn is tasselling and silking this <b>week.</b> <b>We</b> {{think of}} the silk date as a marker for the final 60 to 65 days in which the corn reaches {{physiological}} maturity. That means we might expect dry down to extend into October across the state. Soybeans are setting pods, and with timely August rainfall, pods should fill nicely. Last <b>week</b> <b>we</b> lost approxiamtely 50 degree days to average across Iowa, making July 2009 {{as one of the}} ten coolest in history...|$|R
50|$|This <b>week</b> <b>we</b> {{observed}} that great baskets of dried berries {{were brought in}} from divers towns and delivered to the king or Young Caseekey Jece.|$|R

500|$|On 23 August 2014, it was {{reported}} that Delhi Dynamos, an Indian side that was set to play in the inaugural Indian Super League season, was in talks with Del Piero. His brother, Stefano Del Piero said [...] "During the last (few) <b>weeks,</b> <b>we</b> have received inquiries from several teams, not only from India but also from other countries. There is {{a lot of interest in}} Alessandro." [...] On 28 August 2014, he officially signed for the Indian franchise, signing a four-month deal.|$|E
500|$|They {{asked if}} I'd {{go back to}} the old Temperatures, only this time with Paul [...] At this point we were still hoping to make it for the midseason. After a couple of <b>weeks</b> <b>we</b> agreed that the show should go off the air in January, but {{continue}} production so that we would have 11 shows ready for airing any time they wanted them. Some of the nonsense and hijinks of the first season are gone and we have managed to keep a touch of reality of the second version. As to why the series was not cancelled, Asher remarked, [...] "I can answer that in two words: Paul Lynde." ...|$|E
500|$|DJs Meck and Dino {{created a}} mashup of the former's 2007 single, [...] "Feels Like Home", with [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and {{released}} {{it with the}} name as [...] "Feels Like a Prayer". The song reached the top ten in Belgium (Flanders region) and the Netherlands, while peaking at number15 in Belgium (Walloon region). In the United States, [...] "Feels Like a Prayer" [...] debuted at number36 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart, and reached a peak of number six, after seven <b>weeks.</b> <b>We</b> Are the Fallen, an American gothic metal band, covered [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] live in 2008. Nick Duerden from Spin complimented the performance and the track for being [...] "so successfully pulverized that one wondered whether it wasn't written specifically to become the world's greatest heavy rock anthem." [...] In June 2017, Leonard released a piano ballad version of the track, with vocals from singer Dana Williams. In the same month, Brazilian singer Luiza Possi covered [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] during the show Domingão do Faustão, in a similar performance to that of Blond Ambition World Tour. She later sang it during the encore of a show in tribute to Michael Jackson, {{which took place in}} July. In August 2017, Brazilian actress Fabiana Karla performed the song on the show PopStar.|$|E

500|$|For a brief period, McDonald and Melton {{performed}} {{together as}} a duo at college campuses in the Northwest on behalf of Students for a Democratic Society before returning as regulars at the Jabberwock cafe. The two were joined by local jug band musicians, including Melton's roommates, bass player Bruce Barthol and guitarist Paul Armstrong, and bluegrass guitarist David Bennett Cohen, with whom Melton played in another jug band. The addition of drummer John Francis-Gunning rounded out the six-piece ensemble. It was during their residency at the Jabberwock that Country Joe and the Fish learned to play as a group and expand their repertoire. Within months, based on McDonald and Melton's interest in the live performances of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the recordings on Bob Dylan's album, Highway 61 Revisited, and {{their use of the}} mind-altering drug LSD, the group began equipping themselves with electric instruments and delving more into psychedelia. As a result, Cohen was moved over to the organ. Cohen's experience with keyboards was limited to having played piano at a semiprofessional capacity at the Jabberwock, but, nonetheless, he quickly adapted to the qualities of the instrument. Melton describes the change of the group: [...] "Once we hit into the electric medium and into the rock medium, we were pandering to the public taste. We became extraordinarily popular. The little folk club where we used to play once every two <b>weeks,</b> <b>we</b> played every single night for a month, or something like that, and filled it. And after a while we filled two shows every single night".|$|E
500|$|McKay {{stated that}} Rudd helped him rewrite the script, calling Rudd [...] "great with dialogue", adding [...] "the {{two of us}} holed up in hotel rooms on {{the east and west}} coast, and I think it was like six to eight <b>weeks</b> <b>we</b> just ground it out and did a giant rewrite of the script. I was really proud of what we did, I really thought we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and sort of just {{enhanced}} some stuff." [...] Rudd elaborated, [...] "The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of it all, is really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. We changed some scenes, we added new sequences, we changed some characters, we added new characters. If you took the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different—but the idea is all theirs." [...] Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result. One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being [...] "a crucial part" [...] of the Ant-Man comics. For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story. Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film.|$|E
2500|$|Production began for {{the film}} on June 5, 2012. Reitman and the film's art {{director}} Steve Saklad searched a number of houses in Massachusetts {{as most of the}} film is set inside the Wheelers' home. According to Reitman, [...] "We searched the entire state of Massachusetts for that house. My location manager has never looked at that many locations looking for one place. For <b>weeks</b> <b>we</b> would just drive down the street, knocking on people’s doors. The house we found was perfect but it was very modern. Steve brought it back to 1987." ...|$|E

2500|$|For the 2015 summer tour dates, Paul Manzi {{returned}} to sub for Peter Lincoln who left this online {{message to the}} fans: [...] "There {{have been a few}} rumours going around this weekend, so [...] [...] [...] just to say that I am alive and well! The short explanation for my absence is that I need to rest my voice for a few <b>weeks.</b> <b>We</b> are lucky that our good friend Paul Manzi is able to step in, and Tony knows the role of bass player/singer, so the shows can go ahead, and they will be great! I look forward to being back on stage very soon." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{relocated}} to College Park, Maryland, to record its debut album from June to September 2005. Although {{they only had}} shells of songs when they arrived, {{the rest of the}} album shaped up fast through the marathon session. [...] "We didn't have a day off in the five-and-a-half <b>weeks</b> <b>we</b> were there, 12 or 14 hours a day," [...] Ross said in a 2005 interview. [...] "We were making things up in our heads that weren't there, and on top of the stress of trying to finish the record, we were living in a one-bedroom apartment with four people on bunk beds," [...] recalled Ross. [...] "Everyone got on everybody's nerves. Someone would write a new part for a song and someone else would say they didn't like it just because you ate their cereal that morning." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 5, 2014 {{the band}} {{announced}} {{that they would be}} recording new music issuing this statement: [...] "weren’t initially planning on it. but with the ridiculous amount of support we’ve received in the last few <b>weeks,</b> <b>we</b> have decided to make some new music. working out the details currently." [...] However, on June 8, the band announced after opening for Saosin with original vocalist Anthony Green that this would be their final show, which was later denied on the band's official Facebook page with the comment [...] "“Scott wasn’t finished talking and the song started ha. We’ll probably do some more shows. You’d think sites would reach out before reporting shit.” As of February 14, 2015, In Fear and Faith has stated on their Facebook page they are currently working on new music. On May 14, 2015, Sean Bell posted a video on his Instagram stating that the band had officially started pre-production.|$|E

2500|$|Following a {{multinational}} IGAD conference held in Addis Ababa on 25 November, IGAD Executive Secretary Mahboub Maalim {{announced that the}} Ethiopian government had agreed to support Somalia's TFG, the Kenyan authorities and the African Union's campaign to quash the Al-Shabaab insurgency. Maalim did not elaborate on what exactly Ethiopia's role would be, stating that [...] "We leave that {{to the national security}} forces to decide." [...] On 25 November, an Ethiopian government official acknowledged {{for the first time that}} Ethiopian troops had entered Somali territory for reconnoitring duties. After the IGAD meeting held the same day in Ethiopia's capital, the government official, who requested anonymity, indicated that the Ethiopian government would deploy troops inside Somalia to assist the Somali and Kenyan forces' efforts. He added that the Ethiopian military's activities were for the moment limited to liaison work and reconnaissance, but that [...] "We are looking at a brief period of time, <b>weeks.</b> <b>We</b> don't want our deployment to be used for propaganda by the extremists".|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} orders, General Scott {{traveled all}} the way from his post in Virginia City to Bluff, in order to negotiate an end to the war. Scott was genuinely uninterested in fighting the hostile Utes and Paiutes, so on March 10, 1915 he left Bluff, unarmed, with just a few of his men, to meet Polk and Posey at a place called Mexican Hat, near Navajo Mountain. General Scott described the journey; [...] "We reached Bluff on March 10 and learned that the Indians had gone to the Navajo Mountains, 125 miles southwest of Bluff. We stayed a day in Bluff and then went on to Mexican Hat. Some friendly Navajos met me at Mexican Hat and went ahead of me to tell Poke's [...] band of my coming. Among them was Bzoshe, the old Navajo chief with whom the government had so much trouble with a year ago and who is now our fast friend. I had sent for him to meet me at Bluff. Mr. Jenkins, Indian agent at Navajo Springs, Mr. Creel, Colonel Michie, and my orderly accompanied me to Mexican Hat. None of us had a gun. Jim Boy, a friendly Paiute, was sent out to tell the Paiutes that I wanted to see them. Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in. We talked a little through a Navajo interpreter. It was in the evening, and I just asked them how they were. I told them I did not feel very well {{and did not want to}} talk to them until the next day. They helped us kill a beef and we gave them a good meal, the first they'd had in <b>weeks.</b> <b>We</b> also gave them some blankets. Posey and his men didn't have any weapons, but I have reason to suspect that they had hidden them nearby. The next day, Poke and Hatch [...] and about 25 others came to see me. I asked them to tell me their troubles. I said that I didn't think they would like to have their children chased by soldiers and cowboys all over the mountains and killed and that I wanted to help them. I didn't try to push the matter with them, but asked them what they wanted to do. After they had talked among themselves, they said they would do anything I wanted them to do." ...|$|E
