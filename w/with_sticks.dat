5|$|The Phoenix Zoo {{garnered}} worldwide {{attention for}} one of its animals, an Asian elephant named Ruby. Ruby came to the zoo in 1973, just months after being born in Thailand. After noticing Ruby doodling in the sand <b>with</b> <b>sticks,</b> her keeper decided {{to give her a}} brush and paint. Ruby quickly became known for her paintings, whose sales raised over US$200,000 for the zoo. Art collectors all over the world joined 18-month waiting lists and paid hundreds of dollars for original prints.|$|E
5|$|Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese {{wearing white}} headbands, white {{trousers}} and black tops, armed <b>with</b> <b>sticks,</b> farm implements and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near {{the centre of}} Saigon. They had pretended to be working the transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials. The plan was that this advance party would give signals to a larger party of rebels, who were waiting {{on the outskirts of}} Saigon with the majority of the weapons, to move into the city for {{the main part of the}} uprising.|$|E
5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked <b>with</b> <b>sticks,</b> or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E

5|$|On {{their way}} to King's Landing, the king's entourage has stopped to rest at an inn. While the {{recently}} promised Prince Joffrey and Sansa Stark are walking along the river, they run into Arya sparring <b>with</b> <b>sticks</b> with her friend, a butcher's boy named Mycah. Taunting the boy, Joffrey draws his sword and demands a duel, under pretext of punishing him for accidentally hitting Arya, {{a member of the}} nobility. Mycah and Arya desperately explain that she asked him to spar with her so she could practice. As Joffrey savors the butcher boy's pain and fear, Arya hits Joffrey while her friend flees. Enraged, Joffrey turns on Arya and is about to strike her with his sword when her direwolf Nymeria bites his wrist. Arya seizes his sword and throws it into the river before running into the forest, where she drives away Nymeria and hides until dark.|$|E
5|$|Lenormand de Mezy's {{second wife}} has {{died and the}} city has made {{remarkable}} progress. Henri Christophe is a master chef. Twenty years have gone by and Ti Noel has fathered twelve children {{by one of the}} cooks. He has told these children many stories of Macandal and they await his return. A secret gathering of trusted slaves takes place: Bouckman, the Jamaican, speaks of possible freedom for the blacks emerging in France and also mentions the opposition from the plantation landowners. An uprising is planned; {{as a result of this}} meeting, conch-shell trumpets sound and slaves, armed <b>with</b> <b>sticks,</b> surround the houses of their masters. Upon hearing the conch-shells Lenormand de Mezy is frightened and manages to hide. The slaves kill the white men and drink much alcohol. Ti Noel, after drinking, rapes Mademoiselle Floridor, who is Lenormand de Mezy's latest mistress. The uprising is defeated and Bouckman is killed. The governor, Blanchelande, advocates for the complete extermination of the colony's black population, as they pose a threat with their voodoo and secret religion. Several of the rebels are gathered to be publicly executed, but Lenormand de Mezy secures the release of his slaves, including Ti Noel, intending to sell them in the slave markets in Cuba. Lenormand de Mezy takes Ti Noel and other slaves to Cuba, where he becomes lazy, conducts no business, enjoys the women, drinks alcohol, and gambles away his slaves. Pauline Bonaparte accompanies Leclerc, her army general husband, to Haiti. On the way there, she enjoys sexually tempting the men on the ship. Solimán, a black slave, massages her body and lavishes loving care on her beauty. Leclerc develops yellow fever, and Pauline trusts in the voodoo and magic of Solimán to cure him. Leclerc dies, and Pauline returns to Paris while the Rochambeau government treats the blacks very poorly. However, there is the emergence of black priests who allow the slaves to conduct more business internally.|$|E

25|$|Electronic drum pads are {{the second}} most widely used type of MIDI {{performance}} controllers, after electronic music keyboards.

The pads built into drum machines are typically too small and fragile to be played <b>with</b> <b>sticks,</b> and they are usually played with fingers. Dedicated drum pads such as the Roland Octapad or the DrumKAT are playable with the hands or <b>with</b> <b>sticks,</b> and are often built to resemble the general form of a drum kit. There are also percussion controllers such as the vibraphone-style MalletKAT, and Don Buchla's Marimba Lumina.|$|E
