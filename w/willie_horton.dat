5|$|David Ortiz has won {{the award}} eight times, {{more than any other}} player (2003–2007, 2011, 2013, 2016). Other repeat winners of the award include Martinez himself (five times), three-time winner Hal McRae (1976, 1980, and 1982) and two-time winners <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> (1975 and 1979), Greg Luzinski (1981 and 1983), Don Baylor (1985 and 1986), Harold Baines (1987 and 1988), Dave Parker (1989 and 1990), and Paul Molitor (1993 and 1996). Boston Red Sox players have won the most Edgar Martínez Awards with eleven.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the episode}} {{is based on the}} Watergate scandal, as well as other real-life {{political}} events. The two Republicans who follow Bob around were based on H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, two of Richard Nixon's closest advisors during Watergate. Sideshow Bob's campaign advert was based on the famous <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> and Revolving Door political advertisements used by George H. W. Bush during the 1988 United States presidential election. Birch Barlow's question to Mayor Quimby about whether his stance on crime would differ if it was his family being attacked is a reference to Bernard Shaw's similar question to Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis during the 1988 presidential debates. Quimby's appearance during the debate parodies Richard Nixon's appearance during his first televised debate with John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. Nixon had recently recovered from a cold, and sweated considerably throughout, something that was detrimental to the impression he made in the debate.|$|E
5|$|Clyde began 1974 {{season with}} a 3–0 record, but became embroiled in {{controversy}} following a dispute between new manager Billy Martin and general manager Bobby Brown. Martin and Brown argued about what {{was the best way}} on handling Clyde's future development, which led to Brown's resignation and caused Clyde to miss a month before remaining on the Rangers roster {{for the rest of the}} year. He played in 28 games (21 starts) and finished with 3–9 record, and a 4.38 ERA. He started one game in 1975 (a loss) before injuring his shoulder and was demoted to the Pittsfield Rangers of the Eastern League. He stayed in the minors for three seasons, having a shoulder operation in 1976. The Rangers organization lost so much faith in Clyde's ability that he was left unprotected in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft, but was not chosen. He played for the Sacramento Solons in 1976, and the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League in 1977 where he had 5–7 record with a 5.84 ERA. When the season ended, the Rangers traded Clyde and veteran <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> to the Cleveland Indians for Tom Buskey and John Lowenstein on February 28, 1978.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Willie</b> Wattison <b>Horton</b> (born October 18, 1942) is {{a former}} left fielder and {{designated}} hitter in Major League Baseball who played for six American League teams, primarily the Detroit Tigers. He hit 20 or more home runs seven times, and his 325 career home runs ranked sixth among AL right-handed hitters when he retired. He enjoyed his best season in 1968 with the world champion Tigers, finishing second in the AL with 36 homers, a [...]543 slugging average and 278 total bases. In the later years of his career, he was twice named the AL's top designated hitter.|$|R

2500|$|Although classic blues {{covers and}} blues-styled originals {{remained}} {{prominent in the}} band's repertoire through this period, Green rapidly blossomed as a songwriter and contributed many successful original compositions from 1968 onwards. The songs chosen for single release showed Green's style gradually {{moving away from the}} group's blues roots into new musical territory. Their second studio album Mr. Wonderful was released in 1968 and continued the formula of the first album. In the same year they scored a hit with Green's [...] "Black Magic Woman" [...] (later covered more successfully by Santana), followed by the guitar instrumental [...] "Albatross" [...] (1969), which reached number one in the British singles charts. More hits written by Green followed, including [...] "Oh Well", [...] "Man of the World" [...] (both 1969) and the ominous [...] "The Green Manalishi" [...] (1970). The double album Blues Jam in Chicago (1969) was recorded at the Chess Records Ter-Mar Studio in Chicago. There, under the joint supervision of Vernon and Marshall Chess, they recorded with some of their American blues heroes including Otis Spann, Big Walter <b>Horton,</b> <b>Willie</b> Dixon, J.T. Brown and Buddy Guy.|$|R
25|$|July 27: Denny McLain {{pitched a}} 3-hit shutout over the Orioles for his 20th win. Norm Cash had 4 hits, and <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> hit 2 home runs. The Tigers won, 9–0.|$|E
25|$|The 1961 club {{featured}} two nonwhite starters, Jake Wood and Bill Bruton, {{and later}} in the 1960s, black players such as <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton,</b> Earl Wilson, and Gates Brown would contribute to Detroit's rise in the standings.|$|E
25|$|May 31: Mickey Lolich {{shut out}} the Yankees on a 1-hitter in front of 31,115 fans on a Friday night in Detroit. <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> {{hit a home run}} in the 7th inning for the game's only run.|$|E
25|$|In Game 2, Mickey Lolich hit a {{home run}} and pitched the first of his three {{complete}} game victories, as Detroit won, 8–1. Norm Cash and <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> both homered, and perennial Gold Glove winner, Al Kaline, made two sensational catches in right field.|$|E
25|$|As {{a strong}} nucleus developed, Detroit {{repeatedly}} posted winning records throughout the 1960s. Pitchers Mickey Lolich and Denny McLain entered the rotation {{during the middle}} of the decade, with outfielders <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> (1963), Mickey Stanley (1964) and Jim Northrup (1964) also coming aboard at this time.|$|E
25|$|Major League Baseball {{players who}} played with the Indios include Dennis McClain, Boog Powell, Jim Northrup, <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton,</b> Mickey Lolich, Jack Morris, Dave McNally, Tommy Lasorda, Ron LeFlore, Kurt Bevacqua, Lance Parrish, Paul O'Neill, Ken Caminiti, Zack Greinke, Doug Glanville, Harold Reynolds, Dennis Martínez and Wally Joyner.|$|E
25|$|August 25: After {{taking a}} 5–0 lead, the Tigers {{lost to the}} Yankees‚ 6–5. The {{surprise}} winning pitcher for the Yankees was outfielder Rocky Colavito. The former Tiger slugger pitched 2⅔ innings in relief and retired Al Kaline and <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton.</b> Adding to the insult, Colavito scored the winning run in the 8th inning.|$|E
25|$|A {{substantial}} number of prominent Detroiters {{have lived in the}} neighborhood. Notable residents have included labor leader Walter P.

Brennan, Michigan governor Harry Kelly, boxer Joe Louis, druggist Sidney Barthwell, Congressman Charles C. Diggs, Jr., Motown record label founder Berry Gordy, Detroit Tiger <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton,</b> and dentist and pioneering WCHB radio station owner Wendell F. Cox.|$|E
25|$|Earl Wilson was the team's No. 3 pitcher, going 13–12 for {{the season}} with a 2.85 ERA. Known {{as one of the best}} power hitters of all time among major league pitchers, Wilson hit seven home runs in 88 at-bats in 1968. Wilson's at bat-to-home run ratio of 12.57 was higher than any player in the major leagues in 1968 — higher even than home run leaders Frank Howard and <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton.</b> Wilson was the losing pitcher in Game 3 of the World Series, {{allowing}} 10 baserunners and three earned runs in 4 innings pitched.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} major league debut against the Detroit Tigers on April 14 {{at the age}} of 26. He {{appeared}} in relief of Pedro Ramos and pitched three innings, allowing one hit and no runs while hitting two batters (Al Kaline and <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton)</b> consecutively. He was then relieved by Jack Cullen. He did not receive a decision. On July 10, he made the first — and only — start of his career, facing the Washington Senators. In three innings, he allowed five runs on five hits and one walk, earning the loss.|$|E
25|$|September 14: In {{front of}} 33,688 fans on a Saturday in Detroit, with Denny McLain seeking his 30th win, Reggie Jackson {{hit a home}} run in the 4th inning to put the A's on top. Norm Cash responded with a 3-run home run in the 4th. Reggie Jackson hit his second home run of the day in the 6th inning to put the A's back in the lead. In the bottom of the 9th inning, Al Kaline pinch hit for McLain. Kaline drew a walk and later scored on an error. <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> then drove in Mickey Stanley for the winning run. McLain struck out 10 batters and beat the A's, 5–4, to become the first 30-game winner since Dizzy Dean in 1934.|$|E
25|$|In the 1968 World Series, the Tigers met the {{defending}} World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals, led by starter Bob Gibson (who had posted a record 1.12 ERA {{during the regular}} season) and speedy outfielder Lou Brock. The series was predicated with a bold decision by manager Mayo Smith to play center fielder Mickey Stanley at shortstop, replacing the slick fielding but weak hitting of Ray Oyler. Stanley had never played shortstop before, but was a gold glover in the outfield and an excellent athlete. Smith started him at short for the final nine games {{of the regular season}} and all seven World Series games, with Oyler only appearing as a late-inning defensive replacement. This allowed Smith to play an outfield of <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton,</b> Jim Northrup and Al Kaline in every Series game.|$|E
25|$|In the 1968 World Series, the Tigers met the {{defending}} World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals, led by starter Bob Gibson (who had posted a modern-era record 1.12 ERA {{during the regular}} season) and speedy outfielder Lou Brock. This {{was the first time}} the Tigers and Cardinals had met in the World Series since 1934, when as it was said, they were choked by the Gashouse Gang. The series was predicated with a bold decision by manager Mayo Smith to play center fielder Mickey Stanley at shortstop, replacing the slick fielding but weak hitting of Ray Oyler. Stanley had never played shortstop before, but was a gold glover in the outfield and an excellent athlete.

25|$|In Game 1, Gibson {{completely}} {{shut down}} the Detroit lineup, striking out 17 batters, still a World Series record, en route to an easy 4–0 win. However, due {{in no small part}} to pitcher Mickey Lolich's victories in Games 2 and 5, the Tigers climbed back into the Series. Many fans believe the turning point in the Series came in the fifth inning of Game 5, with the Tigers down three games to one, and trailing in the game, 3–2. Left fielder <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> made a perfect throw to home plate to nail Lou Brock (who tried to score from second base standing up), as catcher Bill Freehan blocked the plate with his foot. The Tigers came back with three runs in the seventh to win that game, 5–3, and stay alive in the Series. The Cardinals would not threaten to score the rest of this game, and scored only two more meaningless runs over the remainder of the series. In Game 6, McLain ensured a Game 7 by notching his only win of the Series, a 13–1 blowout, despite pitching on only two days' rest.|$|E
25|$|In Game 7 at Busch Memorial Stadium, Lolich, also {{pitching}} on two days' rest, faced Gibson. Both men pitched brilliantly, putting zeros up on {{the scoreboard}} {{for much of the}} game. In the bottom of the sixth inning, the Cardinals looked primed to take the lead as Lou Brock singled to lead off the inning, only to be promptly picked off first base by Lolich. One out later, Curt Flood followed with another single, and was also picked off first by Lolich. In the top of the seventh, an exhausted Gibson finally cracked, giving up singles to Norm Cash and <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton.</b> Jim Northrup then struck the decisive blow, lashing a triple to center field over the head of Flood, who appeared to mis-judge how hard the ball was hit. That scored both Cash and Horton; Northrup himself was then brought home by a Bill Freehan double. Detroit added an insurance run in the ninth. A solo home run by Mike Shannon was all the Cardinals could muster against Lolich as the Tigers took the game, 4–1, and the Series, 4–3. For his three victories that propelled the Tigers to the World championship, Lolich was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.|$|E

The song, {{which he}} wrote {{in support of the}} Occupy movement, was also aired that month on Democracy Now! and Jon Wiener's radio show on KPFK in Los Angeles. After reading her article on Larry McCarthy's affiliation with the pro-Romney Restore Our Future group, Cooder sent [...] "Going to Tampa" [...] to Jane Mayer of The New Yorker in February 2012; the song makes reference to McCarthy's <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> ad during the 1988 presidential campaign. Mayer subsequently posted the song on SoundCloud and the magazine's website on February 10. Cooder also sent [...] "Mutt Romney Blues" [...] to Brave New Films, who subsequently produced a music video for the song.

2500|$|Dukakis {{was badly}} {{hurt by the}} Republican [...] "Willie Horton", [...] "Revolving Door", and [...] "Boston Harbor" [...] {{campaign}} ads, the latter of which attacked the governor's failure to clean up environmental pollution in the harbor. Dukakis was a supporter of a state prison furlough program, which had begun before he was governor. The program had resulted in the release of convicted murderer <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton,</b> who then committed a rape and assault in Maryland. As Governor, Dukakis had vetoed a 1976 plan to bar inmates convicted of first-degree murder from the furlough program. The program was abolished by the state legislature in April 1988 after public outcry over the <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> case.|$|E
2500|$|The AL {{increased}} their {{lead in the}} top of the eighth inning. [...] With one out, Carl Yastrzemski and <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> hit back-to-back singles, putting runners at first and second bases. [...] Amos Otis flew out, permitting Yastrzemski to tag up and move to third. [...] Brooks Robinson tripled, scoring Yastrzemski and Horton. [...] The AL now led 4–1.|$|E
2500|$|Although Atwater clearly {{approved}} {{of the use of}} the <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> issue, the Bush campaign never ran any commercial with Horton's picture; instead they ran a similar but generic ad. The original commercial was produced by Americans for Bush, an independent group managed by Larry McCarthy, and Republicans benefited from the coverage it attracted in the national media. Referring to Dukakis, Atwater declared that he would [...] "strip the bark off the little bastard" [...] and [...] "make <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> his running mate". Atwater's challenge was to counter the [...] "where was George?" [...] campaign slogan Democrats were using as a rallying cry in an effort to create an impression that Bush was a relatively inexperienced and unaccomplished candidate. Furthermore, Bush had critics in the Republican base, who remembered his pro-choice positions in the 1980 primary, and that the harder the campaign pursued Dukakis's liberal positions, the bigger his base turnout would be.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{spread quickly}} on the Internet, after {{appearing}} on YouTube {{in the early}} morning hours of December 13, 2007. It was almost immediately compared to the famous <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> ad of 1988. As one political website put it, [...] "You know how most campaign ads have a shelf life of a day or two? Yeah, um … this one may be around for awhile [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Massachusetts {{passed a}} law to {{similarly}} ban furloughs for first-degree murderers, and Dukakis vetoed the bill. Soon afterward, <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton,</b> who was {{serving a life sentence}} for first-degree murder for stabbing a boy to death during a robbery, was released on weekend furlough, during which he kidnapped a young couple, tortured the man, and repeatedly raped the woman. Horton then became the centerpiece of Atwater's ad campaign against Dukakis.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 CNN documentary, Broken Government: [...] Campaign Killers, {{journalist}} Campbell Brown, who is {{not related}} to Floyd Brown, interviewed him briefly {{on the subject of the}} <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> ad, but not about a racy ad with a toll-free number that listeners could call to hear a recording of Gennifer Flowers, a woman who had been the subject of inquiries into President Bill Clinton. Campbell Brown attributed the Flowers ad to David Bossie rather than Floyd Brown, prompting Citizens United to threaten a lawsuit, and to distinguish between its activities, and those of Floyd Brown, the [...] "true" [...] author of the Flowers ad.|$|E
2500|$|DuMond's case {{received}} intense nationwide {{attention in}} late 2007, when his parole {{became an issue}} for presidential candidate Mike Huckabee during the 2008 presidential campaign. Lois Davidson, mother of DuMond rape/murder victim Carol Sue Shields, appeared in a one-minute video entitled [...] "Lois Davidson tells her story" [...] which was posted on YouTube. The commercial attacked Huckabee's efforts to get DuMond released from prison early. This recalled a 1988 television commercial that attacked Michael Dukakis for his approval as Massachusetts governor of a furlough program that allowed convicted murderer <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> to escape and commit more crimes. Dukakis, who {{was running for president}} at the time the commercial aired, suffered a steep drop in poll numbers, a fate Davidson hoped would befall Huckabee.|$|E
2500|$|Game 7 was a {{pitching}} duel between Bob Gibson and Mickey Lolich, pitching on only two days' rest. In a pre-game pep talk, Mayo Smith told his team that Gibson was not Superman, prompting Norm Cash to ask: [...] "What {{was he doing}} in a telephone booth changing his clothes?" [...] The game was scoreless after six innings, as the two pitchers dominated. In the 7th inning, the Tigers broke through on a triple by Jim Northrup that went over center fielder Curt Flood's head, driving in Norm Cash and <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton.</b> Curt Flood initially misread Northrup's hit, taking a step in, and then slipping as he chased the ball over his head. [...] Flood was tagged a [...] "goat" [...] for having misplayed the ball. The Tigers won Game 7 by a score of 4–1.|$|E
2500|$|In Game 1 of the 1968 World Series, Gibson {{struck out}} 17 Detroit Tigers {{to set a}} World Series record for strikeouts in one game, which still stands today (breaking Sandy Koufax's record of 15 in Game 1 of the 1963 World Series). He also joined Ed Walsh as the only {{pitchers}} to strike out at least one batter in each inning of a World Series game, Walsh having done so in Game Three of the 1906 World Series. After allowing a leadoff single to Mickey Stanley in the ninth inning, Gibson finished the game by striking out Tiger sluggers Al Kaline, Norm Cash and <b>Willie</b> <b>Horton</b> in succession. [...] Recalling the performance, Tigers outfielder Jim Northrup remarked: [...] "We were fastball hitters, but he blew the ball right by us. And he had a nasty slider that was jumping all over the place." ...|$|E
