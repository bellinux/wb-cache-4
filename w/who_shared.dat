50|$|One way to {{determine}} the contribution of genes and environment to a trait is to study twins.

Another condition that permits the disassociation of genes and environment is adoption. In one kind of adoption study, biological siblings reared together (<b>who</b> <b>share</b> the same family environment and half their genes) are compared to adoptive siblings (<b>who</b> <b>share</b> their family environment but none of their genes).|$|R
