40|$|Two popular {{types of}} {{spacecraft}} actuators are reaction wheels and magnetic torque coils. Magnetic torque coils are particularly interesting {{because they can}} be used for both attitude control and reaction <b>wheel</b> momentum management (<b>desaturation</b> control).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimintedThe experimental verification of attitude control designs for flexible spacecraft {{is essential for}} reliable operation in space. The Flexible Spacecraft Simulator (FSS) at the Naval Postgraduate School is designed to test a variety of control designs. The experimental setup simulates pitch axis motion of a flexible spacecraft consisting of a rigid central body and a flexible appendage connecting a reflector. The primary actuators are a reaction wheel and thrusters. Angular position information is obtained with a rotary variable differential transformer (RVDT) and angular rate information is obtained by a solid state rate sensor. Two analytical models are derived: one based on cantilever modes, the other based on system modes. Both {{are the result of}} linearized equations of motion which assume small flexible displacements and rates. Slew maneuvers are conducted using four separate controllers. They are proportional-derivative (PD), torque profiles, bang-bang and optimal controllers. Techniques for state estimation are explored for the optimal controller since the standard estimation methods prove to be unsatisfactory. The sinusoidal torque profile delivers the best performance overall with the PD a close second. Momentum <b>wheel</b> <b>desaturation</b> with thrusters and thruster slew maneuvers are also performed. In all cases, experimental results are in close agreement with analytical predictions.

40|$|TUBSAT- 1 (Technical University Berlin Satellite) is an {{experimental}} low-cost satellite being {{financed by the}} German BMFT. The dimensions and weight {{are determined by the}} NASA Gas-Program and it will be ejected from the Space Shuttle within the German spacelab mission D 2 by December 19, 1991, into a 298 km circular orbit and at a 28. 5 ° inclination. To enable a large variety of useful experiments to fly with TUSSAT, it was necessary to develop a rather precise attitude control and stabilization (ACS) system. The ACS should be low cost, flexible (in view of changing ACS modes and parameters during the mission time), minimum component number and a low power consumption. A sun/star orientation with an additional spin mode was chosen and developed. The system is based on a microcomputer, fixed momentum wheel (FMW), one magnetic torquer, one sun and two star sensors. The closed loop pitch control consists of FMW, sun and star (for the eclipse phase) sensors, achieving a pitch pointing accuracy of 0. 26 ° for any slew maneuver by using momentum transfer from the wheel to the satellite. Control of the <b>wheel</b> momentum (<b>desaturation)</b> without affecting the pitch axis orientation can be accomplished by executing a pitch slew maneuver. Positioning the magnetic torquer (which is mounted perpendicular to the pitch axis) to interact with the geomagnetic field vector. The pitch axis reorientation maneuver due to interaction between the magnetic torquer and the magnetic field vector component can be controlled by the one axis star sensor (roll/yaw rotation). A further pitch slew maneuver of 90 ° is necessary for positioning the sensor (roll = yaw) ...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPTs) {{are finding}} renewed user appeal {{due to the}} growth in small {{satellite}} applications. PPTs are especially well suited to small satellite applications because they are simple, low-mass, and high Isp propulsion systems. The solid Teflon fuel allows for a self-contained, inert and stable propellant system. With a power draw of only 0. 1 to 150 W and a very small (50 - 800 µNs) impulse bit, PPT technology {{makes it possible to}} consider a revolutionary attitude control system (ACS) concept providing stabilization and pointing accuracies previously obtainable only with reaction wheels, with reduced mass and power requirements. NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC) and Olin Aerospace Company (OAC) are working together to develop an advanced PPT system with twice the total impulse capability and half the mass of the previous best PPT system. The two key factors to accomplish these goals are: 1) significantly improving thrust efficiency - the ratio of thrust power to input electrical power and 2) improving the energy density and life of the energy storage capacitor. Typically, PPTs provide relatively low efficiency, with the LES 8 / 9 PPT delivering a little more than 7 percent. OAC has tested a matrix of configuration parameters with improvement in the efficiency by a factor of 1. 5 to 2. 0. To achieve the LeRC goals, the capacitor must be capable of 20 million pulses at an energy level of 40 J, ideally with a mass of no more than 1 kg. LeRC and OAC have embarked upon a two-step process to demonstrate the capacitor technology, with benchtop testing at OAC and integrated PPT/capacitor life testing at LeRC to be conducted in the development phase. The program provides for design, fabrication and qualification of a flight PPT, which is then slated to fly as an orbit raising demonstration aboard the Air Force Phillips Lab MightySat II. 1 in early 1999. A second unit, configured for ACS functions, is planned for flight on the NASA New Millennium EO- 1 spacecraft in mid- 1999. With a light, high performance PPT in development for flight applications, it becomes possible to consider replacement of momentum wheels with PPTs. Typical momentum wheel attitude control systems consume 102 ̆ 7 s of W power and weigh 0. 1 kg per kg of spacecraft weight, including the momentum desaturation devices. Mission analysis to be presented shows the PPT to be very competitive with these systems, with the advantages of lower cost, lower mass, extension of ACS capability to very small (nano) satellites, and simplicity in replacing both the <b>wheels</b> and the <b>desaturation</b> devices...|$|R
40|$|Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a multivariable {{advanced}} {{control technique}} widely popular inmany industrial applications {{due to its}} ability to explicitly optimize performance, straightforwardly handling constraints on system variables. However, MPC requires solving a Quadratic Programming (QP) optimization problem at each sampling step. This has slowed down its diffusion in embedded applications, in which fast sampling rates are paired with scarce computational capabilities, as in the automotive and aerospace industries. This thesis proposes optimization techniques and controller formulations specifically tailored to embedded applications. First, fixed-point implementations of Dual Gradient Projection (DGP) and Proximal Newton methods are introduced. Detailed convergence analysis {{in the presence of}} round-off errors and algorithm optimizations are presented, and concrete guidelines for selecting the minimum number of fractional and integer bits that guarantee convergence are provided. Moreover, extensive simulations and experimental tests on embedded devices, supported by general-purpose processing units and FPGAs, are reported to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solvers, and to expose the benefits of fixed-point arithmetic in terms of computation speeds and memory requirements. Finally, an embedded MPC application to spacecraft attitude control with reaction wheels actuators is presented. A lightweight controller with specific optimizations is developed, and its good performance evaluated in simulations. Moreover, special MPC formulations that address the problem of reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>desaturation</b> are discussed, where the constraint handling property of MPC is exploited to achieve desaturation without the need of fuel-consuming devices such as thrusters...|$|E
40|$|The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-R), which {{launched}} in November 2016, {{is the first}} of the next generation geostationary weather satellites. GOES-R provides 4 times the resolution, 5 times the observation rate, and 3 times the number of spectral bands for Earth observations compared with its predecessor spacecraft. Additionally, Earth relative and Sun-relative pointing and pointing stability requirements are maintained throughout reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>desaturation</b> events and station keeping activities, allowing GOES-R to provide continuous Earth and sun observations. This paper reviews the pointing control, pointing stability, attitude knowledge, and orbit knowledge requirements necessary to realize the ambitious Image Navigation and Registration (INR) objectives of GOES-R. This paper presents a comparison between low-frequency on-orbit pointing results and simulation predictions for both the Earth Pointed Platform (EPP) and Sun Pointed Platform (SPP). Results indicate excellent agreement between simulation predictions and observed on-orbit performance, and compliance with pointing performance requirements. The EPP instrument suite includes 6 seismic accelerometers sampled at 2 KHz, allowing in-flight verification of jitter responses and comparison back to simulation predictions. This paper presents flight results of acceleration, shock response spectrum (SRS), and instrument line of sight responses for various operational scenarios and instrument observation modes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dual-isolation approach employed on GOES-R. The spacecraft provides attitude and rate data to the primary Earth-observing instrument at 100 Hz, which are used to adjust instrument scanning. The data must meet accuracy and latency numbers defined by the Integrated Rate Error (IRE) requirements. This paper discusses the on-orbit IRE results, showing compliance to these requirements with margin. During the spacecraft checkout period, IRE disturbances were observed and subsequently attributed to thermal control of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) mounting interface. Adjustments of IMU thermal control and the resulting improvements in IRE are presented. Orbit knowledge represents the final element of INR performance. Extremely accurate orbital position is achieved by GPS navigation at Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO). On-orbit performance results are shown demonstrating compliance with the stringent orbit position accuracy requirements of GOES-R, including during station keeping activities and momentum desaturation events. As we show in this paper, the on-orbit performance of the GNC design provides the necessary capabilities to achieve GOES-R mission objectives...|$|E
40|$|Autonomy from an {{unmanned}} system {{point of}} view describes the capability of a platform to accomplish a pre-defined mission with or without further human interaction and/or supervision. The degree of autonomy of the unmanned system depends on the vehicles’ own abilities of sensing, analyzing, communicating, planning, decision-making, and acting (the intelligence of the system), ranging from semi-autonomy to full-autonomy and autonomous collaboration. As a result, the mission and its complexity define the required degree of autonomy {{of the system and}} vice versa the technologically feasible level of autonomy may limit the operational deployment and consequently the mission parameters. However, the major challenge for unmanned system autonomy is the limitation of risk during operation. For example: In the air domain risk is inherent with operation in civil airspace, decision making for lethal actions, reliable and precise target identification, unintended or collateral damage or the like. In contrast to all other domains, in the space domain unmanned system autonomy is already state-of-the-art, at least for single spacecraft. In particular, most spacecraft have the ability to autonomously enter a Safe Mode in order to protect themselves from potential damage due to anomalous conditions. Autonomous transitions into Safe Mode often include activities like turning off non-essential payloads and hardware, also known as load shedding, entering a sun tracking guidance mode to maximize solar power generation, and achieving a thermally benign attitude. Other areas in which spacecraft sometimes function autonomously include routine operations such as momentum <b>wheel</b> <b>desaturation,</b> sensor pointing at pre-programmed targets, and similar activities. Occasionally for geosynchronous spacecraft, propulsive station keeping maneuvers are pre-programmed and then executed autonomously, although the degree to which this is done varies from program to program. However, the idea of a space architecture wherein individual spacecraft perform autonomous maneuvers, alter operating conditions, and implement other routine tasks to maintain and optimize the performance of the constellation is an appealing one and remains unsolved. In the presentation, the state-of the art with regard to single unmanned system autonomy in all domains will be addressed. Critical vehicle technologies will be highlighted – based on actual and future AVT activities – which might be able to realize unmanned system autonomy on a more architectural level. Conclusions will give an overview not only with regard to the realization horizon for the air, land, sea and space domains but also with regard to issues that have to be solved for certification of such systems...|$|E
