5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>over</b> and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and the enemies on the left side of the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
5|$|Power {{generation}} is managed by China Yangtze Power, a listed subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC)—a Central Enterprise SOE administered by SASAC. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest capacity {{hydroelectric power station}} with 34generators: 32 main generators, each with a capacity of 700MW, and two plant power generators, each with capacity of 50MW, making a total capacity of 22,500MW. Among those 32 main generators, 14 are installed in {{the north side of}} the dam, 12 in the south side, and the remaining six in the underground power plant in the mountain south of the dam. The expected annual electricity generation <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>over</b> 100TWh.|$|E
5|$|Since {{antiviral}} {{drugs are}} effective in treating influenza if given early (see treatment section, below), it can be important to identify cases early. Of the symptoms listed above, the combinations of fever with cough, sore throat and/or nasal congestion can improve diagnostic accuracy. Two decision analysis studies suggest that during local outbreaks of influenza, the prevalence <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>over</b> 70%, and thus patients {{with any of these}} combinations of symptoms may be treated with neuraminidase inhibitors without testing. Even {{in the absence of a}} local outbreak, treatment may be justified in the elderly during the influenza season as long as the prevalence is over 15%.|$|E

5|$|Like its {{predecessor}} , Seeds of Evil is a first-person shooter where the player assumes {{the role of}} Turok from a first-person perspective. As Turok, the player can run, jump, climb ladders, swim and dive underwater for a limited period of time. The player can carry an unlimited number of weapons, ranging from bows and arrows to pistols, rifles, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a speargun, and more advanced weapons such as the Cerebral Bore, which fires a homing projectile capable of latching onto enemy's heads, killing them by drilling into their skulls and exploding. Turok has {{a certain amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by enemies. If Turok's health is fully depleted, the player loses one Life Force point and has to continue the game from a previous checkpoint. If the player loses all Life Force points, the game <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>over.</b> Ammunition, health, and Life Force suppliers can be collected throughout the game to increase the player's resources.|$|E

When the player completes a course, points are awarded based on the rank they finished. If the required quantity is not met, the player will be disqualified and the game <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E

25|$|There is {{debate over}} what {{the effects of the}} 2000s energy crisis <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>over</b> the long term. Some speculated that an oil-price spike could create a {{recession}} comparable to those that followed the 1973 and 1979 energy crises or a potentially worse situation such as a global oil crash. Increased petroleum prices are reflected in a vast number of products derived from petroleum, as well as those transported using petroleum fuels.|$|E

25|$|In a sense, {{this was}} a strange partnership, as {{both of them were}} left arm slow bolwers, and useful lower order hitters. Very few sides in world cricket take two left arm slow bolwers in their side. In fact, at the time of Rafique's arrival, many thought that Moni's {{international}} career <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>over,</b> specially, given his rather indifferent form during the 5th ICC Trophy in Kenya early in 1994. Yet, right from the beginning, the two formed a wonderful combination which went on to serve the national squad throughout the '90s.|$|E

Race points will be awarded to the four first skaters at the intermediate sprints, and to the six first skaters at the final sprint. The accumulated points a skater collects during a race will decide the final ranking. For skaters who are tied in race points, including those who have failed to collect any, their finishing order will be break the tie.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} 25 years, politicians, {{academics}} and journalists have frequently predicted that disputes over water {{would be a}} source of future wars. Commonly cited quotes include: that of former Egyptian Foreign Minister and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Boutrous Ghali, who forecast, “The next war in the Middle East will be fought over water, not politics”; his successor at the UN, Kofi Annan, who in 2001 said, “Fierce competition for fresh water may well become a source of conflict and wars in the future,” and the former Vice President of the World Bank, Ismail Serageldin, who said the wars of the next century <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>over</b> water unless significant changes in governance occurred. The water wars hypothesis had its roots in earlier research carried out on a small number of transboundary rivers such as the Indus, Jordan and Nile. These particular rivers became the focus because they had experienced water-related disputes. Specific events cited as evidence include Israel’s bombing of Syria’s attempts to divert the Jordan’s headwaters, and military threats by Egypt against any country building dams in the upstream waters of the Nile. However, while some links made between conflict and water were valid, they did not necessarily represent the norm.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of Scarborough's population is between 25 and 64 years old. 52% fell into that [...] "working age" [...] {{during the last}} major survey, which also found 21% of Scarborough's population was 14 years old or younger, 15% were between 15 and 24, while senior citizens aged 65+ made up the remaining 12%. Like the rest of Canada, Scarborough's population is aging. It is projected that close to 30% of Scarboourgh residents will be senior citizens by 2041. This had made Scarborough a popular location for retirement communities, which attracts more seniors to the area creating {{a situation where the}} two largest age demographics in Scarobough <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>over</b> 55 and under 25.|$|E
