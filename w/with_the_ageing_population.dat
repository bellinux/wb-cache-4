30|$|However, Weller (2002) {{argued that}} rising <b>the</b> {{retirement}} <b>age</b> will not contain the enlarging pension funding gap but reduce the pensions of low-income population. The result will {{run counter to}} the primary objectives of social security that aims to eliminate poverty of <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> <b>population</b> and narrow down the gap between the rich and poor. In fact, given that pensions are inheritable, the pension deficit is not necessarily connected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> <b>population,</b> and there are a few uncertainties about the effect of the retirement delay over the alleviation of the pension deficit (Zhang 2006). Yet, if we put the growing life expectancy into consideration, the pension gap will be in a correlation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> <b>population.</b> By extending retirement <b>age,</b> <b>the</b> social security program can pool more funds because people have to pay more money into their pension accounts for a longer time, which could offset the effect of the retirement delay over closing the pension gap (Zhang 2007).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT – Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) {{was defined}} in 1957 and is linked with giant cell {{arteritis}} (GCA) in approximately 25 % of cases.

Treatment with a dose of 10 – 20 mg daily of prednisolone is suggested or 40 – 60 mg daily if GCA is also suspected. There are no absolute guidelines to the dose or its duration.

40|$|International audienceImmigration {{is often}} seen as an {{instrument}} of adaptation for ageing countries. In this paper, we evaluate, using a dynamic general equilibrium model, the contribution of migration policy in reducing the tax burden associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>population</b> in France. Four alternative scenarios, compared with a baseline scenario based on official projections, are simulated with the aim of quantifying the effects of immigration on French social protection finances. We show that the age and, to a lesser extent, the skill structure of immigrants are the key features that mainly determine the effects on social protection finances. Overall, these effects are all the more positive in the short to medium term if the migration policy is selective (in favour of more skilled workers). In the long term, the beneficial effects of a selective policy may disappear. But whatever the degree of selectivity of the migration policy, the financial gains from higher consequent migration flows are relatively moderate compared with the demographic changes implied by ageing...|$|E

40|$|Incidence {{rates of}} {{cognitive}} impairment and dementia are rising <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>population.</b> Meanwhile, the limited success of current treatments {{has led to}} a search for early markers of dementia which could predict future progression or improve quality of life for those already suffering from the disease. One focus has been on the correlation between physical and cognitive measures with an increasing interest in the association between frailty and cognitive decline. Frailty is an age-related syndrome described as the decreased ability of an organism to respond to stressors. A number of epidemiological studies have reported that frailty increases the risk of future cognitive decline and that cognitive impairment increases the risk of frailty suggesting that cognition and frailty interact within a cycle of decline associated with ageing. This paper reviews the evidence for an association between frailty and cognitive impairment and outlines some of the mechanisms that potentially underpin this relationship from brain neuropathology and hormonal dysregulation to cardiovascular risk and psychological factors...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} is the world's {{most common}} sustained cardiac arrhythmia and {{is associated with}} a significantly increased risk of stroke. The global burden of atrial fibrillation is rising, commensurate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>population.</b> Well-controlled vitamin K antagonist-based anticoagulation has been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation by two-thirds. However, patients with atrial fibrillation have frequently been denied anticoagulation because of a variety of perceived risks related to bleeding, falls, chronological age, and poor compliance. Even when vitamin K antagonists are used, maximum benefit and safety are only delivered when high quality control of therapy (TTR > 70 %) is achieved, which has proven remarkably difficult in many health-care systems and amongst many patient groups. The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer solutions to many of the challenges of achieving widespread, safe, and effective anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation, yet their uptake into routine clinical practice remains variable. The evidence supporting their more widespread use to overcome the challenges of stroke prophylaxis for atrial fibrillation is reviewed in this article...|$|E
40|$|Relationships {{are central}} to social {{well-being}} and emotional resilience across the lifespan, and good hearing and communication is integral to their establishment and maintenance. However, hearing loss {{is one of the}} most prevalent chronic conditions of ageing and significantly affects communication. Age-related hearing loss (ARHL), also known as presbycusis, typically is slowly progressive and commonly managed many years after being identified, increasing the risk of social withdrawal, early retirement, depression and mortality, and other negative consequences. ARHL occurs as the combination of environmental exposures, vascular insults, trauma, genetic predisposition, and metabolic changes. Further, it is associated with other age-related medical and health conditions, such as falls and dementia, although the relationship between these remains unclear. Despite multiple studies reporting that hearing devices are associated with positive outcomes in speech, communication and quality of life measures, the uptake and use of these is relatively low in many countries.
