5|$|An {{alternative}} systematic scheme exists using gill morphology. This {{distinguishes between}} Protobranchia, Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia. The first corresponds to Newell's Palaeotaxodonta and Cryptodonta, {{the second to}} his Pteriomorphia, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> corresponding to all other groups. In addition, Franc separated the Septibranchia from his eulamellibranchs because of the morphological differences between them. The septibranchs belong to the superfamily Poromyoidea and are carnivorous, having a muscular septum instead of filamentous gills.|$|E
