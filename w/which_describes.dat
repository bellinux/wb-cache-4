This includes identifying the island population which is eligible for the NAP benefits (i.e., family income limits, family status limits, etc.), establishing the process in which individual participants are selected, {{and the process of}} determining the benefit amount for each participant. The plan of operation is reviewed and approved by the FNS before funds are disbursed.|$|E
5|$|Flag of {{convenience}} (FOC) {{is a business}} practice whereby a merchant ship is registered in a country other {{than that of the}} ship's owners, and the ship flies that country's civil ensign. Owners of a ship may register the ship under a flag {{of convenience}} to reduce operating costs or avoid the regulations of the owner's country.

5|$|In his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{pointed out}} a duality symmetry between different components of the metric of a stationary vacuum spacetime, which maps solutions of Einstein's field equations to other solutions.

5|$|Junior synonym: A name <b>which</b> <b>describes</b> {{the same}} taxon as a {{previously}} published name. If {{two or more}} genera are formally designated and the type specimens are later assigned to the same genus, {{the first to be}} published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN (see Tyrannosaurus), but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnitude}} of diffusion damping is calculated as a damping factor or suppression factor, {{represented by the}} symbol , which figures into the Boltzmann equation, an equation <b>which</b> <b>describes</b> the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB. The strength of the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). What affect the diffusion length are primarily {{the properties of the}} plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping. The evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process.|$|E
5|$|This metric {{contains}} a scale factor, <b>which</b> <b>describes</b> how {{the size of}} the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a coordinate system to be made, called comoving coordinates. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their coordinate distance (comoving distance) remains constant, the physical distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the scale factor of the universe.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{religious}} {{language has}} been explained as via negativa, analogy, symbolism, or myth, each of <b>which</b> <b>describes</b> {{a way of}} talking about God in human terms. The via negativa {{is a way of}} referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise ineffable experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.|$|E
