40|$|<b>Window</b> <b>regulator</b> {{system is}} {{becoming}} a complicated mechatronic system. To obtain and improve understandings of system behaviors, this work developed models and simulations. To realize the target, system simulation with uniformed modeling language, VHDL-AMS, is chosen as tool. At first, dynamic behavior of <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> system is studied with method of averaging by a highly abstracted model. As next, main components, e. g. electrical drive, lifting mechanism, door frame and electronic system, are studied and modelled. Parametrization achieves with information from suppliers, existing data bank and measurements. Component models are verified and validated against their measurements. Afterwards, system simulation is built up by assembling component models. As verification and validation, system simulations are compared to measurements. As applications, simulations are used to investigate anti-pinch processes, influence of drum diameter and so on. Depending on the purpose of usage, they can be further improved. As summary, simulation provides support in development of <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> systems.

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 Design can {{be viewed}} as a {{constraint}} satisfaction problem: given constraints on functionality, structure, and manufacturability,produce a detailed structural description of an artifact. We present the notion of a constraint-based design system as one that explicitlyrepresents and operates upon these constraints. A key feature of constraint-based systems is the separation of problem statement from problem solution techniques. Constraint systems are distinguished from parametric design systems, which do not separate problem statement and solution. Current constraint-based systems are examined, and their strengths and weaknesses discussed. We describe DOC (Design Objects and Constraints), an object-oriented constraint-based design system, and WoRM (<b>Window</b> <b>Regulator</b> Mechanism design), a mechanical design system built upon DOC. Issues requiring further research are discussed, and a description of our own research directions is presented. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cars have {{various types}} of doors. The {{swinging}} doors which {{are the most common}} are almost the most complicated parts in a car since they not only determine the general guidelines of car style, but also are vital for passenger's safety by protecting humans from side crashes. Comparison between FEA results and targets led to the necessity to split lower opening of front door into two parts to increase stiffness. Also, thickness of <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> engine fixing in both front and rear doors are increased. Predetermined values from previous works conducted on a similar existing SUV vehicle were used as targets to be achieved by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of car doors. Mobile hinge fixing is duplicated for both front and rear doors Inner panel opening in front door window lower mechanism are also decreased...|$|R

50|$|The second {{generation}} K5 models incorporated the rear hatch glass and tailgate {{into a single}} unit, which allowed the glass panel to retract inside of the tailgate by use of a manual crank mounted on the tailgate or an electric motor activated by a key-operated switch on the tailgate and a dash-mounted switch. The weight of the large glass panel was rumored to be a liability as the manual crank gears wore prematurely and the electric motor was prone to frequent overheating and subsequent failure. This also included the electric motor drive cable which goes to the <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> to the motor (similar in design to a speedometer cable), which usually would fail under heavy abuse. Another feature of the K5 Blazer tailgate was the safety switch connected to the electric motor which prevented the rear window from being raised if the tailgate was unlatched.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2001 {{model year}} (Cars made from September 2000), BMW updated the E39 with newer, clear-lens tail, side marker, and {{headlights}} which first displayed the now-popular [...] "angel eyes."

40|$|Power <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> is a {{mechanism}} for raising and lowering door glass. It consists {{of a set of}} gear, electric motor and door sash channels. For this project, power window design of the Proton Gen- 2 was selected, where the improvement had been made at main arm and slider. The main arm and slider was designed using CAD software. Then, the design was analyzed using FMEA method and FEA (ALGOR) software. These analyses were done to find the best design that can optimize the operation for the stress analysis. There is one design for main arm and two designs for slider had been done. The analysis showed that both of the new designs are better compared to current design. For the both designs, the result showed that when force are applied, the displacement of improvement design that occur is lowest than current design. In conclusion, this improvement can reduce the cost of repairing because the improvement made can hopefully reduce the failure occurrence for that specific power window mechanism...|$|R
40|$|As third {{generation}} (3 G) wireless networks with {{high data rate}} get widely deployed, optimizing TCP performance over these networks would have a broad and significant impact on data application performance. One {{of the biggest challenges}} in optimizing TCP performance over the 3 G wireless networks is adapting to the significant delay and rate variations over the wireless channel. In this paper, we make two main contributions. First, we present a <b>Window</b> <b>Regulator</b> algorithm that uses the receiver window field in the acknowledgment packets to convey the instantaneous wireless channel conditions to the TCP source and an ack buffer to absorb the channel variations, thereby maximizing long-lived TCP performance. It improves the performance of TCP Sack by up to 100 % over a simple drop-tail algorithm for small buffer sizes at the congested router. Second, we present a wireless channel and TCP-aware scheduling and buffer sharing algorithm that reduces the latency of short TCP flows by up to 90 % while still exploiting user diversity, thus allowing the wireless channel to be utilized efficiently...|$|R
40|$|In {{industrial}} product development, adaptive mechatronic systems play a rapidly increasing role. Historically, mechatronic systems {{are characterized by}} a coupling of the physical domains software engineering, mechanical engineering, and electronic engineering. But nowadays, also hydraulic, pneumatic and thermal subsystems {{have to be taken}} into account. Such heterogeneous systems provide a large variety of interactions between their subsystems. Hence, a holistic approach to modelling and simulation would be desirable when dealing with development of such systems. In the case of existence of adaptive components, the challenge becomes much more complex. Now, one has not only to deal with different physical domains but also with variable model structures. Figure 1 shows an example of a <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> (left) and a driving motor (right) belonging to it. Because of environmental influences, functional restrictions or disorders may occur. Hence, it is worth to consider an adaptive system to increase robustness of functionality (adaptive controller, additional drive, heating system etc.). This may illustrate that a holistic approach is essential for design of adaptive mechatronic systems...|$|R

5000|$|In 1983, the Chevettes had {{a makeover}} {{for the front}} and rear fascias, and the Chevette CS was introduced. A black {{finished}} grille and trim moldings replaced most chrome pieces. Scooter and base Chevettes featured black bumpers and end-caps while the higher-end Chevette CS models included color-keyed bumpers and caps with chrome bumper inserts as an option. Scooter and base models featured a black-only grille and headlight buckets while CS models featured argent colored trim. The Chevette S model introduced a cosmetic package that included black painted styled-steel wheels and a red-accented grille and moldings as well as oversized decal emblems in red. Front bucket seats featured new adjustable knobs on the sides, but lost the reclining levers of previous years. Interior trim was also blacked out with new black door handles and black plastic <b>window</b> <b>regulators.</b> An integrated cassette deck was optional with the stereo package. A chrome strip on the dashboard was available only on CS and S models until the end of production.

5000|$|Three bodystyles were {{produced}} (station wagon, sedan, and coupe), {{and the design}} was also {{used as the basis}} for the El Camino pickup truck with its own chassis. The sedan initially had a conservative six-window notchback roofline. This was in contrast to the unusual fastback rooflines adopted by Oldsmobile and Buick divisions which would later revert a more formal pillar style. To increase rear seat hip room (and encourage more orders for the high-profit air conditioner), the windows in the rear doors of four-door sedans were fixed, while the wagons had small moveable vents. With the rear <b>window</b> <b>regulators</b> no longer required, Chevrolet was able to recess the door arm rests into the door cavity, resulting in a few extra inches of rear seat room. Customers complained about the lack of rear seat ventilation. No doubt this design contributed to the number of factory air conditioning units sold with the cars, to the benefit of General Motors and Chevrolet dealers. For the 1981 model year, sedans adopted a four-window profile and [...] "formal" [...] pillared upright roofline. The two-door coupe was last produced in this year, as the Monte Carlo assumed the market position held by the 2-door coupe. For 1982 the Malibu was facelifted with more squared-off front styling marked by quad headlights with long, thin turn signals beneath them. The look was very reminiscent of the also recently facelifted Chevrolet Caprice. For 1983, Malibus gained a block-style [...] "Malibu" [...] badge on the front fenders to replace the cursive-style script located on the rear quarter panels of previous model years.|$|R

It is world market leaders in door system and <b>window</b> <b>regulators</b> and European market leader in seat system. The management system in the new plant in Gothenburg, Sweden, is certified according to ISO 14001 and TS 16949. At the outset of this study the company {{was ready to go}} towards a new step, fulfilling customer demands from Ford and Volvo cars to become certified according to Q 1, which is a standard for management sub systems including fundamental quality and manufacturing disciplines. Brose wanted the authors to lead the implementation work in Gothenburg and to make a standardized work model for other new plants. The collection of data has come through interviews and brochures, which were then analysed and used when creating a model for implementation. Q 1, TS 16949 and ISO 14001 are similar to a number of other standards. We have gone through some of them and made comparisons in order to find ways to facilitate the implementation of Q 1. When working with quality systems it is necessary to create awareness for the employees and set goals for the implementation work. There is also a need to educate employees and build up trust for the system to make it usable for the company. The implementation work has to be delegated to be able to create awareness between the employees and to make them feel needed. Recurring meetings and learning are key elements to build a successful quality work.
