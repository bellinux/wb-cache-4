5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those <b>who</b> <b>value</b> other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E

Commonly, the preferred language is just another attribute of separate ethnic groups.

25|$|The King George whiting, Sillaginodes punctatus (also {{known as}} the spotted whiting or spotted sillago), is a coastal marine fish of the smelt-whitings family Sillaginidae. The King George whiting is endemic to Australia, inhabiting the south coast of the country from Jurien Bay, Western Australia to Botany Bay, New South Wales in the east. The King George whiting is {{the only member of}} the genus Sillaginodes and the largest member of the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae, growing to a length of 72cm and 4.8kg in weight. The species is readily {{distinguishable}} from other Australian whitings by its unique pattern of spots, as well as its highly elongate shape. King George whiting are often found in bays and protected waterways over sand and seagrass beds, also venturing out onto deep continental shelf reefs during adulthood. The species is a benthic carnivore, consuming a variety of crustaceans, polychaete worms, molluscs and fish. The King George whiting forms the basis of one of southern Australia's most important commercial fisheries, reportedly worth over five million Australian dollars per year. The species is also heavily targeted by recreational anglers, <b>who</b> <b>value</b> the whiting for its sporting and eating qualities.|$|E

500|$|Roark {{is opposed}} {{by what he}} calls [...] "second-handers", <b>who</b> <b>value</b> {{conformity}} over independence and integrity. These include Roark's former classmate, Peter Keating, who succeeds by following popular styles, but turns to Roark for help with design problems. Ellsworth Toohey, a socialist architecture critic who uses his influence to promote his political and social agenda, tries to destroy Roark's career. Tabloid newspaper publisher Gail Wynand seeks to shape popular opinion; he befriends Roark, then betrays him when public opinion turns in a direction he cannot control. The novel's most controversial character is Roark's lover, Dominique Francon. She believes that non-conformity has no chance of winning, so she alternates between helping Roark and working to undermine him. Feminist critics have condemned Roark and Dominique's first sexual encounter, accusing Rand of endorsing rape.|$|E

500|$|Gaia is {{inhabited}} by humans and various non-human races. Alexandria, Treno, and Lindblum are populated by {{a mix of}} humans and anthropomorphic animals. The Burmecians are anthropomorphic rats <b>who</b> <b>value</b> dance, thus accounting for their general aversion to footwear, and live in both Burmecia and Cleyra. The Cleyrans split from the Burmecians when the latter started to appreciate [...] "the art of war." [...] The dwarves are short humanoid creatures who appear as inhabitants of the village of Conde Petie on the Outer Continent. There is also a village of black mages that have gained self-awareness, who reside in the Outer Continent, as well. The Genomes, an artificial race of soulless vessels inhabit Terra; they will house the once-dormant Terran souls when Terra assimilates Gaia. Summoners are similar to other humans, but with a horn on their forehead. In the story, only two summoners remain (Garnet and Eiko); the others were exterminated when the Terran warship Invincible destroyed their homeland of Madain Sari. Lastly, the Qu are large, seemingly androgynous humanoids, who are recognized as great gourmands. They inhabit marshlands throughout the world where they catch their primary source of nutrition: frogs.|$|E

500|$|The {{only known}} {{credit for the}} film is that it starred William Garwood. Film historian, Q. David Bowers notes that the plot dealing with circumstantial {{evidence}} focused on one of Lloyd Lonergan's social issues. Lonergan would produce several scenarios featuring the problems with circumstantial evidence being used to obtain convictions. Bowers notes that such convictions were a known social issue, but not a pressing one in 1911. The first such Thanhouser film to tackle the subject was Love and Law released in December 1910. Love and Law was a film which garnered some criticism for an improbable plot. Checkmate wove a more tangled web of circumstantial evidence and intrigue and the resolution comes not from an astute female detective, but by the heiress's novel substitution of a doppelgänger to the prison so that the original can get the needed confession. The serious nature of the film was highlighted with the advertising of the film by Thanhouser which states, [...] "Checkmate carries a message and a lesson to those <b>who</b> <b>value</b> the 'circumstantial evidence' process by which so many convictions are obtained in our criminal courts. The reel demonstrates how easily evidence of this sort may be made to entangle and ensnare a totally innocent man..." ...|$|E

In addition, Zac found the storyline to be [...] "totally silly" [...] and strange though it was possibly very entertaining because of its uniqueness. Theron found that later episodes felt [...] "more natural" [...] and cited the characters {{to be part of this}} improvement, though the animation was [...] "still second-class (at best)." [...] Compared to the Japanese release, Theron Martin greatly preferred the English dubs, noting that [...] "the English dialogue has more punch and better flow than the drier and sometimes awkwardly-worded Japanese." [...] Tasha Robinson of Sci Fi Weekly found Speed Grapher to have a [...] "rich feel that's mirrored in the lovely visuals" [...] and a complicated storyline. She also commented that [...] "Its dry, serious central plotline is also clearly aimed at viewers <b>who</b> <b>value</b> sophisticated, drawn-out serial stories over instant gratification." [...] D. F. Smith of IGN disliked the storyline, though for different reasons. He felt that the series was [...] "trying way too hard to push the content envelope" [...] and that the characters were not likable. However, in contrast to the Anime News Network reviewers, he found the art and animation to be a [...] "first-rate job." ...|$|E
