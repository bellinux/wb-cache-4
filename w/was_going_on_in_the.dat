5|$|Additional {{criticism}} continued even a {{week after}} the storm, especially over the scale of the disaster. The government claimed that only 27 people had been killed by Giri while numerous local and international agencies stated significantly higher totals. They were also blamed for downplaying the amount of damage, resulting in slower distribution of aid to areas in desperate need. Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by the Junta. The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries out of the area and prevent them from knowing what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the region. On November8, local media discovered that the Junta was threatening to sever aid to the region if residents did not vote for them in the national election. According to Mizzima, the opposing party won landslide victories in numerous townships; however, in the cyclone affected areas, the Junta had complete victories.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the filmmakers}} worked around the stars' schedules, {{the filming of}} the whole movie took several years.

25|$|The {{first serious}} armed {{conflict}} {{of the war}} took place on February 14. While Soviet units retreated without a fight {{from the town of}} Mosty, fighting erupted near the towns of Maniewicze and Bereza Kartuska in Belarus. By late February the Bolshevik offensive had come to a halt, and it had become apparent that the Red Army would not break through the Polish lines with half-hearted attacks. On 27 February 1919 the Soviets proclaimed the creation of the Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Both Polish and Soviet forces had also been engaged with the Ukrainian forces (Polish–Ukrainian War). Active fighting <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> territories of Baltic countries (Lithuanian Wars of Independence, Latvian War of Independence and Estonian War of Independence).

500|$|While {{removed from}} the public's gaze, Dylan and The Band made music very {{different}} from the recordings of other major artists. Andy Gill writes, [...] "Musically, the songs were completely at odds with what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of the pop world, which during the long hot summer of 1967 was celebrating the birth of the hippie movement with a gaudy explosion of 'psychedelic' music—mostly facile paeans to universal love draped in interminable guitar solos." [...] Patrick Humphries itemizes the ways in which Dylan's songs dissented from the dominant ethos of rock culture: [...] "While the rock world vented its spleen on parents and leaders, Dylan was singing privately about parental fidelity. While George Harrison was testifying that life went on within and without you, Dylan was taking his potatoes down to be mashed. While Mick Jagger was 2,000 light years from home, Dylan was strapping himself to a tree with roots." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{claimed that}} [...] "Monolith forges new shooter {{territory}} with some truly freaky elements, challenge, fun, and beauty."

I knew my goal—track down a psychic, escort a corporate executive's daughter out of danger—but I didn't ever care {{who these people}} were nor did I understand their motives." [...] The game has also received criticism for its system requirements, which called for an extremely powerful PC for its time. The Xbox 360 port has also received positive reviews, almost as favorable as the PC version. The multiplayer and instant-action mode were praised for better gameplay, but the control scheme was negatively viewed. Reviews have also stated that it lacked bonus features, despite the new mission included in the game. GameSpot gave the game 8.6. while IGN rated it 9.1 ...|$|E
500|$|The climax {{scenes of}} the film were shot in the deserts of Rajasthan in February2011.

The displeasure shown by the crew threatened to disrupt the filming process. Karunanidhi, the writer, visited the sets of the film in a Vadapalani studio in February2011 to peruse over the scenes that had been shot at the time, and the filming then moved on to Guindy National Park in Chennai. [...] The four battle sequences in the movie were shot in Perambalur, near Trichy and Warangal in Andhra Pradesh. The scene in Trichy took 28 days to complete, with 30,000 junior artists used as soldiers along with 3000 horses and another battle scene was shot underwater. A few scenes in the film were reshot after the criticism it received at its premiere that Prashanth's characters showed no emotions at the death of their parents.|$|E

500|$|Reviews were universally {{less than}} {{positive}} on other systems. While critics praised {{the idea of}} the game, they found fault in the execution. Several critics disliked that the troops spawned by the player simply walk past the troops spawned by the opponent without the two groups fighting. The game's flow also attracted significant criticism, with Peter Eykemans of IGN saying [...] "Even on double speed, the pace is painful. This makes a simple two-person battle turn into a lengthy saga of repeating the same actions over and over again." [...] and Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly complaining of [...] "long drawn out matches on even the easiest difficulty settings as you try to force your way past a virtual stalemate". While the visuals did receive praise, critics felt that they also {{got in the way of}} allowing the player to tell what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. Opinions about the narrator were mixed. Henry Winchester of PC Gamer praised the voiceover, calling it [...] "a pleasingly booze-obsessed voiceover, delivered by what sounds like a Dalek doing an impression of Sean Connery". Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly was less kind, stating that [...] "your narrator and chief advisor sounds like an awful Sean Connery impersonator and he may be the best of the voice actors you come across". GamesRadar strikes a more neutral tone, stating that [...] "Pre and post-battle dialog is fully voiced by what are only technically 'actors,' but it definitely beats silent text, and does add a bit of flavor to the world." [...] Multiplayer also received mixed reviews. Eykemans of IGN suggested that multiplayer exacerbates the length and flow issues already present in the single player game, while Matt Hughes of GamesRadar calls multiplayer the game's [...] "biggest asset", stating that [...] "Playing against real humans definitely ramps up the intensity and reduces the cheap exploitation found in the campaign.".|$|E
