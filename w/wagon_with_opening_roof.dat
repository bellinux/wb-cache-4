5000|$|The <b>wagon</b> <b>with</b> <b>opening</b> <b>roof</b> {{is a type}} of railway goods wagon that is, nowadays, {{defined and}} {{standardised}} by the International Union of Railways (UIC) as Class [...] "T". They are a large category of rail vehicle, predominantly used for the transport of hygroscopic bulk commodities such as cement, plaster, lime, potash and grain.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1960s, the {{majority}} of goods wagons procured by European railway administrations have been built to standards laid down by, or based on, those established by the UIC.

50|$|G wagons {{were also}} {{frequently}} filled with bulk materials that were {{vulnerable to the}} weather.

50|$|A covered goods wagon or van is {{a railway}} goods wagon which is {{designed}} for the transportation of moisture-susceptible goods and therefore fully enclosed by sides and a fixed roof. They are often referred to simply as covered wagons, {{and this is the}} term used by the International Union of Railways (UIC). Since the introduction of the international classification for goods wagons by the UIC in the 1960s a distinction has been drawn between ordinary and special covered wagons. Other types of wagon, such as refrigerated vans and goods <b>wagons</b> <b>with</b> <b>opening</b> <b>roofs,</b> are closely related to covered wagons from a design point of view.|$|R
50|$|PKP Cargo owns {{more than}} 62,500 wagons, of {{which more than}} 44,000 are {{currently}} in use. Mineral wagons (approx. 28,000), carrying bulk materials (coal, ores, crushed stone), farm produce (beetroot, potatoes), {{as well as other}} goods, such as timber, machinery and equipment, account for {{a major part of the}} rolling stock. The second most numerous group at PKP Cargo are flat wagons. PKP Cargo uses them to carry containers, metal products, vehicles, machinery, timber etc. In addition, the company has ordinary and special covered vans, <b>wagons</b> <b>with</b> <b>opening</b> <b>roofs</b> and special <b>wagons</b> which can carry, for instance, heavy industrial goods exceeding loading gauge limits, as well as heavy electrical equipment.|$|R

5000|$|Flat wagons (sometimes flat beds, flats or rail flats, US: flatcars), as {{classified}} by the International Union of Railways (UIC), are railway goods wagons {{that have a}} flat, usually full-length, deck (or 2 decks on car transporters) and little or no superstructure. By contrast, open wagons have high side and end walls and covered goods wagons have a fixed roof and sides. Flat wagons are often designed for the transportation of goods that are not weather-sensitive. Some flat wagons are able to be covered completely by tarpaulins or hoods and are therefore suitable for the transport of weather-sensitive goods. Unlike a [...] "goods <b>wagon</b> <b>with</b> <b>opening</b> roof", the loading area of a flat is entirely open and accessible once the cover is removed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the car was {{conservative}} with a pressed steel body built on a ladder chassis. The chassis was designed to give a low overall height to the car by dipping down by 2.75 inches (70 mm) between the axles. The 1125-cc four-cylinder side-valve engine producing [...] drove the rear wheels through a four-speed gearbox and open drive shaft to a live rear axle. Steering was by worm and wheel. Suspension was by half-elliptic springs all round mounted on silent-bloc bushes and damped by frictional shock absorbers. The four-wheel brakes were cable and rod operated by pedal or by hand lever on the offside of the speed lever. The electrical system was 6 volt. For the first year only, a four-door saloon was made in two versions. The basic model cost £155 and was capable of reaching 55 mph with an economy of 34 and the Sunshine or De-Luxe <b>with</b> <b>opening</b> <b>roof</b> and leather upholstery at £168. Bumpers were provided. The chassis was priced at £120.|$|R

He was employed by the Altestenrat der Judein (Jewish Community in Prague) until his arrest by the Gestapo and deportation to Terezin on July 30, 1942. In Terezin he became a prominent figure in the Techinal Drawing Office where he produced a group of clandestine drawings, from memory. He was arrested with fellow artists Bedrich Fritta, Leo Haas and Otto Ungar for allegedly distributing "horror propaganda" on July 17 1944, following a visit by the International Red Cross to Terezin.

40|$|Double layered {{parabolic}} dome structure, <b>with</b> <b>opening</b> in <b>roof</b> is {{analyzed for}} buckling under wind load. Domes <b>with</b> three different <b>opening</b> sizes are used and external wind load is applied from different directions without changing {{the position of}} the opening. Dead load and internal wind pressure is also applied. The dead load and internal wind pressure is kept constant. The internal wind pressure is applied as per the ASCE building requirement that is once in positive direction which is towards the surface and once in negative direction which is away from the surface. The data for this project was sent by company ‘GEOMETRICA’. A MATLAB program has be developed which is capable of converting this data to a. dat file which is input file for NASTRAN. NASTRAN is a processor which is used for simulations and generates result files. The results can be view using PATRAN which is a pre and post processor. The results obtained in different cases are compared. It can be seen that there is large variation in load carrying capacity of the dome and it can be concluded that the size and {{the position of the}} opening has effect on load carrying capacity of the dome. ...|$|R

50|$|During {{the winter}} months, the Takelma lived in semi-subterranean homes dug partly into the {{insulating}} earth with superstructures built of vertically placed sugar pine planks. Poorer people also lived in pole-and-bark dwellings, well banked with earth and dry leaves for insulation. Typically the planks rested on two 6-foot-tall vertical shafts that supported a horizontal central pole. Beds of cat-tail mats were placed {{adjacent to the}} fire pit, <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> in the <b>roof</b> to allow for ventilation. Takelma homes bore structural similarities to the semi-subterranean homes of the Klamath and Modoc peoples to the east, who spoke languages in the Plateau Penutian family, and {{to those of the}} Shasta to the south, who spoke various Shastan languages (which may be part of the hypothetical Hokan family). One historical account describes a rectangular, plank structure large enough to hold 100 people, but archaeologists in the region have typically found remains of much smaller dwellings. During the warmer months of summer Takelma lived in residences made of brush or forwent them altogether.|$|R
