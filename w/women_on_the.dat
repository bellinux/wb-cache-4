5|$|Pfeiffer and Horton {{married in}} Santa Monica in 1981, {{and it was}} on their honeymoon that she {{discovered}} she had won the lead role in Grease 2. Horton directed Pfeiffer in a 1985 ABC TV special, One Too Many, in which she played the high school girlfriend of an alcoholic student (Val Kilmer); and in 1987, the real-life couple played an on-screen couple in the 'Hospital' segment of John Landis's comedy skit compilation, Amazon <b>Women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon. However, they decided to separate in 1988, and were divorced two years later; Horton later blamed the split on their devotion to their work rather than on their marriage.|$|E

Shane tries to encourage her to remember her dead sister, Amy, but this only causes Andrea to storm away.|$|E
5|$|She {{maintained}} {{some political}} {{communication with the}} political right wing. She authored the book Right-Wing Women, reviewed as premised on agreement between feminists and right-wing <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> existence of domination by men in sex and class, but disagreement on strategy. She testified at a Meese Commission hearing on pornography, while Attorney General Edwin Meese was serving socially conservative President Reagan. She had a political discourse with National Review writer David Frum and their spouses arranged by Christopher Hitchens.|$|E

According to Knoke, one time Specht's wife came to visit him on the II./JG 11 base but {{was held at the}} guard room on Specht's orders and refused to receive calls from the guard. Instead he asked Knoke to pass a message to her to 'put herself on ice', saying that he would only have time for her after the war. Specht however did not survive, dying five months before the war in Europe came to an end.|$|E

5|$|Stratus {{made her}} in-ring debut at the June 22 taping of SmackDown!, winning a tag team match with T & A against the Hardy Boyz and Lita. A storyline feud between Stratus and Lita {{developed}} after the match with Stratus attacking Lita on episodes of Raw and SmackDown!. This {{led to an}} Indian Strap match between the two <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> July 24 episode of Raw, which Stratus won with help from Stephanie McMahon. She finished the year competing unsuccessfully for the WWF Women's Championship numerous times, and separating from Test and Albert when the team disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The Fédération Centrafricaine de Football, the CAR's {{national}} football association, {{was founded in}} 1961 and became a FIFA affiliate in 1964. In the CAR, there is no national association staffer dedicated to women's football and no <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board or in the executive committee. With assistance from FIFA, the federation developed a women's programme starting in 2000. A national competition and school competition were later introduced. Football {{is one of the}} most popular women's sports in the CAR. There were about 200 registered youth players in the country and 200 registered senior players as of 2006. There are 80 club-level teams with women on them, 20 of which are exclusively for women.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, this unwieldy {{and confusing}} system {{was replaced by}} the current system in which an actress is nominated for a specific performance in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year. One actress has been nominated posthumously, Jeanne Eagels. Only three film characters have been nominated more than once in this category: Elizabeth I of England (two times by Cate Blanchett), Leslie Crosbie in The Letter, and Esther Blodgett in A Star Is Born. Six <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list have received an Honorary Academy Award for their acting; they are Greta Garbo, Barbara Stanwyck, Mary Pickford, Deborah Kerr, Gena Rowlands, and Sophia Loren.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} a {{secondary}} motive for men, especially young males, for learning the agung: the ability to interact with young, unmarried women. Both Maranao and Maguindanao cultures traditionally adhere to Islamic customs which prohibit dating or causal conversation between the opposite sexes (unless married to or related to by blood) and therefore performances such as kulintang music provided the opportunity for such a connection. Among the Maguindanao, the rhythmic modes of duyog and sinulog a kamamatuan allowed agung players to serenade the young, unmarried <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> kulintang. Tidto, the other rhythmic mode, {{could also be used}} but players rarely use this for serenading since the kulintang player is usually an older woman.|$|E
5|$|A former {{employee}} of Chandler's {{testified that he}} bragged about dating three <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bay that night, and that {{the next morning he}} arrived and delivered materials for a job by boat and immediately set out again. In an attempt to establish Chandler's whereabouts {{on the night of the}} murders, investigators found records of several ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home between 1:00am and 5:00am, which may have been attempts to explain his absence to his wife, and to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murders. Chandler's daughter, Kristal May Sue, testified that her father had talked about killing three women, and that he was afraid of returning to Tampa. A maid, who worked at the motel where the Rogers women stayed, testified that she walked past Chandler on June 1 as she was heading for the Rogers' room for room service. She said that she did not realize the significance of this sighting until Chandler's arrest in 1992; the sighting has never been confirmed. Michelle's boyfriend and Hal Rogers also took the stand during trial.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{ordered his}} men not to harass the <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> train, but the guerrillas robbed {{all of the}} men, finding over $9,000 and taking the soldiers' uniforms. Anderson forced the {{captured}} Union soldiers to form a line and {{announced that he would}} keep one for a prisoner exchange, but would execute the rest. He addressed the prisoners, castigating them for the treatment of guerrillas by Union troops. After selecting a sergeant for a potential prisoner swap, Anderson's men shot the rest. Anderson gave the civilian hostages permission to leave but warned them not to put out fires or move bodies. Although he was alerted of the congressman's presence in the town, he opted not to search for him. The guerrillas set the passenger train on fire and derailed an approaching freight train. Anderson's band then rode back to their camp, taking a large amount of looted goods.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Leslie (Amy Poehler) proudly announces to the parks and recreation staff that she will be judging the Miss Pawnee beauty pageant, a job she takes very seriously. Tom (Aziz Ansari), excited at the prospective of judging <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of their looks, pulls some strings to get a spot on the judging panel along with Leslie. April (Aubrey Plaza) enters the contest in order to win the $600 prize, despite being disgusted with the concept of a beauty contest. She tries, unsuccessfully, to gain an advantage by sucking up to Leslie. Later, Pawnee police officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.) visits Leslie at work to ask her out on a date. She initially accepts, but when Dave mistakes a photo of Madeleine Albright for Leslie's grandmother, Leslie becomes reluctant.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} season premiere, the {{fugitive}} couple, {{now under the}} aliases of Angie and Nick Bolen, buys a house on Wisteria Lane in Fairview, Eagle State, with their nineteen-year-old son, Danny (Beau Mirchoff). While Angie hesitantly befriends the other <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street, Danny takes a liking to Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen), a neighbor who eventually rejects his attempts to form a romantic relationship. When Julie falls into a coma after being strangled, Danny is the prime suspect, thus creating tension between Angie and Julie's mother, Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher). However, Danny is cleared of all charges when his alibi is validated. Meanwhile, neighbor Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) befriends Angie while experiencing a nervous breakdown {{as a result of}} Mike Delfino (James Denton) marrying Susan rather than her. When Katherine begins to question Angie's past, Angie tells Susan that Katherine may have strangled Julie as an act of revenge.|$|E

5|$|Joe Mayer {{was fired}} in 1937. He {{attributed}} this to the hatred of <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of the dean of physical sciences, which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory. Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some thought that {{there were too many}} German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics. Mayer took up a position at Columbia University, where the chairman of the Physics Department, George B. Pegram, arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with Harold Urey and Enrico Fermi, who arrived at Columbia in 1939. Fermi asked her to investigate the valence shell of the undiscovered transuranic elements. Using the Thomas–Fermi model, she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the rare earth elements. This proved to be correct.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur's {{next move}} was the {{invasion}} of Mindoro, where there were good potential airfield sites. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the Sulu Sea, and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on Nashville. As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a kamikaze struck Nashville, killing 133 people and wounding 190 more. Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation within two weeks, but the resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by kamikazes. During this time, MacArthur quarreled with Sutherland, notorious for his abrasiveness, over the latter's mistress, Captain Elaine Clark. MacArthur had instructed Sutherland not to be bring Clark to Leyte, due to a personal undertaking to Curtin that Australian <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> GHQ staff would not {{be taken to the}} Philippines, but Sutherland had brought her along anyway.|$|E
5|$|Peking opera was {{initially}} an exclusively male pursuit. The Qianlong Emperor had banned all female performers in Beijing in 1772. The appearance of <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage began unofficially during the 1870s. Female performers began to impersonate male roles and declared equality with men. They {{were given a}} venue for their talents when Li Maoer, himself a former Peking-opera performer, founded the first female Peking-opera troupe in Shanghai. By 1894, the first commercial venue showcasing female performance troupes appeared in Shanghai. This encouraged other female troupes to form, which gradually increased in popularity. As a result, theatre artist Yu Zhenting petitioned for {{the lifting of the}} ban after the founding of the Republic of China in 1911. This was accepted, and the ban was lifted in 1912, although male Dan continued to be popular after this period.|$|E
