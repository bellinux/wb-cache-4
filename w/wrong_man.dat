5|$|The Stork Club {{was also}} {{featured}} in several movies, including The Stork Club (1945), Executive Suite (1954), Artists and Models (1955), and My Favorite Year (1982). Billingsley received $100,000 {{for the use}} of the club's name in the 1945 film. In All About Eve (1950), the characters played by Bette Davis, Gary Merrill, Anne Baxter and George Sanders are shown in the Cub Room of the Stork Club. The Alfred Hitchcock film The <b>Wrong</b> <b>Man</b> (1957) starred Henry Fonda as real-life Stork Club bassist Christopher Emanuel Balestrero ("Manny"), who was falsely accused of committing robberies around New York City. Scenes involving Balestrero playing the bass were actually shot at the club. The film's screenplay, written by Maxwell Anderson, was based on a true story originally published in Life.|$|E
5|$|While the inceptive noir, Stranger on the Third Floor, was a B picture {{directed}} by a virtual unknown, {{many of the}} films noir still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with The Maltese Falcon (1941), John Huston followed with Key Largo (1948) and The Asphalt Jungle (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946), Strangers on a Train (1951) and The <b>Wrong</b> <b>Man</b> (1956). Otto Preminger's success with Laura (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a high-gloss 20th Century-Fox presentation. Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include Fallen Angel (1945), Whirlpool (1949), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) (all for Fox) and Angel Face (1952). A half-decade after Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend, Billy Wilder made Sunset Boulevard (1950) and Ace in the Hole (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media. In a Lonely Place (1950) was Nicholas Ray's breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, They Live by Night (1948) and On Dangerous Ground (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.|$|E

25|$|In March 2006 it was {{revealed}} that Paddick had consulted libel lawyers in connection with statements issued by Scotland Yard. In verbal and written statements to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on their investigations into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, he had stated that a member of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Ian Blair's private office team believed the <b>wrong</b> <b>man</b> had been targeted just six hours after the shooting. This was contrary to statements made at the time.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Wrong</b> <b>Man</b> (1957), Hitchcock's final {{film for}} Warner Bros., is a low-key {{black-and-white}} production {{based on a}} real-life {{case of mistaken identity}} reported in Life magazine in 1953. This was the only film of Hitchcock to star Henry Fonda, playing a Stork Club musician mistaken for a liquor store thief, who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife (Vera Miles) emotionally collapses under the strain. Hitchcock told Truffaut that his lifelong fear of the police attracted him to the subject and was embedded in many scenes.|$|E
25|$|Other {{observers}} {{have criticized the}} thoroughness of the investigation, and the validity of its conclusions. The author James Baldwin, in his essay The Evidence of Things Not Seen (1985), raised questions about Williams' guilt. Members of his community {{and several of the}} victims' parents did not believe that Williams, the son of two professional teachers, could have killed so many. On May 6, 2005, DeKalb County Police Chief Louis Graham ordered the reopening of the murder cases of four boys killed in that county between February and May 1981 that had been attributed to Williams. The announcement was welcomed by relatives of some victims, who said they believe the <b>wrong</b> <b>man</b> was blamed for many of the murders.|$|E

Alexandra is rescued from a larger misfortune, that of marrying the repugnant Leo, by Birdie, the only person able to do so, who wills herself the courage to tell the younger woman not to marry the <b>wrong</b> <b>man</b> (i.e. Leo), lest she bear the consequences {{for the rest of}} her life. Unfortunately, Oscar overhears part of the conversation and, after Alexandra is out of earshot, slaps Birdie hard.|$|E
25|$|On 17 March 2006, the Met was {{threatened}} with legal action by Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Brian Paddick. In {{evidence to the}} IPCC, Paddick had stated that a member of Sir Ian's private office team believed the <b>wrong</b> <b>man</b> had been targeted just six hours after the shooting, contrary to the official line taken at the time. When this information became public, Scotland Yard issued a statement that the officer making the claim (Paddick) 'has categorically denied this in his interview with, and statement to, the IPCC investigators'. The statement continued that they 'were satisfied that whatever {{the reasons for this}} suggestion being made, it is simply not true.' Paddick's interpretation of this statement was that it accused him of lying.|$|E
25|$|Cobra Commander {{tracked the}} former soldier to Japan, {{where he was}} {{training}} {{to become a member}} of the Arashikage ninja clan. The Commander approached the mercenary Firefly to assassinate the soldier, but Firefly referred Cobra Commander to Zartan, another assassin who infiltrated the clan, but ultimately killed the <b>wrong</b> <b>man</b> (the Hard Master). Storm Shadow was blamed for the murder, and his search for his uncle's killer would eventually lead him to join Cobra, where he'd pledge loyalty to Cobra Commander as his personal bodyguard, in order to get close to him and find the real assassin. The soldier left the ninja clan soon after, to live in seclusion in the Sierra Nevada mountains, until enticed to return to service on the G.I. Joe team as Snake Eyes.|$|E

25|$|Vera Miles, who {{was under}} {{personal}} contract to Hitchcock and had appeared on both his television show {{and in his}} film The <b>Wrong</b> <b>Man,</b> was originally scheduled to play Madeleine. She modeled for {{an early version of}} the painting featured in the film. Following delays, including Hitchcock becoming ill with gallbladder problems, Miles became pregnant and so had to withdraw from the role. The director declined to postpone shooting and cast Kim Novak as the female lead. Ironically, by the time Novak had tied up prior film commitments and a vacation promised by Columbia Pictures, the studio that held her contract, Miles had given birth and was available for the film. Hitchcock proceeded with Novak, nevertheless. Columbia head Harry Cohn agreed to lend Novak to Vertigo if Stewart would agree to co-star with Novak in Bell, Book and Candle, a Columbia production released in December 1958.|$|E
25|$|On June 7, 1904, Kid Curry was {{tracked down}} by a posse outside of Parachute, Colorado. Curry and two others had robbed a Denver and Rio Grande train outside Parachute. As they escaped, they stole fresh horses owned by Roll Gardner and a neighbour. The next morning, when they {{discovered}} their horses had been stolen, Gardner and the neighbour set out {{in pursuit of the}} gang. They joined up with a posse and continued tracking the outlaws. The gang shot Gardner's and his neighbour's horses from under them; Gardner found cover while his neighbour started running. Kid Curry took aim at the neighbour and Gardner shot Curry. The wounded Curry decided to end it at that time, and fatally shot himself in the head to avoid capture. The other two robbers escaped. The rifle Gardner used is still in the family today. Rumors persist that Curry was not killed in Parachute and was misidentified, having actually departed for South America with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Charlie Siringo resigned from the Pinkertons, believing they got the <b>wrong</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
500|$|In June 2015, Riina was absolved by {{the court}} of last instance, the supreme Court of Cassation. The {{evidence}} collected by the prosecution did not allow to establish a direct or indirect role of the accused in the crime. The Court concluded, however, that De Mauro most likely had been killed because he knew the secrets of Enrico Mattei's death, rather than the Borghese coup attempt. De Mauro’s disappearance and likely death {{remains one of the}} unsolved mysteries in Italian history.

500|$|By {{the start}} of the 1890s, Lloyd had built up a {{successful}} catalogue of songs, which included [...] "What's That For, Eh?", about a little girl who asks her parents the meaning of various everyday household objects. Her biographer and theatre historian W. J. MacQueen-Pope described the song as being [...] "blue" [...] and thought that it spoke volumes about her reputation thanks to her [...] "wonderful wink, and that sudden, dazzling smile, and the nod of the head." [...] Similar-styled songs followed; [...] "She'd Never had her Ticket Punched Before", told the story of a young, naive woman travelling to London on her own by train. [...] This was followed by [...] "The <b>Wrong</b> <b>Man</b> Never Let a Chance go By"; [...] "We Don't Want to Fight, But, by Jingo, If we Do"; [...] "Oh You Wink the Other Eye" [...] and [...] "Twiggy Vous"—a song which won her much success and increased her popularity abroad. After an evening's performance at the Oxford music hall, a French well-wisher requested a conversation and to meet Lloyd backstage. [...] Flanked by Courtenay, she appeared at the stage door, where Courtenay threatened the man with violence as both had become suspicious of his interest in her. She took a chance and invited the man into her dressing room, where he identified himself {{as a member of the}} French government. He confirmed to her that [...] "Twiggy Vous" [...] was [...] "most popular in Paris"; she was delighted at the news.

500|$|It {{was while}} Harris was remonstrating with Gregory that [...] "larrikins" [...] {{in the crowd}} surged onto the pitch. A young Banjo Paterson, who later went on to write the iconic Australian bush ballad [...] "Waltzing Matilda", was among the pitch invaders.

[...] On 31 May, following the publication of Harris's letter, The Argus described a significantly lesser figure, editorialising that [...] "only a few hundred sided with the objectors. [...] Those that were actively violent were fewer still, and they were kept in check by the better-disposed of the crowd." [...] Coulthard was jostled and Lord Harris, who {{had returned to the}} field to support Coulthard, was struck by a whip or stick but was not hurt. [...] Hornby, a keen amateur boxer who had been offered the English captaincy before stepping aside for Harris, grabbed his captain's assailant and [...] "conveyed his prisoner to the pavilion in triumph"; it was later said that he had caught the <b>wrong</b> <b>man.</b> [...] Hornby was also attacked and almost lost the shirt off his back. [...] Emmett and Ulyett each took a stump for protection and escorted Lord Harris off, assisted by some members. [...] In the meantime, the crowd anger grew and there was mounting fear that the riot would intensify, due to speculation that the crowd would try to free Hornby's captive. However, there was only jostling as the players were evacuated into the pavilion, and the injuries were limited to minor cuts and bruises. [...] An English naval captain who was at the ground had his top hat pulled over his eyes and was verbally abused by some spectators. [...] After 30 minutes, the field was cleared.|$|E
