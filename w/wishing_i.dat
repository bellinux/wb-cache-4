500|$|The {{reception}} of BuzzSaw has been generally positive. Melinda Siegmeier of the Gold Coast Bulletin stated [...] "the scream machine {{is certainly a}} fitting way to describe Dreamworld's newest thrill ride the BuzzSaw".

500|$|... "You Belong with Me"'s {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Roman White. In the video, Swift portrays both the protagonist and antagonist, which she respectively described as [...] "the nerd, who is pining away for this guy that she can't have" [...] and [...] "the popular girl." [...] Swift described the popular girl's persona as [...] "horrible and scary and intimidating and perfect". Her love interest is portrayed by American actor Lucas Till; Swift met Till while acting {{on the set of}} [...] in April 2008. She later asked him to act in the video, as she was intrigued by his [...] "cool look", embodying a [...] "dreamy guy". In regards to his acting on the video, Swift said, [...] "He's absolutely perfect for the part and really fun to be around, too." [...] According to her, the video's plot is [...] "charming"; she also said that, [...] "the whole video, I'm just sitting there pining away, <b>wishing</b> <b>I</b> could be in her position." [...] In regards to the video's conclusion, White explained that Swift [...] "becomes who she really is", while Swift thought it was a happy ending. Swift commented, [...] "One of my favorite things about this video is that there wasn't a standard performance scene. This video was pretty much all story line and I'm narrating it in the moment, basically narrating while all this is happening around me." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{who were}} {{generally}} less positive in their opinions of Tangled {{and its main}} characters Rapunzel and Flynn Rider were otherwise impressed by Pascal and Maximus' performances. The Liverpool Echos Catherine Jones felt that [...] "Pascal and Maximus shamelessly scene-steal from the human characters", while Chris Tookey of the Daily Mail wrote, [...] "The enjoyable visual gags generally come from the two animal sidekicks". The Illinois Times Chuck Koplinski wrote, [...] "Throw in two animal sidekicks – wily horse Maximus and protective chameleon Pascal – {{and you have a}} film that, while not as moving as the Pixar movies, is a satisfying lark." [...] TV Guide opined that although [...] "There's nothing particularly innovative about Dan Fogelman's screenplay", the author wrote that [...] "a cute animal sidekick ... extend to the visual aspects of the film". Similarly, Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "This ride's a familiar one, but with humourous (sic) sidekicks such as horse-who-thinks-he's-a-dog Maximus and chameleon Pascal, it's thoroughly enjoyable." [...] Although Dave White of Movies.com strongly panned Tangled, he dubbed Pascal and Maximus the film's [...] "Most Memorable Cliché", writing that the characters [...] "are better than the movie deserves." [...] White continued, [...] "they both steal scene after scene from the Cream of Wheat-like main characters", concluding, [...] "I kept <b>wishing</b> <b>I</b> was watching a movie about just them." [...] The Independents Anthony Quinn, who was ambivalent towards the film, admitted that Pascal and Maximus [...] "provide some chuckles." [...] Similarly, Tom Huddleston of Time Out wrote, [...] "With two such bland heroes, it's good that plenty of attention is paid to the supporting characters, notably ... a bad tempered but loveable horse", while Todd Hertz of Christianity Today called Maximus [...] "a more complex, multi-dimensional character than some movies' leads". Despite calling the film [...] "bland", the Houston Chronicles Amy Biancolli called Maximus a [...] "stone cool" [...] character. Tyler Hanley Palo Alto Weekly, however, praised the entire ensemble as a whole, calling Rapunzel, Flynn, Pascal and Maximus [...] "a thoroughly enjoyable quartet." [...] In a lone lukewarm review, James Berardinelli of ReelViews called Pascal [...] "among the least recognizable animal sidekicks (although he possesses amusing mannerisms)." ...|$|E
