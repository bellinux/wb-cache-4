The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain.

40|$|China {{has been}} {{experiencing}} a great {{transition from a}} socialist collective economy {{to a market economy}} since 1978. Before the transition started, the Communist Party had established a socialist collective system with very low levels of income <b>and</b> <b>wealth</b> inequality. With the deepening of the rural reform and the development of rural industry, {{a large number of people}} were lifted out of poverty. However, as the people’s living standards are rising, disparities in income <b>and</b> <b>wealth</b> are also being accentuated. This thesis’s main purpose is to study the extent and determinants of income <b>and</b> <b>wealth</b> inequality in rural China. Based on a sample survey data from Anhui and Sichuan provinces, the thesis answers the following five questions: 1. How much income <b>and</b> <b>wealth</b> inequality is there in rural China in 1994 - 1995 ? 2. How has inequality in rural China changed since the reform of 1978 ? 3. How do the components of income <b>and</b> <b>wealth</b> in China affect the income <b>and</b> <b>wealth</b> distributions? 4. What social and economic factors are most responsible for influencing income <b>and</b> <b>wealth</b> in rural China? 5. How much of the inequality in income <b>and</b> <b>wealth</b> can be accounted for by the factors that predict income <b>and</b> <b>wealth...</b>|$|R
