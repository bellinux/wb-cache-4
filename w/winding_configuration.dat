40|$|We {{examine the}} quantum {{corrections}} to the static energy for Higgs <b>winding</b> <b>configurations</b> {{in order to}} ascertain whether such corrections may stabilize solitons in the standard model. We evaluate the effective action for <b>winding</b> <b>configurations</b> in Weinberg-Salam theory without U(1) -gauge fields or fermions. For a configuration whose size, a ≪ m^- 1 where m = m_W,m_H, m_W is the W-mass, and m_H is the Higgs mass, the static energy goes like g^- 2 m_W^ 2 a [1 +b_ 0 g^ 2 (1 /ma) ]^c_ 0 /b_ 0 in the semiclassical limit. Here g is the SU(2) -gauge coupling constant and b_ 0, c_ 0 are positive numbers determined by renormalization-group techniques. We discuss the limitations of this result for extremely small configurations and conclude that quantum fluctuations do not stabilize <b>winding</b> <b>configurations</b> where we have confidence in SU(2) -Higgs as a renormalizable field theory.

5000|$|The {{advantage}} of two-phase electrical power over single-phase {{was that it}} allowed for simple, self-starting electric motors. In {{the early days of}} electrical engineering, it was easier to analyze and design two-phase systems where the phases were completely separated. It was not until the invention of the method of symmetrical components in 1918 that polyphase power systems had a convenient mathematical tool for describing unbalanced load cases. The revolving magnetic field produced with a two-phase system allowed electric motors to provide torque from zero motor speed, which was not possible with a single-phase induction motor (without an additional starting means.) Induction motors designed for two-phase operation use a similar <b>winding</b> <b>configuration</b> as capacitor start single-phase motors (however, in a two-phase induction motor, the impedances of the two windings are identical, whereas in a single-phase induction motor, the impedances can be, and usually are, quite different, to reduce cost without sacrificing starting performance; indeed, some single-phase capacitor start/capacitor run induction motors have superior starting characteristics when compared to two- or three-phase induction motors.) ...|$|E
5000|$|A zigzag {{transformer}} is a special-purpose transformer with a zigzag or [...] "interconnected star" [...] winding connection, {{such that}} each output is the vector sum of two (2) phases offset by 120°. Its applications {{are for the}} creation of a missing neutral connection from an ungrounded 3-phase system to permit the grounding of that neutral to an earth reference point and also harmonic mitigation, as it can suppress triplet (3rd, 9th, 15th, 21st, etc.) harmonic currents, to supply 3-phase power as an autotransformer (serving as the primary and secondary with no isolated circuits), and to supply non-standard, phase-shifted, 3-phase power.Nine-winding, three-phase transformers typically have 3 primaries and 6 identical secondary windings, which can be used in zigzag winding connection as pictured. As with the conventional delta or wye <b>winding</b> <b>configuration</b> three-phase transformer, a standard, stand-alone transformer containing only six windings on three cores can also be used in zigzag winding connection, such transformer sometimes being referred to as a zigzag bank. In all cases, six or nine winding, the first coil on each zigzag winding core is connected contrariwise to the second coil on the next core. The second coils are then all tied together to form the neutral, and the phases are connected to the primary coils. Each phase, therefore, couples with each other phase, and the voltages cancel out. As such, there would be negligible current through the neutral point, which can be tied to ground.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{two-phase}} doubly salient {{permanent magnet}} machine (FMDSPM) with new <b>winding</b> <b>configuration</b> is proposed in this paper. This machine {{is identical to}} the existing doubly salient permanent magnet machine (DSPM) with respect to the mechanical structure, whereas the <b>winding</b> <b>configuration</b> is totally different from that in the latter. The structure and operation principle of FMDSPM is analyzed, and power and sizing equations are derived analytically, which provides the designer with initial calculation to determine the motor frame. Allowing for the new <b>winding</b> <b>configuration</b> utilized, the magnetic features of FMDSPM are investigated by using the FEA. The results show that this new machine is suitable to the application of DC square wave, and the output torque produced is smoother due to no cumbersomely commutating torque ripples compared with the existing DSPM.
