50|$|The central plaza {{appears to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> {{alignment}} that {{coincides with the}} rise and fall of the Pleiades. Also, on the summer solstice the sun rises from behind the Tajumulco volcano on the eastern horizon, in a line directly over the plaza. The celestial alignment is only maintained in the central plaza, which is most likely the ceremonial center. The outer edges of the site, however, show no alignment, possibly representing a residential area. Several regional sites, contemporaneous and in proximity to Ujuxte, are smaller copies and appear to be secondary centers to Ujuxte, which indicate its importance and domination in the region.|$|R

2500|$|For Latter-day Saints, <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> {{marriage}} {{is not required}} to get into the celestial kingdom, but is required to obtain a fullness of glory or exaltation within the celestial kingdom. The righteous who do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> marriage would still live eternally with God, but they would be [...] "appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering servants." [...] As black people were banned from entering celestial marriage prior to 1978, some interpreted this to mean that they would be treated as unmarried whites, being confined to only ever live in God's presence as a ministering servant. Mark E. Petersen and Apostle George F. Richards taught that blacks could not achieve exaltation because of their priesthood and temple restrictions. Several leaders, including Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, Wilford Woodruff, George Albert Smith, David O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, and Harold B. Lee taught that black people would eventually be able to receive a fullness of glory in the celestial kingdom.|$|R

50|$|Parashurama is born to sage Jamadagni and {{his wife}} Renuka, living in <b>a</b> hut. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> cow called Surabhi who {{produces}} all they desire. A king named Arjuna Kartavirya - {{not to be confused}} with Arjuna Pandava - learns about it and wants it. He asks Jamadagni to give it to him, but the sage refuses. While Parashurama is away from the hut, the king takes it by force. Parashurama learns about this crime, and is upset. With his axe in his hand, he challenges the king to battle. They fight, and Parushama kills the king, according to the Hindu mythology. The warrior class challenges him, and he kills all his challengers. The legend, states James Lochtefeld, likely has roots in the ancient conflict between the Brahmin caste with religious duties and the Kshatriya caste with warrior and enforcement role. However, the Hindu texts are not consistent, and there <b>has</b> been <b>a</b> dispute on whether he was a Kshatriya or a Brahmin.|$|R

Though the two quickly renew their friendship, the other captains remain stilted in Laurences company, talking around subjects which would potentially cause him discomfort. However, Laurence applies himself willingly to the diplomatic mission at hand: he, an honorary son of the Jiaqing Emperor, is to visit Peking in hopes of forming an alliance between China and the United Kingdom. No sooner has he arrived than he is swept up in local politics; conservatives are attempting to assassinate the heir to the throne, Prince Mianning (the future Daoguang Emperor), using Western decoys as their catspaws. Temeraire is also concerned to learn that Lung Tien Chuan, his twin brother and one of only eight Celestials alive, has died of poisoning. This assassination has attacked Miannings legitimacy, as <b>an</b> Emperor must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Celestial</b> companion and there are now none to spare; to this end, Temeraire consents to couple with Lung Qin Mei, <b>an</b> Imperial he <b>had</b> grown fond of during his last sojourn in China, to attempt to breed a new one.|$|R
