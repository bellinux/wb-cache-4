Parametric {{equations}} were used to describe the motion of path followed by the weeding tines. The effective performance of soil working tool was related to the kinematic parameter of the soil working tools, the forward travel distance and speed of the rotary tines and working action of components of <b>weeding</b> <b>tool.</b> The design parameters for appropriate soil working tools and implements were established. The weeder consists of a 5 hp-petrol engine, three ground wheels (pneumatic), tool assembly, frame and handle.

40|$|The use of {{computer-based}} {{signal processing}} and sensor technology to guide and control {{different types of}} agricultural field implements increases the performance of traditional implements and even {{makes it possible to}} create new ones. This thesis increases the knowledge on vision-based perception for mechatronic weed control. The contributions are of four different kinds: First, a vision-based system for row guidance of agricultural field machinery has been proposed. The system uses a novel method, based on the Hough transform, for row recognition of crop rows. Second is a proposal for a vision-based perception system to discriminate between crops and weeds, using images from real situations in the field. Most crops are cultivated in rows and sown in a defined pattern, i. e. with a constant inter-plant distance. The proposed method introduces the concept of using these geometrical properties of the scene (context) for single plant recognition and localization. A mathematical model of a crop row has been derived that models the probability for the positions of consecutive crops in a row. Based on this mathematical model two novel methods for context-based classification between crops and weeds have been developed. Furthermore, a novel method that combines geometrical features of the scene (context) and individual plant features has been proposed. The method has been evaluated in two datasets of images of sugar beet rows. The classification rate was 92 % and 98 %, respectively. The third contribution is the design of a mobile agricultural robot equipped with these perception systems and a mechanical <b>weeding</b> <b>tool</b> intended for intra-row weed control in ecologically cultivated crops. The fourth contribution is a demonstration of the feasibility of the perception systems in real field environments, especially with respect to robustness and real-time performance. The row guidance system has been implemented in three different row cultivators and performed inter-row weed control at two commercial farms. The robot has proven to be able to follow a row structure by itself, while performing weed control within the seed line of a crop row, i. e. intra-row cultivation.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of weed species and the herbicides and cultural practices {{used to control}} weeds in Arizona cotton fields were surveyed in 1995 and 1996. The most common weeds were purple nutsedge, bermudagrass, annual morningglory, Palmer amarnath, Wright groundcherry, common purselane, yellow nutsedge and Johnsongrass. The average statewide cost for hand weeding in 1995 was reported as $ 27. 87 per acre {{in addition to other}} weed control costs. Statewide, most growers used preemergence herbicides before or at planting and used pre- and post-emergence herbicides later in the season. Most of these applications were broadcast applications suggesting that many of the postemergence herbicide applications were layby applications. Preemergence herbicides (usually applied preplant incorporated) such as Treflan, Prowl, and Prometryn were more commonly used than postemergence herbicides.

40|$|Because of {{environmental}} and health safety issues, {{it is necessary to}} develop strategies that do not rely on herbicides to manage weeds. Introducing temporary grassland into annual crop rotations and mechanical weeding are the two main features that are frequently used in integrated and organic cropping systems for this purpose. To evaluate the contribution of these two factors in interaction with other cropping system components and environmental conditions, the present study updated an existing biophysical model (i. e. AlomySys) that quantifies the effects of cropping system on weed dynamics. Based on previous experiments, new sub-models were built to describe the effects on plant survival and growth reduction of mechanical weeding resulting from weed seedling uprooting and covering by soil, and those of grassland mowing resulting from tiller destruction. Additional modifications described the effect of the multi-year crop canopy of grassland on weed survival, growth, development and seed return to the soil. The improved model was used to evaluate the weed dynamics over 27 years in the conventional herbicide-based cropping system most frequently observed in farm surveys (i. e. oilseed rape/winter wheat/winter barley rotation with superficial tillage) and then to test prospective non-chemical scenarios. Preliminary simulations tested a large range of mechanical weeding and mowing strategies, varying operation frequencies, dates and, in the case of mechanical weeding, characteristics (i. e. tool, working depth, tractor speed). For mechanical weeding soon after sowing, harrowing was better than hoeing for controlling weed seed production. The later the operation, the more efficient the hoeing and the less efficient the harrowing. Tractor speed had little influence. Increasing tilling depth increased plant mortality but increased weed seed production because of additional seed germination triggering by the <b>weeding</b> <b>tool.</b> Decreasing the interrow width for hoeing was nefarious for weed control. The best combinations were triple hoeing in oilseed rape and sextuple harrowing in cereals. The best mowing strategy was mowing thrice, every 4 – 6 weeks, starting in mid-May. The best individual options were combined, simulated over 27 years and compared to the herbicide-based reference system. If herbicide applications were replaced solely by mechanical weeding, blackgrass infestation could not be satisfactorily controlled. If a three-year lucerne was introduced into the rotation, weed infestations were divided by ten. Replacing chisel by mouldboard ploughing before winter wheat reduced weed infestations at short, medium and long term to a level comparable to the herbicide-based reference system...|$|E

40|$|Most {{physical}} and cultural weed control methods for arable crops {{do not provide}} complete weed control. Some weeds will escape the treatments and the numbers depend strongly on the successfulness of conducting the treatments. Moreover, current mechanical weed control methods, that work the intra-row area of the crop, generally operate with low selectivity whether it is cereals grown at narrow row spacing or typical row crops (e. g. maize, sugar beets, and many vegetables) at wider row spacing. Low selectivity means that a high weed control level might be associated with severe crop damages, particularly if large weeds are to be controlled satisfactorily. Thus, seeking for complete weed control can be very risky or more likely impossible. Since realising that, a number of investigations have then focussed on the tactical use of mechanical intra-row methods, particularly {{how they can be}} combined with cultural methods that mainly improve crop competitiveness and crop tolerance to withstand mechanical impact (uprooting and soil covering) from the <b>weeding</b> <b>tools.</b> Some promising <b>weed</b> control strategies in e. g. spring barley, onion, and pulse have been achieved from this work (e. g.

40|$|This paper gives a brief {{review of}} the major {{achievements}} in European research on physical weed control methods for agricultural and horticultural crops. Most of the work has emerged from an increasing awareness and concern about pesticide consumption in many Western European countries. Also an increasing interest in organic farming has further pushed the development of more sustainable weed control methods. Generally, the research has been joint projects between engineers and agronomists and the results have so far revealed some prospects as well as limitations for non-chemical methods to become useful solutions, not only for the organic growers but also for the conventional ones. A number of investigations have focussed on rather simple low-tech mechanical weeding principles, such as harrowing, brush weeding, hoeing, torsion weeding, and finger weeding, aiming at describing the weeding mechanisms for a better optimisation of the usage. In some crops, such as transplanted vegetables, potatoes, maize, winter oil seed rape, and partly small grain cereals, mechanical weed control has been quite effective and may become a relevant alternative to chemical weed control. However, current mechanical methods generally work with low selectivity, as they do not distinguish between weed and crop plants when applied into the crop row. Attempts to change the constructions and materials of the <b>weeding</b> <b>tools</b> have not decisively improved the selectivity and mor...|$|R

40|$|Sustainable crop {{production}} {{is necessary to}} ensure global food security and environmental safety. Conservation agriculture (CA) is gaining popularity around the globe due to its sustainable approaches such as permanent soil cover, minimal soil disturbance, planned crop rotations and integrated weed management. Weed control is the biggest challenge to CA adoption. Weed ecology and management is different in CA than in conventional agriculture. In CA, weeds expression, seed bank status, distribution, dispersal mechanisms, diversification, growing patterns and competition trends are complex and differ from conventional systems. It is due to reduced tillage of the soil and the flora that thrives in CA. Reduced tillage systems affect the efficacy of herbicides and mechanical weed control measures. So, {{it is an important}} task to find out the differences and to fabricate new management options. In this review, changing weed dynamics have been framed. A novel aspect of this review is the comprehensive account of sustainable weed management strategies in relation to CA. Modified tillage operations, improved cultural practices, bioherbicides, chemical herbicides, allelopathy, and crop nutrition have been identified as suitable <b>weed</b> management <b>tools.</b> None of these offers complete control but the integration of these tools in suitable combinations works efficiently. Weeds dominating CA and their responses to CA components are highlighted. For example, small seeded and perennial weeds are more abundant in CA.

Allelopathy and crop nutrition are discussed as modern <b>weed</b> management <b>tools</b> for CA. A detailed account of weed responses to fertilizer management options is also given. Integrated weed management compatible to cropping patterns and climatic conditions offers the best results in CA.

40|$|Advances in {{the usage}} of {{computer}} imaging, communication technologies and the successful development of new techniques for precision agriculture have facilitated a smart-digital revolution in row crop agriculture in recent years. The use of a yield monitor, variable rate application (VRA) for fertilizer and herbicides, soil property maps and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology has enabled the development of computer generated prescription maps for farm management. All these technologies are changing agricultural practices from simple mechanical operations to automated operations implemented by robotic-based systems. The automation of individual crop plant care in vegetable crop fields has increased its practical feasibility and improved efficiency and economic benefit. A systems-based approach is a key feature in the mechanization engineering design via the incorporation of precision sensing techniques. The objective {{of this study was}} to design sensing capabilities for Implementation to measure plant spacing under different test conditions (California, USA and Andalucía, Spain). Three different optical sensors were used: an optical light curtain transmitter and receiver (880 nm), a LiDAR sensor (905 nm), and an RGB camera. An active photoelectric transmission sensor, which contained 3 pairs of optical light curtain transmitters and receivers, evaluated the interruption by the tomato stem of the light curtain between the two devices, and was recorded simultaneously in real-time by a high-speed embedded control system. The LiDAR (model LMS 211 in California and LMS 111 in Spain, from SICK AG) was installed in a vertical orientation in the middle of the mobile platform. Additionally, a RGB spatial mosaicked image was used to adjust the data from the light beam and LiDAR sensor and obtain combined information (RGBD where D is for distance). These sensors were used to properly detect, localize, and discriminate between weed and tomato plants.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the use of robotic {{selective}} mechanical cultivation as an alternative method to herbicide control for managing weed species in zero-till cropping systems. Existing best-practice technology in weed spot spraying utilises infrared technology to detect and selectively spray weeds using herbicide at quantities significantly less than those used in normal blanket spray applications. This reduction in the herbicide de- creases operational costs and can be beneficial for the environment; however, the capital investment in the technology is substantial for farmers who wish to own and operate their equipment. While effective in reducing overall herbicide usage, the technology has done little to tackle the rapid evolution of herbicide resistant weed species. As a potential solution to this issue, our research {{over the past three years}} has been focused on the development of non-chemical methods of weed management utilising robot-enabled selective mechanical weeding. Used in conjunction with a robotic vehicle platform, a mechanical weeding array is capable of working throughout the day and night. The <b>weeding</b> <b>tools</b> have been designed to be removable and inter- changeable, allowing the use of tools especially designed for different weed species, weed densities, and soil types. The system developed consists of a one-degree-of-freedom array of weeding tines, actuated into the ground in time to remove individual weeds. Sensing of the weeds is enabled by a vision-based plant detection and classification system, while the timing for the implement actuation to hit the weed is determined as a function of the robot speed. The field trials reported in this paper demonstrate the potential of this robotic system for individualised weed treatment and multi-mode weed management methods. In particular, a trial of the mechanical weeding array in a fallow field over six weeks maintained the weed coverage in robot treated sections to be 1. 5 %, compared to 37 % in the control areas not treated by the robot—a reduction in excess of 90 % in weed coverage...|$|R
