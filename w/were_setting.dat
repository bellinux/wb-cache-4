5|$|Cagney {{announced}} in March 1942 {{that his brother}} William and he <b>were</b> <b>setting</b> up Cagney Productions to release films though United Artists. Free of Warner Bros. again, Cagney spent some time relaxing on his farm in Martha's Vineyard before volunteering to join the USO. He spent several weeks touring the US, entertaining troops with vaudeville routines and scenes from Yankee Doodle Dandy. In September 1942, he {{was elected president of}} the Screen Actors Guild.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, General Walton Walker, {{in command}} of the Eighth Army, {{dispatched}} part of the 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th US Infantry Division, to attack north from the 25th Division's zone to drive off 4th North Korean Division troops moving into Yongsan. Simultaneously, Church assembled all the combat service support soldiers he could and formed them into a combat unit to block further penetration of North Korean forces, which <b>were</b> <b>setting</b> up roadblocks on the roads from Yongsan.|$|E
5|$|The Ptolemaic dynasty had {{initiated}} Greco-Roman {{maritime trade}} contact with India using the Red Sea ports. The Roman historian Strabo mentions a vast increase in trade following the Roman annexation of Egypt, indicating that monsoon was known and manipulated for trade in his time. By {{the time of}} Augustus up to 120 ships <b>were</b> <b>setting</b> sail every year from Myos Hormos to India, trading in a diverse variety of goods. Arsinoe, Berenice Troglodytica and Myos Hormos were the principal Roman ports involved in this maritime trading network, while the Indian ports included Barbaricum, Barygaza, Muziris and Arikamedu.|$|E

5|$|On August 22 & 23, 1869, Carpenter {{and other}} troopers became {{involved}} in a fierce attack by Kiowa and Naconee Indians, who were focused on destroying the buildings and settlement on the Anadarko Reservation. Carpenter, with Troops H and L, patrolled the area aggressively and engaged several groups of warriors who <b>were</b> <b>setting</b> prairie fires upwind of the settlement at different points. Further and increasingly violent assaults {{were made by the}} Native Americans, in numbers ranging from 50 to 500 at different points of the defensive lines. The decisive feature of the engagement was a charge made by Captain Carpenter's troopers. His men routed a body of over 150 warriors, who were about to take up a commanding position in rear of other defenders. On June 5, 1872, the 10th left Fort Sill to elements of the 3rd Infantry and proceeded back to Fort Gibson.|$|E
5|$|On June 18, 860, at sunset, a {{fleet of}} about 200 Rus' vessels sailed into the Bosporus and started pillaging the suburbs of Constantinople (Old East Slavic: Tsarigrad, Old Norse: Miklagarðr). The attackers <b>were</b> <b>setting</b> homes on fire and {{drowning}} and stabbing the residents. Unable {{to do anything to}} repel the invaders, Patriarch Photius urged his flock to implore the Theotokos to save the city. Having devastated the suburbs, the Rus' passed into the Sea of Marmora and fell upon the Isles of the Princes, where the former Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople was in exile at the time. The Rus' plundered the dwellings and the monasteries, slaughtering the captives. They took twenty-two of the patriarch's servants aboard ship and cut them into pieces with axes.|$|E
5|$|The players' union became bolder {{under the}} {{leadership}} of former United Steelworkers chief economist and negotiator Marvin Miller, who was elected executive director in 1966. On the playing field, major league pitchers were becoming increasingly dominant again. After the 1968 season, in an effort to restore balance, the strike zone was reduced and the height of the pitcher's mound was lowered from 15 to 10 inches (38.1 - 25.4cm). In 1969, both the National and American Leagues added two more expansion teams, the leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, and a post-season playoff system leading to the World Series was instituted. Also that same year, Curt Flood of the St. Louis Cardinals made the first serious legal challenge to the reserve clause. The major leagues' first general players' strike took place in 1972, delaying the season's start for two weeks. In another effort to add more offense to the game, the American League adopted the designated hitter rule the following year. In 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system. In 1977, two more expansion teams joined the American League. Significant work stoppages occurred again in 1981 and 1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series {{for the first time in}} 90 years. Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors <b>were</b> <b>setting</b> their all-time record for per-game attendance.|$|E

25|$|When Anangu {{began their}} {{struggle}} for land rights in 1976, very little prospecting was being conducted at Mintabie.

25|$|A {{second major}} cost lay in play scripts. In the years around 1600, playwrights could be paid {{as little as}} £6 to £7 per play (or {{about the price of}} two suits). Yet since the {{companies}} acted a constantly changing repertory, they needed an abundant supply of plays. Philip Henslowe's Diary records dozens of titles for the 15971603 period; when Worcester's Men <b>were</b> <b>setting</b> up for their first London season in 1602, they purchased a dozen new plays from Henslowe's stable of house playwrights, to supplement their existing stock.|$|E
25|$|The new {{commission}} ordered Mayor Wood to disband the Municipal {{police and}} turn over its property to the Metropolitans. Wood refused, however, {{even after the}} State Supreme Court upheld, in May 1857, the law establishing the commission. Wood called upon the Municipals to support him; when this was put to a vote, 15 police captains and 800 patrolmen under Police Superintendent George Washington Matsell chose to support the mayor. The remaining members, among them Captain George W. Walling, chose {{to comply with the}} state law and joined the Metropolitans. While the Metropolitans <b>were</b> <b>setting</b> up their new headquarters on White Street, Mayor Wood quickly filled the Municipal positions left vacant.|$|E
25|$|Maritime {{relations}} {{across the}} Indian Ocean {{started in the}} 3rd century BC, and further developed {{during the time of}} the Indo-Greeks together with their territorial expansion along the western coast of India. The first contacts started when the Ptolemies constructed the Red Sea ports of Myos Hormos and Berenike, with destination the Indus delta, the Kathiawar peninsula or Muziris. Around 130 BC, Eudoxus of Cyzicus is reported (Strabo, Geog. II.3.4) to have made a successful voyage to India and returned with a cargo of perfumes and gemstones. By the time Indo-Greek rule was ending, up to 120 ships <b>were</b> <b>setting</b> sail every year from Myos Hormos to India (Strabo Geog. II.5.12).|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the second}} and third planes <b>were</b> <b>setting</b> up for their attack. Tatum drove one of them off with gunfire, but the other pilot {{continued}} on toward the ship until a hail of gunfire caused him to lose control of his aircraft. He banked sharply to the right, passed by Tatums port side, and splashed about 100yards astern. Within seconds, his cautious comrade renewed his attack. He dove on the fast transport, barely missing the port wing of her bridge, and Tatums antiaircraft fire followed him up as he climbed, did a wing-over, and prepared to come in again. His third and final attack carried him across the ship's fantail and into the water about 50feet from her starboard quarter.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, Sir Ernest Shackleton tasked Aurora to {{help set}} up supply depots {{along the route}} for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. After being delayed by sea ice in McMurdo Sound in January 1915, Aurora managed to make her way further south, and sent teams off {{to set up the}} depots. Eventually she made her way to Discovery Bay on 12 March 1915, where she {{anchored}} and continued to offload supplies. In May, Aurora was trapped in the ice, and was carried out to the sea, stranding the men that <b>were</b> <b>setting</b> up the depots. She remained trapped in the ice {{for the better part of}} a year, drifting some 1600 nautical miles. It was not until 12 February 1916 that the ship escaped from the ice, making it back to Dunedin, New Zealand on 3 April.|$|E
25|$|Marianne Vos {{signaled}} {{her presence}} {{right after the}} start, as she attacked during the first kilometer but was caught soon after. The pace was high from the beginning, and the first climb saw some riders struggling already. In front of the peloton, the Polish and Lithuanian riders <b>were</b> <b>setting</b> the pace, as well as Rebecca Much from the United States who was present in front during the whole race. The first lap was completed after {{a bit more than}} 26 minutes, with the peloton still together. Climbing the Torricelle for the second time, the race got a little more nervous with some attacks, but the leading riders from Italy, Germany and East-European countries controlled the pace. Another rider in front was Amanda Spratt from Australia, who closed the gap to a Polish rider's attack. The field slowly diminished in number, as some struggled to keep up and the first riders abandoned. After passing the finish line for the second time, {{at the foot of the}} Torricelle climb, Spratt crashed inside the bunch, but got up quickly again, made it back to the front and even attacked soon after that. The Italian riders were paying attention and pulled her back. Instead, Francesca Andina and Savrina Bernardi escaped, but were caught by the leading bunch under control of the Ukrainian riders. Spratt was relentless in her efforts, but could not create a gap on her own. With two laps to go the Italian Savrina Bernardi set the pace in the climb and the only riders able to follow were Spratt and Ekaterina Tretiakova from Russia, until a chase group of about 15 joined them on the descent. For the final lap, another group of 15 joined them making a field of about 30 riders, half of the peloton, that rode the decisive phase of the race. The Italian and Dutch teams attacked each other on the last climb, but no break attempt was as powerful as the one by Vos. She took off and nobody could follow. Increasing her lead rapidly, it was about 20 seconds on top of the Torricelle climb, and the chase group down the descent had three other Dutch riders in it, not helping it much. Rebecca Much from the United States was leading the group on her own, and during the last kilometres it became apparent that Vos would take her solo to the finish. The other Dutch riders therefore did not hold back any more and managed to place a second rider on the podium, Ellen van Dijk, who crossed the line right after Marta Bastianelli from Italy.|$|E
