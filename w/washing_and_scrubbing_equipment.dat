The close spacing of the plates can make thorough cleaning difficult, and the stack of plates often cannot be easily disassembled for cleaning. One solution, suggested by several manufacturers, is to wash the collector plates in a dishwasher.|$|R

50|$|Men {{and women}} were {{traditionally}} assigned different jobs during the slaughter. It was commonly {{the men who were}} doing the actual slaughter, the larger part of butchering, and the grinding of meat. Because the society is traditionally patriarchal, the women were in charge of a relatively menial tasks, such as waiting and cooking for the whole crew throughout the event, keeping the environment clean (<b>washing</b> <b>and</b> <b>scrubbing),</b> as well as the emptying the pigs' bowels in order to make them suitable for holding sausage meat.|$|R

50|$|Preventative action {{revolves}} around personal hygiene and the cleanliness {{of the living}} quarters. The rate of reinfection can be reduced through hygienic measures, and this is recommended especially in recurring cases.The main measures are keeping fingernails short, <b>and</b> <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> <b>scrubbing</b> hands <b>and</b> fingers carefully, especially after defecation and before meals. Under ideal conditions, bed covers, sleeping garments, and hand towels should be changed daily. Simple laundering of clothes and linen disinfects them. Children should wear gloves while asleep, and the bedroom floor should be kept clean. Food should be covered to limit contamination with dust-borne parasite eggs. Household detergents have {{little effect on the}} viability of pinworm eggs, and cleaning the bathroom with a damp cloth moistened with an antibacterial agent or bleach will merely spread the still-viable eggs. Similarly, shaking clothes and bed linen will detach and spread the eggs.|$|R
60|$|Well, I {{came out}} here to Carleton, and from the time I got here I was {{perfectly}} happy. John Henry had a little rented house, and he was as poor as a church mouse, being the ne'er-do-well of our family, and the best loved, as ne'er-do-wells are so apt to be. He'd nearly died of lonesomeness since his wife's death, {{and he was so}} glad to see me. That was delightful in itself, and I was just in my element getting that little house fixed up cosy and homelike, and cooking the most elegant meals. There wasn't much work to do, just for me and him, and I got a squaw in to <b>wash</b> <b>and</b> <b>scrub.</b> I never thought about Northfield except to thank goodness I'd escaped from it, and John Henry and I were as happy as a king and queen.|$|R

Their khaki suits had been <b>washed</b> <b>and</b> <b>scrubbed</b> until, though discoloured, they were scrupulously clean. The belts, accoutrements, and rifles had all been rubbed up and scoured. On the other hand, the uniforms of regiments that marched in were travel-stained, begrimed with the dust of battle and the mud of bivouac, until their original hue had entirely disappeared. They looked as if they had at first been dragged through thorn bushes and then been given a mud-bath.|$|R

The site chosen for the house is on elevated ground two miles north of Wicklow Town, overlooking Broadlough Bird Sanctuary and the Irish Sea. There was however no source of fresh water. A stream about a half mile away and 150ft lower was found and a leather ram pump was built to feed three 1,000 gallon tanks in the roof of Tinakilly. In later years even the local council water was unsatisfactory and a 300ft well was sunk to guarantee a sure supply.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{study was}} aimed to provide {{information}} on the decontamination of sediments polluted with heavy metals by soil <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> attrition scrubber techniques, assessing the efficiency of a prototype machinery {{for the improvement of}} sediment quality dredged in the Ravenna Harbor (Italy). An additional purpose was to compare the heavy metal distribution in sediment fractions collected after these treatments. Materials and methods: Textural and geochemical characteristics were determined in bulk sediments and after the treatments of soil <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> attrition <b>scrubbing</b> by a smaller scale prototype. Statistical analyses were carried out to verify the heavy metal correlations at each step of the treatments. Results and discussion: Textural features after treatments showed moderate separation of sand and silt/clay fractions after soil <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> an increase of the fine fractions after attrition scrubbing. Bulk sediments polluted by arsenic (As) were decontaminated after treatments. Concerning heavy metals, mercury was concentrated in the sand while aluminum, As, cadmium, chrome, iron, manganese, zinc, and vanadium were concentrated in the silt/clay fraction. Bivariate plots showed a significant correlation of heavy metals with sand percentage after soil <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> attrition <b>scrubbing.</b> Conclusions: The results suggest that heavy metal concentrations were significantly affected by grain size distribution. Soil washing resulted in the complete decontamination of As in the sediments. The heavy metal concentration was altered in each step of the treatments according to three different trends. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer NatureThe study was co-funded by LIFE SEDI.

40|$|The central {{concept of}} {{this letter is}} to develop an assistive {{manipulator}} that can automate the bathing task for elderly citizens. We propose to exploit principles of soft robotic technologies to design and control a compliant system to ensure safe human-robot interaction, a primary requirement for the task. The overall system {{is intended to be}} modular with a proximal segment that provides structural integrity to overcome gravitational challenges and a distal segment to perform the main bathing activities. The focus of this letter is on the design and control of the latter module. The design comprises of alternating tendons and pneumatics in a radial arrangement, which enables elongation, contraction, and omnidirectional bending. Additionally, a synergetic coactivation of cables and tendons in a given configuration allows for stiffness modulation, which is necessary to facilitate <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> <b>scrubbing.</b> The novelty of the work is twofold: 1) Three base cases of antagonistic actuation are identified that enable stiffness variation. Each category is then experimentally characterized by the application of an external force that imposes a linear displacement at the tip in both axial and lateral directions. 2) The development of a novel algorithm based on cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning that simultaneously optimizes stiffness and position. The results highlight the effectiveness of the design and control to contribute toward the development of the assistive device...|$|R

30|$|Thirty regular {{domestic}} {{consumers of}} mussel were randomly recruited by email from AZTI’s database. They were segmented by gender (50 % men) and age range (18 – 70  years). To remove debris and any remaining byssal thread, 150 mussels were <b>washed</b> <b>and</b> <b>scrubbed</b> for the sensory analysis. Samples were steamed at 100  ±  1  °C for 1  min and then served at 65  ±  1  °C. Mussels {{were presented to}} consumers on white plastic plates labeled with 3 -digit random numbers, containing two mussels from each origin (experimental from open ocean and commercial from Galician Rías). Consumers tasted one mussel from each origin. The consumers received oral and written instructions and were provided with water and unsalted-crisp bread for palate cleansing after each tasting. Each consumer tasted the samples in randomized order and evaluated five attributes (appearance, odor, taste, texture, and global acceptance) with a structured 9 -point scale ranging from 1 (equivalent to I dislike it very much) to 9 (equivalent to I like it very much). The 9 -point hedonic scale (Peryam and Girardot 1952; Peryam and Pilgrim 1957) is {{the most commonly used}} scale for testing consumer preference and acceptability of foods (Schutz and Cardelo 2001). This kind of scales produce central tendency effects on panelist, which reduces the options to a 7 -point scale (Villanueva et al. 2005). Despite this possible reduction, a 9 -point scale with an arithmetic adjustment can always be straightforward re-scaled to a 7 -point scale (Epler et al. 1998). This enables the comparisons with different scale formats with less response options (Dawes 2012), which are common in current scientific literature. Consumers’ purchase intention was also assessed with a structured 5 -point scale ranging from 1 (equivalent to I would not buy it) to 5 (equivalent to I will buy it). The same test was repeated three times with each panelist. Consumers tasting was performed in the sensory laboratory of AZTI- Tecnalia specifically designed according to ISO 8587 : 2006.|$|R
