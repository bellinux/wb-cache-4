5|$|The racial {{segregation}} of local schools {{meant that the}} nearest white school was several miles away; Bakshi obtained his mother's permission to attend the nearby black school with his friends. Bakshi was the only <b>white</b> <b>student</b> in the classroom. Most {{of the students had}} no problem with Bakshi's presence, but a teacher sought advice from the principal, who called the police. Fearing that segregated whites would riot if they learned that a <b>white</b> <b>student</b> was attending a black school, the police removed Bakshi from his classroom. Meanwhile, his father had been suffering from anxiety attacks. Within a few months, the family moved back to Brownsville, where they rarely spoke of these events.|$|E
5|$|The Jena Six {{were six}} black {{teenagers}} in Jena, Louisiana, {{convicted in the}} 2006 beating of Justin Barker, a <b>white</b> <b>student</b> at the local Jena High School, which they also attended.

While the case was pending, it was often cited by some media commentators as an example of racial injustice in the United States. Some commentators believed that the defendants had been charged initially with too-serious offenses and had been treated unfairly.|$|E
5|$|Failing to {{find another}} job at a news agency, he met {{producer}} Allan Burns at a party. Burns got him a job on My Mother the Car where he was hired to rewrite a script after pitching some story ideas. Brooks {{then went on to}} write episodes of That Girl, The Andy Griffith Show and My Three Sons before Sheldon Leonard hired him as a story editor on My Friend Tony. In 1969 he created for ABC the series Room 222, which lasted until 1974. Room 222 was the second series in American history to feature a black lead character, in this case high school teacher Pete Dixon played by Lloyd Haynes. The network felt the show was sensitive and so attempted to change the pilot story so that Dixon helped a <b>white</b> <b>student</b> rather than a black one, but Brooks prevented it. On the show Brooks worked with Gene Reynolds who taught him the importance of extensive and diligent research, which he conducted at Los Angeles High School for Room 222, and he used the technique on his subsequent works. Brooks left Room 222 as head writer after one year to work on other pilots and brought Burns in to produce the show.|$|E
50|$|In eighth grade, <b>white</b> <b>students</b> {{also have}} an initial {{advantage}} over black and Hispanic students in math tests. However, Asian students have an initial 2.71 point advantage over <b>white</b> <b>students</b> and keep pace with <b>white</b> <b>students</b> throughout high school. Between eighth and tenth grade, black students and Hispanic students make slower gains in math than <b>white</b> <b>students,</b> and black students fall farthest behind. Asian students gain 2.71 points more than <b>white</b> <b>students</b> between eight and tenth grade. Some of these differences in gains persist later in high school. For example, between tenth and twelfth grades, <b>white</b> <b>students</b> gain more than black students, and Asian students gain more than <b>white</b> <b>students.</b> There are {{no significant differences in}} math gains between <b>white</b> <b>students</b> and Hispanic students. By the end of high school, gaps between groups increase slightly. Specifically, the initial 9-point advantage of <b>white</b> <b>students</b> over black students increases by about a point, and the initial advantage of Asian <b>students</b> over <b>white</b> <b>students</b> also increases by about a point. Essentially, by the end of high school, Asian students are beginning to learn intermediate-level math concepts, whereas black and Hispanic students are far behind, learning fractions and decimals, which are math concepts that the <b>white</b> and Asian <b>students</b> learned in the eighth grade. Black and Hispanic students end twelfth grade with scores 11 and 7 points behind those of <b>white</b> <b>students,</b> while the male-female difference in math scores is only around 2 points.|$|R
50|$|In a 2006 study, LoGerfo, Nichols, and Reardon (2006) found that, {{starting}} in the eighth grade, <b>white</b> <b>students</b> have an initial advantage in reading achievement over black and Hispanic students but not Asian students. Using nationally representative data from by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)—the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) and the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88), LoGerfo, Nichols, and Reardon (2006) claim that black students score 5.49 points lower than <b>white</b> <b>students</b> and Hispanic students score 4.83 points lower than <b>white</b> <b>students</b> on reading tests. These differences in initial status are compounded by differences in reading gains made during high school. Specifically, between ninth and tenth grades, <b>white</b> <b>students</b> gain slightly more than black students and Hispanic <b>students,</b> but <b>white</b> <b>students</b> gain less than Asian students. Between tenth and twelfth grades, <b>white</b> <b>students</b> gain at a slightly faster rate than black <b>students,</b> but <b>white</b> <b>students</b> gain at a slower rate than Hispanic students and Asian students.|$|R

Of that number, 700 were African Americans. The HISD student body had white students as the largest group until the 1972-1973 school year, when the largest group became the black students. The <b>white</b> <b>student</b> body decreased, while the Hispanic student body increased and became HISD's largest student demographic in the 1989-1990 school year. In 1975 the student body was 39% White and 19% Hispanic. In 1981 the district had 190,000 students; 31% of the district's students were Hispanic, and 21% were White. In 1990 the student body was 43% Hispanic, 40% Black, and 15% White. At the time 45% of HISD schools had no white students.

Powell offered the example (set out in an appendix) of the admissions program at Harvard University as one he believed would pass constitutional muster—that institution did not set rigid quotas for minorities, but actively recruited them and sought to include them as more than a token part of a racially and culturally diverse student body. Although a <b>white</b> <b>student</b> might still lose out to a minority with lesser academic qualifications, both white and minority students might gain from non-objective factors such as the ability to play sports or a musical instrument.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study investigates {{the ways in}} which <b>White</b> college <b>students</b> make sense of meritocracy in relation to racial inequality in the contemporary United States. Through in-depth individual interviews and qualitative methods of analysis, participants reveal their beliefs about how people achieve success in the U. S., their explanations of the economic disparity between Black and White Americans, and their perspectives on meritocracy in contemporary U. S. society. ^ Twenty traditionally-aged <b>White</b> undergraduate college <b>students</b> at a large public University in the Northeast took part in the study. The sample was stratified by gender, year in school and engagement with issues of racism. <b>White</b> <b>students</b> who had experience with issues of racism through academic courses, or who had taken active roles in student organizations that addressed racism were identified as “engaged. ” <b>White</b> <b>students</b> who had not been actively involved in such courses or co-curricular activities were identified as “not-engaged. ” ^ Based on their gender or year in school, there were no differences in <b>White</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 perspectives on either meritocracy or racial inequality. Prior engagement with racism, however, was strongly related to striking differences in <b>White</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 perspectives on meritocracy and their explanations for racial inequality. Engaged <b>White</b> <b>students</b> were much more likely than not-engaged <b>White</b> <b>students</b> to espouse a structuralist stratification perspective about both success and racial inequality, and to assert that the United States is not a meritocracy. Most of the not-engaged <b>White</b> <b>students</b> relied on individualist explanations for both the achievement of success and the causes of racial inequality. Of particular note is the way that many not-engaged <b>White</b> <b>students</b> seemed to be involved in a cognitive juggling act, trying to work with the contradictions between their ideology of meritocracy and their awareness of racial discrimination. ^ The findings raise implications about the role that merit and racial ideology play in forming <b>White</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 understanding of individual achievement and racial inequality in the United States. The study includes suggestions for new ways of conceptualizing anti-racism teaching to emphasize the role of meritocratic ideology and it suggests future research on developmental processes that may challenge traditionally-aged <b>White</b> undergraduate college <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 reliance on merit ideology. ...|$|R
