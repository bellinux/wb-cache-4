40|$|Solid waste {{management}} (SWM) {{is one of}} the major reasons of environmental degradation in Pakistan. Inappropriate management of solid waste causes hazards to dwellers. Recent literature on current SWM practices in five major cities of Pakistan has been reviewed, and an effort has been made to provide a comprehensive review on the total amount of municipal solid waste generated, storage, collection, physical composition, transfer, processing and disposal of SW. There is an overall fragmented approach to the SWM in Pakistan. Inadequate waste collection system exists as it is collected only 51 - 69 % of the total waste generated in a few major cities. Municipal collection of household waste is quite irregular and limited to high-income areas. Generally, inadequate disposal service and no <b>weighing</b> <b>facilities</b> are installed at most of the disposal sites. There is a poor management of hazardous waste and under the current disposal practice no proper method is being employed. The review of the legal framework indicates that there is a need for detailed and clear regulations dealing specifically with solid waste. In addition, promotion of public awareness, legislation, financial and economic calculations, strengthen institutional capacity and regulations enforcement and establishment of a proper sanitary landfill are considered to be principal remedial measures to ensure sound environmental maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Background & objectives: Foot {{length of}} the newborn has a good {{correlation}} with the birth weight and is recommended {{to be used as}} a proxy measure. There can be variations in the measurement of foot length. A study was, therefore, carried out to develop a foot length calliper for accurate foot length measurement and to find cut-off values for birth weight and gestational age groups to be used by primary healthcare workers. Methods: This study was undertaken on 645 apparently healthy newborn infants with known gestational age. Nude birth weight was taken within 24 h of birth on a standard electronic weighing machine. A foot length calliper was developed. Correlation between foot length and birth weight as well as gestational age was calculated. Correctness of cut-off values was tested using another set of 133 observations on the apparently healthy newborns. Action-oriented colour coding was done to make it easy for primary healthcare workers to use it. Results: There was a significant correlation of foot length with birth weight (r= 0. 75) and gestational age (r= 0. 63). Cut-off values for birth weight groups were 6. 1, 6. 8 and 7. 3 cm and for gestational age of 6. 1, 6. 8 and 7. 0 cm. Correctness of these cut-off values ranged between 77. 1 and 95. 7 per cent for birth weight and 60 - 93. 3 per cent for gestational age. Considering 2. 5 kg as cut-off between normal birth weight and low birth weight (LBW), cut-off values of 6. 1, 6. 8 and 7. 3 were chosen. Action-oriented colour coding was done by superimposing the colours on the scale of the calliper, green indicating home care, yellow indicating supervised home care, orange indicating care at newborn care units at primary health centres and red indicating Neonatal Intensive Care Unit care for infants. Interpretation & conclusions: A simple device was developed so that the primary health care workers and trained Accredited Social Health Activist workers can identify the risk of LBW in the absence of accurate <b>weighing</b> <b>facilities</b> and decide on the type of care needed by the newborn and take action accordingly...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} concern {{in recent years}} {{regarding}} the efficiency of marketing of fruits and vegetables, {{and that this is}} leading to high and fluctuating consumer prices and only a small share of the consumer rupee reaching the farmers. Marketing of horticultural crops is complex especially because of perishability, seasonality and bulkiness. The study seeks to examine different aspects of their marketing, focusing particularly, on the wholesale markets for fruits and vegetables which have been established to overcome deficiencies and improve the marketing efficiency. Results indicate that in Ahmedabad the direct contact between commission agents and farmers is very low. For vegetables this is 50 percent and for fruits only 31 percent. Further, in the system of transaction, secret bidding and simple transaction dominate and open auction is relatively rare. In KFWVM, Chennai, the wholesalers act as commission agents and receive consignments directly from producing centers through agents or producers. By and large the system of transaction remains traditional and open auction is rarely seen. This is one major reason for poor efficiency. However, in the small AUS market in Chennai, the farmers sell directly to consumers. The share of farmers in the consumer rupee in Ahmedabad was 41. 1 to 69. 3 percent for vegetables and 25. 5 to 53. 2 percent for fruits. In Chennai KFWVM, the farmers share was 40. 4 to 61. 4 percent for vegetables and, 40. 7 to 67. 6 percent for fruits. In the small AUS market in Chennai, where the farmers sell directly to the consumers, the share of farmers was as high as 85 to 95. 4 percent for vegetables. This indicates that if there are few or no middlemen, the farmers’ share could be much higher. In the Kolkata market the share of farmers ranged from 45. 9 to 60. 94 percent for vegetables and 55. 8 to 82. 3 percent for fruits. Thus, the shares are frequently very low, but somewhat better in Chennai, lower in Kolkata and even lower in Ahmedabad. The margin as a percentage of farmer-consumer price difference (an efficiency measure) shows that in Ahmedabad, the margins are very high and range from 69 to 94 percent. In Chennai they range from 15 to 69 percent, and in Kolkata they range from 46 to 73 percent. The high percentage of margin to farmer-consumer price difference is indicative of large inefficiencies and relatively poor marketing efficiency. There is great need to improve the marketing of fruits and vegetables. One important measure would be to bring more markets under regulation and supervision of a well-represented market committee. Another measure would be the promotion and perhaps enforcement of open auctions in the markets. Yet another measure could be efforts to bring more buyers and sellers into the markets, bringing them closer to perfect markets. The direct participation of farmers should be increased. Market infrastructure should be improved through storage (go-down) facilities, cold storages, loading and <b>weighing</b> <b>facilities.</b> Improvement in the road network, and cold-chain facilities are also of substantial importance. Greater transparency of the operations through supervision and systems can also help substantially. The market integration and efficiency can also be improved by making up-to-date market information available to all participants through various means, including a good market information systems, internet and good telecommunications facilities at the markets. ...|$|E

40|$|Trickle {{irrigation}} is {{the most}} efficient method of irrigating peach orchards in Texas. With a trickle irrigation system, a producer may make full use of a limited or low-volume water supply to apply precise amounts of water to the root zones of individual trees. Improved irrigation scheduling methods offer the potential for further savings in water and energy to pressurize the water since peach trees require less than a fully-watered state for production. This report describes research to determine the crop coefficients for peach trees {{that would result in}} an optimum irrigation schedule. One major effort evaluated the physiological response of the peach tree to varying irrigation regimes. This thrust indicated that a crop coefficient as low as 0. 53 produced similar physiological responses (leaf water potential, leaf resistance, and transpiration rate) as a crop coefficient of 0. 7. The critical period for initiation of stress was during the period before harvest. A large twin <b>weighing</b> lysimeter <b>facility</b> was designed and installed. Preliminary results for mature peach trees showed water use rates at the maximum evapotranspiration rate approached a crop coefficient of 1. 0. The research indicates that the peach tree is a luxury consumer of water; improved irrigation scheduling is achievable...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a research study conducted to investigate the structural performance of a 275 mm hot mix asphalt perpetual pavement constructed as part of the WIM bypass lane at the Kenosha Safety 2 ̆ 6 <b>Weigh</b> Station <b>Facility.</b> Two separate test sections were constructed using variable binder types and in-place air voids. Asphalt strain sensors were fabricated at Marquette University and installed during the construction of the HMA pavement. Sensors were positioned within the outer wheel path and located {{at the bottom of the}} 275 mm HMA pavement and at the interface between the lower layers at a depth of approximately 175 mm from the surface. Strain sensors were oriented in both the transverse and longitudinal directions. A total of 16 strain sensors were installed during construction. Of these, only three survived to provide strain data under traffic loadings. Deflection data obtained from FWD testing was used as comparative measures to strain measurements obtained during testing and to estimate the combined dynamic HMA layer moduli at the time of testing and to develop monthly trends of dynamic HMA layer moduli as a function of the expected mean monthly mid-depth pavement temperature. A comparative analysis of measured strains to those predicted from FWD measurements provided generally good agreement. A mechanistic appraisal of the constructed test sections was completed using the outputs of the EVERSTRESS pavement analysis program. This analysis computed the expected monthly damage induced by the application of 521, 000 monthly ESAL loadings. The results of the mechanistic appraisal indicate the expected service life to 50...|$|R
40|$|Semi-arid and arid environments are {{characterized}} by low precipitation and high evapotranspiration (ET), leaving little water available for discharge into surface water bodies and groundwater recharge. For these water-limited environments, understanding the relationships between precipitation, ET, and soil moisture is critical. These relationships not only affect water resources in these increasingly populated regions but are also necessary to predict the impact of climate change on semi-arid and arid ecosystems. The overall goal of this dissertation was {{to shed light on}} the quantitative relationships between precipitation, evaporation, ET and soil moisture dynamics in an arid and a semi-arid environment. A three-step approach was chosen to (i) quantify soil water fluxes and storage of bare, arid soil in weighing lysimeters, (ii) evaluate a process-based evaporation model using evaporation data from the same bare, arid soil, and (iii) monitor the soil moisture and temperature dynamics of a vegetated, semi-arid soil at a field site. The studies were carried out at two sites in Nevada: (1) The bare arid soil is part of the SEPHAS <b>weighing</b> lysimeter <b>facility,</b> located in Boulder City near Las Vegas, southern NV; (2) The vegetated semi-arid soil with a shallow water table (depth to water 3 ̆c 6 m) is located in Spring Valley near Ely, central Nevada. In a first step, precipitation, evaporation and infiltration, total soil mass and soil moisture profiles were monitored in three lysimeters over four years (water years 2009 - 2012). The results showed that 88 out of 180 precipitation events occurred during winter, but the average amount of precipitation per event was the highest during summer. Between 69...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{information}} {{flow in the}} built environment concentrates {{on the needs of}} the design and construction, rather than on the operation. This leads to inconsistencies and disruption within stages, clearly found at handover of information. It commonly hinders delivery of client’s requirements for the operation of buildings along the project development as well. A structured information delivery enabled by BIM protocols, established at project’s inception, could prevent information loss during the project development. It could as well ensure the coordinated delivery of the clients’ requirements as stated at the pre-design stage, and help anticipating the impact of clients’ decisions at early project stages on operations performance. In this paper, a methodology to obtain, categorize and <b>weigh</b> sustainability and <b>facility</b> management values with the subjective driven priorities from high level management is outlined as part of a decision support system. The latter will assist, {{in the context of a}} digital project delivery, in translating these priorities into objective parameters and information categories to include within the bidders’ BIM Execution Plans.

40|$|Hospital {{refurbishment}} {{has taken}} a secondary role in the last decade, in favour of new build facilities. This has allowed the Client and the Design Team to build and specify with greater flexibility and from essentially a 'blank canvas'. Correspondingly, sustainability as an issue has been easier to plan and implement from the earliest briefing and design stage. The changing economic landscape has necessitated that the focus has now shifted to the refurbishment of the existing healthcare estate. Refurbishment is widely recognised as presenting unique challenges in its own right. Add to this the institutional and statutory requirements {{in the arena of}} sustainability and the unique functional characteristics of an operational hospital and these challenges are increased. Given the practical and economic challenges of refurbishment as an activity, <b>weighed</b> against a <b>facility</b> as multi-faceted and complicated as a hospital, a structured and prioritised process of decision making is required. A multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach is discussed as being most suitable for this process. A pilot study of a nonrandom sample of industry experts is analysed to establish a baseline knowledge platform of the key research variables and subsequent method of selecting criteria. The overall findings establish a good awareness of sustainable development and familiarity with key documentation and guidance, however knowledge of the capital investment appraisal process and the use of MCDM tools is shown to be very limited...|$|R

40|$|Three {{goals of}} this {{research}} were: 1) to develop a field-scale research facility {{that could be used}} for conducting a variety of soil water experiments in both deep (greater than 2 meters) and near-surface soils where the soil water balance could be accurately determined; 2) to develop a transient experimental technique for calibrating time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes; and 3) to study the use of vertically-installed TDR probes for measuring near-surface soil water movement in a field setting, and to compare these measurements with those made by the weighing lysimeter. The <b>weighing</b> lysimeter <b>facility</b> consists of two lysimeter tanks, 4. 0 m deep and 2. 5 m in diameter, which rest atop a scale with a resolution of ± 200 g, equivalent to ± 0. 04 mm of water on the surface. Data collection is completely automated with a data logger and personal computer. Both lysimeters are instrumented with TDR probes, tensiometers, and pore water solution samplers; thermocouples are installed in one lysimeter for measuring temperature. The TDR probes were calibrated using a transient method known as upward infiltration. The method is rapid, allows the soil to remain unchanged during the experiment, and provides many data points. The upward infiltration method was tested using two different length probes in soils of three textures. Results show that the upward infiltration method is stable, repeatable, and provides accurate dielectric constants and calibration curves. Four, vertically-installed TDR probes of different lengths (200, 400, 600, and 800 mm) were placed in the lysimeter at ground surface to measure water added and water lost during a one-month period in the presence of daily irrigated turfgrass. The purpose of this study was to compare changes in soil water storage as measured by the TDR system, against measurements made using the weighing lysimeter. The TDR probes detected diurnal changes in water content due to irrigation and evapotranspiration, even when these amounts changed slightly from day to day. The TDR probes underestimated the measurements of both water added and water loss, as confirmed using measurements from the weighing lysimeter. The presence of a 47 -mm thick biomass above the TDR waveguides retained water that otherwise would have percolated the soil surface into the measurement domain of the probes. Addition and loss of water in the biomass were recorded by the lysimeter, but not by the TDR probes, thus explaining the underestimation. Modeling of near-surface water movement with the HYDRUS model showed very similar water movement behavior as measured by the TDR probes. This confirms our hypothesis that TDR would a useful tool for measuring diurnal changes in water content for irrigation scheduling...|$|R
