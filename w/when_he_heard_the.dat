Accordingly, he arranged for the Australian workmen there to complete it as an emergency field only and for development of the major airbase {{to be carried out}} at Plaine Des Gaiacs Airfield.

5|$|Burton hired Danny Elfman, his {{collaborator}} on Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice, {{to compose}} the music score. For inspiration, Elfman was given The Dark Knight Returns. Elfman was worried, {{as he had}} never worked on a production this large in budget and scale. In addition, producer Jon Peters was skeptical of hiring Elfman, but was later convinced <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> opening number. Peters and Peter Guber wanted Prince to write music for the Joker and Michael Jackson to do the romance songs. Elfman would then combine the style of Prince and Jackson's songs together for the entire film score.|$|E
5|$|During 6 April, the Ban (governor) of the Drava Banovina, Marko Natlačen {{met with}} representatives of the major Slovene {{political}} parties, and created the National Council of Slovenia, whose aim was to establish a Slovenia independent of Yugoslavia. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news of fifth column-led revolts within the flanking 4th Army, Trifunović was alarmed, and proposed withdrawal from the border areas, but this was rejected by Petrović. The front along the border with Italy was relatively quiet, with only patrol clashes occurring, some sporadic artillery bombardments of border fortifications, and an unsuccessful raid by the Italians on Mount Blegoš.|$|E

5|$|The {{circulation}} {{rose from}} 64,000 in 1965 to 67,000 in 1967; the modest 5% increase was exceeded only by Analog {{among the other}} science-fiction magazines, and If won the Hugo Award for best professional SF magazine three years running during this period. However, in March 1969, Robert Guinn sold all four of his magazines, including Galaxy and If, to Arnold Abramson at Universal Publishing and Distribution Corporation (UPD). Pohl was in Rio de Janeiro <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news, and decided to resign his position as editor rather than continue under the new management.

5|$|On April 4, 1968, African-American {{civil rights}} leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated by a sniper in Memphis, Tennessee. United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy was {{traveling}} to Indianapolis to promote his presidential campaign <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news. He delivered a brief, improvised speech on the matter before suspending all of his campaign activities and withdrawing to his room at the Marott Hotel. After several phone conversations with black community leaders, he decided {{to speak out against}} the violent backlash to the assassination and carry on with a scheduled appearance before the City Club of Cleveland. His aides concurred that this was the best course of action, and agreed that he should shortly thereafter go to Washington D.C. and remain there until King could be buried. Kennedy also spoke over the phone with Coretta Scott King, King's widow, in Atlanta. At her request, Kennedy directed aide Frank Mankiewicz to arrange for a plane to retrieve King's body. Since most air carriers were wary of taking up such a task, a plane was chartered from one of Kennedy's friends. John Lewis and Earl Graves, among others, were dispatched to assist Coretta Scott King. Kennedy also had three additional phone lines installed at the King residence to handle the influx of incoming calls while his staff established a phone bank at West Hunter Baptist Church in Atlanta for the King family's use.|$|E

25|$|Once more Ibn Battuta {{returned}} to Tangier, but only stayed {{for a short}} while. In 1324, two years before {{his first visit to}} Cairo, the West African Malian Mansa, or king of kings, Musa had passed through the same city on his own hajj and caused a sensation with a display of extravagant riches brought from his gold-rich homeland. Although Ibn Battuta never mentioned this visit specifically, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> story it may have planted a seed in his mind as he then decided to cross the Sahara and visit the Muslim kingdoms on its far side.|$|E

25|$|Infuriated {{that his}} orders were being defied and a golden {{opportunity}} was being lost, Bragg issued new orders for Hindman to attack early September 11. Cleburne, who was not sick as Hill had claimed, cleared the felled timber from Dug Gap and prepared to advance <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sound of Hindman's guns. By this time, however, Baird's division had reached Negley's, and Negley had withdrawn his division to a defensive position {{just east of the}} crossroads. The two Union divisions then withdrew to Stevens Gap. Hindman's men skirmished with Baird's rear guard, but could not prevent the withdrawal of the Union force.|$|E
25|$|In the legend, Afonso Henriques is visited {{before the}} battle {{by an old}} man who saw in a dream that Henriques would be victorious because God would {{intervene}} in his favour. He advised the nobleman to leave the encampment alone <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> bell of the local chapel. Riding off he was surprised by a ray of light that showed him (in one interpretation) {{the sign of the cross}} and Jesus Christ on a crucifix. Afonso Henriques knelt in its presence and heard the voice of Christ who told him he would defeat the Moors, which he, through courage and his faith, succeeded the following day.|$|E
25|$|What {{is there}} that any man desires,—any man or any woman,—that does not lose half its value when it {{is found to be}} easy of access and easy of possession? Wine is valued by its price, not its flavour. Open your doors freely to Jones and Smith, and Jones and Smith will not care to enter them. Shut your doors obdurately against the same gentlemen, and they will use all their little {{diplomacy}} to effect an entrance.

25|$|On the Ides of March (15 March; see Roman calendar) of 44 BC, Caesar was due {{to appear}} at a session of the Senate. Several Senators had conspired to assassinate Caesar. Mark Antony, having vaguely learned of the plot the night before from a terrified liberator named Servilius Casca, and fearing the worst, went to head Caesar off. The plotters, however, had {{anticipated}} this and, fearing that Antony would come to Caesar's aid, had arranged for Trebonius to intercept him just {{as he approached the}} portico of the Theatre of Pompey, where the session was to be held, and detain him outside. (Plutarch, however, assigns this action to delay Antony to Brutus Albinus.) <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> commotion from the Senate chamber, Antony fled.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the close}} {{resemblance}} {{of his voice}} to the legendary singer Mukesh (Mukesh Chand Mathur), Babla began his career recording covers of Mukesh songs for T-Series. Then one day, in 1990, seminal Indian film composer R.D. Burman was passing through Khar, Mumbai, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> song ‘Sajan re jhoothmut bolo’ blaring from an audio cassette shop. Burman commented on how well Mukesh had sung the song, {{and was surprised to}} learn it was not Mukesh, but the voice of Babla coming from the shop. He was so impressed he contacted Babla and asked to meet him the very next day. Then Pancham Da took Babla under his wing, and he became a regular singer in Pancham Da’s live shows. Unfortunately, Puncham Da’s failing health delayed his film music debut.|$|E
25|$|The French {{victory in}} the Battle of Montenotte was {{completed}} on 12 April when French commander Napoleon Bonaparte concentrated about 25,000 troops near Carcare. To oppose them, Argenteau's division only had 9,000 scattered men and Giovanni Marchese di Provera was nearby with 2,000 more. Bonaparte directed Laharpe with 7,000 French troops to attack from Monte Negino while Masséna with 4,000 advanced from the south. After the defeat on the 12th, Argenteau frankly reported to Beaulieu that he was beaten and only had 700 men left. Having missed the day's combat, Rukavina was in Dego <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> bad news. On the morning of 14 April, he relinquished command of Dego because of his injury and retired to Acqui Terme, missing the Second Battle of Dego which began later that day.|$|E

25|$|The en echelon attack {{continued}} with Anderson's {{division in the}} center. At about 2:45p.m., {{the same time that}} Maney's first attack was being repulsed on the Open Knob, the brigade of Col. Thomas M. Jones began its attack across a valley commanded by a large sinkhole. Jones had no orders to attack from Anderson or Hardee, but moved forward on his own initiative <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sound of firing to his right. As they entered the valley, his men were cut down by musketry and fire from twelve artillery pieces on the next ridge, where the Union 9th Brigade (Rousseau's division) under Col. Leonard A. Harris was posted. Confederate artillery attached to Jones's brigade, Capt. Charles Lumsden's Alabama Light Artillery, returned fire, but due to an optical illusion that made two successive ridges look the same, were unable to fix on the appropriate range and their fire had no effect on the Federal line. At 3:30p.m., the Confederate brigade of Brig. Gen. John C. Brown moved up {{to take the place of}} Jones's retreating men. By this time, most of the Union artillery had had to withdraw to replenish their ammunition, so Brown's men did not suffer the same fate as Jones's. Nevertheless, they made no headway against the infantry units in place until successes on the Confederate left put pressure on the Union position.|$|E
25|$|In 1926 {{he reached}} {{the quarterfinals of the}} French International Hard Court Championship partnering Béla von Kehrling; they were {{defeated}} by eventual victors Howard Kinsey and Vincent Richards. Also in 1926 he won the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club of Berlin tournament, a victory which caused a major scandal. Count Salm threw derogatory verbal abuses to his 18-old opponent Herman Wetzel, who had enough and walked off the court in the second set. The judges overruled the first decision and awarded the match to Salm, reasoning that Wetzel had voluntarily left the court. It was the second time within a year that Salm's misbehavior stirred international controversy and as a result an official ban was requested on the Austrian to deny him access to tournaments. On another occasion in 1928, while he was participating in the mixed doubles at Cannes, he drew attention when he walked off the court in outrage during a match after a ball flew in from outside, distracting him so that he lost the point. He came back <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> laughter of the spectators. His partner, Blanche Gladys Duddell, wife of Edward Murray Colston, 2nd Baron Roundway, was also upset by the count's actions and her husband officially protested during this interruption to ensure that the rules prevented the count from leaving the court again.|$|E
25|$|President Buchanan was {{surprised}} and dismayed at Anderson's move to Sumter, unaware of the authorization Anderson had received. Nevertheless, he refused Pickens's demand to evacuate Charleston harbor. Since the garrison's supplies were limited, Buchanan authorized a relief expedition of supplies, small arms, and 200 soldiers. The original intent was to send the Navy sloop-of-war USS Brooklyn, but {{it was discovered that}} Confederates had sunk some derelict ships to block the shipping channel into Charleston and there was concern that Brooklyn had too deep a draft to negotiate the obstacles. Instead, it seemed prudent to send an unarmed civilian merchant ship, Star of the West, which might be perceived as less provocative to the Confederates. As Star of the West approached the harbor entrance on January 9, 1861, it was fired upon by a battery on Morris Island, which was staffed by cadets from The Citadel, among them William Stewart Simkins, who were the only trained artillerymen in the service of South Carolina at the time. Batteries from Fort Moultrie joined in and Star of the West was forced to withdraw. Major Anderson prepared his guns at Sumter <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> Confederate fire, but the secrecy of the operation had kept him unaware that a relief expedition was in progress and he chose not to start a general engagement.|$|E
