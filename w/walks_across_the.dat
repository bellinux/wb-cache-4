5|$|When Bart {{finds out}} her secret and reveals {{it to the}} school, her social ranking plummets to a new low until a psychic force tells Lady Gaga that Lisa needs her help immediately. After much soul searching and yelling at Lady Gaga for trying to help, Lisa realizes that her {{outburst}} helped her because she is finally expressing her anger instead of bottling it up inside her, in effect making Lady Gaga's mission successful. Lisa catches Lady Gaga just before she leaves town to apologize, and after being forgiven she and Lady Gaga perform a duet together. With Lady Gaga's assistance, Lisa and the entire town of Springfield realize that being oneself is better than being like anyone else. Just as Lady Gaga's train begins to leave again, Moe runs {{up to her and}} asks if she can help him as well, but Lady Gaga declines, stating that she's not that good. As Moe turns and <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> train track, a second train hits him.|$|E
25|$|Gwynplaine renounces his peerage and {{travels to}} find Ursus and Dea. He is nearly driven to suicide {{when he is}} unable to find them. Learning that they are to be deported, he locates their ship and reunites with them. Dea is ecstatic, but {{abruptly}} dies. Ursus faints. Gwynplaine, as though in a trance, <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> deck while speaking to the dead Dea, and throws himself overboard. When Ursus recovers, he finds Homo sitting at the ship's rail, howling at the sea.|$|E
500|$|Back in Oak Brook, Mulder has {{followed}} Pincus {{to the house}} of VinylRight employee Gretchen Starns. [...] Mulder looks through the window and sees the monster leaning over the woman as she watches TV. [...] Mulder breaks the window and then kicks in the door. Inside the house he sees that Starns has been transformed into a zombie. Behind him, out of his sight, the monster <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> ceiling. Mulder catches a glimpse of it crawling up the outside of the house. Later at the FBI office, Starns and Pincus complain to A.D. Skinner about Mulder's behavior. Mulder, seeing Pincus begin to transform into the creature again, draws his weapon. He is restrained by a disbelieving Skinner and then sedated in a hospital.|$|E

500|$|Al Leiter {{pitched a}} {{complete}} game shutout, scattering two hits and four <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> nine inning start. This was Leiter's first complete {{game of the}} season. Pokey Reese was the only Reds player to reach scoring position for the entire game, doubling to lead off {{the bottom of the}} ninth inning and then advancing to third on a ground out. The Bergen Record labeled Leiter the Mets' [...] "flag bearer", coming through in games such as this when the team needed him most. For example, Leiter had also defeated Greg Maddux in his previous start on September 29 to snap the Mets' seven-game losing streak. Leiter's earned run average in the second half of the 1999 season was 1.22 runs lower than in the first. Leiter's start earned an 86 game score, which tied for the 14th best total in the National League that season.|$|E
500|$|All of the Eon Bond films {{feature the}} unique gun barrel sequence, created by graphic artist Maurice Binder, {{which has been}} called by British media {{historian}} James Chapman [...] "the trademark motif of the series". As Bond <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> screen, he is viewed by the audience through {{the barrel of a}} gun trained on him by an unknown assailant. Bond wheels around and shoots directly at the gun/viewer, followed by the assassin's blood spilling down the barrel/screen. It was originally filmed in sepia by putting a pinhole camera inside an actual [...]38 calibre gun barrel, with stunt man Bob Simmons playing the part of Bond. The remake of the sequence for the wide-screen Thunderball featured Connery as Bond. This is accompanied by the opening bars of the [...] "James Bond Theme", composed by Monty Norman, orchestrated by trumpeter and composer John Barry and Burt Rhodes.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} verse, Madonna <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> city with M.I.A. and Minaj, {{and is still}} {{followed}} by cheerleaders and football players. She walks down a city street, as players are shot down by an unseen shooter who opens fire from a passing vehicle. She climbs a pyramid of football players, and is eventually taken to a club with Minaj and M.I.A., who sing their parts in a room filled with other cheerleaders and football players. Madonna then falls from the building but two players catch her. She makes {{her way to a}} town square, then starts dancing with her cheerleaders as they bash heads off of football players using baseball bats, revealing a climactic firework spectacle. Madonna grabs one of the heads and proudly displays it to a cheering audience. The video ends with Madonna in front of a brick wall, laughing and throwing away the baby doll, as the word [...] "Touchdown!" [...] appears in front of a pink backdrop.|$|E

2500|$|They {{typically}} build silk-lined tubular burrow retreats with collapsed [...] "tunnels" [...] or open [...] "funnel" [...] entrances {{from which}} irregular trip-lines radiate over the ground. In some exceptions, which lack trip-lines but may have trapdoors, the silk entrance tube may be {{split into two}} openings, in a Y or T form. Sydney funnel-webs burrow in sheltered habitats where they can find a moist and humid climate, for instance under rocks, logs or borer holes in rough-barked trees. The long-lived female funnel-webs {{spend most of the}} time in their silk-lined tubular burrow retreats. When potential prey, which includes insects, lizards or frogs, <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> trip-lines, they rush out, subduing their prey by injecting their venom.|$|E

2500|$|Hudson did, however, {{note that}} there were some {{challenges}} during development. One of the difficulties was in deciding how much graphical detail to provide. [...] "Since our games generally have a lot of AI and scripting, numerous character models, and huge environments, we stress the hardware in a very different way than most games," [...] Hudson said. This made it difficult to predict how well the game would run. The game uses the Odyssey Engine, based on the Aurora Engine (previously developed by BioWare for use in Neverwinter Nights) but completely rewritten for Knights of the Old Republic. It was highly detailed for its time: grass waves in the wind, dust blows across Tatooine and puffs of sand rise as the player <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> seabed.|$|E
2500|$|H. axyridis, {{like other}} ladybeetles or ladybirds, uses {{isopropyl}} methoxy pyrazine {{as a defensive}} chemical to deter predation, but also contains this chemical in its hemolymph at much higher concentrations than many other such species, along with species/genus-specific defensive compounds such as harmonine. These insects will [...] "reflex bleed" [...] when agitated, releasing hemolymph from their legs. The liquid has a foul odour (similar to that of dead leaves) and can cause stains. Some people have allergic reactions, including allergic rhinoconjunctivitis when exposed to these beetles. Sometimes, the beetles will bite humans, presumably {{in an attempt to}} acquire salt, although many people feel a pricking sensation as a ladybeetle <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> skin, which is just the pressure from the ladybird's feet. Bites normally do no more harm than cause irritation, although a small number of people are allergic to bites.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{detention}} nears its end, the group requests that Brian complete the essay for everyone and John {{returns to the}} storage closet to fool Vernon into thinking he has not left. Brian writes the essay and leaves it in the library for Vernon to read after they leave. As the students part ways outside the school, Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and Bender. Allison rips Andrew's state champion patch from his letterman jacket to keep, and Claire gives Bender one of her diamond earrings, which he attaches to his earlobe. Vernon reads the essay (read by Brian in voice-over), in which Brian states that Vernon has already judged who they are, using simple definitions and stereotypes. One by one, the five students' voices add, [...] "But what we found out is that {{each one of us}} is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal." [...] Brian signs the letter as [...] "The Breakfast Club." [...] Bender raises his fist in triumph as he <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> school football field toward home.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} begins with Scherzinger {{sitting in the}} back of a London hackney carriage. As the rain pours outside and raindrops cover the windows, she sings the first verse while {{changing}} her smart clothes for more casual ones. She stares longingly out of the carriage's window, watching the rain outside. During the chorus, there are two main scenes. In the first she is seen wrapped in blanket while in the second she <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> room of an old house, in need of renovation. The lighting is cold and dim, and most of the furniture is covered in plastic wrap. Scherzinger stares resentfully at her surroundings while crossing the room. In the second verse, Scherzinger stands in front of a mirror in the bathroom of the house where she has a moment of realisation. After turning the taps on for a while, the sink overflows as she scornfully looks in the mirror, relating to the lyrics of the song. She is then scene walking towards the camera, through a hallway of the house. It is a confident independent walk towards the audience with lights flashing rhythmically behind her. The bridge sees Scherzinger sitting in one the house's empty rooms, in an old armchair and intersects some of the earlier carriage and bathroom scenes. As she sings the lyric [...] "The screen fades to black", the blanket seen earlier on falls in front of the camera, revealing a close up shot of Scherzinger's face. Her hair flows in the wind and she finally gets up from the armchair to stand in front of the room's open windows. In the final scene, she stands confidently in front of the window as wind and light flood the room. She sings the final verse of the song, looking directly at the camera and smiling for the first time in the video.|$|E

60|$|But the {{consolation}} {{coming from}} devotion {{did not go}} far with such a one as her. We cannot rest on religion merely by saying that we will do so. Very speedily there comes consolation in another form. Queen Anne is on her deathbed, and a young Stuart prince appears upon the scene, of whom some loyal hearts dream {{that they can make}} a king. He is such as Stuarts were, and only <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> novelist's canvas to show his folly and heartlessness. But there is a moment in which Beatrix thinks that she may rise in the world to the proud place of a royal mistress. That is her last ambition! That is her pride! That is to be her glory! The bleared eyes can see no clearer than that. But the mock prince passes away, and nothing but the disgrace of the wish remains.|$|E

As Miss Howard <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> [...] room to the hall door, it is opened and Stephen Murray enters. [...] A great change is visible in his face. It is much thinner and the [...] former healthy tan has faded to a sallow pallor. Puffy shadows of [...] sleeplessness and dissipation are marked under his heavy-lidded [...] eyes.

60|$|This {{is perhaps}} the strangest book that has seen the light since Frankenstein. Indeed, it is a Frankenstein itself; a Frankenstein with the {{original}} infirmity supplemented by a new one; a Frankenstein with the reasoning faculty wanting. Yet it believes it can reason, and is always trying. It is not content to leave a mountain of fact standing in the clear sunshine, where the simplest reader can perceive its form, its details, {{and its relation to}} the rest of the landscape, but thinks it must help him examine it and understand it; so its drifting mind settles upon it with that intent, but always with one and the same result: there is a change of temperature and the mountain is hid in a fog. Every time it sets up a premise and starts to reason from it, there is a surprise in store for the reader. It is strangely nearsighted, cross-eyed, and purblind. Sometimes when a mastodon <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> field of its vision it takes it for a rat; at other times it does not see it at all.|$|E
