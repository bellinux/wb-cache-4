500|$|For {{an upright}} bicycle on dry asphalt with {{excellent}} brakes, pitching <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> limiting factor. The combined {{center of mass}} of a typical upright bicycle and rider will be about [...] back from the front wheel contact patch and [...] above, allowing a maximum deceleration of 0.5g (5m/s2 or 16ft/s2). If the rider modulates the brakes properly, however, pitching can be avoided. If the rider moves his weight back and down, even larger decelerations are possible.|$|E
500|$|Garfield did not {{consider}} Lincoln particularly worthy of re-election, but no viable alternative seemed available. [...] "He <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> man, though I think we could do better." [...] The Ohioan attended the party convention and promoted Rosecrans as Lincoln's running mate, but delegates chose Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson. Both Lincoln and Garfield were re-elected. By then, Chase had left the Cabinet and had been appointed Chief Justice, and his relations with Garfield became more distant.|$|E

[...] MTV News rated the song as one of the contenders for the [...] "best of the summer", writing [...] "Mimi returns, this time with an Auto-Tuned kiss-off to wannabe lotharios (and Eminem?) that <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack to a million summer hookups and just as many public-intoxication collars.

AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose the song as a [...] "top pick" [...] from Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, while Amos Barshad of The New York Times listed it as the fifth top song of the summer. In contrast, [...] "Obsessed" [...] received a mixed review from the Los Angeles Times writer, Todd Martens, who wrote that although [...] "its feistier Mimi than 're used to", she ultimately [...] "has been molded to fit current trends" [...] and that the single [...] "again sells out the songbird to her producers."

2500|$|Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander and Wayne Knight, {{playing their}} {{respective}} Seinfeld characters, {{appeared in a}} spot presented during halftime of the 2014 Super Bowl on February 2. FOX {{came up with the}} idea of doing such a spot, due in part to the Super Bowl's location being New York that year. An uncut version appeared on Crackle.com immediately afterward, as an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee titled [...] "The Over-Cheer". [...] Although the spot was used to advertise Seinfeld's web series, it was not considered a commercial, as Sony, who produces the series, did not pay for it. Seinfeld has indicated that he thinks the webisode <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last cast reunion, saying, [...] "I have a feeling you've seen the final coda on that very unique experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} its {{discovery}} {{was announced in}} the scientific and the popular press, the fossil was characterized as the [...] "most complete fossil primate ever discovered"; Sir David Attenborough has described it as [...] "extraordinary".

During a ceremony at the American Museum of Natural History Hurum said that [...] "This specimen is like finding the Lost Ark for archeologists" [...] and [...] "It is the scientific equivalent of the Holy Grail. This fossil <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one that will be pictured in all textbooks for the next 100 years." [...] Regarding the publicity, Matt Cartmill an anthropologist from Duke University said [...] "The P.R. campaign on this fossil is I think more of a story than the fossil itself".|$|E
2500|$|Merkel {{has been}} criticised for being {{personally}} present and involved at the M100 Media Award handover to Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, who had triggered the Muhammad cartoons controversy. This happened {{at a time}} of fierce emotional debate in Germany over a book by the former Deutsche Bundesbank executive and finance senator of Berlin Thilo Sarrazin, which was critical of the Muslim immigration. At the same time she condemned a planned burning of Korans by a fundamental pastor in Florida. The Central Council of Muslims in Germany and the Left Party (Die Linke) as well as the German Green Party criticised the action by the centre-right chancellor. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper wrote: [...] "This <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most explosive moment of her chancellorship so far."

2500|$|On September 27, 2011, Naughty Dog's Co-President, Christophe Balestra, {{posted a}} picture via his Twitter account, which showed Uncharted 3 assets taking nearly 24.2 Terabytes {{consumed}} while stating, [...] "We'd better finish this game soon...". It {{was not clear}} if this network drive is for general use or for Uncharted 3 game assets and data. However, Balestra's comment seems to allude to the former, indicating {{that the purpose of}} the drive is for the game. A larger game typically translates into mo-cap and art assets, high-res textures, music, voice audio, more environments, more content, and as a result a more fulfilling game to play. Uncharted 3 <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> largest game to-date. According to Mick Hocking, the director of Sony WorldWide Studios' 3D team, Uncharted 3 [...] "will show a new level in 3D gaming".

2500|$|In {{the midst}} of the European sovereign-debt crisis, Radek Sikorski, Poland's Foreign Minister, stated in November 2011, [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first Polish foreign {{minister}} in history to say so, but here it is: I fear German power less than I am beginning to fear German inactivity. You have become Europe's indispensable nation." [...] According to Jacob Heilbrunn, a senior editor at The National Interest, such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany's history. [...] "This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II. And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin's position {{at the center of the}} Continent." [...] Heilbrunn believes that the adage, [...] "what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union" [...] has been supplanted by a new mentality—what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its Nazi past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed—and not represented—by Nazism. The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski's effusive praise for his country's western neighbor. This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory.|$|E
