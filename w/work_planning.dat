They called for a branch from Gaustad Station on the Holmenkoll Line to Geitmyren and onwards to Sagene. The next proposal for a line was launched in 1917, when Aker Municipality established the company Akersbanerne. It started <b>work</b> <b>planning</b> the Østensjø Line as well as the Sognsvann Line. The neighborhoods of Sogn and Tåsen were being built, and the municipality wanted to establish a good transport system to make the areas more attractive. Holmenkolbanen stated that they should be prioritized to build the system, since they already had a line in the area, but the municipality wanted to have political control over the development of the area.|$|E

At the same time Graakalbanen started preparing the first lots for sale, including installation of water, sewage and roads. In June 1919, the engineering company Grøndahl & Kjørholt took over the <b>work,</b> <b>planning</b> to be finished to Lian by 1921. However, by June 1920, the rising prices resulted in the money being used up. At {{the same time it}} turned out that the rolling stock was too much more expensive than expected; ordering of rolling stock was therefore delayed. In 1921, no construction was done on the line. Not before Trondhjems og Stridens Sparebank issued a loan of NOK 1.6 million was it possible to continue construction. This was based on mortgaging all assets, as well as a NOK 500,000 guarantee from the city council. While work previously had been along the whole route, it was then only concentrated on the section Ila–Munkvoll, where the depot would be located.|$|E

40|$|Summary The {{subject of}} this study is the use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> (schemes of <b>work)</b> in school. A <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> is a {{document}} that describes assignment the students are expected to do during a particular period of time. It can be used to solve didactical challenges connected to pedagogic differentiation and self- regulated learning. The use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> is not developed as a consequence of departmental directives, but a tool made on a local level. Recent classroom research (Klette et al 2008, Haug 2009) shows {{that one of the most}} visible trends is that the amount of individual work is increasing at the expense of the collective teaching, and the use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> is a part of this picture. The use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> has been criticized because it leads to the ‘classroom’ as a learning arena becoming less important and the teacher adopting a background role. As a result, the student must take more responsibility for their own learning, and this leads to different outcomes for the students (Klette 2007). This study has three main areas of discussion: How widespread is the use <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> in school? Which activities and types of interaction have teacher and student when the <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are used as a learning tool? What are the teacher’s intentions in their use of <b>work</b> <b>plans?</b> Data in this study are collected from a survey to teachers and quantitative classroom observations at levels 3, 6, and 9, which are based upon the research project, Quality in Education (KIO) at Volda University Collage. Collection of data took place in 2007 - 2008. The main findings in this present research are that <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are used at all levels at Primary School level, but the KIO data identifies variations with regards to the design and application of these <b>planning</b> documents. Most <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> in use are common <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> for several subjects. These plans are used to a limited extent in schools at levels 3 through to 6, but increasing by year 9. By year 9 the students follow the <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> for a third of the time of their individual work. Teachers both justify and define the schemes of work principally as a means of informing students and parents about school work and homework in an agreed period of time. It may appear that the teachers have no holistic teaching methodology behind the use of <b>work</b> <b>plans.</b> The teacher’s main educational reasons for using <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are pedagogic differentiation. At level 9 <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are used as the main tool when the student is working with differential tasks, whilst year 6 students rarely work with differential tasks when they are using a <b>work</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R

Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times gave the concert a rave review affirming that Mars' energy never runs {{out as well}} as the [...] "seemingly effortless precision", which made the performance about itself. Wood finalized, [...] "The harder he played, the easier it appeared to get." [...] Holly Perry from AXS wrote that Mars was not only a [...] "true artist", but also [...] "an icon in the making". She concluded that the finale had the best production of the entire concert. Mike Wass of Idolator gave a positive review, as he witnessed Mars' [...] "powerful" [...] vocals and the band's [...] "incredibly musicianship." [...] He enlighted the singers [...] "swoonworthy rendition" [...] of [...] "When I Was Your Man", the [...] "rock interpretation" [...] of [...] "Grenade" [...] and the Pharrell duet. Jason Lipshutz, Billboard magazine writer, felt {{that one of the most}} stunning things on the concert was the catalog of number one records he left off the live show and still make it impressive. He continued, saying that Mars is a pop artist with the [...] "whole package", comparing him to [...] "an ace Pixar movie". Lipshutz ended his review stating that Mars is one of the best live performers at the given moment. The Boston Globes Sarah Rodman commented that the singer kept a high level of energy during the entire concert. She added, [...] "much <b>work,</b> <b>planning,</b> and rehearsal went in to the show, but Mars made it look easy." [...] Lillian Altman writing for The AU Review felt that [...] "the chemistry between the nine performers was phenomenal", since the band enjoys performing together by dancing and interacting with the public. After the show's finale Altman confessed that it was the first time she was walking home [...] "singing and dancing in the streets" [...] after attending a concert or festival as she listened to Mars' tracks on her iPod.|$|E

M. 1 of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Hazardous Waste Permit, NM 4890139088 -TSDF (the Permit); (NMED, 1999 a). This <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> describes the programmatic facility-wide approach to future investigations at Solid Waste Management Units (SWMUs) and Areas of Concern (AOCs) specified in the Permit. This FWP addresses the current Permit requirements. It uses the results of previous investigations performed at WIPP and expands the investigations {{as required by the}} Permit. As an alternative to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Facility Investigation (RFI) specified in Module VII of the Permit, current New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) guidance identifies an Accelerated Corrective Action Approach (ACAA) that may be used for any SWMU or AOC (NMED, 1998). This accelerated approach is used to replace the standard RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> and Report sequence with a more flexible decision-making approach. The ACAA process allows a Facility to exit the schedule of compliance contained in the Facility’s Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) permit module and proceed on an accelerated time frame. Thus, the ACAA process can be entered either before or after an RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan.</b> According to NMED’s guidance, a facility can prepare an RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> or Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) for any SWMU or AOC (NMED, 1998). Based on this guidance, a SAP constitutes an acceptable alternative to the RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> specified in the Permit. The scope of work for the RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> or SAP is being developed by the Permittees. The final content of the RFI <b>Work</b> <b>Plan</b> or SAP will be coordinated with the NMED for submittal on May 24, 2000.

A Phase I RFI was completed at WIPP as part of a Voluntary Release Assessment (VRA).
