25|$|His {{personal}} impact, however, was twofold: {{his image}} as a warm, gentle and kind man captivated the whole world. This image was immediately formed when he {{was presented to the}} crowd in St. Peter's Square following his election. The <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> presence made him a much-loved figure before he even spoke a word. The media in particular fell under his spell. He was a very skilled orator.|$|E
500|$|James survived two conspiracies in {{the first}} year of his reign, despite the {{smoothness}} of the succession and the <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> welcome: the Bye Plot and Main Plot, which led to the arrest of Lord Cobham and Sir Walter Raleigh, among others. Those hoping for a change in government from James were disappointed at first when he kept Elizabeth's Privy Councillors in office, as secretly planned with Cecil, but James soon added long-time supporter Henry Howard and his nephew Thomas Howard to the Privy Council, as well as five Scottish nobles.|$|E
500|$|Having {{returned}} {{to live in}} London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reception. Kennedy describes it as [...] "like a musical state occasion".|$|E

500|$|Descriptions of Farmer's playing style {{typically}} stress his lyricism and the <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sound. The Los Angeles Times obituary writers {{noted that}} his playing had [...] "a sweetly lyrical tone and a melodic approach to phrasing, {{neither of which}} minimized his capacity to produce rhythmically swinging phrases". The equivalent comments in The Guardian were that [...] "Farmer avoided the bright, penetrating sound of orthodox trumpet playing and {{was influenced by the}} more reserved articulation of Miles Davis and Kenny Dorham", and that, although he could seem more restrained than Davis or Lee Morgan, [...] "Farmer was in his way a true original. His phrasing was always distinctive, letting the beat run ahead of him rather in the manner of Billie Holiday's vocals".|$|E
500|$|Large has {{commented that}} despite the colour and vigour of the music, there is little by way of characterisation, except {{in the cases of}} Kecal and, to a lesser extent, the loving pair and the unfortunate Vašek. The two sets of parents and the various circus folk are all {{conventional}} and [...] "penny-plain" [...] figures. In contrast, Kecal's character [...] that of a self-important, pig-headed, loquacious bungler [...] is instantly established by his rapid-patter music. Large suggests that the character may have been modelled on that of the boastful Baron in Cimarosa's opera Il matrimonio segreto. Mařenka's temperament is shown in vocal flourishes which include coloratura passages and sustained high notes, while Jeník's good nature is reflected in the <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> music, generally in the G minor key. For Vašek's dual image, comic and pathetic, Smetana uses the major key to depict comedy, the minor for sorrow. Large suggests that Vašek's musical stammer, portrayed especially in his opening Act II song, was taken from Mozart's character Don Curzio in The Marriage of Figaro.|$|E
500|$|Jorgensen {{calls the}} 1966 {{recording}} of [...] "How Great Thou Art" [...] "an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions," [...] as Presley had [...] "crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement {{in which he}} took {{every part of the}} four-part vocal, from [...] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax," [...] in the process becoming [...] "a kind of one-man quartet." [...] Guralnick finds [...] "Stand By Me" [...] from the same sessions [...] "a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance," [...] but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on [...] "Where No One Stands Alone" [...] on which [...] "he was reduced to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound" [...] that Jake Hess would have no problem with. Hess himself thought that while others may have a voice as great or greater than Presley's, [...] "he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime." [...] Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: [...] "The <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort." ...|$|E
60|$|Dawn {{broke and}} merged into day. It {{was cold and}} clear. Sixty below zero was Morganson's {{estimate}} of the frost. Not a breath stirred the chill Arctic quiet. He sat up suddenly, his muscular tensity increasing the hurt of the scurvy. He had heard the far sound of a man's voice and the faint whining of dogs. He began beating his hands back and forth against his sides. It was a serious matter to bare the trigger hand to sixty degrees below zero, and against that time he needed to develop all the <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> which <b>his</b> flesh was capable.|$|R

2500|$|.....we in Ireland {{will once}} again {{get a sense of}} the depth and range of the {{contribution}} of Seamus Heaney to our contemporary world, but what those of us who have had the privilege of his friendship and presence will miss is the extraordinary depth and <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personality...Generations of Irish people will have been familiar with Seamus' poems.

2500|$|At {{the base}} of the well, Dante finds himself within a large frozen lake: Cocytus, the Ninth Circle of Hell. Trapped in the ice, each {{according}} to his guilt, are punished sinners guilty of treachery against those with whom they had special relationships. The lake of ice is divided into four concentric rings (or [...] "rounds") of traitors corresponding, in order of seriousness, to betrayal of family ties, betrayal of community ties, betrayal of guests, and betrayal of lords. This is in contrast to the popular image of Hell as fiery; as Ciardi writes, [...] "The treacheries of these souls were denials of love (which is God) and of all human warmth. Only the remorseless dead center of the ice will serve to express their natures. As they denied God's love, so are they furthest removed from the light and <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> Sun. As they denied all human ties, so are they bound only by the unyielding ice." [...] This final, deepest level of hell is reserved for traitors, betrayers and oathbreakers (its most famous inmate is Judas Iscariot).|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{those who knew}} him well often {{referred}} to his loyalty, both to individuals and to organisations. When the great French conductor Roger Désormière was paralysed by a stroke in 1952 Boulez sent scripts to French Radio in Désormière's name so that his mentor could collect the fee. The writer Jean Vermeil, who observed Boulez in the 1990s in the company of Jean Batigne (founder of the Percussions de Strasbourg), discovered [...] "a Boulez asking about the health of a musician in the Strasbourg orchestra, about another player's children, a Boulez who knew everyone by name and who reacted to each person's news with sadness or with joy." [...] In later life, he was known for his charm and personal <b>warmth.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>his</b> humour, Gerard McBurney wrote that it [...] "depended on his twinkling eyes, his perfect timing, his infectious schoolboy giggle, and his reckless compulsion always to say what the other person would not expect." [...] His close friends included Daniel Barenboim and Patrice Chéreau.|$|E

Whether recalled or reinforced by parental retelling, both aspects of this recollection, the spirit of independent exploration and the protective <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> home, mark <b>his</b> path in life...|$|R

5000|$|The JazzTimes {{review by}} Thomas Conrad said [...] "it {{is the best}} album in years from each of them. The fact that Fresu fits {{seamlessly}} into Bley’s band the Lost Chords proves {{that he is an}} unusually brainy sensualist.

60|$|Lord Ormersfield {{sat alone}} in the library, where the fire burnt more {{for the sake of}} cheerfulness than <b>of</b> <b>warmth.</b> <b>His</b> eyes were weary with reading, and, taking off his spectacles, he turned his chair away from the table, and sat gazing into the fire, giving {{audience}} to dreamy thoughts.|$|R

60|$|There was <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> fury in <b>his</b> last phrases. He {{meant she}} loved him more than he her. Perhaps he could not love her. Perhaps she had not in herself that which he wanted. It was the deepest motive of her soul, this self-mistrust. It was so deep she dared neither realise nor acknowledge. Perhaps she was deficient. Like an {{infinitely}} subtle shame, it kept her always back. If it were so, she would do without him. She would never let herself want him. She would merely see.|$|R
60|$|The talk went on, {{meaningless}} {{and random}} on her part, quite deliberate and purposive on his.
