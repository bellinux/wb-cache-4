5|$|Evans {{started with}} Landells in 1840. His duties {{included}} delivering proofs of drawings {{to be approved}} by artists such as Edward Dalziel, or authors such as Charles Dickens. A year later, Landells launched Punch magazine, and as early as 1842 had Evans illustrate covers for the new publication. Evans worked and became friends with Myles Birket Foster, John Greenaway and George Dalziel. Foster and Evans became lifelong friends. When Landells received a commission from the Illustrated London News to provide illustrations of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, he sent Evans and Foster to Balmoral to make sketches, which Evans engraved. Toward the end of his apprenticeship, the demands of the Illustrated London News caused Evans to <b>work</b> <b>late</b> into the night and return early in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Half of Minneapolis–Saint Paul {{residents}} work in {{the city}} where they live. Most residents drive cars, but 60% of the 160,000 people working downtown commute by means other than a single person per auto. Alternative transportation is encouraged. The Metropolitan Council's Metro Transit, which operates the light rail system and most of the city's buses, provides free travel vouchers through the Guaranteed Ride Home program to allay fears that commuters might otherwise be occasionally stranded if, for example, they <b>work</b> <b>late</b> hours.|$|E

Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) proposes that they <b>work</b> <b>late</b> on Friday, so {{they do not have to}} come in the next day. Once Jim and his co-workers finish working, they find that they are locked in, and everyone quickly places the blame on Jim.|$|E

5|$|Kelly {{attracted}} {{the most attention}} as part of Miles Davis' band from 1959, including an appearance on the trumpeter's Kind of Blue, often mentioned as the best-selling jazz album ever. After leaving Davis in 1963, Kelly played with his own trio, which recorded for several labels and toured the United States and internationally. His career did not develop much further, and he had difficulty finding enough <b>work</b> <b>late</b> in his career. Kelly, who was prone to epilepsy, died {{in a hotel room}} in Canada following a seizure, aged 39.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin came up {{with the}} idea to write about the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the {{screenplay}} for The American President. He would <b>work</b> <b>late,</b> with the TV tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of SportsCenter. The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead he turned his idea into a TV comedy series. Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney-owned ABC network in the fall of 1998.|$|E
25|$|Indian and Bangladeshi {{governments will}} start <b>work</b> <b>late</b> by December or early by January 2015 {{on a new}} rail link to ease surface transport. India will build a 15-km railway tracks linking Tripura's capital Agartala with Bangladesh's southeastern city of Akhaura, an {{important}} railway junction connected to Chittagong port, resource-rich Sylhet and Dhaka. An agreement to implement the railway project was signed between India's former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Bangladesh Premier Sheikh Hasina during her visit to India in January 2010. Total cost of the proposed project is estimated at Rs.252 crore. The Indian Railway Construction Company (IRCON) would lay the new railway tracks {{on both sides of}} the border. Of the 15km rail line, five km of tracks fall in the Indian territory.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the first complete survey of scheduling {{problems with the}} <b>late</b> <b>work</b> criteria. <b>Late</b> <b>work</b> objective functions estimate {{the quality of a}} schedule based on durations of late parts of jobs, not taking into account the amount of delay for fully late jobs. The paper provides a formal definition of the <b>late</b> <b>work</b> parameter and compares the criteria based on it with other classical performance measures. It shows the relationship between the <b>late</b> <b>work</b> model and the imprecise computation model known from the hard real-time literature. Moreover, the paper presents a few real world applications of the <b>late</b> <b>work</b> objective function. The paper lists results obtained for nearly forty problems of scheduling jobs on a single machine, parallel (identical and uniform) machines and dedicated machines, investigated in the literature since 1984.

25|$|Task Review: Renaissance's {{execution}} of the task was virtually flawless thanks to Raef and Simon; the team targeted large companies and got several orders by going door-to-door, making big earnings in both areas, while finishing their washing and pressing on time before the laundry closed and not losing any articles of clothing in the process. Meanwhile, Alpha's performance was dogged by problems; while they managed to secure work from businesses with dirty laundry, they had little luck going door-to-door. The team also started their <b>work</b> <b>late,</b> meaning they did not finish {{by the end of}} the first day, and lost two items in the process for which they were fined. As a direct result, the team effectively lost the task.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he could}} not persuade the Soviets to return the Metropolitan Palace, nor to grant {{permission}} for a pastoral magazine, Bogatyrets managed to obtain the resumption of theological training at the university, and obtained their support for his anti-sectarian missionary <b>work.</b> <b>Late</b> in 1947, Theodosius, who was taking a new seat at Kirovograd, recommended Bogatyrets as his replacement in Chernivtsi, highlighting his scholarly competence and Russophile stances. This proposal was dismissed by Patriarch Alexius, who considered Bogatyrets politically unreliable. The church effectively demoted him {{to the rank of}} Protoiereus, since the rank of Archpriest was unused in Russian Orthodoxy. However, in 1955 the consistory provided him with a monthly pension of 2,000 rubles, citing his contribution to church life during the Austrian era, as well as his scientific work. Bogatyrets was also snubbed by the Soviet state. His house on Pravda Street was nationalized in 1949, and he moved with his books to an apartment on Kvitki-Osnovyanenko. He was only granted citizenship and a Soviet Union passport in 1954.|$|E
500|$|Georges Méliès as Professor Barbenfouillis. Méliès, a {{pioneering}} French film-maker and magician now {{generally regarded as}} {{the first person to}} recognize the potential of narrative film, had already achieved considerable success with his film versions of Cinderella (1899) and Joan of Arc (1900). His extensive involvement in all of his films as director, producer, writer, designer, technician, publicist, editor, and often actor makes him one of the first cinematic auteurs. Speaking about his <b>work</b> <b>late</b> in life, Méliès commented: [...] "The greatest difficulty in realising my own ideas forced me to sometimes play the leading role in my films... I was a star without knowing I was one, since the term did not yet exist." [...] All told, Méliès took an acting role in at least 300 of his 520 films.|$|E

The complete restoration to CAF standards of airworthiness was a long and expensive project involving {{more than three years}} of fund raising and hard <b>work.</b> <b>Late</b> in 1974, the CAF's B-29 was christened FIFI and joined the other World War II fighters and bombers to continue the CAF mandate [...] "to preserve the memories and teach of lessons of mankind's greatest war." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 April 1940, Maathai {{was born}} in the village of Ihithe, Nyeri District, in the central {{highlands}} of the colony of Kenya.

Around [...] 1943, Maathai's family relocated to a White-owned farm in the Rift Valley, near the town of Nakuru, where her father had found <b>work.</b> <b>Late</b> in 1947, she returned to Ihithe with her mother, as two of her brothers were attending primary school in the village, and there was no schooling available on the farm where her father worked. Her father remained at the farm. Shortly afterward, at the age of eight, she joined her brothers at Ihithe Primary School.|$|E

For his work with Obama in the campaign, he would wake as early as 5a.m., and routinely stayed up until 3 a.m. working on speeches. [...] His leadership style among the other Obama speechwriters was very informal. They would often meet in a small conference room, discussing their <b>work</b> <b>late</b> into the evening over take-out food. According to Rhodes, Favreau did not drive structured meetings with agendas. [...] "If he had, we probably would have laughed at him," [...] Rhodes said. Favreau was planning to hire more speechwriters to assist him, but conceded he was unsure of how to manage them. According to him, [...] "My biggest strength isn't the organization thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The groups congregate in {{the early}} morning and evening, any time of year, at parks or public squares, or {{anywhere}} they can find enough space, regardless of what other use that space may nominally have, such as a parking lot. Morning dancers try to avoid parks since they are preferred locations for taiji, the martial arts school whose slowed-down moves are often practiced as exercise, known as tai chi in the West. They begin as early as 5:30a.m., and tend to use spaces nearer supermarkets so they are better positioned to bargain for and purchase fresh vegetables when the markets open. In the evening they tend to start dancing after dinner; for this reason spaces used by square dancers in the evening tend not to be too far from their homes as they also may have to tend to grandchildren they may be watching while their own children <b>work</b> <b>late.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Kuk Harrell, {{one of the}} {{producers}} of Talk That Talk, spoke on the recording of the album saying: [...] "In addition to touring, we are recording Rihanna's new album. We have a portable studio that we set up at the different hotels that we are staying at. We set up shop anywhere in the hotel. Before {{we went on the}} European leg of Rihanna's Loud tour, we started recording the album in Los Angeles. Rihanna likes to <b>work</b> <b>late</b> hours, so she would come into the studio at 9pm and work until 6am." [...] Continuing Harrell stated [...] "The show was the priority, and then the album. That's how the day was broken up." [...] Expanding on this Harrell stated that Rihanna would perform every night, finish her meet [...] and greet by 1 a.m. Then go to the studio for around two or three a.m. During these session Harrell stated [...] "I’d make the decision based off where I felt her voice was. Knowing she just did two hours of a show and meet-and-greets, I would suggest capturing the stuff that was easier to get like the lower-range stuff so we wouldn’t hurt or damage her voice." ...|$|E

On June 26, 2011, [...] "End of Time" [...] was the tenth song to be chosen. Knowles was motivated to record a song in the vein of [...] "End of Time" [...] after listening closely to the material of several rock musicians she saw at music festivals around the world; she analysed their lyrics and melodies, {{and the way they}} mixed different instruments at the same time. Knowles noted, [...] "The instrumentation was just so beautiful. I felt I needed some classics like that." [...] The bass line used in [...] "End of Time" [...] was inspired by the <b>work</b> <b>late</b> Nigerian music legend Fela Kuti, whom she appreciated for [...] "the feel for the soul and heart of his music; it's so sexy, and has a great groove you get lost in. I loved his drums, all the horns, how everything was on the one. What I learned most from Fela was artistic freedom: he just felt the spirit." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{architecture}} of Cantabria {{has a long}} history. In medieval times, artistic individuality was subordinated to ingenuity in civil <b>works.</b> <b>Late</b> Gothic, Plateresque, and renaissance architecture later {{played a role in}} Cantabrian architecture, as did the province's mountain quarries.

2500|$|While {{comparable}} to geisha, these women make livings entertaining business men, often spending {{large amounts of}} their work time with them. [...] Hostesses, however, can choose this path, rather than being sold into it, like a brothel girl from the Meiji era. [...] This type of work borders on the sex industry, with women being paid to amuse men who eat and drink at night clubs, salons, taverns, etc. [...] Though the hours are irregular, the pay is very good for women willing to work in this sector, some of whom even aspire to own their own private establishments. [...] Due to the odd nature of this work, though, this type of employment is usually only sought by divorcees, young unmarried Japanese women, or married women in need of quick cash. Hostesses will often play {{the part of a}} mother or housewife for male customers, caring for them, inflating their ego, and flirting with them, offering bits of flattery for tips. [...] Depending {{on the size of the}} bar, night club, etc., there may be a large show to relax the customers; or in smaller establishments, the hostess will spend one-on-one time with her clients, gaining social ties while charging her clients for their attention. [...] Though it can be a good source of quick money for women willing to work odd hours, normally single women with a low education, usually around the high school level, are the primary hostess candidates. [...] They <b>work</b> <b>late</b> into the nights and sleep during the days, so these women are close to opposites of the salarymen they entertain. [...] In the 21st century, this type of industry has drastically evolved. [...] Pictures of kimono clad hostesses or hostesses willing to dress up in costumes for the amusement of customers have become an iconic image for tourists.|$|E
2500|$|Justman {{registered}} immediate {{concerns over}} the potential cost of attempting to film the treatment. He had particular concerns about a time portal effect, a scene involving a mammoth {{and the number of}} exterior and night shoots that would be required. Despite this, Roddenberry asked Ellison {{to turn it into a}} shooting script and set aside a desk for him in the assistant director's room, expecting him to attend the office every day until he finished it. Ellison ended up with a smaller office of his own at his request, but disliked it sufficiently that he spent the majority of his time on set. He would play loud rock and roll music in the office, and then leave it for the set. On one occasion story editor John D. F. Black caught him on set during the filming of [...] "Mudd's Women" [...] and had him escorted back to the office. The music went on, and Black went back to tell Ellison to turn it down, but the writer had already climbed out the window and left. But on other occasions, he would <b>work</b> <b>late</b> into the night and slept on the couch in Justman's office. As the delays added up, the slots assigned to [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever" [...] were reallocated to other episodes. Although this period was later claimed to be of various lengths, Ellison completed the first draft teleplay in three weeks, handing it to Justman on June 7. Black later said that Ellison always had [...] "40 things going" [...] in reference to him doing multiple assignments at once. In response, Ellison said that doing multiple assignments at the same time was simply how screenwriters earned a living in the 1960s.|$|E
