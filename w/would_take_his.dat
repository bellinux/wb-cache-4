5|$|In February 1818, {{during his}} last term at Oxford, and again {{following}} his father's wishes, he became Member of Parliament (MP) for Marlborough, a pocket borough owned by his cousin Charles, Earl of Ailesbury. The intention was to give Brudenell a grounding in parliamentary affairs before, eventually, he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> place in the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} at ABC, Aubrey saw a limited future {{at the network}} and asked to return to CBS, doing so on April 28, 1958, {{initially}} as assistant to Frank Stanton, president of CBS, Inc., the holding company which owned the network. (Thomas W. Moore <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> ABC job.) Aubrey was made vice president for creative services in April 1959, replacing Louis G. Cowan, whom CBS promoted to network president.|$|E
5|$|Heidfeld {{was finally}} {{announced}} as Webber's 2005 teammate at the Williams season launch on 31 January, with Webber admitting {{he was pleased}} with the eventual decision. Webber's move to Williams brought about comparisons to Alan Jones, Australia's last F1 World Champion, also in a Williams. Expectations were high as Webber's former team boss Paul Stoddart predicted Webber <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> first victory in 2005 while Williams technical director Sam Michael said Webber would eventually win the World Championship with Williams.|$|E

5|$|The Laroche family, father Joseph {{and daughters}} Simonne and Louise, {{were the only}} known {{passengers}} of black ancestry on board the ship. They, along with Joseph's pregnant wife Juliette, were travelling to Joseph's native island of Haiti. Joseph hoped that a move from their former home in Paris back to Haiti, where his uncle Cincinnatus Leconte was president, <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> family away from racial discrimination.|$|E
5|$|On the Persian side, Kardarigan {{was also}} eager {{to fight and}} {{confident}} of victory. He arranged to be escorted by many camels carrying water for his troops in case the Byzantines refused to engage but continued to block access to the Arzamon, and had allegedly prepared iron bars and chains for the prisoners he <b>would</b> <b>take.</b> <b>His</b> movements, however, were detected when the Byzantines' Arab foederati captured {{a few of his}} men, allowing Philippicus to prepare his forces. This early warning was of particular importance since Kardarigan intended to attack on Sunday, a day of rest for the Christian Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea came}} to him after {{attending}} the first Jubilee {{in the city of}} Rome, in 1300, where he realized that Rome's many historical achievements were well-known, and he desired to lay out a history of the origins of his own city of Florence. In his Cronica, Villani described in detail the many building projects of the city, statistical information on population, ordinances, commerce and trade, education, and religious facilities. He also described several disasters such as famines, floods, fires, and the pandemic of the Black Death in 1348, which <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> own life. Villani's work on the Cronica was continued by his brother and nephew after his death. It has been described as the first introduction of statistics as a positive element in history.|$|E

5|$|After the World Cup England {{lost the}} annual Home Championship to Scotland after a 3–2 defeat in April 1967, Charlton scored {{for the second}} {{successive}} international game running after also finding the net against Wales the previous November. He injured his foot during the game as he broke two sesamoid bones in his big toe. As his career went on he began to miss England games with niggling injuries {{so as to avoid}} friendly games in favour of playing important matches for Leeds; Brian Labone <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> place in the England team during Charlton's absences. He was named in the squad for UEFA Euro 1968, but did not feature in either of England's games. He won five caps in 1969, helping England to a memorable 5–0 win over France and scoring in a 1–0 win over Portugal from a corner taken by his brother Bobby.|$|E
5|$|When Brion sent a {{bill for}} the {{abandoned}} sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith {{sent a message to}} the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell of Goldenboy. McConnell told Spin that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1,500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips and Scott McPherson of Sense Field played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.|$|E
5|$|On July 30, 2011 it was {{announced}} that Cotto would make a second defence of his WBA title against rival Antonio Margarito (38-7, 27 KOs) in a rematch to their first fight, which took place in July 2008. The fight was set to take place at Madison Square Garden on December 3, 2011. The MGM Grand was also considered as a possible venue. At first, the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) denied Margarito a boxing license on October 31, 2011. The reason for the denial was not due the cheating allegations, but instead due to the damage to Margarito's eye in the Manny Pacquiao fight. An appeal was filed and a hearing took place to where several leading eye doctors testified that Margarito should be allowed to fight. A final decision was expected on November 18, 2011. Without a license, Margarito could not fight in the state of New York. Arum initially stated that if Margarito was not licensed to fight, then Vanes Martirosyan <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> place on the card. However, Arum later stated that the fight would be moved to a venue in a state that Margarito holds a license. On November 18, 2011, the NYSAC did not make a final vote as expected. Instead, they ordered Margarito to be examined by their own doctor. Based on the findings of their own doctor, they would make a decision on whether Margarito received a license. The New York State Athletic Commission granted Antonio Margarito a license to box in New York after a hearing in Manhattan. A sold-out crowd of 21,239 {{was announced}}. Cotto avenged the defeat from 2008 stopping Margarito in the 10th round. The fight was stopped {{at the start of the}} 10th round because of the condition of Margarito's right eye, which was swollen shut. This was the same eye that was badly damaged in his fight with Pacquiao and the one that almost kept the New York State Athletic Commission from granting him his boxing license because of the special procedure that was performed on it in 2010. At the time of stoppage, Cotto lead 89-82 on all three judges scorecards. For the fight, Cottor earned a minimum $5 million, the figure would increase due to PPV shares and Margarito earned $2.5 million.|$|E

25|$|Greg Chappell {{chose not}} to tour England in 1981 and there was much {{speculation}} over who <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> spot at number three in the batting line up. During {{the early stages of}} the tour it was thought Martin Kent <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> place at number three and Chappell only play one dayers and tour games. However Kent displayed poor form while Chappell was more consistent – 47 against Somerset and 91 against Gloucestershire.|$|E
