5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for forced prostitution around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes <b>with</b> <b>victims</b> of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergency}} room is filled <b>with</b> <b>victims</b> from a chain car accident, {{one of whom}} is admitted in the department of neurosurgery, under the care of Shepherd and Yang. As the physicians soon discover that he has been internally decapitated, they {{come to the conclusion that}} even a minor move would result in irreparable damage. A pregnant woman is admitted in plastic surgery, after having her arm severed. Meredith is assigned to work for Sloan during the day, and is immediately told to find the arm, much to the fascination of her interns. Despite trying to deal with her trainees in a strict manner, Stevens is looked upon as unprofessional by the interns she was assigned to. Her image is further deteriorated when she decides to abandon her hospital duties, in order to perform surgery on a deer, once again letting her emotional involvement interfere with her career. Meredith and Shepherd discuss the repercussions of their breakup, and realize that they cannot reconcile. However, the two engage in sexual intercourse, as a manner to express their mutual feelings for the last time. O'Malley comes to the realization of his love for Stevens, and quickly discloses to her that he shares her romantic feelings.|$|E

40|$|Research {{elsewhere}} {{has suggested}} that the level of <b>victim</b> engagement <b>with</b> support services is generally low, and that many individuals are at risk of trauma symptomology and associated negative psychological outcomes as a result. The existing literature examining barriers to engagement <b>with</b> <b>victim</b> services is relatively small and largely quantitative, and a detailed qualitative examination of decisions to engage <b>with</b> <b>victim</b> services has yet to be undertaken. To address this gap in the literature, the current study examined the provision of information and referral processes by the police, initial and follow-up contact with support services, and perceived barriers to engagement. Victim evaluations of the services used were also examined. Seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted <b>with</b> the <b>victims</b> of violent crime during a six-month period in a police force in England and Wales. Participants who engaged <b>with</b> <b>victim</b> services reported experiencing significant benefits {{as a result of the}} support they received; however, there was a generally low level of engagement <b>with</b> <b>Victim</b> Support and other services in the sample. Several different factors associated with lack of engagement were identified by the analysis, consistent with the results of previous research. The implications of the study for developing more effective strategies for increasing victim engagement, in ways consistent with current local, national and European policy, are considered...|$|R
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that engagement with support services after criminal victimisation is low. With this in mind, {{this study investigated}} predictors of engagement <b>with</b> <b>Victim</b> Support, {{in a sample of}} victims of violent crime. All violent crimes recorded by Lancashire Constabulary for two postcode areas (PR 1 and PR 2), who were referred to Victim Support (Preston) between April 2013 and September 2013 (n= 869) were assessed, with a follow-up undertaken in 2014. Two percent of victims booked or attended a face-to-face meeting <b>with</b> <b>Victim</b> Support, and just over one fifth engaged over the telephone on at least one occasion across a range of support options at the initial data collection point. Engagement <b>with</b> <b>Victim</b> Support was not significantly related to future victimisation. When revictimisation since the first data collection period was inspected against demographic and crime-related variables, previous victimisation, regardless of the type of crime experienced, was the strongest predictor of being victimised again. This was despite the fact that such victims {{were more likely to be}} identified as high risk, and actively engaged <b>with</b> <b>Victim</b> Support at the initial time of victimisation. Suggestions for further research are made in light of the changes generally to victim services in the UK...|$|R
