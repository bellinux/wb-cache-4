40|$|Abstract. For known {{well the}} {{contributions}} of both tension-compression-ratio of material and intermediate principal shear stress to <b>wire</b> <b>forming,</b> the <b>wire</b> <b>forming</b> problem is developed based on unified strength theory. By denoting a notation of D, the unified stresses solution for <b>wire</b> <b>forming</b> is gained, which is suitable to both wire drawing and extrusion. In addition, when material has identical strength in tension and compression, the stresses solution based on unified strength theory become that based on unified yield criterion. Notably, it is proved that the stresses of <b>wire</b> <b>forming</b> are independent of the intermediate principal shear stress. Whether any yield criterion (e. g., Mises, Tresca or unified yield criterion) is adopted, for {{it is assumed that}} the tensile and compressive strength is equal to one another, the stresses solution is as same as that based on unified yield criterion, and is merely a special case of the unified stresses solution developed by this paper...|$|R

50|$|In {{materials}} science, galfenol is {{the general}} term for an alloy of iron and gallium. The name was first given to iron-gallium alloys by United States Navy researchers in 1998 when they discovered that adding gallium to iron could amplify iron's magnetostrictive effect up to tenfold. Galfenol is of interest to sonar researchers because magnetostrictor materials are used to detect sound, and amplifying the magnetostrictive effect could lead to better sensitivity of sonar detectors. Galfenol is also proposed for vibrational energy harvesting, actuators for precision machine tools, active anti-vibration systems, and anti-clogging devices for sifting screens and spray nozzles. Galfenol is machinable and can be produced in sheet and <b>wire</b> <b>form.</b>|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{spraying}} can provide thick coatings (approx. thickness range is 20 micrometers to several mm, {{depending on the}} process and feedstock), over a large area at high deposition rate as compared to other coating processes such as electroplating, physical and chemical vapor deposition. Coating materials available for thermal spraying include metals, alloys, ceramics, plastics and composites. They are fed in powder or <b>wire</b> <b>form,</b> heated to a molten or semimolten state and accelerated towards substrates {{in the form of}} micrometer-size particles. Combustion or electrical arc discharge is usually used as the source of energy for thermal spraying. Resulting coatings are made by the accumulation of numerous sprayed particles. The surface may not heat up significantly, allowing the coating of flammable substances.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{a demand}} for compact, lightweight, {{solid-state}} actuation systems has emerged, driven {{in part by the}} needs of the aeronautics industry. However, most actuation systems used in turbomachinery require not only elevated temperature but high-force capability. As a result, shape memory alloy (SMA) based systems have worked their way to the forefront of a short list of viable options to meet such a technological challenge. Most of the effort centered on shape memory systems to date has involved binary NiTi alloys but the working temperatures required in many aeronautics applications dictate significantly higher transformation temperatures than the binary systems can provide. Hence, a high temperature shape memory alloy (HTSMA) based on NiTiPdPt, having a transformation temperature near 300 C, was developed. Various thermo-mechanical processing schemes were utilized to further improve the dimensional stability of the alloy and it was later extruded/drawn into <b>wire</b> <b>form</b> to be more compatible with envisioned applications. Mechanical testing on the finished <b>wire</b> <b>form</b> showed reasonable work output capability with excellent dimensional stability. Subsequently, the <b>wire</b> <b>form</b> of the alloy was incorporated into a benchtop system, which was shown to provide the necessary stroke requirements of approx. 0. 125 inches for the targeted surge-control application. Cycle times for the actuator were limited to ~ 4 seconds due to control and cooling constraints but this cycle time was determined to be adequate for the surge control application targeted as the primary requirement was initial actuation of a surge control rod, which could be completed in approximately one second...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThis {{retrospective}} single-center study analyzed long-term results after LifePath (Edwards Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, Calif) endoprosthesis implantation for abdominal {{aortic aneurysm}} (AAA), primarily {{focusing on the}} <b>wire</b> <b>form</b> fracture issue and consecutive endoleak rate. MethodsBetween 1999 and 2004, all consecutive patients with LifePath AAA devices in our institution {{were included in the}} retrospective analysis. All patients had computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging preoperatively and image postprocessing. The follow-up using CTA imaging specifically addressed material fatigue (<b>wire</b> <b>form</b> fractures) resulting in migrations and type I endoleaks. ResultsDuring the 6 -year study period, which included the 1 -year withdrawal and redesign of the device, 51 patients were treated with LifePath AAA endografts. The 30 -day mortality was 0 %. The perioperative 30 -day morbidity was 9. 8 %. One patient required a primary conversion due to misdeployment of the iliac limbs within the graft main body. The primary endoleak rate was 20. 56 % (type I, 2 %; type II, 19. 6 %). During the mean follow-up of 40. 7 months, 12 patients died, six were lost to follow-up, and 32 underwent subsequent CTA imaging. Eight patients (25 %) demonstrated a proximal type I endoleak, seven (22 %) had a type II endoleak, and three had a type III endoleak (9 %). In nine patients (28. 1 %), <b>wire</b> <b>form</b> fractures could be detected at image postprocessing. Four patients required a secondary conversion due to endoleak and aneurysm growth (2 type I endoleaks and 2 type III endoleaks). ConclusionWire form fracture is the major structural problem in the LifePath balloon-expandable endograft device, resulting in a significant endoleak rate. We must caution those patients with a LifePath device in-situ that careful follow-up must be performed due to material fatigue and they should consider secondary conversion...|$|E
