5|$|Blue Line trains share {{a single}} tunnel <b>with</b> <b>Orange</b> Line and Silver Line trains {{to cross the}} Potomac River. The current tunnel limits service in each direction, {{creating}} a choke point. A 2001 proposal would have rerouted the Blue Line between the Rosslyn and Stadium–Armory stations by building a bridge or tunnel from Virginia to a new station in Georgetown. The proposal was later rejected due to cost, but Metro again started considering a similar scenario in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius sanguifluus is {{classified}} in the section Dapetes of the genus Lactarius. This section, which also includes other popular edible species such as L.deliciosus, and the less popular L.deterrimus, is characterized by mushrooms <b>with</b> <b>orange</b> or red latex that often impart a greenish stain on the flesh and gills, an often sticky cap, and association with conifers. The specific epithet sanguifluus {{is derived from the}} Latin words sanguis ("blood") and fluus ("flowing").|$|E

5|$|The bill's {{appearance}} {{is important in}} the interactions of the common blackbird. The territory-holding male responds more aggressively towards models <b>with</b> <b>orange</b> bills than to those with yellow bills, and reacts least to the brown bill colour typical of the first-year male. The female is, however, relatively indifferent to bill colour, but responds instead to shinier bills.|$|E
5|$|Variations of the pisco sour {{exist in}} Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. There are adaptations of the {{cocktail}} in Peru using fruits such as maracuya, aguaymanto, and apples, or traditional ingredients {{such as the}} coca leaf. In Chile, variants include the Ají Sour (with a spicy green chili), Mango Sour (with mango juice), and Sour de Campo (with ginger and honey). In Bolivia, the Yunqueño variant (from its Yungas region) replaces the lime <b>with</b> <b>orange</b> juice.|$|E

5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} from China to Britain {{for the first}} time. Superficially similar in appearance to an Aylesbury duck, a Pekin is white <b>with</b> <b>orange</b> legs and bill, with its legs near the rear, giving it an upright stance while on land. Although not thought {{to have such a}} delicate flavour as the Aylesbury, the Pekin was hardier, a more prolific layer, fattened more quickly, and was roughly the same size as an Aylesbury at nine weeks.|$|E
5|$|Route 58 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} <b>with</b> <b>Orange</b> Street and Hecker Street {{in the center}} of Newark. Paralleling Lackawanna Drive, the highway crossed over the Gladstone Branch, Montclair Branch and Morristown Lines maintained by New Jersey Transit. A four-lane divided highway, Route 58 headed eastward along the Essex Freeway, a short freeway in Newark. The highway interchanged with Clifton Avenue heading westbound and Martin Luther King Boulevard a short distance later. The interchange with Martin Luther King Boulevard accessed the nearby Newark Broad Street Station. A short distance later, Route 58 interchanged with Route 21 nearby. After Route 21, the Essex Freeway crossed on the Stickel Bridge over the Passaic River and into Harrison, where Route 58 interchanged with County Route 508. There the designation terminated.|$|E
5|$|Schmid {{lives in}} Bellevue, Washington, during the soccer season. He {{is married to}} Valerie and has four children: Erik, Lacey, Kurt, and Kyle. Kurt is {{currently}} the head scout for Sounders FC. Kyle played as a defender at UC Irvine {{and was in the}} USL Premier Development League <b>with</b> <b>Orange</b> County Blue Star. Kyle is now an assistant coach at Cal State Fullerton. Sigi has rarely missed game days in the MLS, but took time off for Lacey and Kurt's weddings and Kurt's college graduation. Schmid's younger brother, Roland, lives in Sammamish, Washington, and having family in the area was one of the factors which persuaded Schmid to accept the job at Seattle. He also has a nephew and a niece named Graham and Mackenze.|$|E

5|$|Stowe's house, {{which was}} {{located on the}} bank of the St. Johns River, became a tourist attraction, as riverboats {{shuffling}} tourists from Jacksonville to Palatka or Green Cove Springs passed close by and slowed, so the captains could point out her home to their clients. Eventually a dock was built so that visitors could come ashore and peek into the windows of the home. One, who dared to pull down a tree branch covered <b>with</b> <b>orange</b> blossoms in full bloom over the Stowe's veranda, was chased off the property by Calvin. Local residents who held Stowe in less than high regard insinuated that she worked with the enterprising riverboat captains to pose for tourists.|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} a modern looking {{rectangular}} structure <b>with</b> <b>orange</b> brick and clear glass which is adjacent to Glenn Jackson Plaza and Hudson's Bay, with the Mill Race flowing by on the north side. The north and south faces are clear glass, while the other two sides are brick. The exterior walls taper slightly outward on the brick sides of the building. Bricks on these sides were laid horizontally, while the overhanging roof line contains bricks that were laid vertically. A glass-enclosed stairwell and the main entrance near the northwest corner are the only parts that jut out from the primarily rectangular building.|$|E
5|$|The male has mainly black upperparts, a white crown, {{forehead}} and supercilium. There are large white patches {{on the shoulders}} and primaries, and the outermost tail feathers are also white. The throat, neck sides and underparts are white, <b>with</b> <b>orange</b> on the flanks and breast. The iris is brown, the bill is black and the legs are dark brown or black. The female is a duller version of the male, with brownish-black upperparts and a grey or buff tinge to the white shoulder patches and underparts. The juvenile has grey-brown upperparts with darker bars from the head to rump, a paler grey forehead, barred off-white underparts and brown wings with white primary patches.|$|E

5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' <b>with</b> <b>orange,</b> red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 1958, Eisenhower {{announced}} {{a moratorium on}} nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline, which the Soviets did not meet, conducting tests on 1 and 3 November. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies {{such as the use}} of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out <b>with</b> <b>Orange</b> Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride were successfully tested in the Pendant and Burgee tests, allowing a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices. The international moratorium commenced on 31 October 1958, and Britain ceased atmospheric testing for good.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 1958, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{announced}} a one-year moratorium on nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958, if the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom {{also agreed to}} suspend testing. Britain had already indicated that it would do so, and the Soviet Union agreed on 30 August. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, all three all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline. The British scientists needed to gather as much data as possible {{to allow them to}} design production nuclear weapons. Moreover, as the prospect of increased American cooperation grew after October 1957, they knew that {{the quality and quantity of}} what the Americans would share would depend on what they had to offer. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies such as the use of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out <b>with</b> <b>Orange</b> Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride permitted a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices. It would be the biggest and most complex British test series.|$|E
