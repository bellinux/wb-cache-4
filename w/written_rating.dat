40|$|Following {{controlled}} photodeprotection of a 2 -nitrophenylpropyloxycarbonyl-protected (aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (NPPOC-APTES) {{film and}} subsequent derivatization with a bromoester-based initiator, poly(2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethylphosphorylcholine) (PMPC) brushes with various grafting densities were grown from planar silicon substrates using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The grafting density correlated {{closely with the}} extent of deprotection of the NPPOC-APTES. The coefficient of friction for such PMPC brushes was measured by friction force microscopy in water and found to be inversely proportional to the grafting density due to the osmotic pressure that resists deformation. Deprotection of NPPOC-APTES via near-field photolithography using a range of <b>writing</b> <b>rates</b> enabled the fabrication of neighboring nanoscopic polymeric structures with dimensions ranging from 100 to 1000 nm. Slow <b>writing</b> <b>rates</b> enable complete deprotection to occur; hence, polymer brushes are formed with comparable thicknesses to macroscopic brushes grown under the same conditions. However, the extent of deprotection is reduced at higher <b>writing</b> <b>rates,</b> resulting in the concomitant reduction of the brush thickness. The coefficient of friction for such polymer brushes varied smoothly with brush height, with lower coefficients being obtained at slower <b>writing</b> <b>rate</b> (increasing initiator density) because the solvated brush layer confers greater lubricity. However, when ultrasharp probes were used for nanotribological measurements, the coefficient of friction increased with brush thickness. Under such conditions, the radius of curvature of the tip {{is comparable to the}} mean spacing between brush chains, allowing the probe to penetrate the brush layer leading to a relatively large contact area...|$|R

Resulting pauses and <b>writing</b> <b>rates</b> were analyzed in relation to word-orthographic frequency, syllabic length, and phoneme-to-grapheme consistency {{at the end of}} words. More specifically, we showed that the noun production process begins as soon the determiner production is initiated (word frequency effect on latencies, length and consistency effects on determiner <b>writing</b> <b>rate)</b> and continued {{during the course of the}} noun production. When the determiner was absent, the management of writing was different: the writer slowed the production speed, probably in order to realize the lexeme processing that s/he could not do in the absence of the determiner production time. These results provided further evidence that some form of parallel processing occurs in written word production and led us to sketch the time-course of the noun spelling in written denomination of a noun phrase...|$|R
