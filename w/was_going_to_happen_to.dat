They {{initially}} assumed {{that they were going to}} be transported to Moscow. Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich even thought that they might be set free, but his brother assumed that they were heading to another place to be shot. They had an ominous hint of what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them when at the time of departure they were told to leave their luggage.|$|E
500|$|Originally to {{be called}} The Ends of the Earth, each episode would have ended with the planet Earth meeting its demise in a {{different}} way. While writing the first episode, Adams realised that he needed a character who knew what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> Earth before the other characters. He made this character an alien and, remembering an idea he supposedly had had while lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria in 1971, decided that this character would be a [...] "roving reporter" [...] for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a pan-galactic encyclopedia and travel guide. Recollections by his friends at the time indicate that Adams first spoke {{of the idea of}} [...] "hitchhiking around the galaxy" [...] while on holiday in Greece in 1973.|$|E
500|$|Rowe's {{illness and}} Blanchflower's arrival {{together}} signalled {{the end of}} Ramsey's playing career. Ramsey missed matches during the 1954–55 season through injury, and in April 1955 suffered what he called [...] "a terrible roasting" [...] {{at the hands of}} the Leicester City winger Derek Hogg. After Tottenham ended the season in 16th place, Rowe retired permanently; his deputy Jimmy Anderson took over and appointed Nicholson to his coaching staff. When Ramsey was omitted from a post-season tour of Hungary, despite still being club captain, he realised that his time at Tottenham had come to an end. He had played a total of 250 competitive games for Tottenham in all competitions, across six seasons. [...] "I was 35 years old and obviously concerned about my future," [...] he later wrote. [...] "I really didn't know what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> me. I knew my days as a player were numbered, and there was only one way things could go for me in this respect—downhill." ...|$|E

500|$|SS-Obersturmführer Irmfried Eberl was {{appointed}} the camp's first commandant on 11 July 1942. He was a psychiatrist from Bernburg Euthanasia Centre {{and the only}} physician-in-chief to command an extermination camp during World War II. According to some, his poor organisational skills caused the operation of Treblinka to turn disastrous; others {{point out that the}} number of transports that were coming in reflected the Nazi high command's wildly unrealistic expectations of Treblinka's ability to [...] "process" [...] these prisoners. The early gassing machinery frequently broke down due to overuse, forcing the SS to shoot Jews assembled for suffocation. The workers did not have enough time to bury them, and the mass graves were overflowing. According to the testimony of his colleague Unterscharführer Hans Hingst, Eberl's ego and thirst for power exceeded his ability: [...] "So many transports arrived that the disembarkation and gassing of the people could no longer be handled." [...] On incoming Holocaust trains to Treblinka, many of the Jews locked inside correctly guessed what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them. The odour of decaying corpses could be smelled up to [...] away.|$|E

2500|$|Warren {{presided over}} the Court's October 1968 term and retired in June 1969; Nixon named Warren E. Burger to succeed him. Warren regretted his decision, {{reflecting}} [...] "If I had ever known what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> this country and this Court, I never would have resigned. They {{would have had to}} carry me out of there on a plank". Burger, despite his distinguished profile and conservative reputation, proved to be quite ineffective in stopping Brennan's influence within the court, so the [...] "Warren Court" [...] legacy continued in many respects until about 1986, when William Rehnquist became Chief Justice and took firmer control of the agenda.|$|E
