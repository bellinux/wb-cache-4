6000|$|First, I {{should like}} to point out that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> a deal too much about a man's {{inalienable}} right to work or play, at his own sovereign will. In so far as that means--and it is always used to mean--his right to quit any kind of work at any moment, without notice and regardless of consequences to others, it is false; there is no such moral right, and the law should have at least a speaking acquaintance with morality. What is mischievous should be illegal. The various interests of civilization are so complex, delicate, intertangled and interdependent that no man, and no set of men, should have power to throw the entire scheme into confusion and disorder for pro-motion of a trumpery principle or a class advantage. In dealing with corporations we recognize that. If for any selfish purpose the trade union of railway managers had done what their sacred brakemen and divine firemen did--had decreed that [...] "no wheel should turn," [...] until Mr. Pullman's men should return to work--they would have found themselves all in jail the second day. Their right to quit work was not conceded: they lacked that authenticating credential of moral and legal irresponsibility, an indurated palm. In a small lockout affecting a mill or two the offender finds a half-hearted support in the law if he is willing to pay enough deputy sheriffs; but even then he is mounted by the hobnailed populace, at its back the daily newspapers, clamoring and spitting like cats. But let the manager of a great railway discharge all its men without warning and [...] "kill" [...] its own engines! Then see what you will see. To commit a wrong so gigantic with impunity a man must wear overalls.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{the human}} mind can advance or not, is a {{question}} too little discussed, for nothing can be more dangerous than to found our social philosophy on any theory which is debatable but has not been debated. But if we assume, {{for the sake of}} argument, that there has been in the past, or will be in the future, {{such a thing as a}} growth or improvement of {{the human mind}} itself, there still remains a very sharp objection to be raised against the modern version of that improvement. The vice of the modern notion of mental progress is that it is always something concerned with the breaking of bonds, the effacing of boundaries, the casting away of dogmas. But if there be such a thing as mental growth, it must mean the growth into more and more definite convictions, into more and more dogmas. The human brain is a machine for coming to conclusions; if it cannot come to conclusions it is rusty. When we hear of a man too clever to believe, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> of something having almost the character of a contradiction in terms. It is like hearing of a nail that was too good to hold down a carpet; or a bolt that was too strong to keep a door shut. Man can hardly be defined, after the fashion of Carlyle, as an animal who makes tools; ants and beavers and many other animals make tools, in the sense that they make an apparatus. Man can be defined as an animal that makes dogmas. As he piles doctrine on doctrine and conclusion on conclusion in the formation of some tremendous scheme of philosophy and religion, he is, in the only legitimate sense of which the expression is capable, becoming more and more human. When he drops one doctrine after another in a refined scepticism, when he declines to tie himself to a system, when he says that he has outgrown definitions, when he says that he disbelieves in finality, when, in his own imagination, he sits as God, holding no form of creed but contemplating all, then he is by that very process sinking slowly backwards into the vagueness of the vagrant animals and the unconsciousness of the grass. Trees have no dogmas. Turnips are singularly broad-minded.|$|E

50|$|What {{we wanted}} to cover was our {{experiences}} of modern Cambodia {{and the history of}} the music that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> referencing. <b>We</b> wanted to try and tell some of the story of the Cambodia of the ’60s and ’70s. <b>We</b> had <b>been</b> excited by the songs that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>hearing</b> and it didn’t feel right to rap just anything over it. We wanted for new listeners to understand something about Cambodia and the music.|$|R

"The doctor {{seemed no}} {{better able to}} account for the change for the worse in his patient than <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> <b>Hearing</b> her {{complain}} of thirst, he gave her some milk. Not long after taking it she was sick. The sickness appeared to relieve her. She soon grew drowsy and slumbered. Mr. Gale left us, with strict injunctions to send for him instantly if she was taken ill again.|$|R
50|$|Pinchbeck {{was also}} {{featured}} in the 2008 video 2012: Science or Superstition, a documentary describing how much of what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> is science {{and how much is}} superstition.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his speech}} to the delegates in Budapest, Singer said to [...] "every anti-Semite, every neo-Nazi, every anti-Israel: we are {{watching}} you, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> you, we are reading you, {{and we will not}} allow you to continue spreading hatred and bigotry. We Jews are united, and we will prevail." ...|$|E

"Despite what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing,</b> and {{considering}} the public {{track record of}} this administration, I simply do not believe their claims that the NSA's spying program is really limited to foreign communications or is otherwise consistent with the NSA's charter or with FISA ... And unlike the controversy over targeted wiretaps of individuals' phone calls, this potential spying appears to be applied wholesale {{to all sorts of}} Internet communications of countless citizens." ...|$|E
5000|$|Forster later said, [...] "This was {{obviously}} the most commercial thing we'd ever done, {{and it came}} out around October '88, which caught the summer here. It was re-released in summer and it sat fantastically on Australian summer radio and then it sat well on English summer radio. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> walking around Soho and we'd hear it on the radio, every jean shop and café. It was on Radio 1 and so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>hearing</b> it as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> walking around." ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> foreigners’ {{views of}} Italy[...] [...] [...] however, Capriccio Italien has great power, even though it’s {{practically}} a pops piece, Tchaikovsky {{knows what the}} instruments can do in a virtuoso way. He brings them to their limit in the most thrilling fashion. He has a gift for mixing families of instruments just right - like cantabile strings along with mighty brass. I hear the ballet element in everything Tchaikovsky writes, in his sense of rhythm. You can practically dance to both these scores! ...|$|E
50|$|Joe makes {{a concerted}} effort {{at this point and}} the woman’s voice drops to a whisper. She makes Joe imagine the girl lying there, {{describing}} events in erotic terms: “… part the lips … solitaire … Breasts in the stones …Imagine the hands … What are they fondling? … There’s love for you …” Another change Beckett made here was to add in a greater degree of repetition, particularly the word “imagine” emphasising that what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> here is primarily a work of imagination rather than simple recollection.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes! Razumov. <b>We</b> have <b>been</b> <b>hearing</b> {{of nothing}} but Mr. Razumov for months. For my part, I confess I would rather have seen Haldin on this spot instead of Mr. Razumov." ...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the time}} [...] "Memphis" [...] was first broadcast, {{in the spring}} of 1963, Mack was touring with Troy Seals. [...] "I cut 'Memphis' and left the next week. While <b>we</b> <b>was</b> on the road, 'Memphis' became a hit. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> playing the Peppermint Lounge in Miami, and some people came down from Hamilton (Ohio) and said, 'That's all <b>we</b> <b>been</b> <b>hearing</b> (on the car radio) all the way down here.'" [...] "I was {{completely}} taken by surprise. I hadn't listened to the radio. I {{had no idea what was}} happening".|$|R
5000|$|The South Side of Chicago {{was also}} the birthplace of urban, {{electric}} blues, which was a huge influence on Tumatoe. As a teen, he often visited the legendary market at Maxwell Street to hear live blues. He says, “I first saw Muddy Waters when I <b>was</b> 13. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>hearing</b> that stuff {{all the time and}} just assumed everybody was, too. I knew all the old guys, and I'd see them every day. I can't believe I took that for granted." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Trafficking {{has been}} {{increasing}} massively after the earthquakes. For the sex trafficker, this is the favorable time to go communities and lure women and girls away to India, the Gulf countries and other places, giving them false promises of better opportunities. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> that small girls from the most affected districts are being trafficked in just this way. This is what is happening with these women and girls — please help us {{put a stop to}} it." [...] (Sunita Danuwar's statement after the April 2015 Nepal earthquake) ...|$|E
50|$|The Bible {{says that}} {{the wealth of the}} wicked is stored up for the righteous. It is high time that we have top Christian businessmen, businesswomen, bankers, you know, who are men and women of integrity, running the {{economics}} of our nations. That’s what we are waiting for. That’s part and parcel of transformation. If you look at the Israelites, you know, that’s how they won. And that’s how they are, even today. When we will see that, you know, the talk transport us in the lands. We see, you know, the bankers. We see the people holding the paths. They are believers. We will not have the kind of corruption that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> in our societies.|$|E
5000|$|Clinton, {{one of two}} Democratic presidential {{candidates}} in the 2016 election, {{said in a statement}} that the Trump campaign's [...] "divisive rhetoric" [...] was of [...] "grave concern" [...] and said, [...] "We all have our differences, and we know many people across the country feel angry. We need to address that anger together." [...] The morning after the incident, Clinton said, [...] "The ugly, divisive rhetoric <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> from Donald Trump and the encouragement of violence and aggression is wrong, and it's dangerous. If you play with matches, you're going to start a fire you can't control. That's not leadership. That's political arson." [...] Bernie Sanders, the other Democratic candidate, tweeted: [...] "We will continue to bring people together. We will not allow the Donald Trumps of the world to divide us up." ...|$|E

5000|$|Paul Griffiths delves into Felder's {{ability to}} creatively manage musical inheritances {{and use the}} basic {{elements}} of Western music in fresh and original ways in his liner notes to the 2009 Albany Records release, [...] "BoxMan", [...] Another musical gene these pieces share, already implicated in the above, is their rhythmic dynamism, the way pulses bounce off tight metrical frames. Yet another is the containment of rhythmic—and harmonic—tensions in small motifs, out of which a whole stretch of music can spring, almost as of itself. Like the bouncing octaves and the equally fearless triads, these are character traits that Felder uses as sources not so much of retro reference (though there is that in Memento mori and partial distresstoration) as of freshness and vitality. The electronic world towards which this program moves is also that of the live world <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> all through, an energetic modernity.|$|E
5000|$|Symbols are {{the method}} that the {{unconscious}} uses to communicate important information and guidance to the conscious mind. Fox’s speech {{from the day}} before talks about returning a dead mole to his womblike chamber (with food to last it), an image centred on insertion; {{the first of the}} new day concentrates on the mole (now miraculously alive - “Live I did…) moving through tunnels seeking the way out (in fact the text shifts to a first-person narrative) whereas the final section focuses on Fox’s awareness of his twin’s hunger driving his desperate need for extraction. “Taken together, Fox’s three utterances can be seen to construct a scenario of a self-birth attempted yet blocked.” Maud says he needs to be “opened up”; as he can’t ‘open up’ himself, someone needs to step into that rôle. In Cascando (1962/63) this is what the controller is called, the “Opener”, after his function. His use of the term “passage” to refer to something Fox has said before emphasises that what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> is the “, scrabble” of his “old twin” {{trying to find a way}} out. This culminates in the final cry: “Let me out!” ...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the things}} that film studios are hearing with {{increasing}} frequency is the suggestion that compulsory licenses are a solution to piracy. Those of us at film studios have a lot of concerns about that. The argument <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> is basically: "You can't beat it, so you join it—legalize piracy and then tax it. ...|$|E
5000|$|Miscavige was {{becoming}} extremely {{impatient with the}} process. He used every carrot and stick method he knew to overwhelm the D/Commissioner to grant exemption. We spent {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars to gather intelligence to flank all of this. We even received information from credible sources from the White House. And by near the end of the 1992 <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>hearing</b> that Papa Bush himself - exercising his trademark indecision - was concerned about the effect granting exemption to the Church of Scientology would have on his re-election hopes.|$|R

40|$|Shot on {{a mobile}} phone, Dark Glass {{visually}} recreates a spoken description of family photographs recalled under hypnosis. Although the recollection is compelling, it possesses an inherent instability, {{so that we}} are never quite sure what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> or seeing, something further emphasized by the unsteady nature of the image itself, which lends an apparitional quality to this apparent act of truth telling...|$|E
40|$|In this {{election}} year, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> {{a lot of}} attack humor. We hear that {{the former governor of}} Texas, George W.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this year’s LIBER conference emphasises the {{changing}} missions libraries envisage for the decade ahead and the different skills that are needed to fulfil these missions. However, change - a word <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>hearing</b> often during this week - does not materialise in a void, it does not just happen. There are reasons for the changing world in which libraries need to function and I would like to start by looking at a few of them...|$|E

6000|$|Presently we {{came upon}} half a dozen sheep {{nibbling}} grass in the spray of a stream of clear water that sprang from a rock wall a hundred feet high, {{and all at once}} our ears were startled with a melodious [...] "Lul ... l ... l l l llul-lul-LAhee-o-o-o!" [...] pealing joyously from a near but invisible source, and recognized that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>hearing</b> {{for the first time the}} famous Alpine JODEL in its own native wilds.
