In chapter one we briefly review the basics of Q-theory. In the second chapter we characterise the Q-jump operation in terms of certain two-person games and derive an explicit formula for the Q-jump. This makes clear the similarities between the Q-degrees and the constructibility degrees, the Q-jump operation being a natural generalisation of the sharp operation.

40|$|Abstract. I sketch {{an account}} of causation, showing how several of the main {{features}} of causation—asymmetry, transitivity, and necessitation (and sometimes probability-raising) — arise from the combination of fundamental dynamical laws and a special constraint {{on the structure of}} matter in the past. The necessitation and transitivity of causation are grounded in the fundamental physics, but the causal asymmetry is grounded at the coarse-grained level of macroscopic events and processes. At no single level of description does the physics justify the conditions that are taken to be constitutive of causation. Nevertheless, if <b>we</b> <b>mix</b> <b>our</b> reasoning about the microscopic and macroscopic descriptions, the structure provided by the dynamics and special initial conditions can justify the folk concept of causation to a significant extent, enough to explain why our causal concept works so well even though, at bottom, it is comprised of a patchwork of principles that don’t mesh well. The prominence of causation in twentieth century metaphysics is curious considering it partly stems from a classical theory of interaction by mechanical contact that has long been superceded by more sophisticated physics. Specifically, the idea that a central organizing principle of nature is a causal relation between events is not motivated by a seriou...|$|R

50|$|In Solidarité, Renaud criticizes modern civilization for its 'simplism' -- its {{tendency}} to treat problems in isolation {{rather than as}} interconnected, and to follow one principle {{to the exclusion of}} other, corrective principles. The ills of the modern system of property, for example, are due to a 'simplistic' conception of ownership as absolute: an absolute right of property leads to exploitation and oppression; however, property {{does not have to be}} abolished, but merely corrected by principles of association and the 'distribution of benefits'. Because those who defend the rights of capital and those who defend the rights of labour adopt a 'simplistic' view, they come into violent conflict, but violence in the long run never produces a stable and harmonious social order. Property derives its legitimacy from labour: we have a right to ownership of that with which <b>we</b> have <b>mixed</b> <b>our</b> labour. Natural resources, untouched by human labour, such as land, cannot legitimately be appropriated, however, but can be claimed as instruments of labour by any. The 'societarian' theory of Fourier is designed to recognise, reconcile and organise both of these rights in a harmonious equilibrium. Renaud rejects various rival socialist conceptions such as communism (the collectivisation of property) and egalitarianism (the strictly equal distribution of goods), and proposes to apportion the rewards of industry according to talent, capital and labour. Renaud advocated what he called 'organic solidarity'. The concept of solidarity had a storied history after Renaud, appropriated at times not only by socialists but also by social theorists of French political Catholicism and theorists of the nationalist right.|$|R

In our empirical analysis, we select to study listed clubs from the UK football soccer industry. The professional sports industry is well suited for our purposes since it is labor-intensive, and, human capital turnover is highly regulated, monitored and accounted for.

40|$|Standard {{formulations}} of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) {{are unable to}} resolve mixing at fluid boundaries. We use an error and stability analysis of the generalised SPH equations of motion to prove that {{this is due to}} two distinct problems. The first is a leading order error in the momentum equation. This should decrease with increasing neighbour number, but does not because numerical instabilities cause the kernel to be irregularly sampled. We identify two important instabilities: the clumping instability and the banding instability, and we show that both are cured by a suitable choice of kernel. The second problem is the local mixing instability (LMI). This occurs as particles attempt to mix on the kernel scale, but are unable to due to entropy conservation. The result is a pressure discontinuity at boundaries that pushes fluids of different entropy apart. We cure the LMI by using a weighted density estimate that ensures that pressures are single valued throughout the flow. This also gives a better volume estimate for the particles, reducing errors in the continuity and momentum equations. <b>We</b> demonstrate <b>mixing</b> in <b>our</b> new Optimised Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (OSPH) scheme using a Kelvin Helmholtz instability (KHI) test with density contrast 1 : 2, and the 'blob test' - a 1 : 10 density ratio gas sphere in a wind tunnel - finding excellent agreement between OSPH and Eulerian codes.

This formalism {{provides a}} framework for convective models that guarantees consistency for the chemistry and the energy budget in the flows, allows time-dependence and accounts for {{the interaction of the}} convective motions with the global contraction or expansion of the star. In the one-stream limit the formalism reproduces several existing convective models and allows them to treat the chemistry in the flows. We suggest a version of the formalism that can be implemented easily in a stellar evolution code. We then apply the formalism to convective Urca cores in Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs and compare it to previous studies.
