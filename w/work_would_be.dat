5|$|Tippett {{resolved}} {{that his}} <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an oratorio {{rather than an}} opera. He chose the title from Ein Kind unserer Zeit, a contemporary protest novel by the Austro-Hungarian writer, Ödön von Horváth.|$|E
5|$|In September 2017, the building's owners {{unveiled}} {{plans to}} use much of the building's vacant space. Under the proposal, a museum dedicated {{to the history of}} Times Square would be built on the 15th through 17th floors, and the 18th floor would contain a new observatory. The ground level would also be renovated to provide an expanded entrance to the New York City Subway's Times Square–42nd Street station, which is directly underneath the building. <b>Work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> completed by fall 2018.|$|E

5|$|Offenbach often {{composed}} amidst {{noise and}} distractions. According to Keck, Offenbach would first {{make a note}} of melodies a libretto suggested {{to him in a}} notebook or straight onto the librettist’s manuscript. Next using full score manuscript paper he wrote down vocal parts in the centre, then a piano accompaniment at the bottom possibly with notes on orchestration. When Offenbach felt sure the <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> performed, he began full orchestration, often employing a codified system.|$|E
5|$|Also in March 1941, 91 Squadron moved in, {{equipped}} with Spitfires. Additional dispersals and fighter pens {{as well as}} three new blister hangars were built during 1941. Typhoons were based at Lympne from March 1942 to February 1944 {{to counter the threat}} posed by the Luftwaffe's newly introduced Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and a runway was extended across Otterpool Lane to accommodate the Typhoons. In November 1944, Lympne was downgraded to Emergency Landing Ground status. Consideration was given to building four runways at Lympne, with the longest being , but it was noted that serious demolition <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> required and a number of roads would need to be closed.|$|E
5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film and studio <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts {{producers}} Kenneth Hyman and Phil Feldman {{were interested}} in having Sam Peckinpah rewrite and direct an adventure film called The Diamond Story. A professional outcast due to the production difficulties of his previous film Major Dundee (1965) and his firing from the set of The Cincinnati Kid (1965), Peckinpah's stock had improved following his critically acclaimed work on the television film Noon Wine (1966). An alternative screenplay available at the studio was The Wild Bunch, written by Roy Sickner and Walon Green. At the time, William Goldman's screenplay Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had recently been purchased by 20th Century Fox. It was quickly decided that The Wild Bunch, which had several similarities to Goldman's <b>work,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> produced in order to beat Butch Cassidy to the theaters.|$|E
5|$|In February 1959, formal {{authority}} for beginning construction was granted. However, while Menzies was on holiday, some {{officials from the}} Department of Treasury convinced ministers to withhold money needed for the lake, so {{the start of the}} construction was delayed. Once it started, progress was fast. At its peak, the number of people physically working on the construction in the lakes was between 400 and 500. John Overall, the Commissioner of the NCDC, promised Menzies that the <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> finished within four years, and he succeeded, despite the Prime Minister's scepticism. Equipment was quickly requisitioned.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 1944, the 258 {{men from}} the prison barge were marched to a nearby sports field and lectured by Admiral Wright who told them that troops {{fighting}} on Saipan desperately needed the ammunition {{they were supposed to}} be loading and that continued refusal to <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> treated as mutinous conduct, which carried the death penalty in times of war. Wright, who had seen nearly 400 of his men killed in 1942 in the Battle of Tassafaronga, said that although loading ammunition was risky, death by firing squad was the greater hazard.|$|E
25|$|As {{the name}} implies, Offering 4 {{is one of}} many ritual offerings {{uncovered}} at La Venta, including the four Massive Offerings and four mosaics. Why such <b>works</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> buried continues to generate much speculation.|$|R
50|$|Two notable <b>works</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Undine (ウンディーネ) and Euphoria (ユーフォリア) which {{managed to}} hit the chart {{positions}} in Japan at #25 and #18 respectively. Both are opening theme songs for the anime adaptation of Aria.|$|R

5|$|Ramsay {{was part}} of a {{community}} of poets working in Scots and English. These included William Hamilton of Gilbertfield (c. 1665–1751), Robert Crawford (1695–1733), Alexander Ross (1699–1784), the Jacobite William Hamilton of Bangour (1704–54), socialite Alison Rutherford Cockburn (1712–94), and poet and playwright James Thompson's (1700–48), most famous for the nature poetry of his Seasons. Tobias Smollett (1721–71) was a poet, essayist, satirist and playwright, but {{is best known for his}} picaresque novels, such as The Adventures of Roderick Random (1748) and The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751) for which he is often seen as Scotland's first novelist. His <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a major influence on later novelists such as Thackeray and Dickens.|$|E
5|$|This work {{excludes}} {{elements of}} several dreamings associated with country further south, {{which had been}} included in the painting created by Clifford Possum and his brother a year earlier. The omission led scholar Vivien Johnson to conclude that Warlugulong (1977) portrays a narrower geographic area than the preceding work. The artist also modified some of the iconography, and limited the explanations of the painting, omitting secret-sacred dimensions of the stories to avoid offending other Indigenous men, and in recognition that most of the audience for the <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> uninitiated non-Indigenous people.|$|E
5|$|While {{director}} of photography Paddy Seale and special effects supervisor Derek Meddings handled Thunderbirds Are Go, camera and effects roles for Series Two were delegated to their assistants, Julien Lugrin and Jimmy Elliott. Two unused {{buildings on the}} Slough Trading Estate were purchased to address the increased demands on the production team, combining with the pre-existing puppet workshop and art department and publicity centres to form an AP Films production base of five buildings. Converted by January 1966, one of these former factory units contained new puppet stages, while the other was dedicated to one large sound stage on which all model and effects <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> completed.|$|E
25|$|The {{title of}} Realist was thrust upon me {{just as the}} title of Romantic was imposed upon the men of 1830. Titles have never given a true idea of things: if it <b>were</b> otherwise, the <b>works</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unnecessary.|$|R
50|$|The dispute {{was called}} off on 30 November when the {{employers}} offered that excess hours <b>worked</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> compensated in cash if time-off in lieu was not taken within three months. The wage claim was arbitrated by the Industrial Court.|$|R
50|$|Lev Vygotsky's (1896-1934) {{studies in}} {{developmental}} psychology, which opposed themselves to Ivan Pavlov's <b>works,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> expanded {{in the activity}} theory developed by Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev, Pyotr Zinchenko (a member of Kharkov School of Psychology), and Alexander Luria, a neuropsychologist who developed the first lie detector.|$|R
5|$|His tasks {{included}} finding {{experts to}} examine and report on his collections from the voyage. Darwin proposed to edit these reports, writing his own forewords and notes, and used his contacts to lobby for government sponsorship of publication of these findings as a large book. When a Treasury grant of £1,000 was allocated {{at the end of}} August 1837, Darwin stretched the project to include the geology book that he had conceived in April 1832 at the first landfall in the voyage. He selected Smith, Elder & Co. as the publisher, and gave them unrealistic commitments on the timing of providing the text and illustrations. He assured the Treasury that the <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> good value, as the publisher would only require a small commission profit, and he himself would have no profit. From October he planned what became the multi-volume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle on his collections, and began writing about the geology of volcanic islands.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 Max Weber Sr. {{died two}} months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved. After this, Weber became {{increasingly}} prone to depression, nervousness and insomnia, {{making it difficult for}} him to fulfill his duties as a professor. His condition forced him to reduce his teaching and eventually leave his course unfinished in the autumn of 1899. After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and autumn of 1900, Weber and his wife travelled to Italy {{at the end of the}} year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919. Weber's ordeal with mental illness was carefully described in a personal chronology that was destroyed by his wife. This chronicle was supposedly destroyed because Marianne Weber feared that Max Weber's <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> discredited by the Nazis if his experience with mental illness were widely known.|$|E
5|$|Nowhere was demobilization more of {{a problem}} than at Los Alamos, where there was an exodus of talent. Much {{remained}} to be done. The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> required to make them simpler, safer and more reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were needed now that plutonium was in short supply because of the problems with the reactors. However, uncertainty {{about the future of the}} laboratory made it hard to induce people to stay. Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement. In fact, Bradbury would remain in the post for the next 25 years. Groves attempted to combat the dissatisfaction caused by the lack of amenities with a construction program that included an improved water supply, three hundred houses, and recreation facilities.|$|E
50|$|Other {{long term}} {{proposals}} include the Manchester - Marple Tram Train scheme, {{which was on}} a 'reserve list' of TIF schemes. Significant new infrastructure <b>works</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> required between Piccadilly and Ashburys station, known as 'Piccadilly Link'. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> incorporated within a major mixed-use development by Grangefield Estates, known as 'Chancellor Place', around the former Mayfield Station site.|$|R

5|$|On April 6, 2008, {{a seven-year-old}} boy accidentally started {{a fire in}} a nearby {{campground}} while playing with matches. The fire moved up the riverbank and destroyed the bridge's wooden deck and rails. The county funded a study to determine the feasibility and cost of reconstructing the bridge. The engineers determined that the steel cables and towers most likely did not suffer structural damage and could be reused. The study estimated reconstruction costs at $850,000. The engineers determined the original blueprints, preserved in a museum, were of sufficient quality that only minimal engineering <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> required. The county agreed to direct the effort, but will not fund it with taxpayer money. As replicas do not qualify for historical status, historians are debating if using the original towers and cable is enough for the structure to qualify as historical. Grand County has set up an account for interested parties to donate to the reconstruction effort.|$|E
5|$|The {{team that}} should {{determine}} the necessary engineering work {{and assess the}} car's financial viability {{was put in place}} during mid-1989, working from the TWR workshops. Mike Moreton headed the team, joining TWR to run the XJ220 project. Moreton came from Ford Motorsports where he led the team responsible for the Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth, and was a project manager for the Ford RS200 Group B rally car program. Richard Owen was appointed chief designer, and the remainder of the team was made up of Jaguar and TWR staff, including Pete Dodd, {{the only member of the}} group of twelve responsible for the XJ220 concept. The exterior and interior designers who had worked on the XJ220 prototype, Keith Helfet and Nick Hull, rejoined the project when it became clear that more design <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> needed.|$|E
5|$|When Mackintosh and the depot-laying party {{finally reached}} Cape Evans in mid-June, {{they learned that}} Aurora, with 18 men on board and {{carrying}} most of the shore party's supplies and equipment, had broken loose from its winter mooring during a gale. Ice conditions in McMurdo Sound {{made it impossible for}} the ship to return; the shore party of ten was effectively marooned, with drastically depleted resources. However, most of the stores required for the depots had been landed. Mackintosh therefore resolved that the following season's <b>work</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> carried out to the full: depots would be laid across the Great ice Barrier {{all the way to the}} Beardmore Glacier. The party would seek to make up its lack of supplies and equipment by salvaging the stores left by earlier expeditions, particularly from Captain Scott's recent sojourn at Cape Evans. The entire party pledged its support to this effort, though it would require, wrote Mackintosh, a record-breaking feat of polar travel to accomplish it. However, the long months of preparation were difficult for Mackintosh. The only officer in the party, he found it hard to form close relationships with his companions. His position became increasingly isolated, and subject to the frequent vocal criticisms of Joyce in particular.|$|E

50|$|Often <b>works</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{painted in}} polychrome, basic paints made from pigment and colour powders.
