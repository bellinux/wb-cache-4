Owning a studio helped the band expand creatively, as the duo {{did not need to}} worry about time constraints that would occur with a rented studio. André 3000 observed, [...] "You can sit there and fuck with just a kick and a snare all day long if you want to... You're not working on the clock. [...] Really, you're just <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> mind." [...] Big Boi spent the majority of the recording time in the studio, while André 3000 worked at home, creating beats and experimenting with an acoustic guitar. [...] One song that came from a jam session on the guitar was [...] "Ms. Jackson", the album's second single. [...] André 3000 also created song lyrics by writing words on the walls of his home: [...] "I had planned to paint my house anyway; writing on the walls was just something I would do." [...] One stray lyric on his wall eventually developed into [...] "Gasoline Dreams".|$|E

When he kidnapped me, I lived with him and he gave me a swell time. When I left him, a woman came and interviewed me about it for one of the Sunday papers. Sob stuff. Called the piece 'Even Kidnappers Have Tender Hearts Beneath A Rough Exterior.' I've got it upstairs in my press-clipping album. It was pretty bad slush. Buck Maginnis hasn't got any tender heart beneath his rough exterior, but he's a good sort and I liked him. We used to shoot craps. And he taught me to chew. I'd be tickled to death to have Buck get me again. But, if you're <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own, all right. It's all the same to me, {{provided}} you meet me on the terms." ...|$|E

She also worked {{in a manner similar to}} Plath, writing poetry every day, journaling and also writing to her mother, as Plath often did. The Chicago Tribune reviewed Your Own, Syliva, writing about the novel that [...] "rarely is there such a striking and successful blend of literary form and subject." [...] Your Own, Sylvia also won the Myra Cohn Livingston Award in 2008.|$|E
