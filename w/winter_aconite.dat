Bare white boughs of twisted fig-trees depressed her. Besides, these hills were steep, and Herminia felt the climbing. Nothing in city or suburbs attracted her soul. Etruscan Volumnii, each lolling in white travertine on the sculptured lid of his own sarcophagus urn, and all duly ranged in the twilight of their tomb at their spectral banquet, stirred her heart but feebly. St. Francis, Santa Chiara, fell flat on her English fancy. But as for Alan, he revelled all day long in his native element. He sketched every morning, among the huddled, strangled lanes; sketched churches and monasteries, and portals of palazzi; sketched mountains clear-cut in that pellucid air; till Herminia wondered how he could sit so long in the broiling sun or keen wind on those bare hillsides, or on broken brick parapets in those noisome byways. But your born sketcher is oblivious of all on earth save his chosen art; and Alan was essentially a painter in fibre, diverted by pure circumstance into a Chancery practice.|$|E

50|$|Eranthis (<b>winter</b> <b>aconite)</b> is a genus {{of eight}} species of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family Ranunculaceae (Buttercup family), native to southern Europe and east across Asia to Japan. The common name comes from the early flowering time and the resemblance of the leaves {{to those of the}} related genus Aconitum, the true aconite. Like the notoriously toxic Aconitum (and, indeed, many other genera of the Ranunculaceae) Eranthis is poisonous, although its chemistry is different, the toxic compounds present being mainly cardiac glycosides of the bufadienolide group similar to those found in Adonis vernalis, rather than the extraordinarily virulent alkaloids of Aconitum.|$|E
50|$|Eranthis hyemalis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae, native to calcareous woodland habitats in France, Italy and the Balkans and widely naturalised elsewhere in Europe. It is a tuberous-rooted herbaceous perennial growing to 15 cm, with large (2 - 3 cm), yellow, cup-shaped flowers held above a collar of 3 leaf-like bracts, appearing in late winter and early spring. The six sepals are bright yellow and petaloid and the petals are {{in the form of}} tubular nectaries. There are numerous stamens and usually six unfused carpels. The fruit are follicles each containing several seeds. It is commonly known as <b>winter</b> <b>aconite,</b> and is valued in cultivation as one of the earliest of all flowers to appear. E. hyemalis and the sterile hybrid cultivar 'Guinea Gold' have both gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plant name}} Aconite may refer to two plant genera {{in the family}} Ranunculaceae, namely Aconitum and Eranthis, {{although}} Eranthis is known more usually as <b>Winter</b> <b>Aconite.</b> The plants used in the brewing of Chhaang in Baltistan and Ladakh are, however, almost certainly referable to Aconitum species, which {{have a long history}} of use in the folk medicinal systems of Asia. Aconitum species are amongst the most virulently poisonous plants known, containing a variety of extremely toxic alkaloids, including aconitine and pseudaconitine. The use of Aconitum as an additive in beer-brewing is therefore a practice fraught with the danger of fatal poisoning and should on no account be undertaken by any individual attempting to replicate a traditional Chhaang recipe. Although individual Aconitum species vary somewhat in the degree of their toxicity, all are poisonous and, when used in traditional herbal medicine, are invariably pre-treated in various ways intended to minimise their toxicity, while retaining their assumed therapeutic properties. Nevertheless, numerous fatalities have occurred resulting from such medicinal use e.g. in certain Chinese medicinal soups consumed for their supposed tonic effects, which include augmenting physical strength, boosting the immune system, and dispelling 'wind' and 'dampness' ...|$|E
40|$|Eranthis hyemalis {{belongs to}} the Ranunculaceae family whose representatives enrich early spring pollen flow and nectar for pollinating insects. Flowering biology and {{morphological}} characteristics flowers of <b>winter</b> <b>aconite</b> were studied. The forage value was estimated as the rate of nectar production. Observations were carried out between 2008 and 2011 in the Botanical Garden of the Maria Curie-Skłodowska University located in the Lublin area. In the conditions of Lublin, flowering of <b>winter</b> <b>aconite</b> plants started {{at the beginning of}} February and lasted until the end of March. The seasonal bloom dynamics was strongly affected by maximum temperatures, which intensified flower blooming, and snowfalls which hampered this process. During the day, flowers opened between 8. 00 am and 3. 00 pm, but the highest intensity was between 10. 00 am and 12. 00 am. The process of pollen release, with the average number of 29 stamens shedding pollen in the flowers, lasted from 2 to 3 days. During the day the largest number of anthers opened at noon hours, between 11. 00 am and 1. 00 pm, though a certain rise in this number was also observed in the morning hours between 8. 00 and 9. 00 am. Eranthis hyemalis flowers develop funnel-shaped nectaries, on average 3 - 6 per flower. The determined amount of nectar per flower was 1. 23 mg, while the concentration of sugars in it averaged 72. 11 %. The weight of nectar sugar per flower was 0. 88 mg...|$|E
40|$|A lectin was {{isolated}} from root tubers of <b>winter</b> <b>aconite</b> (Eranthis hyemalis) by affinity chromatography on fetuin-agarose, {{and it was}} partially characterized with respect to its biochemical, physicochemical and carbohydrate-binding properties. The Eranthis hyemalis lectin is a dimeric protein (Mr 62000) composed of two different subunits of Mr 30000 and 32000, held together by disulphide bonds. It is especially rich in asparagine/aspartic acid, glutamine/glutamic acid and leucine, and contains 5 % covalently bound carbohydrate. Hapten inhibition assays indicated that the winter-aconite lectin is specific for N-acetylgalactosamine. In addition, the lectin exhibits a pronounced specificity towards blood-group-O erythrocytes. The winter-aconite lectin is the first lectin to be isolated from a species belonging to the plant family Ranunculaceae. It appears {{to be different from}} all previously described plant lectins. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The lectin {{found in}} the tubers of the <b>Winter</b> <b>Aconite</b> (Eranthis hyemalis) plant is an N-acetyl-D-galactosamine {{specific}} Type II Ribosome Inactivating Protein (RIP); Type II RIPs have shown anti-cancer properties, and hence have potential as therapeutic agents. Here we present a modified protocol for the extraction and purification of the E. hyemalis lectin (EHL) using affinity chromatography. De novo amino acid sequencing of EHL confirms its classification as a Type II Ribosome Inactivating Protein. The biocidal properties of EHL have been investigated against the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Arrested first stage larvae treated with EHL have shown some direct mortality, with surviving larvae subsequently showing a range of phenotypes including food avoidance, reduced fecundity, developmental delay and constitutive dauer larvae formation. Both inappropriate dauer larvae development and failure to locate to bacterial food source {{are consistent with the}} disruption of chemosensory function and the ablation of amphid neurons. Further investigation indicates that mutations that disrupt normal amphid formation can block the EHL-induced dauer larvae formation. In combination, these phenotypes indicate that EHL is cytotoxic and suggest a cell specific activity against the amphid neurons of C. elegans...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} upon the bioelectric potential across the plasma membrane in cells of tepals of Eranthis hyemalis (L.) Salisb. (<b>Winter</b> <b>aconite)</b> is described. Rapid warming of an intact tepal {{resulted in a}} transient small increase in the magnitude of transmembrane potential difference followed by a substantial long-lasting depolarization which is considered as an "anomalous" response. Upon rapid cooling the reverse response occurred: a small transient depolarization {{was followed by a}} substantial hyperpolarization (also an anomalous response). The anomalous responses were more pronounced in the epidermis on the abaxial side of the tepal than in that on the adaxial side, indicating an electrophysiological dorsiventrality of the tepals. The anomalous responses were much less apparent in cells of isolated tissues than in cells of intact tepals. This difference does not appear to result from wounding or bringing a tissue into direct contact with the external solution because in segments of tepals devoid of the abaxial epidermis only, the PD of the parenchyma behaved in a way {{similar to that of the}} intact tepals. It is suggested that the occurrence of the anomalous responses is modulated by the tissue stresses. The functional importance of the responses for thermonastic movements is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Lectin are {{proteins}} which play {{an important}} role in the defence mechanisms of plants against the attack of microorganisms and insects: this role has provoked particular interest in the fields of biotechnology and agriculture. This paper describes the extraction and purification of the lectin found in tubers of the <b>winter</b> <b>aconite</b> (Eranthis hyemalis), with the aim of improving and modernising the existing extraction protocol. The Eranthis hyemalis lectin (EHL) is a member of the type- 2 Ribosome Inactivating Proteins (RIP) family, proteins which have the ability to inhibit in vitro protein synthesis. RIPs have been linked to plant defence by their antiviral, antifungal and insecticidal properties, and some have been found to be potent inhibitors of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus- 1 (HIV- 1) virus. EHL was purified using affinity column chromatography and ammonium sulphate precipitation; thiourea was used as antioxidant in order to prevent EHL denaturing during the extraction process. The presence of EHL in the extract was verified using a blood agglutination test with rabbit erythrocytes. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis was employed to determine the lectin size; EHL was found to be formed of two chains with molecular weights of approximately 31 kDa; the size of the whole protein was estimated as approximately 60 kDa. The concentration of the EHL in the post-column eluent, determined using the Bradford Assay, was 380. 1 μg. cm- 3. This improved extraction protocol is the first step which will enable future research on the potential use of EHL in crop protection, by studying its insecticidal, fungicidal and bactericidal properties...|$|E
