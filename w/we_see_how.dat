500|$|Bamboo Dong from Anime News Network {{was more}} {{critical}} of the character, calling her [...] "a blank slate". She said Akane is [...] "uninteresting and forgettable, and her previous role in the show as the moral compass seems to have waned as well". Chris Beveridge from The Fandom Post was more optimistic; he said, [...] "Akane provides a good voice for this, since she’s new to it all and wants to bring nuance to the numbers and the situations, but <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> experience plays out against her at times, but also that she does have something to offer with it".|$|E

500|$|... "The Way We Was" [...] is {{the twelfth}} episode of The Simpsons second season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on January 31, 1991. In the episode, Marge {{tells the story of}} how she and Homer first met and fell in love. Flashing back to 1974, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> Homer falls in love with Marge in high school and tries to get close to her by enlisting her as his French tutor. After several hours of verb conjugation, Marge falls for Homer too, only to become enraged when he admits that he is not a French student. Marge rejects Homer's invitation to the prom and goes with Artie Ziff. Artie {{turns out to be a}} terrible date and Marge realizes that it is Homer she really wants.|$|E
2500|$|One {{rational}} {{tendency is}} towards increasing {{the efficiency and}} output of the human body. Several means can be employed in reaching this end, including trends towards regular exercise, dieting, increased hygiene, drugs, and an emphasis on optimal nutrition. As well as increasing lifespans, these allow for stronger, leaner, more optimized bodies for quickly performing tasks. [...] Another aspect of this is maintaining {{a certain level of}} physical attraction. Processes such as the combing of hair, use of a fragrance, having an appropriate haircut, and wearing certain clothes receive calculated use, that of giving off a certain impression to other individuals. In these cases, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> rationalization does produce meaning and is not just simply a way to speed things up, i.e., a fat person is said to have poor self-control and discipline and thus you can now make personal judgments about them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect of}} {{profound}} {{shifts in the}} agricultural practices of the United States, and the disappearance of traditional agrarian life, {{are some of the}} major concerns of the Port William fiction, though the theme is often only a background or subtext to the stories themselves. The Port William fiction attempts to portray, on a local scale, what [...] "a human economy … conducted with reverence" [...] looked like in the past—and what civic, domestic, and personal virtues might be evoked by such an economy were it pursued today. Social as well as seasonal changes mark the passage of time. The Port William stories allow Berry to explore the human dimensions of the decline of the family farm and farm community, under the influence of expanding post-World War II agribusiness. But these works rarely fall into simple didacticism, and are never merely tales of decline. Each is grounded in a realistic depiction of character and community. In A Place on Earth (1967), for example, farmer Mat Feltner comes to terms with the loss of his only son, Virgil. In the course of the novel, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> not only Mat but the entire community wrestles with the acute costs of World War II.|$|E
