5|$|Eighteenth-century prisons were {{effectively}} lodging houses. Poorly {{maintained and}} often filthy, they might {{consist of a}} couple of rooms in a cellar. Before the Gaols Act 1823, then the Prisons Act of 1835 and 1877, they were administered by the royal household, the aristocracy and the bishops, and run for profit by private individuals <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> right to manage and make money from them.|$|E
5|$|The 181-room hotel, {{opened in}} 1902, was {{designed}} by architect Goldwin Starrett. It was originally conceived as a residential hotel but was quickly converted to a traditional lodging establishment. Its first owner-manager, Frank Case (<b>who</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> hotel in 1927), established many of the hotel's traditions. Perhaps its best-known tradition is hosting literary and theatrical notables, most prominently {{the members of the}} Algonquin Round Table.|$|E

5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 {{found that the}} roof was cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, and covered with clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961.

5|$|Bubbles (born April 30, 1983) is {{a common}} chimpanzee, known for being the {{one-time}} companion animal of American recording artist Michael Jackson, <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> primate from a Texas research facility in the early 1980s. The animal was a frequent travel companion to the singer, whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery and, among other factors, a public perception of Jackson as eccentric. During the Bad world tour, for example, Jackson brought Bubbles with him to Japan, where they both drank tea with the mayor of Osaka.|$|E

Owners of Just Cause 2 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, or PC received automatic access to a Sleeping Dogs character outfit {{in the style of}} Just Cause 2 protagonist Rico Rodriguez. The outfit increases the player's action hijack statistics and increases the range from which the player can perform stunt takeovers of enemy vehicles.|$|E
5|$|His {{library and}} {{collections}} {{were left to}} his widow Sara and their children. Joseph Banks, an English botanist, wanted to buy the collection, but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala. In 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried {{to sell it to}} Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, James Edward Smith, <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books.

5|$|John Preston Hippisley {{inherited}} {{the house in}} 1956 {{on the death of}} his father Richard John Bayntun Hippisley and in order to settle the liability for inheritance tax he sold Ston Easton. Subsequently maintenance of the building was poor and the fabric decayed. In 1958 a Preservation Order was obtained to stop the building being demolished and adding to the growing trend of destruction of country houses in 20th-century Britain. Restoration was undertaken by William Rees-Mogg <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> building in 1964. Peter Smedley bought it from Rees-Mogg in 1977 or 1978 and carried out further restoration and converted it into a hotel. Notoriously he allowed the BBC to film his Dignitas assisted suicide. The house was sold again in 2001 to Von Essen Hotels.|$|E
5|$|New {{purchases}} {{of the game}} are provided with a one-time use card granting access code that unlocks the game's Cerberus Network, an online downloadable content and news service that enables bonus content for the game. However, users <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> game used {{would have to pay}} for the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content. This policy allows publishers to combat the used-game market; companies like GameStop have allowed costumers to sell used games back to the retailer so that the company can resell them at a small discount to other customers, but the publisher does not make a profit. BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11% of all Mass Effect 2s downloadable content revenue came from the Cerberus Network. The policy attracted criticism from some of the fan community, who have criticized downloadable content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{cochineal}} {{was widely}} traded in Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. In the 15th and 16th centuries, along with grain, timber, and salt, {{it was one}} of Poland's chief exports, mainly to southern Germany and northern Italy as well as to France, England, the Ottoman Empire, and Armenia. In Poland, the cochineal trade was mostly monopolized by Jewish merchants, <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> dye from peasants in Red Ruthenia and other regions of Poland and Lithuania. The merchants shipped the dye to major Polish cities such as Kraków, Gdańsk (Danzig), and Poznań. From there, the merchandise was exported to wholesalers in Breslau (Wrocław), Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Augsburg, Venice, and other destinations. The Polish cochineal trade was a lucrative business for the intermediaries; according to Marcin of Urzędów (1595), one pound of Polish cochineal cost between four and five Venetian pounds. In terms of quantities, the trade reached its peak in the 1530s. In 1534, 1963 stones (about 30 metric tons) of the dye were sold in Poznań alone.|$|E

Other family members were James Watson Webb (father of Henry Walter Webb), a diplomat, newspaper publisher and New York politician; General Samuel Blatchley Webb (father of James Watson Webb), an aide to George Washington; and businessman William Seward Webb (brother of Henry Walter Webb), {{founder and president of}} the Sons of the American Revolution.

Morgan, lived at Woodlea in Scarborough with his wife Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt Shepard and their children.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{grew from}} {{strength}} to strength and by 1907 the congregation numbered 150, with school attendance at 60. In time plans {{were made for}} a larger, more permanent church. This {{was the brainchild of}} Father Thomas Moloney, <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> current presbytery and acquired the land that stood at the back so that a church could be built. The foundation stone was eventually laid on Low Sunday 1931 by Archbishop Alban Goodier, an English Jesuit who had been Archbishop of Bombay between 1919 and 1926. The new church, in Oxford Road, was designed by the diocesan architect, T. H. B. Scott. It was built of brick in the Romanesque style, seating 350. The church was built quickly and opened by Cardinal Bourne on 29 September 1931. It was officially consecrated on 14 May 1936, after its debts were cleared.|$|E
5|$|Before Little's purchase, the punchbowl {{had been}} the {{property}} of Sir Timothy Augustine Coghlan, New South Wales Agent-General in London, <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> bowl for ₤40 in 1923 from one Miss Hall for his own collection. The bowl was subsequently {{in the possession of}} Francis Edwards Ltd before Coghlan's unexpected death in London on 30April 1926. Coghlan had personally collected the bowl from a Miss Hall at 'Highfield', 63 Seabrook Rd, Hythe (Kent), England, a few months after she had decided to offer the bowl to the New South Wales Government for ₤50. Earlier, a visit to Miss Hall by a Sydney schoolteacher, Jessie Stead, on 6August 1923, resulted in the proposal that the bowl ought to be the property of the City of Sydney. Jessie Stead later indicated that she was informed by Miss Hall that her father had acquired the bowl in the late 1840s – the earliest dating for the punchbowls' provenance – and that Miss Hall believed the bowl was commissioned for William Bligh, New South Wales's fourth Governor (in office 1806–1808). In 2002, the State Library of New South Wales digitised the punchbowl images {{with the support of the}} Nelson Meers Foundation, a philanthropic foundation supporting Australian arts, and the bowl became one of the 100 extraordinary library objects to be exhibited as part of Mitchell Library's centenary celebrations in 2010.|$|E

5|$|The legal Underbelly DVD was {{released}} 8 May 2008 by Roadshow Entertainment, {{a day after}} the final episode was aired on television. In accordance with the legal suppression, the release was not distributed through any retail or rental outlets in Victoria or on the internet. Roadshow Entertainment has confirmed that all box sets and point of sale displays will carry a sticker or stamp reminding buyers the series is not for sale, distribution or exhibition in Victoria. Legal experts said Victorians <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> box set interstate and watched it themselves at home would likely not fall foul of the law, but anyone who showed it more widely could be charged with contempt. The DVD has sold 265,000 copies around Australia. In September 2008, a Limited Edition DVD {{was released}}, containing a numbered steel case and an extra disc with a documentary entitled Carl Williams– A Day of Reckoning. The Underbelly soundtrack was released on 29 March 2008, both as a CD and online. It features elements of the score by Burkhard Dallwitz in addition to music tracks that were featured in the series.

5|$|In June 2015, Valve {{created a}} formal process to allow purchasers to request full refunds on games they had {{purchased}} on Steam for any reason, with refunds guaranteed {{within the first}} two weeks as long as the player had not spent more than two hours in the game. Prior to June 2015, Valve had a no-refunds policy, but allowed them in certain circumstances, such as if third-party content had failed to work or improperly reports on certain features. For example, the Steam version of From Dust was originally stated to have a single, post-installation online DRM check with its publisher Ubisoft, but the released version of the game required a DRM check with Ubisoft's servers each time it was used. At the request of Ubisoft, Valve offered refunds to customers <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> game while Ubisoft worked to release a patch that would remove the DRM check altogether. On The War Zs release, players found that the game was still in an alpha-build state and lacked many of the features advertised on its Steam store page. Though the developers Hammerpoint Interactive altered the description after launch to reflect {{the current state of the}} game software, Valve removed the title from Steam and offered refunds to those who had bought it. Valve also removed Earth: Year 2066 from the Early Access program and offered refunds after discovering that the game's developers had reused assets from other games and used developer tools to erase negative complaints about the title. Valve stated it would continue to work on improving the discovery process for users, taking principles they learned in providing transparency for matchmaking in Dota 2 to make the process better, and using that towards Steam storefront procedures to help refine their algorithms with user feedback.|$|E
