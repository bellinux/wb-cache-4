Some team members faced charges for breaching the APEC zone, but these were dropped because police had allowed their entry into the restricted zone. Other less controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on The Chaser's War on Everything, with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC <b>wrap-up</b> episode.|$|E

[...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

[...] He added, [...] "This is a horribly messy piece of work that somehow gets {{to the heart of}} madness, and it's occasionally a starkly beautiful piece about survivor's guilt." [...] About the episode, Matt Fowler of IGN stated, [...] "Not that anything was overtly awful, but the pacing was such that you could just never get a hold on what was going on." [...] He added, [...] "I also don't want to fully penalize a show for pulling out all the stops and taking me on a completely unexpected journey." ...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{telecast}} of the Olympics on Canadian {{television was}} CBC's {{broadcast of the}} 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. CBC aired black-and-white highlights of the previous day's events and aired the Canada vs. Soviet Union hockey game live by leasing a standby circuit from CBS and making CBC's 1st winter Olympics in the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, USA. Critics compared CBC's overall Olympic coverage unfavourably to that of ABC, which broadcast same-day colour highlights throughout the Games. For the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy, CBC produced a total of 17 hours of radio and TV coverage for the 1960 Summer Olympics. CBC Television broadcast same-day highlights each night. The half-hour package featured was provided by CBS Sports, which had the broadcast rights in the United States. CBS sportscasters Bud Palmer, Gil Stratton, and Bob Richards provided commentary. CBS sent videotapes of each day's events by jet to Idlewild Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport) in New York City where a mobile transmission unit there beamed the pictures to the CBC and CBS networks.

40|$|Background:  Medical {{educators}} {{sometimes have}} to respond to inappropriate behaviours from doctors in training that {{have the potential to}} endanger their future careers and affect the safety and well-being of their patients. The authors led workshops at international meetings using case-based discussion and plenary <b>wrap-ups</b> to reinforce and share the learning outcomes. This paper summarises key points of difference and common themes about how to manage challenging professional behaviours presented by doctors in training that may be of value to tutors and clinical educators. Context:  Although the problems encountered had elements in common, experiences varied between countries, schools and programmes as regards processes, procedures and thresholds for launching an investigation. Whereas variations are not unexpected {{it is important to consider}} the context and background against which decisions are made. Appropriate responses must take account of professional, legal and ethical guidelines, where they exist. Implications:  Major inconsistencies in hearings and investigations may not be in anyone’s best interests: fairness is core to most notions of justice, whether from the perspective of a doctor in training, clinical educator or member of the public. Therefore, schools and programmes need to take this into account when reviewing processes and procedures. Although the career of a doctor in training is important, it is not the only consideration. If systems fail the public has a right to be concerned, and striving to ensure that medical students graduate to become safe, professional doctors is something of concern to all clinical educators...|$|R
