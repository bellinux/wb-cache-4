30|$|When {{taking a}} life cycle perspective, <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> {{in the use}} phase clearly {{dominate}} the overall result (Fig.  8 b). <b>Water</b> <b>savings</b> in the United Kingdom are highest, as the avoided production of thermal energy from natural gas shows a relatively high water intensity compared to Germany and China. With regard to avoided impacts resulting from <b>water</b> <b>savings,</b> Fig.  8 c shows that <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in China lead to a significantly higher benefit than the <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in Germany or in the United Kingdom.

40|$|Background: People's {{behaviors}} and intentions about healthy behaviors {{depend on their}} beliefs, values, and knowledge about the issue. Various models of health education are used in deter-mining predictors of different healthy behaviors but their efficacy in cultural behaviors, such as <b>water</b> <b>saving</b> behaviors, are not studied. The {{study was conducted to}} explain <b>water</b> <b>saving</b> beha-viors in Yazd, Iran on the basis of Health Belief Model and Reasoned Action Theory. Methods: The cross-sectional study used random cluster sampling to recruit 200 heads of households to collect the data. The survey questionnaire was tested for its content validity and reliability. Analysis of data included descriptive statistics, simple correlation, hierarchical multiple regression. Results: Simple correlations between <b>water</b> <b>saving</b> {{behaviors and}} Reasoned Action Theory and Health Belief Model constructs were statistically significant. Health Belief Model and Reasoned Action Theory constructs explained 20. 80 % and 8. 40 % of the variances in <b>water</b> <b>saving</b> beha-viors, respectively. Perceived barriers were the strongest Predictor. Additionally, there was a sta-tistically positive correlation between <b>water</b> <b>saving</b> behaviors and intention. Conclusion: In designing interventions aimed at water waste prevention, barriers of <b>water</b> <b>saving</b> behaviors should be addressed first, followed by people's attitude towards <b>water</b> <b>saving.</b> Health Belief Model constructs, with the exception of perceived severity and benefits, is more powerful than is Reasoned Action Theory in predicting <b>water</b> <b>saving</b> behavior and may be used as a framework for educational interventions aimed at improving <b>water</b> <b>saving</b> behaviors...|$|R

The main {{aim of this}} paper is to explore the irrigating behaviour of farmers examining factors affecting their decision to adopt novel <b>water</b> <b>saving</b> practices. In order to achieve the above aim both summary statistics and multivariate methodologies are employed. In particular, a two-step cluster analysis was used to explore the different adoption levels of <b>water</b> <b>saving</b> practices and a categorical regression model was estimated to explain this variation.

40|$|Majority of the {{investigations}} on rainwater harvesting focused on sizing and potential <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> including studies proposing different methods of estimating rainwater tank outcomes. Several studies used monthly rainfall data to estimate rainwater tank outcomes. However, quantification using daily rainfall {{data will be}} much more accurate compared to using monthly rainfall data. A vast majority of works using daily rainfall data used daily water balance model for analysis. Again most of the studies using daily water balance model used historical rainfall data, calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> for many years and then presented an average of all the calculated years’ total outcome(s). ‘Raintank Analyser’ is a tool, which uses the same methodology and widely used; used by the South Australian policy makers for producing relevant design charts. In contrast, eTank, a daily water balance model was developed to produce potential rainwater savings, augmented townwater supply, tank overflow, reliability and payback period for three distinct climate conditions (dry, average and wet years). This paper presents comparison of eTank calculated potential <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> with those calculated by ‘Raintank Analyser’ under similar conditions for a rainfall station in central Adelaide. In general, ‘Raintank Analyser’ produced <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> are very close to the eTank calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in average year. However, through the eTank produced potential <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in dry and wet years, it is found that significant climatic variations exist. Magnitudes of climatic variations under different scenario are presented. Again, to assess spatial variability, three more rainfall stations from different regions of Adelaide metropolitan were selected. eTank was used to calculated potential <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in three climatic conditions (dry, average and wet years) for various combinations of roof and tank sizes. Again it is found that depending input variable conditions (tank size, roof area and climate) significant spatial variations exist within some of the regions. Also, it is found that potential <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> not only depends on total rainfall amount of a particular area, but also on other input conditions; i. e. under similar conditions an area with lower annual rainfall may provide higher <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> due to rainfall pattern...|$|R

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{population}} and ever-increasing water demand water authorities of many highly populated cities {{are struggling to}} maintain potable water supply for the residents. Without effective measure(s) the situation is expected to get worse day by day. To reduce the potable water demand, several methods/systems were proposed; rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse, recycled (treated) water supply and using water efficient appliances. Among all the water harvesting and recycling systems, Rain Water Harvesting System (RWHS) {{is considered to be}} the most effective, reliable and safe if used for non-potable purposes. Rainwater tank is the most common form among all the rainwater harvesting systems. For many remote communities rainwater tank is essential as they have to buy expensive bottle water for daily consumptions. In some urban areas due to lack of resources authorities are unable to provide continuous water supply. Even among urban communities where efficient urban water supply exist, rainwater tank is increasingly being used for non-potable purposes (i. e. garden irrigation, toilet flushing, cloth washing etc.) to reduce potable water consumptions. RWHS comprises with a rainwater collection surface (eg. roof), water storage (eg. water tank), pumping system for distribution and other accessories (eg. first flush diverter, overflow). However, optimisation of this system both in <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> and reliability is a challenge. Various studies and methods of analyses have been used in this regard. Among methods of analysing RWHS, a daily water balance method is most feasible and reasonably accurate. However, most of the relevant past studies using daily data used continuous simulations of historical daily rainfall for a long period, which provides single averaged outcomes (i. e. <b>water</b> <b>savings,</b> reliability, overflow etc.). Through such analysis of averaged variables, rainwater tank users do not get an adequate insight of the expected realistic situation(s) in regards to variability of outcomes. With the impacts of climate change, such ranges of realistic outcomes are expected to be widening further. This paper presents analyses from a recently developed daily water balance model (eTank), which calculates rainwater tank outcomes under three different climatic conditions (i. e. dry, average and wet years). To investigate the climatic variability fifteen representative years (five for each dry, average and wet conditions) were selected from historical rainfall data collected from a coastal site (Sydney Observatory Hill) of an Australian major city, Sydney. Calculated expected annual rainwater savings were compared with the calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> generated by widely used tool, 'Raintank Analyser', which uses historical daily rainfall data for many years and presents an average of all the calculated years' cumulative <b>water</b> <b>savings.</b> It is found that 'Raintank Analyser' calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> closely match with the eTank calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in average year, which is reasonable and ascertains eTank's accuracy. However, significant climatic variations in <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> are expected for the particular location as calculated by eTank. Also, eTank calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> were compared with the published results from another continuous simulation type water balance model, CSWBM for the same rainfall station for large roofs. Calculations were performed considering same conditions in regard to daily rainwater demand, roof area, losses and tank volume. It is found that CSWBM produced <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> significantly vary with the eTank calculated water savings; for smaller tank sizes CSWBM calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> are even lower than the eTank calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in dry year, whereas for larger tank sizes CSWBM calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> are closer to the eTank calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in wet year. In reality, continuous simulation type water balance model results should be closer to the eTank calculated results in dry years. CSWBM calculated reliabilities were compared with the eTank calculated reliabilities in different climatic conditions. Again, it is found that CSWBM calculated reliabilities significantly vary with the eTank calculated reliabilities; for larger tank sizes CSWBM calculated reliabilities are much higher than the eTank calculated reliabilities even in wet year, which is not realistic. Presented comparisons reveals the fact that users should be cautious in using such computational tool(s) as some of these tools may produce erroneous results...|$|R

In response to the water crisis, China's government has begun in recent years to invest in research on techniques to save water in the agricultural sector, although there is a debate about the extent of success in adoption by farmers. Top policy makers have publicly stated they would allocate billions of dollars in funding if they knew it would succeed in <b>saving</b> <b>water.</b> Unfortunately, there has been relatively little research in China on the economics of <b>water</b> <b>saving</b> technology and there is almost no systematic information on the extent to which the technologies have been adopted, if they are appearing to save water, and the characteristics of the communities that have been adopting them.
