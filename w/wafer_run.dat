40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{architecture}} of an intelligent test error detection agent that is able to independently supervise the test process. By means of rationally applied bin and cause specific retests it should detect and correct the majority of test errors with minimal additional test effort. To achieve this, the agent utilizes test error models learned from historical example data to rate single <b>wafer</b> <b>runs.</b> The resulting run specific test error hypotheses are sequentially combined with information gained from regular and ordered retests in order to infer and update a global test error hypothesis. Based on this global hypothesis the agent decides if a test error exists, what its most probable cause is and which bins are affected. Consequently, {{it is able to}} initiate proper retests to check the inferred hypothesis and if necessary correct the affected test runs. The paper includes a description of the general architecture and discussions about possible test error models, the inference approach to generate the test error hypotheses from the given information and a possible set of rules to act upon the inferred hypothesis...|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} {{of an experiment}} {{with this type of}} sampling plan is generally to reduce the variability due to sites on the wafers and <b>wafers</b> within <b>runs</b> (or batches) in the process.

40|$|Techniques {{related with}} {{abbreviations}} like PiP, SiP, PIC, MCM etc. indicate that passive devices in systems are still of importance. As well increasing process complexity in technology migration towards deep submicron stimulates a System-on-Chip (SoC) versus System-in-Package (SiP) discussion for systems including passive elements. Passive devices are today mainly based on ceramic substrates and assembled into packages, modules or systems as discrete elements. Future integration concepts ask for reduction of system integration space and subsequent e. g. for chip-stacking. Silicon based passive devices can support an "all-components-on-silicon" concept. Therefore lateral- and trench-type capacitors have been investigated. The results of first research <b>wafer</b> <b>runs</b> show good electrical characteristics concerning e. g. breakdown voltage and Q-factor up to GHz frequency range. Concerning trench-type capacitors {{the reduction of}} the equivalent series resistance was addressed by t he development of an innovative metal-filled trench process. As a third topic a basic study was done in the area of micro inductors. The focus of the study was set on lithography of thick film material.
