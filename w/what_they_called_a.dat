Pakistan's foreign secretary Salman Bashir later confirmed that Pakistani military had scrambled F-16s after they became aware of the attack but that they reached the compound after American helicopters had left.|$|E

25|$|In 1988 several vendors, {{mostly from}} the Unix and {{database}} communities, formed the SQL Access Group (SAG) {{in an effort to}} produce a single basic standard for the SQL language. At the first meeting there was considerable debate over whether or not the effort should work solely on the SQL language itself, or attempt a wider standardization which included a dynamic SQL language-embedding system as well, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> Call Level Interface (CLI). While attending the meeting with an early draft of what was then still known as MS Data Access, Kyle Geiger of Microsoft invited Jeff Balboni and Larry Barnes of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to join the SQLC meetings as well. SQLC was a potential solution to the call for the CLI, which was being led by DEC.|$|E
25|$|In {{the midst}} of their {{apparent}} success, the members of TLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 3, 1995. TLC declared debts totaling $3.5 million, some of it due to Lopes' insurance payments arising from the arson incident and Watkins' medical bills, but the primary reason being that the group received <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> less than favorable deal from Pebbitone. After Arista Records, LaFace, and Pebbitone recouped their investment for recording costs and manufacturing and distribution (common recoupable charges in most record contracts), both Pebbitone and LaFace Records went on to charge for expenses such as airline travel, hotels, promotion, music videos, food, clothing, and other expenses. According {{to the members of}} TLC, ironically, the more successful the album became, the more they were in debt. In addition to this, managers, lawyers, producers, and taxes had to be paid, leaving each member of the group with less than $50,000 a year after having sold millions upon millions of albums.|$|E
500|$|Backbreaker {{relies on}} the Euphoria engine, a real time {{animation}} engine developed by NaturalMotion {{that has been used}} in games such as Grand Theft Auto IV, , and Red Dead Redemption. This allows animations for tackles and blocking to be created on the spot instead of using a limited set of canned animations. Due to this, developers pushed to advertise that [...] "no two tackles are the same" [...] in an attempt to draw players to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> more physically realistic football game than its competitors. The physics system was rated well by the reviewers, who commented that the integration of realistic physics created a very lifelike interaction between the players on the field.|$|E

500|$|After Peres's dismissal, {{the members}} began {{a search for}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Moderate Reform" [...] rabbi. This time, they {{consulted}} Wise, not Leeser. The position was advertised in Wise's newspaper as a [...] "Teacher, Preacher, and Reader", paying $1,000 (today $) per year. Qualifications included the ability to [...] "instruct children in Hebrew, lecture once a week in German or English and read the Prayers properly". In 1860, they hired Simon Tuska. Peres stayed in Memphis, and the theological tensions within the congregation were resolved when forty of the more traditional members departed; with Peres as their spiritual leader, they formed the Orthodox Beth El Emeth congregation in the early 1860s. This division process was common to many American congregations of the time.|$|E
500|$|Dimetrodon is {{an early}} member {{of a group called}} synapsids, which include mammals and many of their extinct relatives, though it is not an {{ancestor}} of any mammal (which appeared millions of years later). It is often mistaken for a dinosaur in popular culture, despite having become extinct some 40million years (Ma) before the first appearance of dinosaurs in the Triassic period. As a synapsid, Dimetrodon is more closely related to mammals than to dinosaurs or any living reptile. By the early 1900s most paleontologists called Dimetrodon a reptile in accordance with Linnean taxonomy, which ranked Reptilia as a class and Dimetrodon as a genus within that class. Mammals were assigned to a separate class, and Dimetrodon was described as a [...] "mammal-like reptile". Paleontologists theorized that mammals evolved from this group in (<b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called)</b> <b>a</b> reptile-to-mammal transition.|$|E
500|$|George's {{brother and}} {{successor}} William IV {{had to be}} persuaded to be crowned at all; his coronation {{at a time of}} economic depression in 1831 cost only one sixth of that spent on the previous event. Traditionalists threatened to boycott <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Half Crown-nation". [...] For this coronation, a number of economising measures were made which would set a precedent followed by future monarchs. The assembly of peers and ceremonial at Wetsminster Hall involving the presentation of the regalia to the monarch was eliminated. The procession from Westminster Hall to the Abbey on foot was likewise eliminated and in its place, a state procession by coach from StJames's Palace to the abbey was instituted, and this pageantry is an important feature of the modern event. The coronation banquet after the service proper was also disposed of.|$|E

500|$|The {{predecessor}} to Burger King, Insta-Burger King, began deploying {{the original}} broiling device in 1952 when its owners, Matthew Burns and Kieth Kramer, acquired {{the rights to}} George Read's Inst-Shake and Insta-Broiler machines. The Insta-Broiler cooked the burgers in a wire basket between two broilers, allowing the burgers to be cooked on both sides simultaneously. The machine was capable of cooking over 400 patties per hour, which allowed the company to grow rapidly. When McLamore and Edgarton opened their first Insta-Burger King location in Miami, they revamped the unit into <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "flame broiler" [...] – the forerunner of the modern unit used by Burger King today. After the acquisition of Insta-Burger King in 1954, the pair contracted {{the construction of the}} newly designed flame broilers to the SaniServ company of Indianapolis, Indiana, for the initial run of broilers. Eventually, the company moved the manufacturing contract for the broiler units to Nieco Automatic Broilers of Windsor, California, who manufactured all subsequent units until the start of the 2000s.|$|E
500|$|Calhoun labored {{to raise}} troops, provide funds, speed logistics, rescue the currency, and {{regulate}} commerce {{to aid the}} war effort. One colleague hailed him as [...] "the young Hercules who carried the war on his shoulders." [...] Disasters on the battlefield made him double his legislative efforts to overcome the obstructionism of John Randolph, Daniel Webster, and other opponents of the war. In December 1814, with the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte apparently defeated, and the British invasions of New York and Baltimore thwarted, British and American diplomats signed the Treaty of Ghent. It called {{for a return to}} the borders of 1812 with no gains or losses. [...] Before the treaty reached the Senate for ratification, and even before news of its signing reached New Orleans, a massive British invasion force was utterly defeated in January 1815 at the Battle of New Orleans, making a national hero of General Andrew Jackson. Americans celebrated <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "second war of independence" [...] against Britain. This led {{to the beginning of the}} [...] "Era of Good Feelings", an era marked by the formal demise of the Federalist Party and increased nationalism.|$|E
500|$|It took [...] "fifteen man-years" [...] {{and three}} actual {{years to develop}} the game. [...] In a 2006 interview, lead {{designer}} Johnson said, [...] "I had never really designed a game before ... It's funny {{looking back on it}} now—just by happenstance I ended up creating a very open ended system where players could go anywhere and do whatever and a story sort of unfolded." [...] Ybarra stated that the game was almost cancelled more than once, and came out about a year behind schedule. Johnson was guided by Archon designer Paul Reiche III during development. Reiche advised him to draft a [...] "story network" [...] that would highlight all the most important points of the story and list the in-game objects necessary to advance from one to the next. The designers rewrote the script multiple times. The group designed <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "fractal generator", which took six man-years to develop and allowed them {{to increase the number of}} planets in the game from 50 to 800. The game was one of the earliest to use procedurally generated content for planets and everything on them. The techniques used created a type of roguelike environment on each planet, with the contents randomly distributed. The story network was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox game design. They created a separate ecosystem generator over the course of two man-years of work. The alien names were created by randomly combining syllables until they had names they liked, and their code for simulating communications was rewritten four times before completion.|$|E
