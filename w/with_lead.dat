5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated <b>with</b> <b>lead.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bismuth metal {{has been}} known since ancient times, {{although}} it was often confused <b>with</b> <b>lead</b> and tin, which share some physical properties.

The game was released in North America, Europe and Australia on November 7, 2008 and was released in Japan on July 30, 2009. The game expands technically on the previous game by using a modified Unreal Engine 3 engine. The development team brought in comic book writer Joshua Ortega to help write the plot for the game.|$|E
5|$|Hunting <b>with</b> <b>lead</b> shot, {{along with}} the use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E

5|$|In {{developed}} countries, {{people with}} low levels of education living in poorer areas are most at risk for elevated lead. In the US, the groups most at risk for lead exposure are the impoverished, city-dwellers, and immigrants. African-American children and those living in old housing have also been found to be at elevated risk for high blood lead levels in the US. Low-income people often live in old housing <b>with</b> <b>lead</b> paint, which may begin to peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust.|$|E

5|$|Negative {{oxidation}} {{states can}} occur as Zintl phases, as either free lead anions, as in Ba2Pb, <b>with</b> <b>lead</b> formally being lead(−IV), or in oxygen-sensitive ring-shaped or polyhedral cluster ions {{such as the}} trigonal bipyramidal Pb52− ion, where two lead atoms are lead(−I) and three are lead(0). In such anions, each atom is at a polyhedral vertex and contributes two electrons to each covalent bond along an edge from their sp3 hybrid orbitals, the other two being an external lone pair. They may be made in liquid ammonia via the reduction of lead by sodium.|$|E
5|$|Outcome {{is related}} to the extent and {{duration}} of lead exposure. Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the central nervous system are not. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children <b>with</b> <b>lead</b> poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{typically}} {{results from}} ingestion of {{food or water}} contaminated <b>with</b> <b>lead,</b> and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil, dust, or lead-based paint. Seawater products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters. Fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in. Soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint, and residual emissions from leaded gasoline.|$|E
