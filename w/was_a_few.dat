5|$|George Elsworth Smith {{was born}} in Sewickley, Pennsylvania in 1862 to Elizabeth ("Eliza") and Christian Smith. The Smith family also {{included}} two sisters, Annie and Elizabeth, and another son, William C. Smith, that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years younger than George Smith. His mother was originally from Ireland and emigrated to the United States in 1857, and {{his father was a}} carpenter from Baden, Germany. Eliza remarried after Christian Smith's death in the early 1870s to retail grocer Edward Downing, who died in the 1880s. She remarried a second time on November 20, 1906 to real estate and coal developer Thomas S. Wood after George Smith's death.|$|E
5|$|Robson {{was born}} in Sacriston, County Durham, the fourth of five sons of Philip and Lilian Robson (née Watt). When he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months old, Robson's family moved to the nearby village of Langley Park where {{his father was a}} coal miner. Their two-bedroom house had no bath and an outside toilet. As a boy, he was often taken by his father to watch Newcastle United play at St James' Park on Saturday afternoons, {{requiring}} a 34-mile round trip. Robson describes Jackie Milburn and Len Shackleton as his childhood heroes. Both played for Newcastle in the inside-forward position, the position Robson would later assume during his playing career.|$|E
5|$|When I met him for {{the first}} time he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years younger than I am now, and I was barely on the edge of manhood. He drew me into a vortex of his endless campaigns and projects... He {{introduced}} me to Bach and Brahms, and to the importance of maintaining a balance in life between the pursuit of our individual pleasures and engagements in, and responsibility for, the social condition. He believed that no class, caste or genre of people were exempt from this obligation.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} his graduate studies at Harvard, Sledd briefly {{served as a}} Latin instructor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He was ordained as a Methodist minister and licensed to preach in 1898. At the suggestion of his father, he contacted Methodist minister Warren Akin Candler, then president of Emory College in Oxford, Georgia, who was a prominent leader of the Georgia Methodist Conference and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months from being elevated as a Methodist bishop. Candler {{was impressed with the}} character and academic credentials of the young scholar, and assisted him in becoming a professor of Latin language and literature at Emory College, a position Sledd held from 1898 to 1902. While living in the Candler family home, Sledd {{fell in love with the}} bishop's only daughter, Annie Florence Candler, and he married her on March 22, 1899; his father conducted the wedding ceremony.|$|E
5|$|An eighth, fragmentary {{specimen}} {{was discovered}} in 1990, not in Solnhofen limestone, but in somewhat younger sediments at Daiting, Suevia. Therefore, it {{is known as the}} Daiting Specimen, and had been known since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the Naturkundemuseum in Bamberg. The original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund Albertsdörfer in 2009. It was on display {{for the first time with}} six other original fossils of Archaeopteryx at the Munich Mineral Show in October 2009. A first, quick look by scientists indicates that this specimen might represent a new species of Archaeopteryx. It was found in a limestone bed that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred thousand years younger than the other finds.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, new U.S. Air Force bases were {{constructed}} {{along the northern}} border of the continental U.S.; their most direct route to the Soviet Union was through the Arctic Circle. These sites were high-importance strategic bases for hosting long-range missiles and aircraft. In 1947, the New England Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers chose a site in northeastern Maine, within both the Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation. The remote site consisted mostly of dense forest, shallow marshes, and wild blueberry bogs, on a slight plateau over the town, which helped keep it above the fog most of the time. Only {{a small part of}} the base was suitable for farming, so there was little impact on Aroostook County's agricultural community. Additionally, Loring was not far from sources of materials for runway, taxiway, and parking apron construction. The most important benefit of the site was that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred miles closer than any other base to potential targets in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Nevill {{was found}} in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over an {{overturned}} chair next to the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> inches from his skin. The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were found—three in the kitchen and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.|$|E
5|$|Soon after that, {{he entered}} a feud with World Heavyweight Champion Kane. He {{defeated}} Mysterio and Alberto Del Rio to become the number one contender for Kane's World Championship at WWE's Survivor Series PPV event, which ended in a draw. The following week, Edge lost his match with David Otunga thanks to Paul Bearer's interference. He kidnapped Bearer after this and used him to cost Kane his match with Big Show On November 19, Edge tortured Paul Bearer forcing him to play dodge ball and force feeding him, planning to wear down Kane. He then ambushed Kane in the garage when he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> feet from Paul Bearer and drove away with his hostage.|$|E

25|$|Inspired by the {{magnetic}} Zeeman effect, and especially by Lorentz's explanation of it, Woldemar Voigt performed classical mechanical calculations of quasi-elastically bound electrons in an electric field. By using experimental indices of refraction he gave {{an estimate of}} the Stark splittings. This estimate <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> orders of magnitude too low. Not deterred by this prediction, Stark undertook measurements on excited states of the hydrogen atom and succeeded in observing splittings.|$|E
