40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{three different}} antenna systems <b>for</b> mobile <b>vehicle</b> applications. The antennas are either patches or derivatives in all cases. The {{first is a}} dual-band telephone antenna with a low profile and wide bandwidth. Operating at 900 MHz and 1800 MHz, with a VSWR of better than 1 · 7, it is a hybrid construction combining a monopole with a top-loading patch shorted to the ground-plane. Extra-shorted pins provide the upper frequency band coverage. It provides monopole radiation characteristics and can be hidden under a plastic panel or mounted on the vehicle roof. The second is a microstrip patch antenna integrated into a laminated glass <b>windscreen</b> <b>for</b> a <b>vehicle.</b> It is fed using a coplanar waveguide feed printed on the innermost layer of the glass, avoiding {{the need for a}} contacting feed within the laminate. The patch and ground plane are meshed for manufacturing in the glass to avoid distorting the heat profile when the glass is shaped and laminated. The patch is easily fed from inside the vehicle and is potentially a very low cost design. The final antenna discussed is a dual-band patch antenna specifically designed for the Globalstar satellite telephone system at 1 · 6 GHz and 2 · 45 GHz. It also covers the Iridium band at 1 · 6 GHz. A single circularly polarised patch is used. Dual-band operation results from truncating the corners of the square patch and judiciously placed slots to achieve a band spacing of 1 · 5...|$|R

25|$|In the 20th century, {{new types}} of glass such as {{laminated}} glass, reinforced glass and glass bricks increased the use of glass as a building material and resulted in new applications of glass. Multi-story buildings are frequently constructed with curtain walls made almost entirely of glass. Similarly, laminated glass has been widely applied to <b>vehicles</b> <b>for</b> <b>windscreens.</b> Optical glass <b>for</b> spectacles has been used since the Middle Ages. The production of lenses has become increasingly proficient, aiding astronomers as well as having other application in medicine and science. Glass is also employed as the aperture cover in many solar energy collectors.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from its}} Egyptian visit in late 1933, the {{activities}} of the various SM.80s are not well recorded. An exception is a fatal landing accident which the Fiat heir and Juventas chair Eduardo Agnelli died on 14 July 1935. The aircraft, the first SM.80, was owned by Giovanni Agnelli, the founder of Fiat and Eduardo's father. It seems that Eduardo was thrown forward into the propeller when the aircraft hit a floating obstacle as he was preparing to disembark. Normal cockpit access on the SM.80 was via separate forward folding <b>windscreens</b> <b>for</b> passenger and pilot.|$|R

The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit <b>windscreen</b> <b>for</b> aerodynamic streamlining.|$|R

50|$|The cockpit {{located the}} two seats over mid-chord. In sports mode the JG.10 was flown {{from an open}} cockpit with a triplex <b>windscreen</b> <b>for</b> each {{occupant}} {{but it could also}} be configured as a tourer by attaching a glazed and streamlined, rectangular section top. Access to the latter was from above. There were removable dual controls and each seat could be folded down to provide a clear surface for an air bed. Luggage could be stored behind the seats in a netted-off space. Each occupant was provided with a parachute stored in cockpit side-pockets and which exited through the sides, pulled by a static line attached to the wearer's harness.|$|R
50|$|With Le Mans the {{eventual}} target, {{the car was}} further developed to incorporate modified cylinder heads, revised camshafts, side-draft Weber carburettors and a race exhaust system, while the suspension and brakes were also upgraded, with stiffer and shorter springs, larger brakes, wider wheels and racing slick tyres. In this form DBSV8/10038/RC raced in AMOC events throughout 1975, competing up until September 1975. The car showed promise, {{proving to be a}} match for former Le Mans cars at the AMOC Silverstone meeting in July by finishing 3rd. Later that year, the car gained a quartet of dragster-style downdraft Weber carburettors, which were the height of half the <b>windscreen</b> <b>for</b> the 1976 season.|$|R
