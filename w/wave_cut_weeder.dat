40|$|Four {{different}} {{techniques that}} use <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> analysis {{to predict the}} wave pattern resistance coefficient of a ship hull are compared. Two of the techniques are based on longitudinal <b>wave</b> <b>cuts</b> and two are based on transverse <b>wave</b> <b>cuts.</b> The results are compared with values from pressure integration and with towing tank measurements of the residuary resistance. Three hulls are used for the comparison: the Dyne Tanker, the Series 60 and the SSPA Ro-Ro Ship model 2062. The <b>wave</b> <b>cuts</b> are computed from linear and non-linear solutions of the wave pattern. A technique whereby the free surface deformation at any distance downstream of a vessel can be predicted very quickly {{based on the information}} computed in one of the transverse <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> methods is also described. When used with appropriate wave information, the wave resistance prediction was very consistent for the four different <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> methods and it was not possible say that one method is better than the other in this respect. The four <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> methods tested gave the same ranking of the wave resistance for a bulb size variation of the Ro-Ro ship model. This ranking agreed with the ranking from pressure integration and from towing tank measurements. The transverse <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> methods seems to be more robust and needs less time for the CFD calculation than the longitudinal <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> methods which makes them more suitable to include in an automatic optimisation procedure. Single and multiple transverse <b>wave</b> <b>cuts</b> methods performed equally well for linear computations, but the multiple transverse <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> method is preferred for non-linear computations since it is less sensitive to the position of the <b>wave</b> <b>cuts.</b> The <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> analysis calculates values for the wave resistance that are less than the values obtained from pressure integration and from the residuary resistance as measured in a towing tank...|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of a marine terrace follows this general process: A <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> platform must be carved into bedrock (high wave energy is needed for this process). Although {{this is the first}} step to the process for the {{formation of}} a marine terrace, not all <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> platforms will become a marine terrace. After the <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> platform is formed it must be removed from interaction with the high wave energy. This process happens by either change in sea level due to glacial-interglacial cycles or tectonically rising landmasses. When the <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> has been raised above sea level it is preserved. The terraces are most commonly preserved in flights along the coastline.|$|R

40|$|Four {{previously}} unconsidered and undescribed terrace locations {{have been}} identified as Quaternary <b>wave</b> <b>cut,</b> emergent, marine terraces. The presumption has persisted that there apparently are no identifiable, marine terraces on Santa Catalina Island. This is, in large part, due to the absence of corroborative Pleistocene marine fossil assemblages and the extensive erosion of suspected terrace locations. However, there does exist an abundance of water rounded pebbles and cobbles. These are in relatively distinct concentrations in at least four locations, especially along the western margins of the island. Utilizing the methodology developed by Dodkins and Folk in 1970, the authors determined that the Maximum Projection Sphericities (i//p) of the pebbles and cobbles were generated by wave not fluvial action, thereby establishing them as artifacts from <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> benches...|$|R

40|$|A deep-Vee hull form, {{renowned for}} its {{favourable}} seakeeping, manoeuvring and competitive resistance qualities at high Froude number (Fn> 0. 55), is re-designed for lower Froude number (Fn= 0. 388 & 0. 2). Novel features include a bulbous bow and a modified transom stern. The new design, modelled using the FRIENDSHIP CAD system, has a displacement of 16, 000 tonnes. The bulbous bow and the modified stern are optimised for resistance using two different techniques, namely an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach and the gradient-based Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA). The techniques are compared for efficiency and performance. The wave pattern resistance response surfaces are computed using the SHIPFLOW CFD software by systematically varying the design parameters for the bulbous bow and stern. These surfaces, which display the cause-and-effect relationships in the design procedure, are stored as a database for training and using the ANN method. In SHIPFLOW, two techniques are used for computing the resistance: pressure integration and transverse <b>wave</b> <b>cut.</b> It {{turns out that the}} transverse <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> technique is the most robust one for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|The panel {{method for}} the {{treatment}} of the free surface flow of a ship has been further developed. For the calculation of the wavemaking resistance the method of transverse <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> analysis is used. Based on systematic comparison computations {{it turns out that the}} results obtained by using transverse <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> analysis agree essentially better with the measurements than those obtained by integrating the computed hull pressure distributions. An iterative solution method based on the incomplete LU-decomposition has been developed. With this new method identical results were obtained, but the computer time could hav been reduced to 30 % to 40 % of those using the old method. A multi-grid method combined with the ILU-decomposition was developed. Systematic comparison computations show same results between 1 -, 2 - and 3 -grid methods. But the computer time required for 2 - and 3 -grid methods is slightly more than using the 1 -grid method. (orig.)

40|$|Ship {{optimization}} {{based on}} computer simulations {{has become a}} decisive factor {{in the development of}} new, economically efficient and environmen-tally friendly ship hull forms. An important task at an early design stage is the optimization of the wave-making characteristics of the ship hull since a considerable resistance component stems from the steady ship wave system. Moreover, the ship waves cause adverse effects in the far field as the wash hits the shore line or other vessels. A novel hull form optimization approach is pre-sented. It builds on a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) based evaluation of the ship wave pattern, on straightforward realization of the cause and effect relation of hull variations and their impact on wave formation, which is accessed by a perturbation approach, and on <b>wave</b> <b>cut</b> analysis. <b>Wave</b> <b>cut</b> analysis yields an excellent assessment of the wave-making characteristics of a hull form in terms of its free wave spectrum and the associated resistance. These features are highly integrated and controlled by a fully automated, self-governed optimization scheme used to improve the wave-making characteristics accompanied by a substantial reduction of the ship’s resistance and power consumption.
