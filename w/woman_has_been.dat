5|$|The largest Chadian {{delegation}} {{to reach the}} Olympics appeared in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea and at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain; each time, Chad's National Olympic Committee sent six athletes. During the 1992 games, the NOC sent the nation's first female Olympian. Since then (and up to the Beijing games), at least one <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{a part of the}} Chadian delegation. The smallest contingency of Chadian Olympians occurred during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, when only Kaltouma Nadjina competed on the country's behalf. The delegation that arrived in Beijing consisted of two athletes—one man (30-year-old Moumi Sébergué) and one woman (15-year-old Hinikissia Albertine Ndikert), both participants in track events. Ndikert was Chad's flagbearer at the ceremonies. Up to and including the Beijing games, there has yet to have been a medalist from Chad.|$|E

25|$|Richard, Nicci, and Cara then {{travel to}} the People's Palace and learn that the boxes are missing {{and that they have}} been put into play. Richard finds the statue Kahlan left and figures out that the Sisters have stolen his wife and the boxes. With the proof in the Garden of Life, Nicci and Cara finally believe in the {{existence}} of Kahlan, despite not remembering her. While there, they learn that an older <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> found fatally stabbed near the D'haran army; Nicci and Richard determine that it is Sister Tovi. Nicci uses deception to interrogate Tovi, discovering that it was Samuel who stabbed Tovi and took the Box of Orden she was carrying. She also learns about the Chainfire spell, about how it was used to obliterate everyone's memory about Kahlan, and that the Boxes of Orden were created in opposition to it. Later, Richard realizes that the Sword of Truth protected him from the Chainfire spell, which is why he was still able to remember Kahlan.|$|E
25|$|Some modern {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} explain the reports of werewolf behaviour with recognised medical conditions. Dr Lee Illis of Guy's Hospital in London wrote a paper in 1963 entitled On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves, in which he argues that historical accounts on werewolves could have in fact been referring to victims of congenital porphyria, stating how the symptoms of photosensitivity, reddish teeth and psychosis could have been grounds for accusing a sufferer of being a werewolf. This is however argued against by Woodward, who points out how mythological werewolves were almost invariably portrayed as resembling true wolves, and that their human forms were rarely physically conspicuous as porphyria victims. Others have pointed {{out the possibility of}} historical werewolves having been sufferers of hypertrichosis, a hereditary condition manifesting itself in excessive hair growth. However, Woodward dismissed the possibility, as the rarity of the disease ruled it out from happening on a large scale, as werewolf cases were in medieval Europe. People suffering from Down syndrome have been suggested by some scholars to have been possible originators of werewolf myths. Woodward suggested rabies as the origin of werewolf beliefs, claiming remarkable similarities between the symptoms of that disease and some of the legends. Woodward focused on the idea that being bitten by a werewolf could result in the victim turning into one, which suggested the idea of a transmittable disease like rabies. However, the idea that lycanthropy could be transmitted in this way {{is not part of the}} original myths and legends and only appears in relatively recent beliefs. Lycanthropy can also be met with as the main content of a delusion, for example, the case of a <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reported who during episodes of acute psychosis complained of becoming four different species of animals.|$|E

The roles of several other major female characters were also made smaller in the final film compared to earlier drafts.|$|E
500|$|Levels of LH/FSH may be {{suppressed}} by a raised prolactin level, {{and are therefore}} not interpretable unless prolactin is low or normal. In men, the combination of low LH and FSH in combination with a low testosterone confirms LH/FSH deficiency; a high testosterone would indicate a [...] source elsewhere in the body (such as a testosterone-secreting tumor). In women, the diagnosis of LH/FSH deficiency depends on whether the <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> through the menopause. Before the menopause, abnormal menstrual periods together with low estradiol and LH/FSH levels confirm a pituitary problem; after the menopause (when LH/FSH levels are normally elevated and the ovaries produce less estradiol), inappropriately low LH/FSH alone is sufficient. Stimulation tests with GnRH are possible, but their use is not encouraged.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the fetus}} {{begins to move}} during the first {{trimester}}, it is not until the second trimester that movement, {{often referred to as}} [...] "quickening", can be felt. This typically happens in the fourth month, more specifically in the 20th to 21st week, or by the 19th week if the <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> pregnant before. It is common for some women not to feel the fetus move until much later. During the second trimester, most women begin to wear maternity clothes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{importance}} of the wali is debated between the different schools of thought. [...] To the Hanafi Sunnis, a male guardian is not required for the bride to become married, {{even if it is}} her first marriage. [...] Therefore, the marriage contract is signed between the bride and the groom, not the groom and the wali. [...] To the Hanbali, Shafi'i, and Maliki Sunni schools, a wali is required in order for a virginal woman to marry. [...] In these schools, if a <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> divorced, she becomes her own guardian and does not need a wali to sign a marriage contract.|$|E
2500|$|Luke is {{the gospel}} writer {{who was a}} physician, and while his {{profession}} may have motivated his interest, nothing suggests a medical diagnosis. Asthenia throughout the New Testament means [...] "weakness" [...] or [...] "powerlessness" [...] of any kind, including sickness. Some have seen the affliction as ankylosing spondylitis, but an alternative interpretation is that hard labor over the years had bent the woman's back. The incident has been examined at length {{from the perspective of}} feminist theology by Francis Taylor Gench, who views it as both healing and liberating; Jesus {{goes on to say that}} the <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> freed from a kind of bondage to Satan. The breaking of bonds or chains is often associated with freedom from an unclean spirit; in the case of the Gerasene demon (above), the demoniac had the physical power to break chains as a result of possession.|$|E
