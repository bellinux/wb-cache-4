5|$|At {{the time}} of Erika's classification, {{forecast}} models diverged significantly on the potential future of Erika. Statistical guidance and the HWRF depicted a hurricane while the ECMWF and GFS showed a <b>weaker</b> system due to increasing wind shear. The models that intensified the storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it <b>weaker</b> had the system continuing along a westward course. Accordingly, the NHC noted low confidence in their five-day forecast for Erika. This uncertainty ultimately reflected in above-average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones, but roughly average for weak, poorly organized systems. Throughout August25 and into early August26, the convective organization of Erika fluctuated due to wind shear and entrainment of dry air, periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection.|$|E
