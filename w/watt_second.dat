5000|$|The Crew Of The Flying Saucer was former The Minutemen/Firehose bassist Mike <b>Watt's</b> <b>second</b> touring band, {{formed to}} {{continue}} touring behind his first solo album, 1995's Ball-Hog or Tugboat?. The band consisted of, along with Watt on bass and vocals, guitarist Nels Cline and two drummers, Vince Meghrouni and Michael Preussner. Meghrouni also doubled on saxophone. All three had played on various cuts on Ball-Hog....|$|R
5000|$|A monolight is a {{self-contained}} photographic flash lighting unit usually {{found in a}} studio. Each monolight has its own independent power source. [...] It {{does not depend on}} a centralized power supply as a [...] "pack and head" [...] system does. Monolights are also independently controlled: each has its own power settings and light output. [...] Flash power is predominantly measured by the industry in <b>watt</b> <b>seconds,</b> which is unit-equivalent to the joule.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>watt</b> <b>second</b> (also watt-second, symbol W s or W·s) is a {{derived unit}} of energy {{equivalent}} to the joule. The watt-second is the energy equivalent {{to the power of}} one watt sustained for one second. While the watt-second is equivalent to the joule in both units and meaning, there are some contexts in which the term [...] "watt-second" [...] is used instead of [...] "joule".|$|E
5000|$|The power {{conditioner}} {{will also have}} a [...] "joule" [...] rating. A joule is a measurement of energy or heat required to sustain one watt for one second, known as a <b>watt</b> <b>second.</b> Since electrical surges are momentary spikes, the joule rating indicates how much electrical energy the suppressor can absorb at once before becoming damaged itself. The higher the joule rating, the greater the protection.|$|E
50|$|Watt {{did work}} with both Cline and Meghrouni {{again after the}} Crew Of The Flying Saucer had {{completed}} its run; Cline was the sole guitarist on <b>Watt's</b> <b>second</b> solo album Contemplating The Engine Room, and has toured and recorded with him as part of both another Watt project band, The Black Gang, and in the jazz/punk group Banyan. Meghrouni would participate in another Watt project band, The Pair Of Pliers, in 1999 and 2000.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} these confusions {{is that this was}} <b>Watt's</b> <b>second</b> engine (after the Kinneil engine) and the first by the Boulton and Watt partnership. In fact several engines were built between 1773 (the return of the Kinneil engine to Birmingham) and the {{construction}} of Beelzebub in 1777. These include such well-known engines as the 1775 38-inch blowing engine for John Wilkinson's blast furnaces at New Willey, near Broseley, and the 50-inch pumping engine for Bloomfield Colliery near Tipton.|$|R
2500|$|Watt has {{dedicated}} all of Firehose's releases and his solo albums {{to the memory}} of Boon. [...] "Disciples of the 3-Way" [...] on Firehose's final studio album Mr. Machinery Operator is about Minutemen, and [...] "The Boilerman" [...] from <b>Watt's</b> <b>second</b> solo album Contemplating The Engine Room (which parallels the stories of Minutemen, Watt's father, and the novel The Sand Pebbles) is about Boon; Watt had guitarist Nels Cline play one of Boon's old Fender Telecaster guitars on the track.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{designed}} and initially manufactured in 1942 by Strobo Research, a company founded by Edward Farber and Harold Edgerton that was located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Stroboflash electronic flashes were used extensively by newspaper photographers {{as an alternative to}} flash bulbs. In 1955, Stroboflash was sold by Strobo Research to Graflex, Inc., a now defunct company that also produced sheet film large format cameras and a host of camera accessories and was located in Rochester, New York. There were four models of Stroboflash, aptly designated as Stroboflash I, Stroboflash II, Stroboflash III and Stroboflash IV. The Stroboflash I used two 240 volt dry cell batteries that are no longer made and was the lightest of the four models and produced 50 watt seconds of light power. The Stroboflash II, III and IV were powered by two 225 volt dry cell batteries that are still produced by Eveready, but are now quite expensive (two #489 225 volt batteries hooked up to produce 450 volts). The Stroboflash II and Stroboflash IV were produced by Graflex through 1975, when Graflex, Inc. sold the Stroboflash IV to another company called Graflite that produced it until about 1978, then they also went out of business. The Stroboflash III was only produced for a few years. It put out 200 watt seconds of light power, but could not be turned down. It was replaced by the Stroboflash IV that had four power setting that could be selected via a rotary top mounted switch: 1/4 (50 watt seconds), 1/2(100 watt seconds), 3/4(150 watt seconds) and full (200 watt seconds). The Stroboflash II had a constant 100 <b>watt</b> <b>second</b> light output that was not adjustable.|$|E

Master Ishii was delighted; Peter Aerts {{would be the}} perfect opponent for Sakate who had just lost previously to Maurice Smith. However Satake had hurt his hand the week before the fight and Ishii needed to find a replacement fighter fast. Adam put his hand and said that he would fight Aerts in place of Sakate.

Blachly wanted a device {{for the treatment of}} major depression unresponsive to pharmaceuticals that used minimal energy to induce a seizure. ECT machines of the time all used an excessive amount of jules (<b>watt</b> <b>seconds)</b> to achieve a seizure and Blachly believed them to be unsafe. Custom Systems was sold to Data Design Inc. in 1980. Data Design sold the product design and rights Of MECTA to Gorham and Robin Nicol in mid-1980.|$|R

50|$|William Murdoch (sometimes Murdock) (1754-1839) was an {{engineer}} {{working for the}} firm of Boulton & Watt, when, while investigating distillation processes sometime in 1792-1794, he began using coal gas for illumination. He was living in Redruth in Cornwall at the time, and made some small scale experiments with lighting his own house with coal gas. He soon dropped the subject until 1798, {{when he moved to}} Birmingham to work at Boulton & Watt's home base of Soho. Boulton & Watt then instigated another small-scale series of experiments. With ongoing patent litigation and their main business of steam engines to attend to, the subject was dropped once again. Gregory <b>Watt,</b> James <b>Watt's</b> <b>second</b> son, while traveling in Europe saw Lebon's demonstrations and wrote a letter to his brother, James Watt Jr., informing him of this potential competitor. This prompted James Watt Jr. to begin a gaslight development program at Boulton & Watt that would scale up the technology and lead to the first commercial applications of gaslight.|$|R

50|$|In autumn 1898, cornetist Harry Prampin {{replaced}} Lowery as {{the head}} of the band and Prampin's wife, Laura, joined as a trap drummer. Also, Desdunes occasionally played second trombone in the band under Prampin, while his orchestra's repertoire included overtures from the Operas Raymond and Lucrezia Borgia. Other significant musicians joined the band over the following few years, including cornetist Frank Clermont, M. F. Watts and Cecil Smith Watts. The Nashville singers toured nationally, from Maine to California, and Desdunes' role included a noted arrangement of music to go with the work of group comedians Harris and S. H. Dudley. He also performed as first alto in 1898 with many of the same performers in a group called Fred W. Simpson's Oliver Scott Refined Negro Minstrals with Harry Prampin (director and soloist), Lash Gideon (solo cornet), George Bryant (first cornet), Ed Rouseve (clarionet), M.

5000|$|In the Australian drama Adore, Watts co-starred with Robin Wright, playing two {{childhood}} {{friends who}} {{fall in love}} with each others sons. The movie premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival as Two Mothers, and later opened in selected cinemas. It received a mixed feedback from critics, who concluded that Watts and co-star Wright [...] "give it their all, but they cant quite make Adores trashy, absurd plot believable". She obtained the FCCA Award for Best Actress in 2014, for her role. Her next release was Movie 43, an independent anthology black comedy film that featured 14 different storylines, with each segment having a different director. Watts segment, titled [...] "Homeschooled", was directed by Will Graham and revolved around two devoted parents (Watts and Liev Schreiber) attempting to replicate their sons whole high school experience. This marked <b>Watts</b> <b>second</b> collaboration with Schreiber, following the 2006 drama The Painted Veil. The portmanteau film was universally panned by critics, with Richard Roeper calling it [...] "the Citizen Kane of awful".|$|R
