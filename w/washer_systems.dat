40|$|Thin film sensor systems {{based on}} {{hydrogenated}} carbon {{have the advantage}} to combine two very important characteristics. They show a piezoresistive behaviour and also a tribological stability caused by a high hardness and wear resistance. Therefore they can be applied {{on the surface of}} machine parts or used for building up universal insertable sensor <b>systems</b> like sensory <b>washers.</b> A real challenge is the deposition of a whole sensory layer system on technical components like a spindle, which have a length of 480 mm and an outer diameter of about 90 mm. The functions of the layer system directly applied in the contact zone between spindle shaft and tool holder are the measurement of the clamping force of the tool holder, the imbalance of the used tool and the process forces during machining. For this application a self-contained thin film sensor system is investigated. Directly in the spindle shaft an insulating alumina layer is deposited in a thickness of about 4 µm followed by electrode structures out of 200 nm thin chromium coating. On top of this the piezoresistive hydrogenated carbon layer in a thickness of about 1 µm is deposited, covered by a wear resistant and insulating top coating. Therefore a silicon and oxygen modified carbon layer in a thickness of about 2 µm is used. The piezoresistive sensor layer and also the top layer are part of the diamond like carbon layer family [1, 2, 3, 4]. Another very important application is the sensory washer. The thin film sensor system, consisting out of the piezoresistive sensor layer deposited directly on the washer surface, the electrode structures out of chromium for the local detection of the load distribution in the <b>washer</b> <b>system</b> and the insulating layer as top layer out of the silicon and oxygen modified carbon layer, has a thickness in the range of 9 µm.

40|$|Bottom ash is {{produced}} by the incineration of household waste. Waste regulations mandate that re-use of this residue be given priority. The goal of the investigations was to devine and test the process conditions of an integrated wet chemical treatment of bottom ashes in a bottom ash discharger. This should lead to an improved quality of bottom ashes. Easily soluble pollutants and fine particles should be removed by a washing process, and heavy metals of environmental significance should be stabilized {{by the addition of}} gaseous carbon dioxide or phosphoric acid in one and the same process. To achieve the above objectives, dry raw bottom ashes were removed continuously from three incineration plants, sieved into grain fractions and conditioned. Laboratory experiments were carried out in a glass reactor and a heating water reactor. Pilot-scale experiments were performed in a bottom ash discharger. Each type of treated and untreated bottom ash was characterized according to environmental and technical construction material criteria. Results indicated that easily soluble salts and fine particles were removed by the washing of bottom ash. In laboratory experiments, the concentrations of heavy metals in leachates after treatment could be lowered significantly by the addition of gaseous carbon dioxide or phosphoric acid. However, in pilot-scale experiments the concentrations of carbon dioxide or phosphoric acid in the process fluids were too low, and hence the expected stabilization of heavy metals was not achieved. The chemical reactions of the additives mostly happen in the washing solution. Stabilization can be reached only with a large amount of additives. In the case of phosphoric acid this would constitute a great expenditure of chemicals associated with a decrease in acid neutralization capacity of the bottom ash. After wet chemical treatment all bottom ashes exhibited a significant improvement of technical construction material characteristics. This procedure may be applied without incurring substantial investment costs by retrofitting existing incineration plants to allow on-site washing of bottom ash. In addition the carbon dioxide from the cleaned flue gas can be used to accelerate the aging processes. A stabilization of heavy metals is possible mostly by changing the pH value in the leachates of the treated bottom ashes. The washing solutions could then be used in the <b>washer</b> <b>system</b> of the flue gas cleaning facility. (orig.)

Cadillac set apart the GM transmission from other corporate models it was shared with by the Cadillac-exclusive viscous converter clutch, which provided even smoother shifting under hard acceleration. Engine controls were monitored by the GMP4 Powertrain Control Module (PCM), an on-board 64-kilobyte computer. A new exhaust set-up with a wider catalytic converter reduced restriction by 38% from last year, while the 0-60 mph speed went from 9 seconds in 1990 to 8.2 for '91. Revised engine mounts prevented engine noise and vibration from affecting the cabin, while the new Computer Command Ride (CCR) system, optional on most other Cadillac models, was standard on Eldorado. CCR would automatically adapt the suspension mode with regard to vehicle speed for better handling and ride comfort. A $309 electrically heated windshield was new to the option list this year, as was the available ($480 on base Eldorado, no charge on Biarritz or Touring Coupe) [...] "Security Package" [...] which now included remote keyless entry along with automatic door locks with central unlocking, and the theft-deterrent system.
