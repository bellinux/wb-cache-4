40|$|Electrical {{machines}} with distributed concentrated windings are challenging {{the selection of}} the soft magnetic materials due to stator design and power conversion efficiency. A shorter magnetisation path and relatively high magnetisation frequency establish a good potential for low permeability soft magnetic materials with low power losses in the core. The focus of this article is on the analysis of a three-phase machine with laminated and iron powder cores where the concern is on the modular winding design, torque capability and stator efficiency. Different iron powder cores are compared to laminated core on basis of 2 D FEA. The three-phase machine torque is compared with the conventional distributed concentrated winding, an axially distributed <b>wave</b> <b>winding,</b> and a number of circumferentially distribute wave-winding segments. According to 3 D FEA, the conventional coils are preferred if the permeability of the core is low...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a double-gap axial field permanent magnet (PM) dc motor whose double-layer armature <b>wave</b> <b>winding</b> is constructed of copper strips. It investigates {{the performance of}} two machines using powder iron and lamination steel materials as armature teeth. Tests are conducted to evaluate the motor torque and speed curves {{as well as their}} efficiency under different loads. Finite element analysis (FEA) and equivalent circuit models are used to determine the levels of the magnetic saturation in the motors; calculate torque, inductance, and electromotive force (EMF); and determine the distribution of losses in the machine. The results show that the powder iron armature machine has lower back EMF and torque constants, and is less efficient than the steel laminations machine, which is due to the lower permeability and saturation flux density of the powder iron material...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe main {{objective}} of this dissertation is the detailed design, sizing, analysis and experimental validation of the sustainable wind generator. The proposed machine topology for the generator uses permanent magnets (PMs) from discarded hard disk drives (HDDs). The PM configuration inherently produces a non-uniform air gap flux-density distribution and the pole pitches of the PMs are relatively small. This would result to an unbalanced generator output {{and a number of}} stator inter-connecting leads, if conventional tooth-concentrated non-overlapping winding configurations are used. Hence, a concentrated full-pitch overlapping <b>wave</b> <b>winding</b> configuration is developed, which overcomes the aforementioned challenges. The proposed sustainable coreless axial flux generator is then analyzed with classical machine theory and verified by finite element analysis (FEA) software. It is shown that the traditional sizing approach for axial flux machines needs modification to accommodate the design of the proposed machine topology. For the numerical analysis, 3 D-FEA is used to verify the 2 Dmodel which is subsequently employed in the numerical analyses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{wind blowing}} over sea surface generates tiny <b>wind</b> <b>waves.</b> They develop {{with time and}} space {{absorbing}} wind energy, and become huge <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> usually referred to ocean surface <b>waves.</b> The <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> cause not only serious sea disasters but also take important roles in the local and global climate changes by affecting the fluxes of momentum, heat and gases (e. g. CO 2) through the air-sea boundary. The present paper reviews the selected studies on <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> conducted by our group in the Research Institute for Applied Mechanics (RIAM), Kyushu University. The themes discussed are interactions between water <b>waves</b> and <b>winds,</b> the energy spectrum of <b>wind</b> <b>waves,</b> nonlinear properties of <b>wind</b> <b>waves,</b> {{and the effects of}} surfactant on some air-sea interaction phenomena...|$|R

40|$|The {{statistical}} {{properties of}} short <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> {{under the influence}} of long waves are investigated based on wave data from a laboratory experiment carried out in the large Marseille-Luminy <b>wind</b> <b>wave</b> tank. The <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> are generated with various fetches and speeds. The long wave is mechanically generated by a submerge paddle and propagates in the <b>wind</b> direction. Surface <b>wave</b> elevations are measured by an array of capacitance wave gauges aligned in the wind direction. The long wave effects are examined based on the statistical parameters derived from the probability distribution and zero-up-crossing wave height and <b>wave</b> period of <b>wind</b> <b>waves.</b> In the absence of long waves, the skewness of the probability distributions, an index of wave nonlinearity, shows a clear dependence to the increase of the significant slopes of <b>wind</b> <b>waves.</b> The presence of long waves significantly decreases the skewness and the dependence to the <b>wave</b> slopes. The <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> riding on the crest of long waves show a larger mean wave height and shorter mean wave period than those riding in the trough of long waves...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>wave</b> {{development}} {{in the presence of}} a long mechanically-generated wave was investigated in the large IRPHE <b>wind</b> <b>wave</b> tank, for different wind speeds and long <b>wave</b> parameters. <b>Wind</b> and <b>wave</b> observations with and without long waves were made simultaneously at various fetches and compared. At short fetches, the <b>wind</b> <b>wave</b> field observed in presence of mechanical waves exhibits a broadened dominant spectral peak shifted towards low frequencies. At large fetches, the main effect of long <b>waves</b> on <b>wind</b> <b>wave</b> fields consists in a noticeable damping of the dominant waves. The damping factor increases rapidly with long wave steepness akL at small akL but no longer varies at large akL. Moreover, this factor is strongly wind dependent, increasing first up to 6 m/s, then decreasing significantly before reaching a saturation value at high wind speeds. Consistently, the wind-generated wave fields observed in presence of long waves are characterized by much lower equilibrium dominant wave steepness. Finally, the relevant mechanisms at the origin of these phenomena and their implications for ocean wave fields are discussed...|$|R
