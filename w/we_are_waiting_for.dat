5|$|From the few Greeks of Mani and {{the rest}} of Greeks who live there to Ibrahim Pasha. We {{received}} your letter in which you try to frighten us saying that if we don't surrender, you'll kill the Maniots and plunder Mani. That's why <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> you and your army. We, the inhabitants of Mani, sign and wait for you.|$|E
500|$|In Italy {{there was}} {{widespread}} condemnation of Schumacher. The daily newspaper l'Unità called {{for him to}} be fired by Ferrari. [...] "Schumacher ought to face charges in a Spanish court for the grave deed he committed" [...] it reported. [...] "The driver covered himself, Ferrari and Italian sport as a whole with shame. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Ferrari to announce that it is throwing out Michael Schumacher and hiring a new driver who is more intelligent, has more wisdom and a real sense of morality." ...|$|E
2500|$|While leaving, Daniel Domscheit-Berg copied {{and then}} deleted roughly 3,500 {{unpublished}} {{documents from the}} WikiLeaks servers, including information on the US government's 'no-fly list' and inside information from 20 right-wing organisations, and according to a WikiLeaks statement, 5gigabytes of data relating to Bank of America, the internal communications of 20 neo-Nazi organisations and US intercept information for [...] "over a hundred Internet companies". In Domscheit-Berg's book he wrote: [...] "To this day, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Julian to restore security, {{so that we can}} return the material to him, which was on the submission platform." [...] In August 2011, Domscheit-Berg claims he permanently deleted the files [...] "in order to ensure that the sources are not compromised." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Why, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> you to begin,' said Mrs. Beecher reproachfully. 'Do {{let us have}} something, {{for really}} the time is {{slipping}} away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{gave you}} strict orders {{to come right}} back, Jarvey," [...] they heard Mr. Watson say. [...] "You knew <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> those blue-prints." ...|$|R
2500|$|Cao Cao {{turned to}} Tian Chou, who was {{familiar}} with the area and had run-ins with the Wuhuan before, for advice regarding this situation. Tian Chou notified Cao Cao of a disused road that led to the abandoned Former Han frontier lands. From there the army can march through undefended territory and attack the Wuhuan where they least expect it, and by doing so [...] "Tadun's head can be taken without a single battle", Tian Chou said. Cao Cao, most pleased, accepted the plan and led his army back (presumably to Wuzhong). He had his men erect signs on the roads by the water, which wrote [...] "It is the middle of summer, and the road is impassable. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> autumn or winter to resume the advance." [...] Enemy scouts saw the sign and apparently believed that Cao Cao really retreated. As Tian Chou had predicted, the Wuhuan were convinced that any force that could not advance through the plains had to turn back, which was a miscalculation most grave.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{heard them}} saying {{something}} about it, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the colonel on parade, this morning; but I {{did not think}} much of it." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{told me this}} story, in the Umballa Refreshment Room while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> an up-train. I {{supplied}} the beer. The tale was cheap at a gallon and a half.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly so, Mr. S. The {{identity}} is one as I could prove on oath in any court in England. You {{was on the}} railway platform at Exeter on Saturday when <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the 12 express 'buss;--wasn't you now, Mr. S.?" ...|$|R
6000|$|BOHUN (resuming {{command of}} the proceedings). Now, Mr. Crampton: <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> you. Do you give up your {{objection}} to the dressing, or do you stick to it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This wouldn't {{take more}} than a day or two each week, and twenty-five dollars a letter would be {{convenient}} while <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> our cards to turn up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good," [...] {{said the}} man; [...] "but I {{wish it was}} ready now. And now, sir, if you would just glance over this book, while <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> supper--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Parkins, [...] "the head {{baggage man}} (he wears a uniform, you know, in Italy {{just like a}} soldier) {{said it was because}} we'd {{forgotten}} to check them in Vienna. However there <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> twenty-four hours with nothing but our valises." ...|$|R

[...] "He was gay with it too--when <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the {{boulevard}} trolley he opened her up and went right between Charlie and me. I had to laugh. He's got a job over in Haverhill you can't hold that guy under water long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Talking of guitars," [...] {{spoke the}} woman, {{addressing}} {{me for the}} first time; [...] "while <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the maté, perhaps you will sing us a ballad. The guitar is lying just behind you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{asked me}} to meet you, and, as far as I can see, every man in Carrington is here," [...] he said. [...] "Raymond Lyle, you called this meeting. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> {{what you have to}} say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tuts!" [...] {{said the}} doctor, losing patience, [...] "Mr. Dishart gives {{more than any}} other man in Thrums to the poor, and he is not to be preached to by a gypsy. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> you, Nanny." ...|$|E
60|$|While <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the reply, I {{made myself}} master {{of all the}} {{information}} Marian could afford {{on the subject of}} Sir Percival's family, and of his early life.

50|$|Passed a given {{number of}} days, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{going to have}} a well defined pattern, which can be, or not <b>be</b> what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for.</b> Although it could not seen {{intuitive}} through the explanation above, an important feature of the algorithm is that it is easy to predict how it will become a pattern just after {{taking a look at the}} parameters passed to the algorithm.|$|R
60|$|Commodore Barney {{used the}} Avenger as his flag-ship while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the Scorpion, and our deck was {{literally}} crowded {{with men who}} had been summoned to receive orders. He even ate breakfast with us, doing the greater portion of the eating holding converse with one or another, and it can well <b>be</b> fancied that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> proud because of having made possible such an honor for our pungy.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{we should}} be twelve," [...] Lady Anselman sighed. [...] "Of course!" [...] she added, her face {{suddenly}} brightening. [...] "What an idiot I am! It's Ronnie <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for.</b> One can't be cross with him, poor fellow. He can only just get about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And even that," [...] the Duchess remarked, smiling, [...] "has been yellow for {{the last}} few days.

6000|$|...

5000|$|... "When it stopped, the respite {{was only}} for a short time. A second wave came across. We held our breath, but it passed on towards Argentan. A third {{bombardment}} followed, just as intense, the terrible noise blotting out {{the sound of the}} women praying. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> a fourth wave, which never arrived. When we emerged from our shelter, our breath still shaking, a cloud of dust smothered the courtyard and all the neighbouring streets." [...] ….|$|R
60|$|We {{found the}} Tracys {{when we arrived}} at home. Dermot was not equal to {{standing}} about at the pottery, but Lady Diana had promised to come and help me entertain the party, and very kindly she did so during the very trying hungry hour to which we had to submit, inasmuch as, when Sir James at last appeared, it turned out that he never ate luncheon, and was in perfect ignorance that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "O <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> {{one called}} God," [...] said they, [...] "(Though by some the Will, or Force, or Laws; [...] And, vaguely, by some, the Ultimate Cause;) Waiting {{for him to}} see us before we are clay.

6000|$|... "I reckon {{they suspect}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> help, and they {{mean to do}} {{something}} before it gits too late," [...] observed Poke Stover.

6000|$|... "We knew--my {{mother and}} I--that the braves would <b>be</b> home soon. <b>We</b> {{expected}} them every minute. While <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> them, {{my mother went}} into the bush to pick berries. There she discovered a war-party of our enemies. They were preparing to attack our village, for they knew the men were away, and they wanted the scalps {{of the women and}} children. But they did not know the exact spot where our wigwams were pitched, and were just going, after a feed, to look for it.|$|R
