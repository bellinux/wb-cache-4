50|$|Moist {{heat therapy}} has been {{believed}} {{to be more effective}} at warming tissues than dry heat, because water transfers heat more quickly than air. Clinical studies do not support the popular belief that moist heat is more effective than dry heat. Moist heat results in the perception that the tissue is heated more deeply. In fact, recent studies indicate that vasodilation, the expansion of the blood capillaries (vessels) to allow more blood flow, is improved with dry heat therapy. Expansion of the blood capillaries is the primary objective of heat therapy. Heat therapy increases the effect on muscles, joints, and soft tissue. Heat is typically applied by placing a <b>warming</b> <b>device</b> on the relevant body part.|$|E

This common perioperative {{problem has been}} linked to adverse patient outcomes such as myocardial ischaemia, surgical site infection and coagulopathy. International perioperative guidelines recommend patient warming, using a forced air <b>warming</b> <b>device,</b> and the use of warmed intraoperative irrigation solutions for the prevention of hypothermia in at-risk patient groups. This trial will investigate the effect of these interventions on patients’ temperature, thermal comfort, and total recovery time. Method/Design The trial will employ a randomised 2 x 2 factorial design. Eligible patients will be stratified by anaesthetist and block randomised into one of four groups: Group one will receive preoperative warming with a forced air warming device; group two will receive warmed intraoperative irrigation solutions; group three will receive both preoperative warming and warmed intraoperative irrigation solutions; and group four will receive neither intervention. Participants in all four groups will receive active intraoperative warming with a forced air <b>warming</b> <b>device.</b> The primary outcome measures are postoperative temperature, thermal comfort, and total recovery time. Primary outcomes will undergo a two-way analysis of variance controlling for covariants such as operating room ambient temperature and volume of intraoperative irrigation solution.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inadvertent {{hypothermia}} {{is common}} in patients undergoing surgical procedures with a reported prevalence of perioperative hypothermia ranging from 50 % to 90 %. Hypothermia within the perioperative environment may have many undesired physiological effects {{that are associated with}} postoperative morbidity. There are different options for treating and/or preventing hypothermia within the adult perioperative environment, which include active and passive warming methods. This systematic review was undertaken to provide comprehensive evidence on the most effective strategies for prevention and management of inadvertent hypothermia in the perioperative environment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to identify the most effective methods for the treatment and/or preventions of hypothermia in intraoperative or postoperative patients. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Adult patients ≥ 18 years of age, who underwent any type of surgery were included in this review. Types of interventions included were any type of linen or cover, aluminium foil wraps, forced-air <b>warming</b> <b>devices,</b> radiant <b>warming</b> <b>devices</b> and fluid <b>warming</b> <b>devices.</b> This review considered all identified prospective studies that used a clearly described process for randomisation, and/or included a control group. The primary outcome of Interest was change in core body temperature. REVIEW METHODS: Two independent reviewers assessed methodological validity of papers selected for retrieval and any disagreements were resolved through discussion. RESULTS: Nineteen studies with a combined 1451 patients who underwent different surgical procedures were included in this review. Meta-analysis was not possible. Forced-air warming in pregnant women scheduled for caesarean delivery under regional anaesthesia prevented maternal and foetal hypothermia. Intravenous and irrigating fluids warmed (38 – 40 °C) to a temperature higher than that of room temperature by different fluid <b>warming</b> <b>devices</b> (both dry and water heated) proved significantly beneficial to patients in terms of stable haemodynamic variables, and higher core temperature {{at the end of the}} surgery. Water garment warmer was significantly (P 0. 05) effective than forced-air warming in maintaining intraoperative normothermia in orthotopic liver transplantation patients. Extra warming with forced air compared to routine thermal care was effective in reducing the incidence of surgical wound infections and postoperative cardiac complications. Passive warming with reflective heating blankets or elastic bandages wrapped around the legs tightly were found to be ineffective in reducing the incidence or magnitude of hypothermia. CONCLUSION: There are significant benefits associated with forced-air warming. Evidence supports commencement of active warming preoperatively and monitoring it throughout the intraoperative period. Single strategies such as forced-air warming were more effective than passive warming; however, combined strategies, including preoperative commencement, use of warmed fluids plus forced-air warming as other active strategies were more effective in vulnerable groups (age or durations of surgeries).

Objective The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of different heating methods on the microtensile bond strength of an etch-and-rinse adhesive to dentin. Material and method Twenty-four caries-free extracted human third molars were transversally sectioned to expose a flat dentinal surface. The samples were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid gel and divided into three groups (n = 8) : 1) Control - the adhesive system (Adper Single Bond 2; 3 M ESPE) was applied at room temperature; 2) <b>Warming</b> <b>device</b> - the adhesive was warmed to 37 °C in a custom device before application; and 3) Warm air - the adhesive was warmed to 50 °C with an air jet after application on dentin. The specimens were restored with a composite resin (Filtek Z 250 A 2, 3 M ESPE) and prepared for microtensile bond strength testing, after 24 h in water storage. The data were subjected to one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (p 0. 05). The mean bond strength values in the control, the <b>warming</b> <b>device,</b> and the warm air groups were 48. 5 (± 5. 2), 40. 35 (± 4. 9), and 47. 2 (± 5. 3) MPa, respectively (p = 0. 05).

To remedy this problem, we initiated a quality improvement process that investigated {{the use of a}} conductive warm water-circulating device (the Allon ThermoWrap, Menen Medical Corporation, Trevose, PA, USA), and hypothesized that it would decrease the incidence of perioperative hypothermia. We compared two different intraoperative warming devices using a historic control. We retrospectively reviewed intraoperative records of 80 TAVRs between 6 / 2013 and 6 / 2015, 46 and 34 of which were done with the forced-air and water-circulating devices, respectively. Continuous temperature data obtained from pulmonary artery catheter, temperature upon arrival to cardiothoracic ICU (CTU), age, BSA, height, and BMI were compared. Patients warmed with both devices were similar in terms of demographic characteristics. First recorded intraoperative temperature (mean 36. 26 ± SD 0. 61 vs. 35. 95 ± 0. 46 °C, p = 0. 02), lowest intraoperative temperature (36. 01 ± 0. 58 vs. 34. 89 ± 0. 76 °C, p< 0. 001), temperature {{at the end of the}} procedure (36. 47 ± 0. 51 vs. 35. 17 ± 0. 75 °C, p< 0. 001), and temperature upon arrival to the CTU (36. 35 ± 0. 44 vs. 35. 07 ± 0. 78 °C, p< 0. 001) were significantly higher in the water-circulating group as compared to the forced-air group.

40|$|Background Women {{undergoing}} Cesarean Section (CS) {{are vulnerable}} to the adverse effects associated with perioperative core temperature drop, {{in part due to}} the tendency for CS to be performed under neuraxial anesthesia, blood and fluid loss, and vasodilation. Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia (IPH) is a common condition that affects patients undergoing surgery of all specialties and is detrimental to all age groups, including neonates. Previous systematic reviews on IPH prevention largely focus on either adult or all ages populations, and have mainly overlooked pregnant or CS patients as a distinct group. Not all recommendations made by systematic reviews targeting all adult patients may be transferable to CS patients. Alternative, effective methods for preventing or managing hypothermia in this group would be valuable. Objectives To synthesize the best available evidence in relation to preventing and/or treating hypothermia in mothers after CS surgery. Types of participants Adult patients over the age of 18 years, of any ethnic background, with or without co-morbidities, undergoing any mode of anesthesia for any type of CS (emergency or planned) at healthcare facilities who have received interventions to limit or manage perioperative core heat loss were included. Types of intervention(s) Active or passive warming methods versus usual care or placebo, that aim to limit or manage core heat loss as applied to women undergoing CS were included. Types of studies Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met the inclusion criteria, with reduction of perioperative hypothermia a primary or secondary outcome were considered. Types of outcomes Primary outcome: maternal core temperature measured during the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative phases of care Secondary outcomes: newborn core temperature at birth, umbilical pH obtained immediately after birth, Apgar scores, length of Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU) stay, maternal thermal comfort. Search strategy A comprehensive search was undertaken of the following databases from their inception until May 2012 : ProQuest, Web of Science, Scopus, Dissertation and Theses PQDT (via ProQuest), Current Contents, CENTRAL, Mednar, OpenGrey, Clinical Trials. There were no language restrictions. Methodological quality Retrieved papers were assessed for methodological quality by two independent reviewers prior to inclusion using JBI software. Disagreements were resolved via consultation with the third reviewer. An assessment of quality of the included papers was also made in relation to five key quality factors. Data collection Two independent reviewers extracted data from the included papers using a previously piloted customized data extraction tool. Results 12 studies with a combined total of 719 participants were included. Three broad intervention groups were identified; intravenous (IV) fluid <b>warming,</b> <b>warming</b> <b>devices,</b> leg wrapping. IV fluid warming, whether administered intraoperatively or preoperatively, was found to be effective at maintaining maternal (but not neonatal) temperature and preventing shivering, but does not improve thermal comfort. The effectiveness of IV fluid warming on Apgar scores and umbilical pH remains unclear. <b>Warming</b> <b>devices,</b> including forced air warming and under body carbon polymer mattresses, were effective at preventing hypothermia and reduced shivering, however were most effective if applied preoperatively. The effectiveness of <b>warming</b> <b>devices</b> to improve thermal comfort remains unclear.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Perioperative {{hypothermia}} {{increases the}} morbidity of surgery. However, the true incidence of hypothermia during prolonged laparoscopic surgery is still unknown. To investigate this issue, {{we compared the}} temperature change between patients undergoing open and laparoscopic colorectal surgery. METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients who were undergoing laparoscopic (33) or open (27) colorectal surgery had a transesophageal temperature probe placed after induction of anesthesia. Core temperature values were measured at 15 -min intervals. RESULTS: The groups were not statistically different with respect to age, sex, body surface area, or initial transesophageal temperature. The type of surgical access (open or laparoscopic) caused {{no difference in the}} incidence of hypothermia. The use of a forced-air <b>warming</b> <b>device</b> produced significantly less hypothermia during laparoscopic surgery. Men showed significantly less variability in temperature change than women.

Two non-wet (Azuki no Chikara, Eye Hot R) and three wet (hot towel, Hot Eye Mask, Memoto Este) devices were compared in a masked manner. Visual analog scale (VAS) score for ocular symptoms, tear film breakup time (TFBUT), meibum grade, temperatures (eyelid skin, tarsal conjunctiva, central cornea), Schirmer test value, and meibomian gland area were measured before and after warming application. ResultsThe single application of the five warming devices improved the VAS score, TFBUT, and ocular temperatures. In the repeated warming application, Azuki no Chikara as a representative non-wet <b>warming</b> <b>device</b> induced a stable and significant improvement in TFBUT and increased the tarsal conjunctival temperature and meibomian gland area in both normal subjects and MGD patients. It also improved meibum grade in MGD patients. ConclusionOur results suggest that repeated eyelid warming with a non-wet device improves tear film function in normal individuals and may have beneficial effects on both tear film and meibomian gland function in MGD patients...|$|E
40|$|To {{achieve the}} radical {{improvements}} in building energy efficiency being {{called for by}} the State of California, {{it will be necessary}} to apply an integrated approach involving new designs, new technologies, new ways of operating buildings, new tools for design, commissioning and monitoring, and new understanding of what comprises a comfortable and productive indoor environment. This project, which is an amendment to CEC Contract 500 - 08 - 044, has focused on two space conditioning technologies that were part of the original project and showed significant potential to dramatically improve traditional levels of energy efficiency while also increasing occupant satisfaction and thermal comfort. The amendment allowed us to extend our ongoing research on these two promising technologies: personal comfort systems, and radiant heating and cooling systems. The work done under this project has advanced the understanding of personal comfort systems and radiant heating and cooling systems, and has generated the following findings and recommendations: (1) four field demonstration studies with personal comfort systems technologies showed evidence of reduced zone heating energy use (as much as 46 - 75 percent for one study) while also dramatically improving occupant comfort under a variety of challenging thermal situations; (2) the personal comfort systems components tested in the four demonstration field studies included foot <b>warming</b> <b>devices,</b> leg <b>warming</b> <b>devices,</b> chairs that provide both heating and cooling, and small desk fans for cooling; (3) the results of the personal comfort systems field studies demonstrated that personal comfort systems have reached a level of performance that supports commercial market introduction; (4) building energy performance data, occupant satisfaction assessments, and valuable lessons learned from two successful and well-performing radiant slab office buildings; (5) development of an online map of buildings using radiant technologies to provide resources to building stakeholders who are interested in their implementation; (6) laboratory experiments comparing zone-level sensible cooling loads between radiant chilled ceiling and overhead air distribution systems confirmed the fundamental differences and implications for cooling load calculation methods; (7) two energy simulation studies showed that the David Brower Center design and heating, ventilating and air conditioning strategy present a viable design option in terms of predicted energy use and thermal comfort over a range of California climates, and demonstrated the potential impact of more accurately specifying furniture and contents (i. e., internal mass) on predicted zone peak cooling loads...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that waste heat from forced-air warming blankets {{can increase the}} temperature and concentration of airborne particles over the surgical site. The mechanism for the increased concentration of particles and their site of origin remained unclear. We therefore attempted to visualise the airflow in theatre over a simulated total knee replacement using neutral-buoyancy helium bubbles. Particles were created using a Rocket PS 23 smoke machine positioned below the operating table, a potential area of contamination. The same theatre set-up, <b>warming</b> <b>devices</b> and controls were used as in our previous study. This demonstrated that waste heat from the poorly insulated forced-air warming blanket increased the air temperature on the surgical side of the drape by> 5 °C. This created convection currents that rose against the downward unidirectional airflow, causing turbulence over the patient. The convection currents increased the particle concentration 1000 -fold (2 174 000 particles/m 3 for forced-air warming vs 1000 particles/m 3 for radiant warming and 2000 particles/m 3 for the control) by drawing potentially contaminated particles from below the operating table into the surgical site.
