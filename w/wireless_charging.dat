40|$|A {{range of}} {{furniture}} pieces which allow inductive charging of low power devices {{have entered the}} market. Usually, the <b>wireless</b> <b>charger</b> module is cut through the furniture surface. As a consequence, the surface is not entirely smooth, which is aesthetically a disadvantage. It would be preferable if the <b>wireless</b> <b>charger</b> would be invisible, implying integration underneath {{the surface of the}} furniture. In this paper, we study the feasibility of inductive wireless power transfer with the most common used table top materials and coatings. We install the transmitter coil beneath the furniture surface so the <b>wireless</b> <b>charger</b> module remains invisible. We also measure the efficiency and power transfer of a typical bedside table with inductive powering, already available on the market, as a case study in order to obtain a reference for future furniture applications. Our main conclusion is that the presence of the most common furniture panels and coatings does not adversely influence inductive power transfer. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{an attempt}} {{has been made}} to produce a {{recipient}} system of <b>wireless</b> <b>charge</b> for a simple hearing aid so that electrical signal would be generated through detecting and receiving radio frequency waves (RF). The purpose of this design is to receive <b>wireless</b> <b>charge</b> for hearing aids and basically for any electronic device which is not required to a high energy for being setup. In this study, it has been demonstrated that as the amount of radio receiving energy increases, distance of receiver from antenna should be decreased; otherwise, either maximum amount of the receiving energy, or signal power density of the transmitter should be increased. Since it is im-possible to be performed, it is decided to set up an energy receiving system constructed by rec-tenna and charge Circuit and to adjust their parameters to provide energy requirements for a de-vice with low-power consumption. In this paper, different components of an energy receiving sys-tem from radio frequency band have been mentioned and a diagram block has been suggested. Subsequently, input impedance of designed antenna has been adjusted by provided relations. This impedance should be adjusted with the total impedance of regarded hearing aid Circuit by which the highest amount of received signal power is transferred to the battery of hearing aids.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} of the <b>wireless</b> battery <b>charging</b> platform have prompted requirements to investigate the mutual inductance between a movable planar coil and the fixed planar coil on the <b>charging</b> platform. The <b>wireless</b> battery <b>charging</b> platform must allow the load to be placed anywhere on the charging surface. Therefore, the relative position between the movable energy-receiving coil and the energy-transmitting coils on the charging platform must be flexible. In this paper, an extended formula is proposed for the mutual inductance calculation for two coaxial or noncoaxial planar spiral windings sandwiched between two double-layer substrates. It can quickly determine the mutual coupling of two planar windings that can have different relative positions and distance between them. This new calculation method provides a new and useful tool for determining the mutual inductance of a movable planar coil and the fixed planar coil on the <b>wireless</b> battery <b>charging</b> platform. The theory has been favorably tested and compared with practical measurements and also with finite-element analysis. © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
