50|$|In 1958, David married Barbara Kathleen Whitaker, who was {{the warden}} of Lundy Island. Barbara Snow was also a noted ornithologist and a geologist. From 1957 to 1961 the Snows worked for the New York Zoological Society at the society's {{research}} centre in Trinidad. Here they made detailed studies of the oilbirds (Steatornis caripensis) and the fascinating and very complex courtship dances of the <b>white-bearded</b> <b>manakin</b> (Manacus manacus) and the golden-headed manakin (Pipra erythrocephala).|$|E
50|$|They {{focussed}} {{for some}} time on the fascinating and very complex courtship dances of the <b>white-bearded</b> <b>manakin</b> (Manacus manacus) and the golden-headed manakin (Pipra erythrocephala). They came to realise that tropical fruit-eating birds have abundant food resources, and, therefore, a lot of “spare time” which has facilitated the extraordinary flourishing of communal lek displays by male manakins. He described these in several classic papers, while also working with Barbara on other tropical birds.|$|E
50|$|The male <b>white-bearded</b> <b>manakin</b> has a {{fascinating}} breeding display at a communal lek. Each male clears {{a patch of}} forest floor to bare earth, and perches on a bare stick. The display consists of rapid leaps between sticks and the ground, accompanied by a loud wing snap, the whirring of the wings, and a chee-poo call. Groups of up to 70 birds may perform together, the largest leks being in Trinidad. The female builds a shallow cup nest low in a tree; two brown-mottled white eggs are laid, and incubated entirely by the female for about 18-19 days, with a further 13-15 days to fledging. The young are fed mainly on regurgitated fruit with some insects.|$|E
50|$|The major {{properties}} are the Spring Hill Estate and the adjacent William Beebe Tropical Research Station (also known as Simla), {{which was established}} by the famous naturalist and explorer William Beebe as a tropical research station for the New York Zoological Society. Beebe bought the 'Verdant Vale' estate in 1949 and named it after Simla in India, which he had visited in 1910. Both properties had previously been cacao estates but contained large stands of original rainforest. The owners of the Spring Hill Estate, Newcombe and Asa Wright, hosted many visiting scientists in the 1950s and '60s, including the noted ornithologists David Snow and Barbara Snow, who made detailed studies of the oilbirds and the very complex courtship dances of the <b>white-bearded</b> <b>manakin</b> and the golden-headed manakin.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>white-bearded</b> <b>manakin</b> (Manacus manacus) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird which breeds {{in tropical}} South America. It is found from Colombia, Venezuela and Trinidad south to Bolivia and northern Argentina. This manakin is found in forests, secondary growth and plantations. It is a small, plump bird about 10.7 cm long. Males have a black crown, upper back, wings and tail and are otherwise white. Females are olive-green and resemble female golden-headed manakins. At breeding time, males are involved in lekking behaviour {{on the forest floor}} during which they puff out their neck feathers. This is a fairly common species with a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
40|$|Behavioral {{studies of}} birds have {{reported}} several functions for active anting. Maintenance of plumage and prevention from ectoparasites are some examples. In this context, anting by males {{may be of}} particular importance in a classical lek mating system, where male-male competition is common and individuals with higher fitness may be more successful at attracting of females. In the present note, I describe the anting behavior of <b>White-bearded</b> <b>Manakin</b> (Manacus manacus) and I relate it to lek breeding and feeding (frugivory) habits of the species. Males used up to seven Solenopsis sp. ants. They rubbed each small ant from 4 to 31 times on undertail feathers until the ants were degraded; ants were not eaten. Males then searched for a new ant in the court. Seeds discarded by males on their individual display courts attract herbivorous ants that are used for anting {{as a way to}} maintain feathers and fitness. I hypothesize that anting in <b>White-bearded</b> <b>Manakin</b> may increase the probability of males to attract females to their display courts...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{structuring}} {{is common}} in natural populations. It is important to identify and consider population structure when studying evolutionary processes. Recently, the discovery of genetic structuring in some lekking bird species has opened up new perspectives on {{our understanding of the}} evolution of lek mating systems. This thesis uses molecular data to identify patterns of broad and fine scale genetic structuring in the lekking <b>white-bearded</b> <b>manakin</b> Manacus manacus. Additionally, data on male mating success, female visiting patterns and behavioural, morphological and territorial characteristics of individual males are used to identify variables that may influence the distribution of matings in this species. Analysis of genetic divergence within the genus Manacus revealed genetic sub-structuring and limited gene flow between species/subspecies. There was no significant isolation by distance relationship. Factors such as physical barriers to gene flow {{may play a role in}} shaping the genetic structure of the bearded manakin genus. <b>White-bearded</b> <b>manakin</b> leks on Trinidad were composed of groups of related males. More than one such kin group existed on each lek. That related males gather in groups suggests that genetic structuring is not simply a consequence of limited dispersal. Active choices must take place by both residential and newly arrived birds. Female visits to, and matings with, males were non-random. Centrality of male display court was the only measured variable that consistently correlated with male mating success. More aggressive displays were made as the distance between courts decreased. There was no significant relationship between the number of aggressive displays made between males and relatedness levels. Males with high mating success spent more time in aggressive behaviours. In conclusion, <b>white-bearded</b> <b>manakin</b> lek formation and display court acquisition is likely to be influenced by genetic relatedness levels and male-male interactions. Centrality of court seemed important in mating success and may be an indicator of male dominance. However, a variety of other factors may also influence mating success and may be variable over time...|$|E
40|$|In lek mating systems, males {{aggregate}} {{and defend}} arenas where they display for females; females select and mate {{with a male}} and then solely raise their offspring. Generally, female visits and copulations increase and reproductive variance in male mating success declines with lek size. Here we investigate how male display effort changes across a gradient in lek size. We expect male display effort, an energetically expensive activity, will increase with lek size and male rank due to changes in breeding opportunities and competition among males. We test the interaction of male rank and lek size on display effort using the <b>white-bearded</b> <b>manakin,</b> Manacus manacus (Aves: Pipridae), a well-studied species with a wide geographic distribution {{in the new world}} tropics. We used mini-video recorders to simultaneously capture female visits and display behaviors of 41 males distributed over 10 leks. We found that overall display effort increased disproportionately with lek size due to males of both high and low ranks increasing their display effort at larger leks. Our results suggest that increased breeding opportunities and intrasexual competition at larger leks result in males of different ranks investing similarly in increased display effort in order to attract females...|$|E
