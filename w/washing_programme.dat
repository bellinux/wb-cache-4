Includes bibliographical references (page 70). Safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and hygiene practices have very profound impact on human life. Especially, Bangladesh faces multiple challenges in the water, sanitation and hygiene sectors. BRAC has been working in this sector as a programme named “WASH Programme of BRAC” with major support of Netherlands government since 2006 to achieve millennium development goals (goal 4 & 7) on safe drinking water and basic sanitation. <b>WASH</b> <b>Programme</b> can be classified into two phases. First phase is called <b>WASH</b> I <b>programme</b> (during May 2006 to April 2011) and the second phase is called <b>WASH</b> II <b>programme</b> (during October 2011 to April 2015). The first phase has fulfilled sanitary latrine coverage to 25. 6 millions, hygiene education coverage 38. 8 millions and safe drinking water coverage 1. 78 millions of people within the period of 2006 to 2011. <b>WASH</b> <b>programme</b> (<b>WASH</b> II) is currently running in 254 Upazilas including 150 Upazilas of the first phase. This research work aims to accomplish an empirical study of <b>WASH</b> <b>programme</b> in Dhamrai Upazila. The objective {{of this study is}} to find out whether the <b>WASH</b> <b>programme</b> is benefitting the health condition of the poor. Many poor people of our country usually deprive of getting safe drinking water and sanitation facilities due to many impediments and problems that can be expressed by three indicators; these are accessibility, affordability and usability. The aim of this programme is to make every people accessible or affordable to get the benefit of safe drinking water and use of sanitary latrine. Hygiene knowledge and hygiene practices are important for better health status. From the research findings, it has been revealed that, in Dhamrai, around ninety percent respondents were attacked by diarrhoeal diseases more than five times in a year. But due to the effective activities of <b>WASH</b> <b>programme,</b> this percentage has now reduced to zero percent. This is obviously a great achievement of <b>WASH</b> <b>programme</b> in Dhamrai Upazila. In spite of having such big achievements the <b>WASH</b> <b>programme</b> in research area is not out of flaws. According to the research survey, though this programme has significant success in sanitation and hygiene sector, it has not fulfilled the demand of safe drinking water. However, the improvement of health condition of the poor people of Dhamrai Upazila through the <b>WASH</b> <b>programme</b> has been reflected by the respondent’s opinion on the question ‘overall satisfaction level of the respondent on WASH programme’. Among forty respondents, 62. 5 percent are satisfied and 32. 5 percent are highly satisfied with the programme activities. That is, all the respondents except five percent are either ‘satisfied’ or ‘highly satisfied’ with the <b>WASH</b> <b>programme.</b> Finally, some policy implications have been made in the last chapter as recommendation that would be helpful for the programme authority and policy planners concerned with water, sanitation and hygiene sector.

Lack of basic sanitation and safe water is an acute problem for all who live in poor and overcrowded urban slums and rural areas of the developing world. For women and girls it presents unique problems. Simply fetching water can place them at risk, while many have to wait until dark to relieve themselves, fearing harassment and sexual assault. In schools dropout rates increase when access to safe water and separate boys and girls toilet facilities are unavailable. There is also a clear need for privacy and dignity in relation to menstruation, pregnancy and childbirth. Within the home, women typically bear the main responsibility for keeping their households supplied with water, caring for the sick, maintaining a hygienic domestic environment and bringing up healthy children. With such users' insight and specific needs to be taken into consideration, wouldn't it make sense to involve women in all planning, implementation and operations of water, sanitation and hygiene (<b>WASH)</b> <b>programmes?</b> Here we examine the crucial role women can and should play as key agents of change.

25|$|Hand washing {{with soap}} {{is the single}} most {{effective}} and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities worldwide. Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old, taking the life of an estimated 1.8 million children per year. Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million child deaths annually. According to UNICEF, turning hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by one-quarter. Hand washing is usually integrated together with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (<b>WASH)</b> <b>programmes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Africa {{lags behind}} {{the rest of}} the world in {{achieving}} international targets for access to safe water and sanitation services, with more than 300 million people without access to an improved water supply and 600 million without adequate sanitation. Therefore, there is renewed emphasis to scale up programmes to increase coverage. Improved water supplies generally rely on the development of groundwater; and sanitation programmes depend on the ability of subsurface to assimilate waste. However, despite the important role of groundwater, hydrogeology and hydrogeologists are rarely given due consideration in planning, implementing and appraising these programmes. Here we discuss what hydrogeological science can contribute to water supply and sanitation (<b>WASH)</b> <b>programmes,</b> illustrated using examples from several programmes across Africa. We propose a framework to help prioritise the involvement of hydrogeologists and the role of groundwater science in improving WASH and making interventions more cost effective and sustainable. The same level of hydrogeological expertise is not required in all areas, but should be targeted to where the impact will be greatest. However, to make the decision on the level of expertise required for a programme requires the contribution from a hydrogeologist early in the planning cycle. The important role of hydrogeological and hydrochemical mapping and resource evaluation in planning programmes is discussed using examples from Nigeria and Ethiopia. Different methods for groundwater exploration are discussed using a recent programme in northern Ghana. The role of hydrogeologists in overseeing construction is illustrated from a world bank project in Ethiopia to assess levels of corruption in rural water supply. Hydrogeological science also has a crucial role in researching future opportunities and issues as a result of climate change, population growth, and food insecurity. Hydrogeologists clearly have much to offer <b>WASH</b> <b>programmes.</b> To be most effective hydrogeology should be communicated effectively and in a manner that is easily integrated into existing programmes. Hydrogeologists should also accept that there are some areas where employing modern hydrogeological techniques will not be cost effective and concentrate on the areas where they can best add value. ...|$|R
40|$|Water {{resources}} {{in many parts}} of the world, but particularly in Africa, face multiple pressures. These growing pressures, along with rainfall variability, pose significant risks to water resources and livelihoods. Over the past two decades the concept of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) has been presented as a panacea, but subscription to this model has not delivered the results expected. Despite a massive endeavour there is extensive evidence that IWRM remains difficult to implement, particularly in fragile states. In contrast, at local level the responsibility of communities to manage water supply systems forms a central component of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sector policy. But <b>WASH</b> <b>programmes</b> are focused primarily on the supply of services, and not enough on water resources. Consequently, remarkably little has been written about the role of communities in monitoring and managing water resources. Also, few studies have examined the transitions fragile government institutions need to undertake to move from one (inferior) situation, to a much better one. This study used Action Research (AR) to investigate the role community-based institutions can play in monitoring water resources, alongside government authorities. Initial field research was conducted in Darfur and Niger before further work in Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone. It found that communities could monitor water resources with high degrees of success; however, continued external support is also required from responsible government institutions. Community-Based Water Resources Management (CBWRM) is considered a realistic and plausible approach for strengthening the water component in <b>WASH</b> <b>programmes.</b> This research argues that in fragile states there is greater potential to develop national water security plans from local- level initiatives. Adopting a “localised” approach is particularly important for countries that face the pervasive obstacles of short rainfall seasons: negligible hydrometeorological monitoring, limited water infrastructure and weak institutions. CBWRM warrants greater attention from the WASH sector and further research is needed to identify how effectively communities can manage water resources and scale up this approach once Water Resource Assessments (WRAs) have been conducted...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Hand washing is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most effective hygiene promotion activities for public health in developing countries. This study compared hand washing knowledge and practices in BRAC’s water; sanitation and hygiene (<b>WASH)</b> <b>programme</b> areas over time. Methods This study is a cross-sectional comparative study between baseline (2006), midline (2009) and end-line (2011) surveys in 50 sub-districts from the first phase of the programme. Thirty thousand households from 50 sub-districts were selected in two steps: i) 30 villages were selected from each sub-district by cluster sampling, and ii) 20 households were chosen systematically from each village. The matched households were considered (26, 404 in each survey) for analysis. Data were collected from households through face-to-face interview using a pre-tested questionnaire. Respondents were the adult female members of the same households, who had knowledge of day-to-day household activities related to water, sanitation and hygiene. Results A gap between perception and practice of proper hand washing practices with soap was identified in the study areas. Hand washing practice with soap before eating was much lower than after defecation. In baseline data, 8 % reported to wash their hands with soap which significantly increased to 22 % in end line. Hand washing knowledge and practices before cooking food, before serving food and while handling babies is considerably limited than other critical times. A multivariate analysis shows that socio-economic factors including education of household head and respondent, water availability and access to media have strong positive association with hand washing with soap. Conclusion Gap between knowledge and practice still persists in hand washing practices. Long term and extensive initiatives can aware people about the effectiveness of hand washing. </p...|$|R
40|$|Durable {{products}} {{allow to}} reduce the consumption of raw materials long-term and to contribute to waste minimization. Thus, durability {{plays a key role}} to enhance circular economy and resource conservation, for example in the category of electrical and electronic equipment. However, it was observed that the average lifetime of these products has decreased over recent years. We identified the washing machine product group as a relevant case study {{for the development of a}} durability test, and as a potential trigger to systematically address durability in the design of products. The main objective of this research was to develop a procedure to test minimum durability performance of washing machines, on which limitations and potentials for future improvements would be highlighted. The procedure was developed to potentially be used in policy. The durability test was developed considering the whole product tested under overstressed conditions. A series of spinning cycles with fixed unbalanced loads was run on two washing machines, to observe failures and performance changes during the test. Even though no hard failures occurred, results clearly showed that not all of the washing machines are able to sustain such a test without abrasion, or performance deterioration. The proposed test allowed to have results in a relatively short amount of efforts and time, which makes it compatible with policy constraints. However, the attempt to mimic the stress induced on a washing machine by doing a high number of pure spinning cycles with fixed loads did not allow equal testing conditions: The actions of the control procedure regarding unbalance loads differ from machine to machine. Therefore, future developments will need to replace the series of spinning cycles with various <b>washing</b> <b>programmes,</b> and the fixed unbalanced loads with real loads, paying attention to limit the time required by the test. The outcomes of this research can be used as a basis to develop standardized durability tests and to hence contribute to the development of future product’s policy measures. JRC.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety of}} sperm washing and assisted reproduction technique (ART) outcome offered to serodiscordant couples with a human immunodeficiency virus- 1 (HIV- 1) -positive male. METHODS: Sperm washing was performed and checked by RT–PCR on each semen sample before its fresh usage. Intrauterine insemination (IUI) or IFV/ICSI was offered according to fertility profile of each couple. Non-infected women underwent HIV testing 2 weeks before each procedure and for up to 6 months after. RESULTS: Seven hundred and fortyone couples entered the study of a possible 2011 serodiscordant couples counselled over 4 years. Superovulation and IUI were performed in 581 couples, where the pregnancy rate per cycle and pregnancy rate per couple were 19 and 78 %, respectively, with multiple pregnancy rate being 4 %. One hundred and sixty couples were treated by IVF/ICSI, where pregnancy rate per cycle and per couple were 22 and 41 %, respectively, with multiple pregnancy rate being 10 %. All female partners were still HIV- 1 negative at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Sperm <b>washing</b> within a <b>programme</b> of reproductive counselling was proved to be safe in this large series of serodiscordant couples. The overall pregnancy rate (70. 3 %), independent of the procedure used (IUI or IVF/ICSI), justifies the effort of the medical team in setting up and implementing dedicated centres and of the individual patient in seeking a safe pregnancy.

40|$|Bangladesh is densely {{populated}} {{and it is}} expected that the population increases significantly in the coming decade, up to 60 % more by 2050 according to IIASA (2013). Demand for drinking water will increase accordingly. These developments may cause significant changes in the hydrological system, e. g. leading to a drop of groundwater pressures. Moreover, climate change and a sea level rise are predicted by the scenarios drawn by the International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC, 2013). This leads to, among others, an increase of salt water intrusion, in surface water as well as in groundwater. The goal of the BRAC <b>WASH</b> II <b>programme</b> is to contribute to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals by providing integrated water services, sanitation and hygiene promotion expanding to hard-to-reach areas and to under-served populations, in collaboration with government and other stakeholders. As part of the programme, innovative research is addressed in six relevant themes, one of which is the theme salt water intrusion. This project, SWIBANGLA – Managing salt water intrusion impacts in Bangladesh, contributes to the theme salt water intrusion. In this project, the focus is on salt water intrusion in coastal groundwater systems, as groundwater is the main resource of drinking water. So, intrusion of sea water into the coastal surface water courses that are under the influence of tidal effect and storm surges are not studied here. When the salt water intrusion processes and dynamics in groundwater systems are understood, adequate water management measures are feasible. Otherwise, a shortage of sufficient, clean fresh water at the right moment for domestic water supply as well as for agricultural use will occur. Currently, a blue print for accurate policy measures on the issue of salt water intrusion does not exist. In current water safety planning practices in Bangladesh, the issue of salt water intrusion in groundwater systems is underexposed. The Department of Public Health and Engineering (DPHE) is the main authority in developing and improving Water Safety Plans for water supply technologies in Bangladesh. The outputs of SWIBANGLA are mainly meant for DPHE, which has been the main stakeholder during the project, but they are also meant for all governmental agencies, NGOs, universities and others that study, manage or have to deal with salt water intrusion impacts in Bangladesh. SWIBANLGA has two main general objectives which contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals: increasing WASH sector stakeholders’ awareness of the salinization of drinking water resources and the threats posed by this process; increasing WASH sector stakeholders’ knowledge and skills necessary to anticipate on the salinization of drinking water resources. The specific additional objectives leading to the main ones are: -Create {{a better understanding of the}} process of salinization of drinking water resources in Bangladesh -Provide recommendations for monitoring -Provide recommendations for adaptation and mitigation -Achieve an effective, tailored knowledge transfer between the Netherlands and Bangladesh -Advise on the integration of the salinization issue in Water Safety Plannin...|$|R
40|$|Solid waste {{management}} {{has become one}} of the contemporary issues of the 21 St Century at local, national, regional and global scale. Studies on community participation in developing countries have been done but up to date gaps exist in the documentation of the real community based projects in solid {{waste management}}, challenges affecting full community participation as well as suggested solutions. The impacts of the suggested solutions are only superficially dealt with. This study examined the roles and effectiveness of communities in solid waste management in high density residential areas so as to come up with sustainable solid waste management options with respect to Nenyere area in Mbare, Harare. The study area was purposively selected by the researcher to assess the roles and effectiveness of the community health clubs and waste recycling cooperatives in the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene <b>programmes</b> (<b>WASH)</b> and the Urban Environment Programmes meant to empower the communities to embark in solid waste management activities in their neighbourhoods. The area was also selected by virtue of its ever growing population and unsustainable waste handling and disposal practices which are likely to make it vulnerable to disease outbreaks. To achieve this, semi structured interviews and 100 questionnaires from systematically selected residents were used to obtain information on the various solid waste management activities done at community level from residents and key informants from various organisations that deal with solid waste management issues respectively. Photos, observations and focus group discussions assisted the researcher to unearth the evidence on the ground. Information obtained include socio-demographic data, types and quantities of solid waste generated weekly at household level, activities undertaken by the communities in solid waste management, supporting organisations, challenges encountered, environmentally sound solid waste management strategies as well as legislation and institutional aspects. Research findings revealed that organic waste dominated the solid waste stream and accounted for over 50 % of the solid waste generated at household level. Quantity of waste generated was positively correlated to household size. Composting, clean-up campaigns, waste sorting, recycling and education awareness are the main activities undertaken with support from different organisations. Minimum awareness on legislation and institutional aspects negatively affect the communityâ€™s compliance to legal obligations. In light of these findings, the researcher recommends that full technical and financial support must be offered to community health clubs and recycling cooperatives by the private sector, non-governmental organisations and local authority. Environmentally sustainable solid waste management practices guided by the principles of the integrated approach and invigorated by environmental education must be fully adopted...|$|R
