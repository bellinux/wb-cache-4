5|$|A country's {{external}} <b>wealth</b> {{is measured}} by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external <b>wealth</b> while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external <b>wealth</b> are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external <b>wealth</b> means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external <b>wealth</b> indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E

5|$|Exactly {{who owned}} the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and {{probably}} never will be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents {{only a portion of}} the precious-metal <b>wealth</b> of the person, or people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as those found in the Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had <b>wealth</b> in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the <b>wealth</b> of someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of the <b>wealth</b> of a family that was incredibly wealthy.|$|E

5|$|Kentish {{manufacture}} before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry. Kentish jewellers {{were highly}} skilled, {{and before the}} end of the sixth century they gained access to gold. Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the Loire. It is not known what Kent traded for all of this <b>wealth,</b> although it seems likely that there was a flourishing slave trade. It may well be that this <b>wealth</b> was the foundation of Æthelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought <b>wealth</b> in its turn.|$|E

5|$|<b>Wealth,</b> like {{income and}} taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% {{of the adult}} {{population}} possess 72% of the country's household <b>wealth,</b> while the bottom half claim only 2%. According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's <b>wealth</b> in 2016. Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value. Since peaking {{in the second quarter of}} 2007, household <b>wealth</b> was down $14trillion, but has since increased $14trillion over 2006 levels.

5|$|Wollstonecraft wields the English philosopher John Locke's {{definition}} of property (that is, ownership acquired through labour) against Burke's notion of inherited <b>wealth.</b> She contends that inheritance {{is one of}} the major impediments to the progress of European civilization, and repeatedly argues that Britain's problems are rooted in the inequity of property distribution. Although she did not advocate a totally equal distribution of <b>wealth,</b> she did desire one that was more equitable.|$|E

5|$|At King Edward's death, {{only the}} royal estates and the estates of Harold were larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand. Medieval writers {{condemned}} {{him for his}} greed and for his pluralism. Hugh the Chanter, a medieval chronicler, claimed that the confiscated <b>wealth</b> of Stigand helped keep King William on the throne. A recent study of his <b>wealth</b> {{and how it was}} earned shows that while he did engage in some exploitative methods to gain some of his <b>wealth,</b> other lands were gained through inheritance or through royal favour. The same study shows little evidence that he despoiled his episcopal estates, although the record towards monastic houses is more suspect. There is no complaint in contemporary records about his private life, and the accusations that he committed simony and was illiterate only date from the 12th century.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, his <b>wealth</b> briefly surpassed $101billion. Despite his <b>wealth</b> and {{extensive}} business travel, Gates usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, {{when he bought}} a private jet. Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not {{the richest man in}} the world because he disliked the attention it brought. In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his <b>wealth</b> doubled from 40billion to more than 82billion. Since October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.|$|E

5|$|Nobles, {{who were}} {{believed}} to be direct descendants of the descended person from heaven, lived in tongkonans, while commoners lived in less lavish houses (bamboo shacks called banua). Slaves lived in small huts, which had to be built around their owner's tongkonan. Commoners might marry anyone, but nobles preferred to marry in-family to maintain their status. Sometimes nobles married Bugis or Makassarese nobles. Commoners and slaves were prohibited from having death feasts. Despite close kinship and status inheritance, there was some social mobility, as marriage or change in <b>wealth</b> could affect an individuals status. <b>Wealth</b> was counted by the ownership of water buffaloes.|$|E

5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the prosperity gospel, the health and <b>wealth</b> gospel, or the gospel of success) is a religious belief among some Christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of God for them, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material <b>wealth.</b> Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Terry {{was born}} in York, to Joseph Terry, the {{confectioner}} and co-founder of Terry's of York, and his wife Harriet Atkinson, {{the daughter of a}} successful farmer from Leppington, North Yorkshire and sister-in-law to the elder Terry's initial business partner, Robert Berry. His family's <b>wealth</b> enabled him to attend the independent St Peter's School, York. Such <b>wealth</b> had arisen after Terry's of York had advantageously relocated to St Helen's Square, in the centre of York, with business benefiting from the City's intake of 30,000 shoppers and tourists daily as a result of significant developments in rail travel.|$|E

5|$|The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) was {{introduced}} in 1995 in the Human Development Report written by the United Nations Development Program in order to add a gender-sensitive dimension to the Human Development Index. The GDI takes into account not only the average or general level of well-being and <b>wealth</b> within a given country, but also how this <b>wealth</b> and well-being is distributed between different groups within society, especially between genders. However, feminist economists do not universally agree {{on the use of}} the GDI and some offer improvements to it.|$|E
5|$|The Quwatlis were {{a family}} of merchants, who became wealthy from trading with Arabia, and moved to Damascus from Baghdad in the 18th-century. The family {{established}} itself {{in the district of}} al-Shaghour in Damascus, and by 1860, some of the family's <b>wealth</b> was invested in buying large tracts of land in the Ghouta farms surrounding Damascus. The family's notable status was owed to their <b>wealth,</b> rather than an aristocratic or religious lineage, and their traditional spheres of activity were commerce and the Ottoman civil service.|$|E
