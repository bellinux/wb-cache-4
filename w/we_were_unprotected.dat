I almost {{was not able to}} imagine how spread theme this is. I have known some Community associations in the Czech Republic but I have never known more information about its work expect they work to help people in emergency events and crisis situations. That`s all. Nowadays we all meet strange situations and risks almost every day. It can be caused by human factor (wildfire, outflow chemicals) or by nature`s effects (earthquake, strong storm, flood) and <b>we</b> all <b>are</b> <b>unprotected.</b> And <b>we</b> also dont know when human factor or nature`s effects attack again. In these situations we have some State Services which constitute Crisis management and Integration Rescue System to analyse, solve and to help people in these situations. Next help for people affected by emergency events and crisis situations are Community associations usable for their resolutions. And {{this is the most important}} point my work is all about. All af these associations are made to help people. That is the main reason to rise it. My work in my graduation thesis is to analyse out present-day situation and methods of registered procedures. I wanted to discover peoples awareness and knowledges about these associations and finally to evaluate time behaviour of the real situation with model simulations...|$|R
