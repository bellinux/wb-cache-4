5|$|In 2007, Dunst reprised {{her role}} as Mary Jane Watson in Spider-Man 3. In {{contrast}} to the previous two films' positive reviews, Spider-Man 3 received mixed reviews from critics. Nonetheless, with a total worldwide gross of $891million, it stands as the most commercially successful film in the series and Dunst's highest-grossing film {{to the end of}} 2008. Having initially signed on for three Spider-Man films, she revealed that she <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> fourth, but only if Raimi and Maguire also returned. In January 2010, it was announced that the fourth film was cancelled and that the Spider-Man film series would be restarted, and therefore dropping Dunst, Maguire and Raimi from the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> <b>A</b> story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E

25|$|The Mega Borg spill brought {{attention}} to the 984 protocols, legislation that has been held up in Senate since 1985.

25|$|Synchronized diving {{was adopted}} as an Olympic sport in 2000. Two divers form {{a team and}} perform dives simultaneously. The dives are identical. It used to be {{possible}} to dive opposites, {{also known as a}} pinwheel, but this is no longer part of competitive synchronized diving. For example, one diver would perform a forward dive and the other an inward dive in the same position, or one <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> reverse and the other a back movement. In these events, the diving would be judged both on the quality of execution and the synchronicity – in timing of take-off and entry, height and forward travel.|$|E

25|$|Jonathan's {{administration}} was heavily criticized for {{its failure to}} bring back the over 200 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram.

Jonathan initially denied that there had been any abduction at all, but then later signaled his government <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> prisoner release in exchange for the kidnapped girls. Discussions then took place in Paris with foreign ministers from France, Britain, the United States and Israel, where he agreed no deals should be struck with terrorists.

He had arranged for Presley to record five singles before his induction, guaranteeing RCA enough material to release over a two-year period.
