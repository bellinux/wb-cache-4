Deadlocks were a problem, but they were the {{exception}} rather than the norm; many legislatures did not deadlock over elections at all.

[...] While Utah suffered from deadlocks in 1897 and 1899, they became what Zywicki refers to as [...] "a good teaching experience," [...] and Utah never again failed to elect senators. Another concern was that when deadlocks occurred, state legislatures were unable to conduct their other normal business; James Christian Ure, writing in the South Texas Law Review, notes that this did not in fact occur.

50|$|Further {{conclusion}} can be {{made about}} empathy gap and power: the <b>weaker</b> <b>party</b> often doesn’t realize that being in a <b>weaker</b> <b>party</b> can actually give them more power to strategically think and make decision, leading to better outcomes.

40|$|Originally, {{contract}} law {{was considered to}} be immune from the effect of fundamental rights, the function of which was limited to being individual defences against the vigilant eye of the State. This traditional view, however, has recently been put under pressure as a result of fundamental rights increasingly becoming relevant for {{contract law}}. The relationships between private parties under contract law have started losing their immunity from the effect of fundamental rights, which has led many authors to speak about the constitutionalisation of contract law. The idea behind resorting to fundamental rights in contract law is the protection of the <b>weaker</b> <b>parties</b> such as family sureties against stronger parties such as banks. At the same time, within the system of contract law itself one can trace the tendency towards a more society-oriented contract law which manifests itself in the growing concern for the interests of the <b>weaker</b> <b>party.</b> How should fundamental rights and the modern contract law relate to each other? What role can be played by fundamental rights in the modern contract law in cases involving an imbalance in power between the contracting parties? This book embarks on a comparative analysis and combines theoretical and practical perspectives to provide answers to these questions. In the first place, this book discusses the relationship between fundamental rights and private law in general in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, as well as in EU law and the law of the ECHR, against the background of the underlying rationale for the distinction between public and private law as it has developed on the continent. Secondly, the book examines whether and, if so, how the interests of the <b>weaker</b> <b>party</b> can be protected on the level of fundamental rights, on the one hand, and contract law, on the other, in the context of risky financial transactions, such as suretyship and investment contracts. The final part of this book builds upon the insights and conclusions drawn from the theoretical and practical perspectives to develop recommendations regarding the desirable extent of the constitutionalisation of contract law. It is argued that the subordination of contract law to fundamental rights with a view to protecting the <b>weaker</b> <b>party</b> is questionable not only from the dogmatic {{point of view of the}} distinction between public and private law, but also for the very practical reason that it does not lead to the enrichment of legal discourse for the benefit of the <b>weaker</b> <b>party,</b> but instead entails adverse consequences for finding a solution in the circumstances of a case and the development of law in general. In contrast to fundamental rights, contract law is much better equipped to be able to address the issue of the power imbalance in contractual relationships and to provide a basis for a much more open debate concerning the desirable extent of the protection of the <b>weaker</b> <b>party.</b> It is only the dialogue between fundamental rights and contract law which may lead to a major breakthrough in the understanding of contractual justice and, above all, in providing solutions which would benefit the <b>weaker</b> <b>party...</b>|$|R

40|$|European Contract Law {{is still}} very much in development. So far, only {{piecemeal}} legislation on contract law has been enacted on a European level. Accordingly, many of the questions concerning which rules to decide on are still up for debate. One such debate concerns <b>weaker</b> <b>party</b> protection and more specifically the position of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Here many normative questions are still left unresolved. This means that a normative framework is called for to make coherent choices in deciding on rules of contract law in Europe. The dissertation examines whether Rawls’ theory of distributive justice can provide such a framework and what the implications of adopting a Rawlsian framework entail for the positive rules on SMEs in European contract law. It defends a normative conception of contract law inspired by Rawls’ principles of justice called: ‘contract law as fairness’. It goes on to argue that <b>weaker</b> <b>party</b> protection is an important element of this contract law as fairness and furthermore that there are no legitimate grounds for distinguishing between consumers and SMEs with regard to who should count as a <b>weaker</b> <b>party.</b> Hence, the dissertation argues that the implication of applying a Rawlsian framework to European contract law for the position of SMEs is that they deserve the same protection as consumers...|$|R
