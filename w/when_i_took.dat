25|$|We {{left the}} town, fleeing this living picture of Sodom, with incessant fear lest the raging {{waters of the}} lake {{overtake}} us, which were at the moment invading {{the main part of}} the town, sweeping away everything they encountered. On the outskirts of the town, I came upon a woman who was so exhausted by her burden of two little children and a bundle of clothing that she could proceed no farther. Moved by pity, I took one of the toddlers from her and carried him, and the little indio who has been wailing while in the arms of his mother, stopped short <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> him into mine and never uttered a sound while I was carrying him a good piece of the way.|$|E
25|$|Much of what I {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E
500|$|Richmond {{fell ill}} {{the day after}} the 1986 NASCAR annual banquet during a promotional trip to New York City. He was not well enough to begin the 1987 NASCAR season despite lengthy {{hospitalization}} in Cleveland and further rest at home; when Richmond missed the Daytona 500, his condition was reported as double pneumonia. Media later reported that he had tested positive for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). He returned to Pocono for the Miller High Life 500 {{during the middle of the}} year. Starting third, he led by the fifth lap and ultimately led 82 laps, including the final 46, to win the race by eight car-lengths over Bill Elliott. In the middle of the race, Richmond's car suffered gearbox problems. Because he could use only fourth (high) gear, he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits. Richmond was emotional after the victory, saying, [...] "I had tears in my eyes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the checkered flag. Then every time anyone congratulated me, I started bawling again." [...] Richmond earned a victory in the next race at Riverside, and made his final 1987 start at Michigan International Speedway's Champion Spark Plug 400 that August, finishing 29th with a blown engine. He resigned from Hendrick Motorsports in September 1987.|$|E

So - I wasn't actually in high school - so my mentality was what - I'm living my own life; I'm a spirited, young woman; I can handle this; I can handle anything. And at 19, you think you rule the world, and you can control things. And a lot of times, you don't.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1969 Clapton {{made the}} switch to the Fender Stratocaster. [...] "I {{had a lot of}} {{influences}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> up the Strat. First there was Buddy Holly, and Buddy Guy. Hank Marvin was the first well known person over here in England who was using one, but that wasn't really my kind of music. Steve Winwood had so much credibility, and when he started playing one, I thought, oh, if he can do it, I can do it". The first—used during the recording of Eric Clapton—was [...] "Brownie", which in 1973 became the backup to the most famous of all Clapton's guitars, [...] "Blackie". In November 1970 Eric bought six Fender Stratocasters from the Sho-bud guitar shop in Nashville, Tennessee while on tour with the Dominos. He gave one each to George Harrison, Steve Winwood, and Pete Townshend.|$|E

2500|$|Emanuel Custer was {{an outspoken}} Democrat who taught his {{children}} politics and toughness {{at an early}} age. In a February 3, 1887 letter to his son's widow, Libby, he related an incident [...] "when Autie [...] was about four years old. He {{had to have a}} tooth drawn, [...] and he was very much afraid of blood. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> him to the doctor to have the tooth pulled, it was in the night and I told him if it bled well it would get well right away, and he must be a good soldier. When he got to the doctor he took his seat, and the pulling began. The forceps slipped off and he had to make a second trial. He pulled it out, and Autie never even scrunched. Going home, I led him by the arm. He jumped and skipped, and said 'Father you and me can whip all the Whigs in Michigan.' I thought that was saying a good deal but I did not contradict him." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 19 November 2010, it was {{announced}} that she was to be ennobled to sit in the House of Lords as a Conservative Party peer. [...] "I was completely taken by surprise <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the call from the Prime Minister in September," [...] Heyhoe Flint said. [...] "Obviously I am really thrilled at my appointment but still very humbled at the thought of joining such a historic institution ... My background in sport, journalism, charity and community work will I hope stand me in good stead, and I hope I can make a positive contribution as a working peer. I will certainly look forward to the commute from one Lord's to another Lords." [...] She was subsequently invested as a life peer on 21 January 2011 taking the title Baroness Heyhoe Flint, of Wolverhampton in the County of West Midlands. The formal designation of her title without a hyphen broke a rule that peerage titles could only have one word, previously observed by the likes of Lord Lloyd-George, Lord Alanbrooke and Lord Lloyd-Webber.|$|E
2500|$|As the taped {{conversation}} continued, {{the jury}} heard Saldívar's {{reaction to the}} news of Selena's death after her phone picked up a local radio station's signal. In an angry voice, Saldívar asked Young why he had kept the singer's condition from her, since she wanted to visit Selena at the hospital, believing she was still alive. Young told Saldívar not to believe the radio announcement, {{and that he did}} not know about Selena's current condition. The conversation then switched to Saldívar blaming Quintanilla, Jr. for the murder claiming that he threatened to kill her. She explained to Young that she bought the gun for protection after finding her car tires deliberately slashed. She also told him how Quintanilla, Jr. sexually abused her by [...] "sticking a knife" [...] in her vagina, threatening to murder her if she went to the police. When asked about what happened in her motel room, Saldívar exclaimed: [...] "I bought this gun to kill myself, not her, and she told me, 'Yolanda, I don't want you to kill yourself.' And we were talking about that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> it out and pointed it to my head, and when I pointed it to my head, she opened the door. I said 'Selena, close that door,' and when I did that gun went off." ...|$|E
