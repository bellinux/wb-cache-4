40|$|The {{effects of}} {{thromboxane}} B 2 and the stable prostaglandin endoperoxide analogs (15 Z) -hydroxy - 9 α - 11 α - (epoxymethano) prosta - 5 Z, 13 E - dienoic acid (U 44069) and (15 Z) -hydroxy - 11 α, 9 α-(epoxymethano) prosta- 5 Z, 13 E-dienoic acid (U 46619) were tested on <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> across the toad urinary bladder. In {{the presence of}} indomethacin or meclofenamic acid, inhibitors of prostaglandin and thromboxane A 2 synthesis, thromboxane B 2 stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in a dose-dependent manner. U 44069 (1 μM) stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> from 3. 6 ± 0. 8 to 12. 4 ± 1. 2 mg/min per 10 cm 2 hemibladder surface area, while U 46619 (1 μM) stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> from 2. 8 ± 1. 0 to 21. 8 ± 2. 0 mg/min per 10 cm 2. The prostaglandin endoperoxide/thromboxane A 2 antagonist trans- 13 -azaprostanoic acid, an inhibitor of vasopressin-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow,</b> inhibited thromboxane B 2 - and U 46619 -stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in a dose-dependent manner. The inactive cis- 13 -azaprostanoic acid did not inhibit vasopressin-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in untreated hemibladders and {{had no effect on}} U 46619 -stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in indomethacin or meclofenamic acid pretreated hemibladders. U 46619 (1 μM) enhanced vasopressin-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in indomethacin pretreated hemibladders, producing a significant parallel shift (P < 0. 001) in the dose-response relationship to submaximal concentrations of vasopressin (0. 1 - 0. 6 mU/ml), while not affecting <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> stimulated by supramaximal concentrations of vasopressin (10 mU/ml). trans- 13 -Azaprostanoic acid abolished the potentiating effects of U 46619 on vasopressin-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> These results show that thromboxane A 2 -like compounds stimulate <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in the toad urinary bladder...|$|R
40|$|A lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) {{is applied}} to {{problems}} of dispersion in two-dimensional <b>water</b> <b>flows.</b> The <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> is modelled by shallow water equations. A two-distribution lattice Boltzmann equation algorithm is presented to solve the pollutant transport problem {{within the framework of}} shallow <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> One distribution models the shallow <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> The other distribution models the pollutant transport. Flow characteristics and concentration profiles of dispersive species are obtained at various flow regimes. For fast <b>water</b> <b>flow,</b> the concentration profiles are highly affected by the flow advection and become completely different from those at slow <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> Numerical results are presented for pollutant transport in bounded and open channel flows. The proposed LBM is also used to simulate a pollution event in the Strait of Gibraltar. The obtained results indicate that the present method is useful for the investigation of transport phenomena by shallow <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> in complex geometries and practical flow problems...|$|R
30|$|In {{traditional}} {{analysis of}} slope stability, overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> is not taken into account. As is well known, {{the depth of}} overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> is only several centimeters or millimeters, which may have little effect on a stable slope with a large safety factor; however, for a slope in the limiting equilibrium condition, the effect of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> should not be ignored. This is because the overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> with only several centimeters or millimeters may cause the so-called stable slope to become an unstable slope. Especially, in landslide hazard assessment, not considering the effect of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> may result in an incorrect assessment and lead to serious damage in the so-called safety area, which is obtained by landslide hazard assessment without consideration {{of the effect of}} overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> on the stability. Thus, {{in order to avoid the}} aforementioned accidents, the effect of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> should be taken into account in slope stability analysis.|$|R
5|$|Several {{experienced}} {{pilots who}} were at the airport {{at the time of the}} accident testified that they considered the weather at that time unsuitable for flight, as a thunderstorm seemed to be forming or moving over the field. In addition, investigators determined that the weight of the aircraft during its takeoff roll exceeded its maximum allowable takeoff weight by 96lbs, which would have increased the stall speed by about two percent. Since the aircraft was flying in moderate to heavy rain, the NTSB calculated that the <b>water</b> <b>flowing</b> on the wings would have further increased the stall speed by about 1.5%. A higher stall speed reduces the margin of safety at slower airspeeds, such as during a climb.|$|E

Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari was probably used as a meditation place for the sultan, or some said as the meeting place for the sultan and his concubines. In the middle of the building was also a sleeping room for the sultan with <b>water</b> <b>flowing</b> beneath it.

5|$|Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley (1886) {{repeated}} Fizeau's {{experiment with}} improved accuracy, addressing several concerns with Fizeau's original experiment: (1) Deformation of the optical components in Fizeau's apparatus could cause artifactual fringe displacement; (2) observations were rushed, since the pressurized {{flow of water}} lasted only a short time; (3) the laminar flow profile of <b>water</b> <b>flowing</b> through Fizeau's small diameter tubes meant that only their central portions were available, resulting in faint fringes; (4) there were uncertainties in Fizeau's determination of flow rate across {{the diameter of the}} tubes. Michelson redesigned Fizeau's apparatus with larger diameter tubes and a large reservoir providing three minutes of steady water flow. His common path interferometer design provided automatic compensation of path length, so that white light fringes were visible at once as soon as the optical elements were aligned. Topologically, the light path was that of a Sagnac interferometer with an even number of reflections in each light path. This offered extremely stable fringes that were, to first order, completely insensitive to any movement of its optical components. The stability was such that it was possible for him to insert a glass plate at h or even to hold a lighted match in the light path without displacing the center of the fringe system. Using this apparatus, Michelson and Morley were able to completely confirm Fizeau's results.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} analyse the {{relationship}} of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> depth with rainfall intensity, the overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in Figure  3 is scaled up in Figure  2.

In Figure  3, the time for overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> to begin to generate t* is given for different rainfall intensities. The figure shows that the larger the rainfall intensity, the higher the overland flow depth. The depth of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> increases with increase rainfall duration time and then becomes nearly constant. Here, the depth of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> is quite small, several centimeters or millimeters, and the result is in accordance with the actual case.|$|R

5|$|Established as a seaport by the Vikings and Danish traders {{at the end}} of the 8th {{century in}} the Prussian border area {{previously}} already explored by the Scandinavians, Truso lasted as a major city and commercial center until the early 11th century, when it was destroyed and replaced in that capacity by Gdańsk. The settlement covered an area of 20 hectares and consisted of a two-dock seaport, the craft-trade portion, and the peripheral residential development, all protected by a wood and earth bulwark separating it from the mainland. The port-trade and craftsmen zones were themselves separated by a fire control ditch with <b>water</b> <b>flowing</b> through it. There were several rows of houses, including long Viking hall structures, waterside warehouses, market areas and wooden beam covered streets. Numerous relics were found there, including weights used also as currency units, coins (from English to Arab) and workshops processing metal, jewelry or large quantities of amber. Remnants of long Viking boats were also found, the whole complex being a testimony to Viking preoccupation with commerce, the mainstay of their activities around the Baltic Sea region. The multi-ethnic Truso had extensive trade contacts not only with distant lands and Scandinavia, but also the Slavic areas located to the south and west of it, from where ceramics and other products were transported along the Vistula in river crafts. Ironically, Truso's sudden destruction by fire and subsequent disappearance was apparently a result of a Viking raid.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Conventional fault {{detection}} and diagnosis in water chillers needs <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> measurements to calculate system load. However, {{the measurement of}} <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> meters usually fluctuates greatly, and high accuracy flow meters are very expensive. In this paper, a novel modelling method using a new reference model for {{fault detection}} and diagnosis in water chillers was developed, and the real evaporator <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate {{was replaced by a}} pseudo evaporator <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate that was equal to the designed evaporator <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate or the average evaporator flow rate under stable operation conditions. The new-developed reference model was validated by the data sets from ASHRAE 1043 -RP. The validation results showed that the new developed reference model has good prediction accuracy and clear diagnosis rules, which can be used for fault detection and diagnosis in water chillers in the absence of <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> measurements.
