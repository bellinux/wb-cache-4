Players with very long dreadlocks have been tackled by their hair, which is legal according to NFL rules.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) 				 California State University, Los Angeles, 2011 Committee members: Laura Calderon, Pera Jambazian, Lane Christianne, Nazareth KhodiguianAcculturation, Diabetes, ObesityObesity is {{an urgent}} matter in Los Angeles among Hispanic adolescents, and {{understanding}} the causes is important to finding solutions. This investigation assessed the acculturation level of the participants and its influences on dietary intake behaviors of fruits and vegetables, fast food consumption and weight status. More {{than half of the}} participants' acculturation orientation was integration, according to the results of the AHIMSA scale. These results might help us understand how acculturation influences the choices of Hispanic adolescents. Those participants who where more acclimated to the United States culture ate more from fast food restaurants than those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> acculturated. Those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> acculturated ate more fresh vegetables. The waist circumferences of those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> more integrated were larger than those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> acculturated. This information can be used for the development of future interventions in Hispanic communities...|$|R
25|$|Antiandrogens affect {{existing}} {{facial hair}} only slightly; patients may see slower growth and some reduction in density and coverage. Those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> {{than a decade}} past puberty and/or whose race generally lacks {{a significant amount of}} facial hair may have better results. Patients taking antiandrogens tend to have better results with electrolysis and laser hair removal than those who are not. In patients in their teens or early twenties, antiandrogens prevent new facial hair from developing if testosterone levels are within the normal female range.|$|E
25|$|The Bayesian {{approach}} {{is superior to}} use in decision making {{when there is a}} high level of uncertainty or limited information in which to base decisions on and where expert opinion or historical knowledge is available. Bayes is also useful when explaining the findings in a probability- sense to people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> familiar and comfortable with comprehending statistics. It is in this sense that Bayesian methods are thought of as having created a bridge between business judgments and statistics for the purpose of decision-making.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{scientists}} disagree whether Lower Paleolithic {{humans were}} largely monogamous or polygynous. In particular, the Provisional model suggests that bipedalism arose in pre-Paleolithic australopithecine societies as an adaptation to monogamous lifestyles; however, other researchers note that sexual dimorphism is {{more pronounced in}} Lower Paleolithic humans such as Homo erectus than in modern humans, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> polygynous than other primates, which suggests that Lower Paleolithic humans had a largely polygynous lifestyle, because species that have the most pronounced sexual dimorphism tend {{more likely to be}} polygynous.|$|E

25|$|Segregation affects {{people from}} all social classes. For example, a survey {{conducted}} in 2000 found that middle-income, suburban Blacks live in neighborhoods with many more whites than do poor, inner-city blacks.

While, in a significant sense, they are less segregated than poor blacks, race still powerfully shapes their residential options.|$|E
25|$|The {{assessed}} {{risk of a}} dive would {{generally be}} considered unacceptable if the diver {{is not expected to}} cope with any single reasonably foreseeable incident with a significant probability of occurrence during that dive. Precisely where the line is drawn depends on circumstances. Professional diving operations tend to be less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> constrained by occupational health and safety legislation and codes of practice. This is one of the factors driving the use of surface supplied equipment where reasonably practicable for professional work.|$|E
25|$|Bullying is {{repeated}} acts over time that involves a real or perceived imbalance of {{power with the}} more powerful individual or group attacking those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> powerful. Bullying may consist of three basic types of abuse – verbal, physical and emotional. It typically involves subtle methods of coercion such as intimidation. Bullying can be defined in many different ways. Although the UK currently has no legal definition of bullying, some US states have laws against it. Bullying is usually done to coerce others by fear or threat.|$|E
