5|$|Hope shows {{its central}} {{character}} alone, {{with no other}} human figures visible and without her traditional fellow virtues, Love (also known as Charity) and Faith. She is dressed in classical costume, based on the Elgin Marbles; Nicholas Tromans of Kingston University speculated that her Greek style of clothing was intentionally chosen to evoke the ambivalent nature of hope in Greek mythology over the certainties of Christian tradition. Her pose is based on that of Michelangelo's Night, in an intentionally strained position. She sits on a small, imperfect orange globe with <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> cloud around its circumference, against an almost blank mottled blue background. The figure is illuminated faintly from behind, as if by starlight, and also directly from the front as if the observer {{is the source of}} light. Watts's use of light and tone avoids the clear definition of shapes, creating a shimmering and dissolving effect more typically associated with pastel work than with oil painting.|$|E
25|$|Richard Wiseman, of The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, draws {{attention}} to possible alternative explanations for perceived paranormal activity in his article, The Haunted Brain. While he recognizes that approximately 15% of people believe they have experienced an encounter with a ghost, he reports that only 1% report seeing a full-fledged ghost while the rest report strange sensory stimuli, such as seeing fleeting shadows or <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> smoke, or the sensation of hearing footsteps or feeling a presence. Wiseman makes the claim that, rather than experiencing paranormal activity, it is activity within our own brains that creates these strange sensations.|$|E
500|$|An {{especially}} well-struck Franklin half {{dollar is}} said to have full bell lines. To qualify, the seven parallel lines making up the bottom of the bell must be fully visible, and the three <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> hair to the right of Franklin's ear on the obverse must also fully show, and not blend together. Many Franklins have been damaged by [...] "roll friction": the tendency of pieces in a loose coin roll to rub together repeatedly, causing steel-gray abrasions, usually on Franklin's cheek and on the center of the Liberty Bell.|$|E

500|$|Clapton, in a {{separate}} interview, was also asked about the meaning and representation of Cersei's crown, saying [...] "I chose {{to make it in}} silver with just <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> gold to try to show her isolation, her mental disentangling from her family. There is no reference to Baratheon; there is no need anymore. She doesn't have to try and prove a link. The center of the crown is the lion sigil abstracted — its mane represents the Iron Throne, her desire. She has made it her own — she is reborn." [...] Clapton revealed as well that King Tommen Baratheon's costume was intended to show how heavily his responsibilities weigh on him, as he is weighted down with jeweled finery, with Clapton saying [...] "He was a nice boy. Too nice for this." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's visuals and {{atmosphere}} were highlighted positively. Polygon editor Arthur Gies felt that Alien: Isolation is [...] "a beautiful game, full of deep shadows and mystery around every corner," [...] while Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer praised the lighting and unusually compelling environment design. IGN's Ryan McCaffrey gave high marks to the game's retro-futuristic art direction and sound design, commenting: [...] "From <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> smoke that billow out of air vents to clouds of white mist that obscure your vision when you rewire an area's life-support systems {{in order to}} aid your stealthy objectives, Isolation certainly looks and sounds like {{a part of the}} Alien universe." [...] Similarly, PC Gamer reviewer Andy Kelly said that the game's art design sets Alien: Isolation apart from the likes of System Shock or Dead Space and creates a [...] "convincing science-fiction world, with machines and environments that are functional and utilitarian, rather than overtly futuristic." ...|$|E
500|$|Like many musicians of his generation, Holst {{came under}} Wagner's spell. He had recoiled {{from the music}} of Götterdämmerung when he heard it at Covent Garden in 1892, but {{encouraged}} by his friend and fellow-student Fritz Hart he persevered and quickly became an ardent Wagnerite. Wagner supplanted Sullivan as the main influence on his music, and for some time, as Imogen put it, [...] "ill-assimilated <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> Tristan inserted themselves on nearly every page of his own songs and overtures." [...] Stanford admired some of Wagner's works, and had in his earlier years been influenced by him, but Holst's sub-Wagnerian compositions met with his disapprobation: [...] "It won't do, me boy; it won't do". Holst respected Stanford, describing him to a fellow-pupil, Herbert Howells, as [...] "the one man who could get {{any one of us}} out of a technical mess", but he found that his fellow students, rather than the faculty members, had the greater influence on his development.|$|E

2500|$|These {{are mostly}} fibrous <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> {{delicate}} white cirriform ice crystal cloud that show up clearly {{against the blue}} sky. Cirrus are generally non-convective except castellanus and floccus subtypes which show limited convection.

2500|$|Williams can be {{identified}} as a soprano. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic commented {{that she has a}} [...] "warm, kittenish voice" [...] with the ability to [...] "transform" [...] from [...] "kitten to tiger", belting [...] "with absolute conviction". [...] GospelMusicCity.com praised her [...] "delicate vocals" [...] and described her [...] "sopralto stylings" [...] as [...] "inimitable", writing that on [...] "Heard a Word" [...] she [...] "demonstrates further versatility in Ella-like fashion". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also compared her to other singers writing; [...] "Williams's warm vocal recalls both the playful <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> her R contemporaries (Jill Scott, Erykah Badu) and the breathy timbre of Diana Ross" [...] while Emily Sogn of PopMatters wrote [...] "Williams singing style is pleasingly slow paced...that owes a lot to her pop contemporaries like Ashanti and Janet Jackson."

2500|$|It was {{not until}} two years later that Grove stood again in Chamonix, this time {{accompanied}} by Edward Buxton and Reginald Macdonald, {{both of whom were}} keen to attain the unclimbed peak, especially as the Aiguille de Bionnassay was [...] "the only peak passing thirteen thousand feet which had escaped the devastations of the Alpine Club". Their suggestion was not met enthusiastically by the two usual guides whom Grove employed: Jean Pierre Cachat and Michel Payot. Later that day, however, (27 July) they hired a carriage to carry them to Les Ouches (Les Houches) and then walked to the Pavillon de Belle Vue from where they could view the ice-clad slopes of the Bionnassay towering above them through what Grove describes as [...] "the driving clouds and mist of a stormy afternoon". They retired to bed early, waking again at midnight for a 1 a.m. start, noting the sky was clear, but had a treacherous nature; fog banks were building up on the horizon and <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> thin cloud streaked ominously across the sky.|$|E
2500|$|The vortex {{method is}} a grid-free {{technique}} for the simulation of turbulent flows. It uses vortices as the computational elements, mimicking the physical structures in turbulence. Vortex methods were {{developed as a}} grid-free methodology {{that would not be}} limited by the fundamental smoothing effects associated with grid-based methods. To be practical, however, vortex methods require means for rapidly computing velocities from the vortex elements – in other words they require the solution to a particular form of the N-body problem (in which the motion of N objects is tied to their mutual influences). A breakthrough came in the late 1980s with the development of the fast multipole method (FMM), an algorithm by V. Rokhlin (Yale) and L. Greengard (Courant Institute). This breakthrough paved the way to practical computation of the velocities from the vortex elements and is the basis of successful algorithms. [...] They are especially well-suited to simulating filamentary motion, such as <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> smoke, in real-time simulations such as video games, because of the fine detail achieved using minimal computation.|$|E
2500|$|Wright {{migrated}} to New Zealand in 1887 and {{spent several years}} as a rabbiter on stations in Central Otago. During this time he wrote in both prose and verse for major provincial newspapers about station life. He studied for the Congregational ministry and Wright studied divinity from 1896 at the University of Otago. [...] Wright had {{done a lot of}} private reading, but found that apart from English his education was generally below that of the other students. In 1897 Wright was awarded a Stuart prize for poetry. Wright published four volumes of ballads, Aorangi and other Verses (1896), Station Ballads and other Verses (1897), <b>Wisps</b> <b>of</b> Tussock (1900), and New Zealand Chimes (1900). As a clergyman Wright was liked, but he found the work uncongenial and gave it up for journalism in which he had considerable experience in New Zealand. Wright married Elizabeth Couper at Dunedin on 3 August 1899; a son David was born in 1900, but the marriage failed. Wright joined the New Zealand Mail as parliamentary reporter in 1907.|$|E

2500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also {{described}} Williams' voice was [...] "warm", noting that it recalls [...] "the playful <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> her R contemporaries (Jill Scott, Erykah Badu) and the breathy timbre of Diana Ross". Cinquemani then described the album as being [...] "a mix of slick hip-hop-style beats, inspirational themes and catchy, pop-friendly hooks" [...] with [...] "admirable", [...] "largely restrained arrangements", lending particular praise to the [...] "surprisingly eloquent (and non-denominational) sentiment" [...] that is featured within {{the lyrics of}} the album's title track ("Heart to Yours"). Tracy Hopkins of Rolling Stone magazine gave the least favorable review however, stating that despite Williams' collaborations with contemporary gospel singers, they [...] "only reinforce the thin-piped vocalist's shortcomings". Hopkins also wrote that although Williams [...] "is in the right place", her vocals are [...] "too quiet" [...] and the production is too [...] "tame to start a real Holy Ghost party". On the contrary, Mike Rimmer of Cross Rhythms gave a very favorable review of the album (10/10), describing [...] "the quality" [...] as being [...] "superb throughout" [...] and [...] "Michelle's soulful laid back vocals" [...] as being [...] "delicious throughout".|$|E
2500|$|Several new {{supplementary}} features have been formally {{recognized by the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The feature fluctus can form under conditions of strong atmospheric wind shear and instability when wave-like clouds of the variety undulatus break into regularly spaced crests. This variant is sometimes known informally as a Kelvin–Helmholtz (wave) cloud. [...] This phenomenon has also been observed in cloud formations over other planets {{and even in the}} sun's atmosphere. [...] Another highly disturbed but more chaotic wave-like cloud feature associated with the undulatus variety has been given the Latin name asperitus. [...] The supplementary feature cavum is a circular fall-streak hole that occasionally forms in a thin layer of supercooled altocumulus or cirrocumulus. [...] Fall streaks consisting of virga or <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> cirrus are usually seen beneath the hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude. [...] This type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes. A murus feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering, rotating cloud base than can lead to the development of tornadoes. A cauda feature is a tail cloud that extends horizontally away from the murus cloud and is the result of air feeding into the storm.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{subsequent}} regeneration {{was then}} filmed {{in a variety}} of different ways, as dictated by the director on that particular episode. Indeed, no two regenerations were particularly similar until the Russell T Davies era. Only BBC Wales Doctor Who attempted to standardise the way regeneration looked. Ever since [...] "The Parting of the Ways", every regeneration has been portrayed as a [...] "golden glow explosion" [...] (although the colour of the explosion is fiery orange in [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] and is milky white in Utopia). Rose was the first to describe this type of regenerations, saying [...] "I saw him sort of explode, and then you replaced him" [...] to the Tenth Doctor immediately after the Ninth Doctor regenerated. Also, these regenerations are portrayed as violent discharges that could harm anyone nearby, {{to the point where the}} most powerful occurrences, seen in The End of Time and [...] "The Time of the Doctor", were able to destroy the Tardis interior and send out a shockwave that destroyed a Dalek ship along with several troops respectively. Each time there was a regeneration with people nearby, either the Doctor or his companions had everyone present get away from the person who was regenerating to avoid them being harmed. In smaller discharges, regeneration was far less harmful and could be emitted from the hand in <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> golden regeneration energy, which was capable of healing the injuries of others. The subsequent Children in Need Special established that there was residual [...] "regeneration energy" [...] in a gaseous state after a transformation which had to be expelled through the mouth. This was seen again in [...] "The Christmas Invasion", [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] and [...] "The Doctor's Daughter" [...] — though the latter narrative never made quite clear that Jenny actually regenerated. The Tenth Doctor was seen breathing out gaseous regeneration energy shortly after his transformation, as was the Eleventh Doctor. Consciously holding back the regeneration caused a buildup of energy that resulted in a powerful and violent explosive discharge of regeneration energy. Also, gaining a new cycle of regenerations and Time Lords lives being reset resulted in a shockwave and explosion of regeneration energy with the range of a thermonuclear explosion. Directed regeneration energy discharges could destroy anything in its path, even a Dalek Saucer, while the shock wave destroyed any Dalek troops in the vicinity. The actual regeneration of the Eleventh Doctor, following the wild outburst of regeneration energy that only reset his body, is the first time that the revived series differed from the established process of regeneration. When regenerating into the Twelfth Doctor, the process only includes a brief, mostly off-screen (due to the Doctor leaning back out of the camera) blast of energy.|$|E
