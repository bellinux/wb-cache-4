Thoughts of winding down her career were dashed when her husband was asked if his wife would like to work there, presenting a music programme. Say Yes became the first TV series she made for them. Three more followed: <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>One</b> Body, Backstage and Dana and friends. With this exposure she became a popular Catholic music singer, appearing at conferences and public gatherings across America. Heart Beat Records, the US Catholic music label, issued a number of her music and prayer albums.|$|E

500|$|According to Religion News Service writer Steve Rabey, [...] "Within You Without You" [...] "contrast Western individualism with Eastern monism". The lyrics convey basic {{tenets of}} Vedanta philosophy, {{particularly}} in Harrison's {{reference to the}} concept of maya (the illusory nature of existence), in the lines [...] "And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion / Never glimpse the truth". Author Joshua Greene paraphrases the song-wide message as: [...] "A wall of illusion separates us from each other … which only turns our love for one another cold. Peace will come when we learn to see past the illusion of differences and come to know that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> …" [...] The solution espoused by Harrison is for individuals to see beyond the self and each seek change within, further to Vivekananda's contention in Raja Yoga that [...] "Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest that divinity …" [...] According to ethnomusicologist David Reck, aside from the reference to maya, the lyrics convey Indian philosophical concepts such as advait (the one essential reality), satya (perception of truth) and, in the line [...] "With our love we could save the world", universal love.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Forget About Us" [...] is a mid-tempo song lasting {{three minutes}} and fifty-three seconds, while drawing {{influence}} from pop and R with downtempo beats music genres. Written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox and Johntá Austin, and {{produced by the}} former three, the song drew comparisons to Carey's [...] "We Belong Together". According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard, the song features a similar tempo, lyrical style, instrumentation and production as the latter song, and incorporates a reminiscent vocal performance from Carey. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 72 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of G minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of D3 to the high-note of F6. Lyrically, the song describes the potency of a [...] "first love", and features a protagonist pleading to her lover to [...] "not forget about them". Critics noted that the song's lyrics both let go of a lover, as well as cherishing their memory. Carey sings, [...] "You just let it die / With no goodbyes", indicating a relationship that has long decayed, and how she has let it drift away, while also adding, [...] "There's only one me and you / And how we used to shine / No matter what you go through / <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>one,</b> that's a fact that you can't deny", indicating that while {{they are no longer}} together, she will continue to cherish the memory of them and how strong their love was. According to Carey, she refrained from giving away too much of the song's lyrical meaning, in order to allow fans to possibly interpret the song in their own way: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, the Holyoake {{government}} {{published the}} [...] "Hunn Report", a wide-ranging summary of Māori assets, {{and the state}} of Māori in New Zealand at the time. The report was a damming indictment of past governments' neglect of Māori within society, and Holyoake endeavoured to act on its findings. By embracing the No Maoris – No Tour cause, Holyoake ended the practice of an apartheid sporting body dictating the racial composition of New Zealand rugby teams touring in South Africa. In a 1966 speech directed at the South African authorities, Holyoake delicately defended the principle of racial equality, stating [...] "in this country <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> people; as such we cannot as a national be truly represented in any sphere by a group chosen on racial lines".|$|E

In an interview with Democracy Now, Walker said, [...] "I was with other women who believe that the women and children of Iraq are just as dear as the women and children in our families, and that, in fact, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> family.

2500|$|As {{the keynote}} speaker, Obama {{set the tone}} for the party platform. His speech, proclaiming the {{unnecessary}} and artificial divides in American culture and politics, was reminiscent of John Edwards's [...] "Two Americas" [...] stump speech: [...] "There's not a liberal America and a conservative America—there's the United States of America." [...] Obama emphasized the importance of unity, and made veiled jabs at the Bush administration and the news media's perceived oversimplification and diversionary use of wedge issues: [...] "We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states, and yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq, and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> people, all of us pledging allegiance to the Stars and Stripes, all of us defending the United States of America." ...|$|E
2500|$|The motto {{was almost}} {{certainly}} taken from the title page of Gentleman's Magazine, a monthly magazine published in London which had used it from its first edition in 1731, and was {{well known in the}} colonies. [...] The motto alluded to the magazine being a collection of articles obtained from other newspapers, and was used in most of its editions until 1833. [...] The motto was taken in turn from Gentleman's Journal, a similar magazine which ran briefly from 1692 to 1694. [...] While variants turn up in other places (for example a poem often ascribed to Virgil called Moretum contains the phrase E Pluribus Unus), this is the oldest known use of the exact phrase. [...] Another source was some of the Continental currency issued earlier in 1776; these were designed by Franklin and featured the motto <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>One</b> surrounded by thirteen rings, each with the name of a colony. This design is echoed in the seal submitted by the first committee, and the motto was quite possibly a Latin version of this concept.|$|E
2500|$|Bono {{described}} the song's theme as such: [...] "It {{is a song}} about coming together, but it's not the old hippie idea of 'Let's all live together.' It is, in fact, the opposite. It's saying, <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>one,</b> but we're not the same. It's not saying we even want to get along, but {{that we have to}} get along together in this world if it is to survive. It's a reminder that we have no choice". The Edge described it on one level as a [...] "bitter, twisted, vitriolic conversation between two people who've been through some nasty, heavy stuff". On another level, he suggested that the line [...] "we get to carry each other" [...] introduces [...] "grace" [...] to the song and that the wording [...] "get to" [...] (instead of [...] "got to") is essential, as it suggests that it is a privilege to help one another, not an obligation. The band have been told by many fans that they played the song at their weddings, prompting Bono to respond, [...] "Are you mad? It's about splitting up!" [...] There was some speculation that the song described a conversation between a father and his HIV-positive gay son, based on the connection of the song to David Wojnarowicz, a gay artist who died of AIDS.|$|E

We belong both of us to a home-loving stock, and the peace and prosperity of every home in the land is at stake. On our action now depends the question whether our children shall curse or bless us; whether we shall live in their memory as promoters of civil strife, with all its miserable consequences, or as joint architects of a happy, prosperous, and united state.
