5000|$|During the 1930s {{the format}} of plates never settled down.The first Soviet {{registration}} plates issued in 1931 has an [...] "L-NN-NN" [...] format, where L represents a Cyrillic letter and N being a number. Every registration is linked to a single vehicle, while motorcycle plates differ from those for cars in terms of dimensions. 2 license plates were issued to every vehicles: a frontal plate and a rear plate. Frontal plates for motorcycles are to be mounted along the front wing of a vehicle, while rear ones are to be mounted perpendicular to the rear wing. Registration plates for test-drive vehicles appeared later, which contained the word [...] "проба" [...] (proba, lit. [...] "test") on the top, with the first pair of digits absent, therefore forming the format [...] "L-NN". Two major drawbacks of this format were later found, with the first being that the letter was issued in sequential order regardless of any situation, while {{the second is that}} a letter could stand for two sparsely populated regions, and on the other hand, a large city could possess a number of letters. These drawbacks caused the termination of this format in 1934.In 1934, a new replacement standard was set: the letter on the former design was changed to a digit, and there {{was the name of the}} registry, or [...] "Dortrans" [...] below the digits. There were at first 45 Dortrans, one for each region, under CzUDorTranse, or in its full name, Central management of highways and dirt roads and road transport at the Council of People's Commissars of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and then after a reorganization of administrative divisions, the number went up to 52. The former format was considered temporarily valid and owners must change to the new format before July 1, 1934. The format was not strict, i.e. the number of digits is not necessarily supposed to be 5, and the name of the region could reach up to 8 characters excluding dots and dashed, which made it often <b>writte</b> in abbreviated form. Test-drive and transit plates remained their format, except that the name of the Dortran was replaced by the word [...] "транзит" [...] (tranzit, lit, [...] "transit"), or [...] "проба" [...] (proba, [...] "test"). The plates have usual colors in their public transport variant, but there were experimental numbers in an inverse scheme.At the end of 1936 the format changed once more, with the beginning of the sequence switched to a two-letter code of the regional registry, followed by two pairs of numbers separated by a hyphen, which made it an [...] "LL NN-NN" [...] pattern. The code uses letters of the Russian alphabet except for [...] "Ё", [...] "Й", [...] "Ъ", [...] "Ы" [...] and [...] "Ь". There was a single-line frontal plate plus a double-line rear plate for each vehicles, with motorcycle plates bearing the same format, albeit in a smaller size. This difference existed until 1994. Trial and transit numbers also remained, which replaced the region code with the word [...] "транзит" [...] (tranzit, lit. [...] "transit"), below which positioned a factory code.Near the end of the 1930s, in coordination to the current format, there was also a so-called [...] "уменьшенного" [...] (umen'shennogo, lit. [...] "reduced") format: The plate was smaller, used a narrower and slimmer font, and the regional code became smaller, shifted to the top-left corner, with the numbers down-scaled. At the same time a single format was developed for trailers, but seldom given. Subsequently, this format became the basis for the next change.|$|E
