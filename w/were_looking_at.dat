5|$|In late October 2009, Halcyon {{announced}} it would auction off the rights to future Terminator material and was seeking $60–70 million, though the only offer made was by director Joss Whedon for $10,000. In December 2009, Halcyon {{issued a statement saying}} that they <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> various options including sale and refinancing of the rights with an announcement on the outcome no later than February 1, 2010. On February 8, 2010, an auction was held to determine the owner of the Terminator rights. After studios Sony Pictures and Lionsgate bid separately, Pacificor, the hedge fund that pushed Halcyon into bankruptcy, made a deal for $29.5 million. Pacificor hired an agency to sell off the rights to the franchise.|$|E

A few days later, Glenn Close was cast {{as the head of the}} Nova Corps in the film, followed shortly by the casting of Karen Gillan as the film's lead female villain.

5|$|John played {{infrequently}} for Cardiff {{during the}} 1968/69 season, making just 14 appearances. Despite this he {{was available for}} all matches in the 1969 Five Nations Championship, again playing in each match paired with Edwards. The Welsh selectors had dropped five players from the previous Championship, and notable debutants in the team to face Scotland at Murrayfield on 1 February 1969 were J.P.R. Williams and Mervyn Davies. John scored his first international try in the encounter after charging down a kick and dummying his way over. Scotland, who were under enormous pressure from the kick-off, lost 17–3. When Ireland came to the Cardiff Arms Park in March the team was on a seven match unbeaten run, and <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> taking the Grand Slam after defeating England, France and Scotland. It therefore {{came as a surprise}} at the ease with which the Welsh pack dominated. Wales won 24–11, with Dai Morris the stand-out Welsh player, though John also had one of his best matches, keeping pressure on the Irish with long touch kicks and scoring with a dropped goal. Despite out-scoring France in tries scored, the match at Stade Colombes ended in an 8–8 draw, preventing a Welsh Grand Slam, though a win in the final match to England would give Wales the Championship. The England decider is best remembered for Maurice Richards' four tries, but John too was on the scoresheet with a dropped goal and a try of his own. The game finished 30–9 to Wales, giving John his first Championship title and made him a Triple Crown winning player, as Wales had beaten all three other Home Nation teams.|$|E

The RAF were asked to evaluate the F-111 as a cheaper option for the strike aircraft requirement, although the incoming Labour government denied it planned to cancel the British aircraft.

They were aided by the Theosophical Society, who were dedicated {{to the search for}} wisdom within ancient sources, including Buddhism and the Pāli Canon. Anagarika Dharmapala was one of the Theravāda leaders with whom the Theosophists sided. Dharmapala tried to reinstate vipassanā, using the Visuddhimagga and the Pali Canon as a foundation. Dharmapala reached out to the middle classes, offering them religious practice and a religious identity, which were used to withstand the British imperialists. As a result of Dharmapapla's efforts lay practitioners started to practise meditation, which had been reserved specifically for the monks.|$|E
25|$|In March 1970, the U.S. {{recommended}} that all NATO forces adopt the 5.56×45mm cartridge. This shift represented {{a change in}} the philosophy of the military's long-held position about caliber size. By the middle of the 1970s, other armies <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> assault rifle type weapons. A NATO standardization effort soon started and tests of various rounds were carried out starting in 1977. The U.S. offered the 5.56×45mm M193 round, but there were concerns about its penetration {{in the face of the}} wider introduction of body armor. In the end the Belgian 5.56×45mm SS109 round was chosen (STANAG 4172) in October 1980. The SS109 round was based on the U.S. cartridge but included a new stronger, heavier, 62 grain bullet design, with better long range performance and improved penetration (specifically, to consistently penetrate the side of a steel helmet at 600 meters).|$|E
25|$|The {{estimates}} of likelihood {{associated with the}} optimistic bias are based on how closely an event matches a person's overall idea of the specific event. Some researchers suggest that the representativeness heuristic is {{a reason for the}} optimistic bias: individuals tend to think in stereotypical categories rather than about their actual targets when making comparisons. For example, when drivers are asked to think about a car accident, {{they are more likely to}} associate a bad driver, rather than just the average driver. Individuals compare themselves with the negative elements that come to mind, rather than an overall accurate comparison between them and another driver. Additionally, when individuals were asked to compare themselves towards friends, they chose more vulnerable friends based on the events they <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at.</b> Individuals generally chose a specific friend based on whether they resemble a given example, rather than just an average friend. People find examples that relate directly to what they are asked, resulting in representativeness heuristics.|$|E

25|$|The {{investors in}} the Lowell textile {{companies}} decided {{they needed to do}} something about their transportation situation. They looked toward the railroads budding in England, and now in America, for inspiration and took operations on the Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad and the construction ongoing on the Allegheny Portage Railroad and Baltimore & Ohio {{and a handful of other}} ventures as omens and inspiration. A railroad could run year round, was expandable with as many tracks as they might need, and could use the new locomotives that were being highly praised in England at the heart of recent news stories. By 1829 the B was testing a locally produced steam locomotive, the Tom Thumb, and opened for passenger operations in May 1830.

25|$|Giger {{conceived}} the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all outside forces. He mandated that the creature have no eyes, {{because he felt}} that it made them much more frightening if you could not tell they <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> you. Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located {{at the tip of}} a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed biomechanical, a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years, {{they were more}} {{interested}} in the acoustics of speech. For instance, they <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the differences between /ba/ or /da/, but now research has been directed to the response in the brain from the stimuli. In recent years, there has been a model developed {{to create a sense of}} how speech perception works; this model is known as the Dual Stream Model. This model has drastically changed from how psychologists look at perception. The first section of the Dual Stream Model is the ventral pathway. This pathway incorporates middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal sulcus and perhaps the inferior temporal gyrus. The ventral pathway shows phonological representations to the lexical or conceptual representations, which is the meaning of the words. The second section of the Dual Stream Model is the dorsal pathway. This pathway includes the sylvian parietotemporal, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, and premotor cortex. Its primary function is to take the sensory or phonological stimuli and transfer it into an articulatory-motor representation (formation of speech).|$|E
