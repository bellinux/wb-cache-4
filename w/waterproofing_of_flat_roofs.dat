40|$|The {{system of}} {{mechanic}} fastening {{is one of}} the most frequently used variants of roof membrane stabilization against the impacts of wind sucking. With the growing number of applications of mechanically fastened roofs the number of defects is also growing. We particularly see them in the joints <b>of</b> <b>waterproofing</b> membranes. The contribution is thus dedicated to examination of mutual dependence between the type of the carrier and the strength characteristics of mechanically fastened joints of these sheets. Bitumen sheets with different types of carrier used for onelayer mechanically fastened <b>waterproofing</b> membranes <b>of</b> <b>flat</b> <b>roofs</b> were chosen as samples. The above mentioned dependence is frequently stated in the practice, but is not explicitly documented. The aim of the contribution is to confirm or refute a hypothesis that a relation between the bitumen sheet carrier type and the strength of their joints exists. The results were arranged on the base of statistic evaluation of data obtained by laboratory measurement...|$|R
