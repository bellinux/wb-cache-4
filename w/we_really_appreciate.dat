Speaking {{of the nature of}} the storyline, Thakrar commented: [...] "In the UK, 3628 babies were stillborn in 2013, that's one in every 216 births; a shocking fact I've come to learn during my preparation for telling this story." [...] She added: [...] "It is an experience that profoundly changes a person's life forever, and we feel a heavy responsibility to tell the truth of this. Our hope is that we can encourage people to talk about their experiences and their babies that have died." [...] Erica Stewart, Bereavement Support Services Manager at Sands, stated: [...] "The death of a baby is rarely talked about. Many people shy away from the issue, others have a misconception that this is a thing of the past. We hope that with a TV drama as popular as EastEnders covering this heartbreaking experience, it will help to lift the taboo, and raise awareness of all the issues that surround the death of a baby.

40|$|We were {{particularly}} interested by the editorial on new frontiers of anesthesia in endoscopy, recently published in Endoscopy [1]. This editorial, commenting on {{a report by}} Lara et al. [2] on adverse events of anesthesiological procedures in the endoscopy setting, takes the opportunity to state “a new paradigm” and to highlight some key messages. <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>appreciated</b> this new approach which finally surmounts the inheritance of a strict separation between general anesthesia {{in the operating room}} and sedation in the endoscopy suite. Advances in pharmacology and in monitoring allow performance everywhere of a continuum of anesthesiological techniques, ranging from simple monitored anesthesia care to very deep anesthesia with a wide number of options. The choice should be made on a case-by-case basis after a comprehensive evaluation of the individual patient. Sedation in advanced endoscopy is very often a challenge for providers. The high number of adverse events reported by Lara et al. and by other authors [3] often corresponds to reality. However, when the basic data are examined, the quality of sedation is not always as good as expected. In the study by Lara et al., many sedations had been performed without real control of the effect-site concentration of propofol [4] and by providers who were not always specifically dedicated to endoscopy The question is not, therefore, sedation vs. general anesthesia, but rather, how can the quality of anesthesia care be improved? Over the last year, at our tertiary referral center, over 2100 complex endoscopies with anesthesiological support were performed. However, focusing only on the 1365 ERCPs, 1124 (82...|$|R

In 1994 the revolution began with Limerick claiming the Munster title while Offaly emerged as the top dogs in Leinster. Both sides subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland final. The match was a rather unremarkable affair, save for an explosive final five minutes. Offaly trailed by five points with as many minutes left when they were awarded a close-in free. Johnny Dooley was given the signal from the management team to go for a point; however, he decided to ‘do something different’. The sliotar ended up in the Limerick net, thus opening the floodgates for a remarkable finish. Seconds later the sliotar flew into the Limerick net again, courtesy of Pat O'Connor. Limerick failed to counter as Offaly tacked on some more points to win by 3-16 to 2-13. The ‘five-minute final’ resulted in mixed emotions for Éamonn Cregan, as the Offaly manager was a native of Limerick.|$|R

40|$|Editor: We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the article by Fukunaga et al 1 entitled “Thermodilution-derived coronary blood flow pattern immediately after coronary intervention {{as a predictor of}} microcirculatory damage and midterm clinical outcomes in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. ” We congratulate the authors for this interesting approach to assess myocardial damage during ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction and would appreciate very much their views on several methodological aspects that seem to us of key importance for the correct interpretation of their results. First, the variability of thermodilu-tion data refers to inter- and intra-observer classification of the obtained waveform patterns, not to variability between separate thermodilution. Experienced operators in this technique will acknowledge changes in waveform morphology intrinsically related to handmade injections. Thus, information on pattern reproducibility across several different measurements is key before clinical consideration of this index. Second, although the wide unimodal and bimodal patterns showed high mean transit time values (indicating lower myocardial flow), 2 the mean transit time of these 2 patterns was not reported. This raises a major clinical question: were the worse MRI findings and the higher rate of major adverse cardiac events truly related to the bimodal pattern or, alterna-tively, to a lower myocardial flow reflected in longer mean transit time? Importantly, compared with the wide unimodal group, the bimodal pattern exhibited higher index of microcirculatory resistance values (65 ± 41 and 76 ± 38 U; P=NS). Although statistical significance was not reached, the authors reported Bonferroni-adjusted significance level for post hoc corrections, which is known to overcorrect for type I error. 3 <b>We</b> would <b>really</b> <b>appreciate</b> if the authors provide both the adjusted and unadjusted P values stated in figures as NS, because statistical trends are of utmost importance for future study designs. In addition to the reply of the authors, we think that larger studies, addressing the above-mentioned issues, are required to accurately assess the potential value of the bimodal pattern over that of IMR estimation...|$|R
