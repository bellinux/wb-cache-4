40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study of the}} ability of <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> and liver imaging tests to detect hepatic metastases was performed. Eighty patients at risk for hepatic metastases but without clinical evidence of disease were <b>tested</b> with 13 <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> and three liver imaging <b>tests.</b> No single <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> had greater than 65 % accuracy in the detection of hepatic lesions. No combination of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> increased this accuracy. If the <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> were used {{with one of the}} liver imaging tests, the accuracy was improved in some combinations to 76 %. The CEA assay when analyzed in patients with colorectal primaries had an accuracy of 79 %. The results show that the <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> alone are not sufficiently accurate to detect liver metastases. Additional accuracy can be obtained by the combined use of a single liver imaging <b>test</b> and selected <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests.</b> Use of all the liver imaging <b>tests</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> lowers the accuracy and increases the expense and thus is unnecessary...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if use of basic <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> improves {{diagnosis and treatment}} outcomes in outpatients attending rural primary health care facilities. Setting: Six rural health centres in Kenya. Design: Cross-sectional study to observe change in diagnosis and treatment made by clinical officers after <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> in outpatients attending six rural health centres in Kenya. Subject: The {{diagnosis and treatment of}} 1134 patients attending outpatient services in six rural health centres were compared before and after basic <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing.</b> Essential clinical diagnostic equipment and <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> were established at each health centre. Clinical officers and laboratory technicians received on-site refresher training in good diagnostic practices and laboratory procedures before the study began. Results: <b>Laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> were ordered on 704 (62. 1 %) patients. Diagnosis and treatment were changed in 45 % of tested patients who returned with laboratory results (21 % of all patients attending the clinics). 166 (23. 5 %) patients did not return to the clinician for a final diagnosis and management decision after <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing.</b> Blood slide examination for malaria parasites, wet preparations, urine microscopy and stool microscopy resulted in most changes to diagnosis. There was no significant change in drug costs after <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing.</b> The greatest changes in numbers of recorded diseases following <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> was for intestinal worms (53 %) and malaria (21 %).

Methods:This is a cross-sectional retrospective study, in which a survey on medical records and <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> results of patients admitted to the ICU was conducted, in the period from August to September 2013.

40|$|Forty years ago, Lundberg {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the brain-to-brain loop for <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing.</b> In this concept, in the brain of the physician caring for the patient, the first step involves the selection of <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> and the final step is the transmission of the test result to the ordering physician. There are many intermediary steps, some of which are preanalytic, ie, before performance of the test, some are analytic and relate to the actual performance of the test; and others are postanalytic and involve transmission of test results into the medical record. The introduction of this concept led to a system to identify, and classify errors associated with <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> performance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patient {{safety and}} {{the life cycle of}} a drug are {{negatively}} influenced by the still increasing occurrence of potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Clinical risk management of potential DDIs is required in patients using drugs to influence the benefit-risk profile positively. Information about <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> results, in particular, may be useful in the assessment of potential DDIs for the individual patient. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the frequency and nature of <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> required for the assessment of the clinical relevance of potential DDIs in Dutch community pharmacies. In addition, the nature and clinical relevance of these potential DDIs is analysed. METHODS: All patients from 100 Dutch community pharmacies using, according to dispensing information, two or more drugs concomitantly on a specified date (Wednesday, 4 April 2007), were included (n = 223, 019). The anonymous dispensing data of the included patients were analysed against a list of DDIs requiring <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> for the assessment of their clinical relevance. The number of patients at risk for these potential DDIs with severe adverse reactions was calculated. The frequency of potential DDIs requiring <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> were stratified by age, sex and degree of polypharmacy. RESULTS: Of the included patients, 24. 4 % had one or more potential DDIs (n = 54, 427). In 9. 0 % of the included patients, one or more <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> for the assessment of clinical relevance of the potential DDI were required (n = 19, 968). The frequency of DDIs requiring <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> increased with increasing age and number of drugs, but was not related to sex. The most commonly required <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> were for renal function (42. 2 %), electrolytes (20. 1 %) and coagulation (13. 1 %). The percentage of patients at risk for potential DDIs requiring <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> with adverse reaction category F (serious, irrecoverable disablement or death) was 2. 5 %; category E (increased risk of failure of life-saving therapy) was 0. 6 %; and category D (inconvenience with residual symptom and failure of therapy concerning serious but non-fatal diseases) was 3. 8 %. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of patients in Dutch community pharmacies are at risk for potential DDIs requiring <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> for the assessment of the clinical relevance of the interaction. There is a strong relationship between the frequency of DDIs requiring <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> and age and the number of drugs concomitantly used. In the clinical risk management of potential DDIs, information about <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> results is of additional value. Future research is necessary in order to obtain more evidence on using <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> in terms of which tests should be linked to pharmacy data, in which patients they should be done, how often and what actions should be taken when an abnormal value is found...|$|R
