5|$|According to the Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran, {{the films}} {{released}} {{during this period}} could not be classified as truly Indonesian films as there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> of nationalism within them. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.|$|E

I would chew a piece of gum at school, and the nun would say, 'Jesus is very angry with you about that,' and on the wall behind her would be a dying, {{bleeding}} guy on a cross. That's a horrifying image to throw at a little kid. You really could almost think that your talking in line, say, was on a par with killing Jesus." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} posted {{early in the}} first season, Gerard O'Donovan of The Daily Telegraph {{expressed}} mixed feelings about the series [...] "so far at least", saying: [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> that this was doing much different from other mainstream crime thrillers. Sticking {{too close to the}} original script meant a golden opportunity was missed to dig deeper into the attitudes and history that both connect and divide the UK and France". However, he also wrote that he would be [...] "happy to be persuaded otherwise if the action develops".|$|E

500|$|Elliot Gay of Japanator {{elaborated}} on {{the challenges}} {{that could have been}} faced in adapting a 50- to 80-hour RPG into a 90-minute film but praised its admirable job at pacing albeit a few issues. He noted that one such example was with as with the introduction of the Tartarus Tower which he felt was [...] "rushed and somewhat under-explained". Gay also noted that the film [...] "suffers from not having a strong narrative through-line" [...] and that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> of closure since [...] "nothing truly significant [...] place". He argued that this was as an [...] "unavoidable side effect of adapting Persona 3". Like Eisenbeis though, Gay felt that Makoto's experiences ultimately result in his growth and that the subtitle Spring of Birth [...] "refers to Makoto and the forward progress he makes as a person." [...] Gay went on to praise the film's visuals, explaining that the [...] "film captures the darker atmosphere of the game admirably." [...] Overall, Gay described the film as delivering [...] "a nostalgic trip down memory lane for longtime fans, and an accessible entry point for folks curious about the franchise." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Tedder of New York {{felt that}} the main story was weak and that the [...] "plot line might have made more sense last year, with Andy trying to take his mind off {{troubles}} with Erin or Robert California by trying to regress to his college days without it working, but these days Andy is the boss and has the girl." [...] He did, however, compliment the appearance of Colbert, writing that [...] "it was still nice to see the two Daily Show alums sparring again." [...] He was also complimentary towards the [...] "little tidbits", such as Dwight's subplot. Bonnie Stiergnberg of Paste {{felt that the}} episode was too rushed and that the storylines {{did not have a}} chance to naturally play out. She wrote that, [...] "Each thread provided some interesting character development or set up future storylines, but, crammed together in the same 21 minutes, they made for a slightly disjointed-feeling episode." [...] WhatCulture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer gave the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five and called it the [...] "first dud of the ninth season". He criticized the story, saying that [...] "the plot's failure [...] the goal of the story was not met by the means the writers chose to employ; there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> of grand scope or deep-rooted history, just Andy being petty and refusing {{to let go of the}} past as he's challenged by his old friend." [...] Kratzer called Dwight and Nellie's subplot the [...] "most successful story" [...] in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|Thomson later {{recognized}} {{those aspects}} as {{being part of}} Altman's style, beginning with MASH (1970): [...] "MASH began to develop the crucial Altman style of overlapping, blurred sound and images so slippery with zoom that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> of composition. That is what makes Nashville so absorbing." [...] Altman explained that to him such overlapping dialogue in his films was closer to reality, especially with large groups: [...] "If you've got fourteen people at a dinner table, {{it seems to me}} it's pretty unlikely that only two {{of them are going to}} be talking." [...] Pauline Kael writes that Altman, [...] "the master of large ensembles, loose action, and overlapping voices, demonstrates that [...] [...] [...] he can make film fireworks out of next to nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the concession, {{these early}} {{negotiations}} {{did not go}} well. [...] McCardell and Chandler were inexperienced negotiatiors, not picking up on the private signals the union sent and {{did not understand the}} importance of the signals when they did become aware of them. Even company-side negotiators complained about the inexperience of McCardell and Chandler, arguing that this inexperience lessened the company's ability to divine the union's real bargaining positions. When McCardell and Chandler were not at the bargaining table, negotiators who were present had no real authority to bargain on behalf of the company. Combined, these two factors significantly hindered IH's bargaining abilities. [...] As one scholar pointed out: [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> that the company negotiators had the capacity to understand the industry, the union's positions, or the politics that these leaders faced; neither were these negotiators truly free to develop that understanding." ...|$|E
2500|$|Subhas Chandra Bose {{believed}} that the Bhagavad Gita was {{a great source of}} inspiration for the struggle against the British. Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his emphasis on social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days. The fresh interpretation of the India's ancient scriptures had appealed immensely to him. [...] Many scholars believe that Hindu spirituality formed the essential part of his political and social thought throughout his adult life, although there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> of bigotry or orthodoxy in it. [...] Subhas who called himself a socialist, {{believed that}} socialism in India owed its origins to Swami Vivekananda. As historian Leonard Gordon explains [...] "Inner religious explorations continued {{to be a part of}} his adult life. This set him apart from the slowly growing number of atheistic socialists and communists who dotted the Indian landscape.".|$|E

2500|$|Several {{critics have}} praised the series' stories: Andy Goergen of Nintendo World Report commented on how 999 [...] "truly expands what {{narrative}} video games can be capable of", and Christian Nutt at Gamasutra said that Uchikoshi is [...] "pushing {{the boundaries of}} what video game narrative can be". Tony Ponce of Destructoid called 999 [...] "one of the greatest videogame tales ever told", and {{a great example of}} how engaging and powerful narratives in video games can be. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com featured 999 on a list of [...] "must-play" [...] Nintendo DS visual novels, citing its story, themes and [...] "zany narrative experimentation", and called Virtue's Last Reward [...] "one of the biggest, boldest visual novels to ever hit America". Writers for Famitsu liked the tense story and the sense of accomplishment when solving puzzles in 999, and the intertwined story and flowchart system in Virtue's Last Reward. Jason Schreier of Kotaku included both 999 and Virtue's Last Reward on a list of [...] "must-play" [...] visual novels worth playing even for people who do not like anime tropes. Schreier also wrote for Wired, calling 999s narrative [...] "innovative" [...] and saying that he liked the game's ending and cast, but that he thought that some of the game's prose was [...] "sloppy" [...] and that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> of real danger.|$|E
2500|$|Fry scored 94 {{first-class}} centuries, {{including an}} unprecedented six consecutive centuries in 1901. No-one else has scored more consecutive hundreds. On 12 September 1901, {{playing for the}} Rest of England against Yorkshire at Lord's, he scored 105, which was his sixth consecutive first-class century. He made his highest first-class score of 258 not out in 1911, a season which led to his recall to the England Test team as captain in 1912. In 1921 Fry was once again considered for the Test side. The Selection Committee asked him {{to play in the}} First Test match at Nottingham under the captaincy of Johnny Douglas, with a view to taking over the captaincy {{for the remainder of the}} series if, as they anticipated, things went wrong. Fry declined on the basis that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> in recalling a forty-nine-year-old merely as a player, but stated that he would consider returning as captain. As England were badly beaten at Nottingham the Selection Committee again pressed Fry to return for the Second Test but once again he declined, due to poor form. Following another heavy defeat in the Second Test the Selection Committee made a further attempt to persuade Fry to return for the Third Test as captain, a job he was now keen to accept. Unfortunately he injured a finger taking a catch during Hampshire's match with the Australians. In the short term, the injury did not appear too serious: he scored a half-century in Hampshire's first innings and, when they followed on in reply to the Australians' massive total he top scored with 37. Furthermore, in his next match against Nottinghamshire he scored 61 in the first innings (but registered a duck in the second). It appears however that the injury was affecting his fielding more than his batting and, for last time, C.B. felt obliged to stand down from the side for the next Test. Fry later commentated on cricket matches, being called [...] "one of the most eloquent cricket commentators of all time." ...|$|E
