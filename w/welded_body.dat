40|$|Residual {{stresses}} are {{an important}} consideration in the component integrity and life assessment of welded structure. The welding process is very complex time dependent physical phenomenon with material nonlinearity. The welding is a thermal process with convection between fluid flow and <b>welding</b> <b>body,</b> between <b>welding</b> <b>body</b> and environment. Next type of boundary conditions is radiation and thermo-mechanical contact on the outer surface of gas pipe in the near of weld.

In this paper, a brief review of weld simulation and residual stress modelling using the finite element method (FEM) by commercial software ANSYS is presented.

50|$|<b>Welded</b> <b>body</b> {{cylinders}} have {{a number}} of advantages over tie rod style cylinders. Welded cylinders have a narrower body and often a shorter overall length enabling them to fit better into the tight confines of machinery.

Special features are easily added to the cylinder body, including special ports, custom mounts, valve manifolds, and so on.|$|E

40|$|Temperature {{field has}} an {{important}} influence on the phase changes and, finally, on the microstructure and mechanical properties, residual stresses and strains development in the welded joints. During the welding, temperature field shape and its profile depend on many factors but, assuming some assumptions regarding homogeneity and materials isotropy, the mathematical relations for different practical cases can be obtained. Besides, <b>welded</b> <b>bodies</b> can be infinite or semi-infinite as the plates, bars and massive bodies are considered.

5000|$|Vinyl {{continued}} {{to appear in}} many car lines through the 1980s, but {{the coming of the}} [...] "aero look," [...] first introduced to the U.S. market by the 1983 Thunderbird, tended to militate against both opera windows and vinyl roofs, as their more formal style did not go well with the sleek profile designers were beginning to emphasize. During this final phase, canvas-look tops, often called cabriolet roofs, with simulated convertible top bows under the fabric, gained some popularity. The availability of all vinyl styles dwindled in the 1990s, until the 2002 Lincoln Continental offered one of the last factory applied versions.Hearse and limousine bodies almost universally still have vinyl tops. Not only are they part of the expected style of those vehicles, but they have a practical advantage in covering up the <b>welded</b> <b>body</b> seams that result when standard sedans are stretched to greater length. Aftermarket customizers also continue to install vinyl roofs of various types. These are usually seen on Cadillacs and Lincolns, but can be fitted to virtually any kind of car.|$|E
50|$|The Marina was a {{conventional}} design, a fully unitary spot <b>welded</b> <b>body</b> (no sub-frames were used {{except on the}} six-cylinder) with a longitudinally mounted engine driving through the transmission and naked propeller shaft to a solid live axle suspended on semi-elliptic leaf springs with telescopic dampers. For ease of production and to reduce costs the body featured a strong central 'spine' around the transmission tunnel {{where most of the}} unit's strength was. The rear dampers were inclined inboard from the axle to their top mounts on this 'spine', rather than being mounted vertically on dedicated top mounts built into the body at the rear wheel arches. This limited the effectiveness of the dampers somewhat (they were dissipating vertical motion when mounted at an angle) and, when combined with the live rear axle, made the rear end prone to 'bump steer' on rough roads. A similar setup was used on the early Ford Escort for the same reasons of cost-effective construction but Ford revised the arrangement on later models. BL lacked the funds to significantly retool the Marina's design and so all models were fitted with this less-than-ideal setup.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} with the mass-produced gondola car of model 12-9046, a new model has an all-metal <b>welded</b> <b>body</b> volume which is increased by 2 cubic meters to 87 cubic meters. The cover of the side and the end walls is made of smooth sheet instead of the curved profile. On the end wall two zones and five efforts of the P-shaped cross section are set, which ensure high rigidity for the perception of stress in the collisions. Tare weight of the gondola car is reduced per ton. Bearing metal frame, body, parts of the brake linkage, cover of the body, the hatch covers are made of low-alloyed steel according to GOST 19281-89 14 category, the strength class of which {{is not less than}} 390. Centre girder is equipped with more technologically advanced and reliable in operation welded lugs. The running gear of the gondola car consists of 2 two-axle bogies of model 18-7020, which are equipped with elastic-rolling runner skids of a new system. In order to improve traffic safety the gondola is equipped with a new system of separate braking carts. Overhaul of the new gondola is increased to 32 years, whereas mileage of nowadays produced analogues is 22 years.|$|E
