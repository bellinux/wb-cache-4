"We {{have heard}} {{something}} like that before, but we doubt it. <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> is to have your condescension recognized; they feel that, if they don't know it. Besides, their manners have been formed by people who don't ask good-morning from them; they are so used to being treated {{as if they were}} not there that they cannot realize they are there. We have heard city people complain of the wane of civility among country people when they went to them in the summer to get the good of their country air. They say that the natives no longer salute them in meeting, but we never heard that this happened when they first saluted the natives. Try passing the time of day with the next farmer you meet on a load of wood, and you will find that the old-fashioned civility is still to be had for the asking. But it won't be offered without the asking; the American who thinks from your dress and address that you don't regard him as an equal will not treat you as one at the risk of a snub; and he is right. As for domestics--or servants, as we insolently call them--their manners are formed on their masters', and are often very bad. But they are not always bad. We, too, have had that fancy of yours for saying good-morning when we come down; it doesn't always work, but it oftener works than not. A friend of ours has tried some such civility at others' houses: at his host's house when the door was opened to him, arriving for dinner, and he was gloomily offered a tiny envelope with the name of the lady he was to take out. At first it surprised, but when it was imagined to be well meant it was apparently liked; in extreme cases it led to note of the weather; the second or third time at the same house it established something that would have passed, with the hopeful spectator, for a human relation. Of course, you can't carry this sort of thing too far. You can be kind, but you must not give the notion that you do not know your place." ...|$|E

[...] According to Holden, the film is [...] "too {{frivolous}} even to be called satire." [...] According to Mick LaSalle, what makes the film [...] "fun" [...] is [...] "the harshness wrapped in a pretty package. The movie stars Audrey Tautou and Gad Elmaleh, who are about the only French stars that it's almost impossible to imagine having an active sex life. Their aura of innocence helps. Still, in America, no director could ever make this movie, even with the most innocent-seeming actors on the planet. This is way European, folks, not meant for our eyes, and, of course, that's the whole kick." [...] LaSalle notes the following:"Priceless is an entertaining sex farce that takes its characters to some of best hotels and most exclusive restaurants in France, and to watch it is to marvel at how some people live - and how you don't. But here's the interesting thing: Through this seduction, Priceless turns the viewer into a harlot, too, who can suddenly understand why Irene would do anything and sleep with anybody just {{to stay in this}} lifestyle. Likewise, we understand - instinctively, without thinking about it or judging it - why Jean might start sleeping with an older rich woman, just so he can stay in the hotels where Irene stays. Would {{you want to be the}} person who orders the drinks or fetches the drinks? How easy would it be to go back to normal life after confirming <b>what</b> <b>you</b> never <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to know, that the rich really do have it better, as in a lot better, as in money really does buy happiness?

5000|$|McGonigal defines willpower as [...] "the {{ability to}} do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to do when part of you really doesn’t want to do it", and says that humans {{experience}} conflicts between impulse and self-control in personal and social contexts, giving examples such as: craving for sweet foods, the urge to be sarcastic or complaining, {{and the desire to}} procrastinate. Humans have evolved adaptations to control their instincts and successfully resist impulsive drives, because living in groups requires self-control and this—McGonigal says—means taking the harder option. According to McGonigal, willpower failure or success can spread through a group, because humans tend to mirror the behavior of those they are socially connected with.|$|E
