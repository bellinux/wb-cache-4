5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} that, {{although}} the <b>world</b> <b>may</b> be causally {{independent of the}} human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent. The general idea is influenced by Kant's idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on the categories of thought.|$|E

5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones allow {{players to}} freely explore the game world, which is {{typically}} {{on the scale}} of an entire city. Some games base their level design on real world cities, such as London, New York City, and Los Angeles. Players are usually able to navigate by vehicle or on foot. Some games put greater emphasis on leaping, climbing, and even swimming. Exploring the world is not just necessary to complete objectives, but also to gain valuable items, weapons, and vehicles. Different parts of the game <b>world</b> <b>may</b> be controlled by different enemy factions, who will attempt to stop the player in a variety of ways. However, more recent games in this genre allow players to acquire their own territory. The freedom of navigating a huge game <b>world</b> <b>may</b> be overwhelming or confusing for new players. Game designers {{have come up with a}} variety of navigational aids to solve this problem. A mini-map feature is common, while Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto IV go so far as to offer a GPS service. Games without these navigation tools are sometimes criticized as confusing.|$|E

5|$|Ni no Kuni: Dominion of the Dark Djinn is a {{role-playing}} {{game that}} uses a fixed third-person perspective. Players complete quests—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. Outside of quests, players can freely roam the open world. Players explore towns, villages, dungeons and dangerous places scattered throughout the world, and possess the ability to travel between the world and Oliver's hometown of Hotroit. Upon leaving a location, players enter the World Map, which can be navigated, or used to select a destination. The <b>world</b> <b>may</b> be fully explored {{from the beginning of}} the game without restrictions, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content and forms of transport to navigate the world.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} year of development, Gas Powered Games found that {{they were not going to}} be able to finish the game within the planned two years; not only was the {{seamless}} world without loading screens harder to create than they had thought, but, according to lead developer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in choosing how many innovative features they could put into the game's custom engine, such as the wide range through which the virtual camera system could zoom in and out. Other features supported and later dropped included allowing up to ten characters at once—and therefore maintaining up to ten areas of the single-player world—instead of the final maximum of eight, and a weather system that included wind blowing projectiles off course. According to Kijanka, the developers also spent a lot of time changing technologies mid-development, such as building a custom animation editor before moving to a licensed one, and starting with the OpenGL graphics library only to switch to Direct3D. As a result, the team was required to work 12–14 hour days and weekends for most of the development time in order to complete the game within four years. In a 2011 interview, Taylor stated that in retrospect the final cost in development time of the seamless <b>world</b> <b>may</b> have been too high, and also that the team tried to make too large of a game for their budget; he believed that a game with closer to 35 hours of playtime instead of 70 would have been a better and more polished experience given their constraints.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 156 - 164. In this thesis, {{the nature}} and {{function}} of Marvellous Secondary worlds are examined {{by means of a}} comparative study of three Marvellous Secondary worlds: C. S. Lewis's Narnia, J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, and Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea. We consider the way in which Marvellous Secondary <b>worlds</b> <b>may</b> be used in order to explore certain aspects of reality highly effectively through themes and images characteristic of Marvellous fantasy. In the Introduction, the wide range of Secondary worlds in modern fantasy and the specific functions that Secondary <b>worlds</b> <b>may</b> fulfil is commented on. These analyses are then linked to a discussion of some of the central characteristics of Marvellous Secondary worlds...|$|R

The paper underlines how virtual <b>worlds</b> <b>may</b> offer new experimental platforms through new interactions perceiving the changeable nature of technology. The {{article is based on}} the results of the experience developed in the mainframe of the educational innovation project performed at La Laguna University during the 2012 - 2013 academic courses. The technological infrastructure has been created already and the 3 D graphic modelling was designed using open source software aiming for creation of the ‘La Laguna Virtual University’ virtual world. Teachers have given ubiquitous classes in this virtual environment interacting with students. All feedback from teachers and students has already been gathered in this experience...|$|R
