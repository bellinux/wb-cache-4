5|$|Chaplin {{had interviewed}} several actresses {{to play the}} blind flower girl but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. Cherrill waved {{and asked if she}} <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> the chance to work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin {{eventually}} invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness, and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally {{gave him a}} purpose in life and allowed him to {{make good use of}} his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first group of Americans to do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker was told that he had to be {{certified}} by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he had learned in England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was eager to get into the front lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and doubted he <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> to the front. While in Paris, he was happy to continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.|$|E

50|$|In his mass-market {{anthology}} The Portable Henry Rollins, Rollins {{stated that}} he had given 2.13.61 its name because someone {{had told him that}} his first self-released book, 20 (1984), had to have a company name on it, and since he felt {{at the time that he}} <b>would</b> only <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> to release one book, he simply used his birthdate.|$|R

After {{becoming}} a fairyland, Oz harbored many Witches, Magicians, and Sorcerers until the time when Ozma made magic illegal without a permit. In yet another inconsistency, it is implied that Ozma was the fairy left behind by Queen Lurline to rule the country, contradicting the story where she was Pastoria's daughter. This is later confirmed in Glinda of Oz: ...|$|R

25|$|San Francisco had {{a chance}} to score early when {{defensive}} back Rashad Holman intercepted a pass from Johnson on the opening drive and returned it 13 yards to the Buccaneers 40-yard line. But on third down, Bucs defenders Warren Sapp and Derrick Brooks shared a sack on Garcia that pushed the 49ers out of field goal range. Tampa Bay then drove 74 yards in 13 plays with a drive that included 17-yard receptions by Alstott and receiver Keyshawn Johnson, along with four third down conversions. Alstott finished the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. San Francisco responded as Garcia's 30-yard completion to Tai Streets set up a 24-yard field goal by Jeff Chandler, but the 7-3 score ended up being as close as the 49ers <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> {{for the rest of the}} game.|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{took the}} opening kickoff and stormed down the field. James gained 39 {{yards on the}} first five plays of the drive, and then Manning {{finished}} it with a 31-yard touchdown pass to Stokley. Denver responded on their ensuing drive, advancing the ball 49 yards in 12 plays and taking 8:13 off the clock. Jason Elam capped off the drive with a 49-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 7–3, {{but it was as}} close as Denver <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> {{for the rest of the}} game. After the kickoff, Harrison caught three passes for 70 yards, including a pass in which he made a diving catch around three Denver players. All of them thought Harrison was down by contact and started to leave the field, but no one had actually touched him, and Harrison got back up and ran 46 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|On 29 July 2011, Chicane {{revealed}} {{a preview of}} the title track for the forthcoming artist album Thousand Mile Stare on YouTube. Unfortunately, by November {{it was clear that the}} album had been leaked onto the internet, the second time such an occasion had occurred in Chicane's career. For a time it seemed doubtful whether the album <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> released, but an exclusive box set version of Thousand Mile Stare was released on 12 December 2011. It included a cassette-shaped USB flash drive of rare material and an album of remixes. Each early order contained the buyer's name on the album sleeve. The regular version of the album, which contained three previously unreleased tracks, was released on 16 April 2012, with an album launch live show following in London at Koko on 27 April with guest performances from Kate Walsh, Vigri, Aggi Dukes and support from VillaNaranjos.|$|E

25|$|There {{would be}} no more scoring until 5:45 {{remained}} in the half, when the Packers suddenly buried St. Louis with three consecutive touchdowns. First, Cardinals safety Benny Perrin slipped while covering James Lofton in the end zone, and Dickey threw him the ball for a 20-yard score. Then Packers linebacker George Cumby recovered Stump Mitchell's fumble on the Packers 39. Dickey's subsequently completed a 30-yard pass to Jefferson and Eddie Lee Ivery broke off an 18-yard run before finishing the drive with a 2-yard rushing score. Two plays later, safety Mark Murphy intercepted Neil Lomax's pass and returned it 22 yards to the Cardinals 12-yard line, setting up Dickey's 4-yard touchdown toss to Ivery that gave Green Bay a 28-3 lead. St. Louis managed to respond with Lomax's 5-yard touchdown pass to Pat Tilley with nine seconds left in the half, but Lewis blocked the extra point, and their 28-9 halftime deficit ended up being as close as the score <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get.</b>|$|E
500|$|Most airmen doubted they <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> out of Buchenwald {{because their}} {{documents}} were stamped with the acronym [...] "DIKAL" [...] (Darf in kein anderes Lager), or [...] "not {{to be transferred}} to another camp". At great risk, Lamason and Burney secretly smuggled a note through a trusted Russian prisoner, who worked at the nearby Nohra airfield, to the German Luftwaffe of their captivity at the camp. The message requested in part, that an officer pass the information to Berlin, and for the Luftwaffe to intercede on behalf of the airmen. Lamason understood that the Luftwaffe would be sympathetic to their predicament, as they would not want their captured men treated in the same way; he also knew that the Luftwaffe had the political connections to get the airmen transferred to a POW camp.|$|E
500|$|Asked in July 2006 {{what she}} hoped for Kyla {{in the long}} run, Ayola responded: [...] "Most of all I’d {{like to see her}} laugh, big belly laughs as she has not done much of that! ...I also would like her to find a man that she is with not just because he is {{attractive}} but someone who can work her out and understand her". [...] Several months after this interview, the character was romantically linked to newcomer and former guest star, general surgical consultant Abra Durant, played by Adrian Edmondson. Edmondson departed from and returned to the show several times, with Kyla and Abra breaking up and reuniting on multiple occasions. Asked in February 2008 whether the two <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> back together, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, but I love working with Ade – he’s a gorgeous man." [...] The two ultimately left Holby together, moving to Ghana.|$|E
5000|$|A {{girlfriend of}} mine in college {{referred}} me to the man that was putting the group together. I honestly was so scared to sing and I didn't even know a song to sing at the audition so I sang [...] "Jesus Loves Me".

I am so thankful to this day for that experience because I do not think I <b>would</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>gotten</b> the role in Pitch Perfect if I hadn't overcome my fear to open my mouth and sing.|$|R
5000|$|... "Salvation Station" [...] and [...] "Dear Daddy" [...] {{were both}} mostly written by Davison.

The band expanded {{it into a}} non-acoustic version featuring all members, with Babb adding [...] "the middle break with the solos and the very Gentle Giant-y part". [...] "Dear Daddy" [...] was originally written and recorded by Davison in the early 90s. According to Schendel, the lyrics [...] "come from a far more personal place than we <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> normally <b>get</b> into." [...] The final result {{is a mix of}} both Davison's original recording and new work.|$|R
6000|$|Charley sighed as {{he thought}} of his many debts, his poor prospects, and his passionate love. There seemed, indeed, to be little chance that he <b>ever</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> on at all in the {{ordinary}} sense of the word.

500|$|... “I {{am writing}} {{this story about}} a detective who turns into a tree” was what writer Troy Kennedy Martin told his colleagues when asked what {{he was working on}} during the early 1980s. Kennedy Martin had become {{frustrated}} that “at the BBC there was no political dimension to their drama whatsoever” but had chosen to write a political story anyway, not really believing it <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> made. The election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan as President of the United States had brought about a major shift in the global political landscape and Kennedy Martin was motivated to write out of concern arising from such issues as the Greenham Common protests, the Falklands War, unrest among the miners and, arising out of the escalation of the Cold War, the fear that “born-again Christians and Cold War warriors appeared to be running the United States”.|$|E
500|$|Abra, {{aided by}} a {{returned}} Ric, {{decided to go ahead}} with the operations anyway, and secured the use of Kellar theatre at night from Clifford. [...] However, events come to a head when they received a charity patient in episode [...] "Duty of Care" [...] chaperoned by Abra's father, Cecil. [...] Having previously told Kyla his father was dead, Abra attempted to hide his identity from her, but she was furious to discover the truth. He placated her briefly, but was so worried when his father collapsed with ill-health that he ruined a social services meeting to decide whether her son may be returned from foster care. [...] They rowed bitterly, and soon thereafter Abra's father died. [...] He decided to take over the running of the charity in his father's place, and once more departed from Holby, again leaving Kyla behind. When asked whether the two characters <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> back together, following Abra's second abandoment, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, but I love working with Ade – he’s a gorgeous man." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Hara's {{first major}} film role {{was that of}} Mary Yellen in Jamaica Inn (1939), {{directed}} by Alfred Hitchcock and co-starring Laughton. O'Hara portrayed the innkeeper's niece, an orphan who goes {{to live with her}} aunt and uncle at a Cornish tavern, a heroine which she describes as [...] "torn between the love of her family and her love for a lawman in disguise". Laughton insisted that she change her name to the shorter [...] "O'Mara" [...] or [...] "O'Hara", and she eventually decided on the latter after expressing contempt at both. [...] When she said [...] "I like Maureen Fitzsimons and I want to keep it", Laughton replied with, [...] "Very well, you're Maureen O'Hara." [...] (O'Hara would later say that [...] "nobody <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> [...] straight.") [...] O'Hara noted that Laughton had always wanted a daughter of his own, and treated her as such, and she later stated that Laughton's death in 1962 was like losing a parent. She worked well under Hitchcock, professing to have [...] "never experienced the strange feeling of detachment with Hitchcock that many other actors claimed to have felt while working with him." [...] On the contrary, Laughton was engaged in a bitter battle with Hitchcock throughout the production and resented many of Hitchcock's ideas, including changing the nature of the villain from the novel. Though Jamaica Inn is generally seen by critics and the director himself as one of his weakest films, O'Hara was praised, with one critic stating [...] "the newcomer, Maureen O'Hara is charming to look at and distinct promise as an actress". Seeing the film was an eyeopener for O'Hara and change in self-perception, having always seen herself as a tomboy and realizing that on screen she was a woman of great beauty to others. When she returned to Ireland briefly after the film was completed it dawned on her that life {{would never be the same}} again, and she was hurt when she attempted to make pleasant conversation to some local girls and they rejected her advances, considering her to be very arrogant.|$|E

60|$|What {{would his}} conquest over Morella avail if Heaven should give him power to conquer?

How <b>would</b> they <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> the smell of the smoke of that {{sacrifice}} out of their nostrils? Castell was a brave man; no torments would make him recant. It was doubtful even if he would be at the pains to deny his faith, he who had only been baptized a Christian by his father for the sake of policy, and suffered the fraud to continue for the purposes of his business, and that he might win and keep a Christian wife. No, Castell was doomed, and he could no more protect him from priest and king than a dove can protect its nest from a pair of hungry peregrines.|$|R
50|$|The {{next season}} saw another cup run for Rovers {{as they reached}} the final of the FAI Cup again and this time Shamrock Rovers, managed by Irish {{football}} legend Johnny Giles, were their opponents. A controversial penalty scored by Ray Treacy gave the Dublin side a 1-0 win and prolonged Rovers search for their first FAI Cup. After one more season manager Billy Sinclair announced his departure and he would eventually be replaced by ex-Finn Harps manager Patsy McGowan who brought with him several players from the Donegal side. This included Brendan Bradley the league's all-time top scorer. In his second season at the club McGowan led Rovers to their fifth FAI Cup final where they this time met Dundalk. A 2-0 defeat left many wondering <b>would</b> Rovers <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> their hands on the famous trophy. At the end of the following season when Rovers finished in 5th position McGowan left to return to Finn Harps. He would be replaced by long-serving player Paul Fielding.|$|R

2500|$|Plans {{to make a}} third Evil Dead film {{had been}} {{circulating}} {{for a number of}} years, even prior to the production of Darkman. Evil Dead II made enough money internationally that Dino De Laurentiis was willing to finance a sequel.

Evil Dead II, according to Bruce Campbell, [...] "was originally designed {{to go back into the}} past to 1300, but we couldn't muster it at the time, so we decided to make an interim version, not knowing if the 1300 story <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> made". Promotional drawings were created and published in Variety during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot.
