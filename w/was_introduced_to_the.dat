Common animals include a large variety of birds (storks, curlews, harriers), amphibians and mammals (beavers). The reserve is home to the largest fallow deer population in France. This animal <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area in 1854.|$|E

5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom.

Many breeders {{switched}} to the Pekin duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the Pekin duck, inbreeding, and disease in the pure-bred Aylesbury strain and the rising cost of duck food meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that cricket <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Americas and India before it had spread throughout the British Isles. For example, {{there is no record}} of cricket in Yorkshire, home of the English game's most successful club, until 1751.

5|$|Large-scale {{irrigation}} <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> San Joaquin Valley in {{the late}} 19th century, {{and led to the}} construction of numerous state, federal and privately owned dams, which blocked migrating salmon and caused a large decline in riparian habitat. Diversion of water for irrigation often reduces the river to a small stream by the time it reaches its mouth. Efforts to mitigate environmental damage include habitat conservation work, re-establishment of historic streamflow patterns, and the construction of a salmon hatchery.|$|E
