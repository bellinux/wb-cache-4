30|$|Site-level {{estimates}} of ΔC and ΔC 2 stocks and <b>were</b> <b>calculated</b> three ways. First, inventory- based site estimates ΔC and ΔC 2 stocks <b>were</b> <b>calculated</b> as an arithmetic mean of ground plots at each site.

5|$|This protein {{belongs to}} the apolipoprotein A1/A4/E family and {{contains}} 2 coiled coil domains. Overall, APOA5 is predicted to have approximately 60% a-helical content. The mature APOA5 protein spans a length of 366 amino acid residues, of which 23 amino acids code for the signal peptide.

5|$|In the Critérium du Dauphiné, four {{different}} jerseys were awarded. The most {{important was the}} general classification, which <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. The rider with the least accumulated time is the race leader, identified by a yellow jersey with a blue bar; the winner of this classification was considered {{the winner of the}} race.|$|E
5000|$|Thermal transmittances [...] most {{walls and}} roofs can <b>be</b> <b>calculated</b> using ISO 6946, {{unless there is}} metal {{bridging}} the insulation in which case it can <b>be</b> <b>calculated</b> using ISO 10211.

5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> that a flyby {{mission to}} Eris could take 24.66 years using a Jupiter gravity assist, based on launch dates of 3 April 2032 or 7 April 2044. Eris would be 92.03 or 90.19 AU from the Sun when the {{spacecraft}} arrives.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> that a flyby {{mission to}} Makemake could take just over 16 years using a Jupiter gravity assist, {{based on a}} launch date of 21 August 2024 or 24 August 2036. Makemake would be {{approximately}} 52 AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives.|$|E
5|$|The final {{classification}} {{was a team}} classification. The team's time on each <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> {{by taking}} the best three riders from that team and adding their times together; {{the team with the}} lowest cumulative time was the leader of the classification.|$|E

5000|$|The three DFs and SSs <b>are</b> <b>calculated</b> {{from the}} summaries. Then the MSs <b>are</b> <b>calculated</b> and a ratio determines F.|$|R
5|$|The final {{classification}} {{was a team}} classification. This <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> {{using the}} finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage, excluding the team time trial; the leading team was {{the team with the}} lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets.|$|E
5|$|The final {{individual}} classification was {{the combination}} classification. This <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> by adding up each rider's {{position on the}} other three individual classifications. The rider with the lowest cumulative score was {{the winner of the}} classification and wore a white jersey.|$|E
5|$|The final {{individual}} classification was {{the young}} rider classification. This <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> {{the same way as}} the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1987. The leader wore a white jersey.|$|E
5|$|For illustration, the gcd(1071, 462) <b>is</b> <b>calculated</b> {{from the}} {{equivalent}} gcd(462, 1071 mod 462) = gcd(462, 147).

50|$|Variations of the Rucker Index {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>calculated.</b> If {{the site has}} a high {{diversity}} of species a RI20 can <b>be</b> <b>calculated</b> using twenty species. For sites with limited data or low species diversity, a RI5 with only five species can <b>be</b> <b>calculated.</b> A Rucker Girth Index or RGI10 can also <b>be</b> <b>calculated</b> using the girth of the largest girth individual {{in each of the}} ten fattest species on a site.|$|R
5|$|The {{technique}} used to analyse the BFO values was validated against 87 aircraft {{with the same}} SATCOM equipment operating in the region {{around the time of}} Flight 370's disappearance and against 9 previous flights operated by the same aircraft (9M-MRO). The sensitivity to error <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> during the early phase of Flight 370 when the aircraft's location, track, and ground speed were known. This resulted in an uncertainty of ±28° heading and ±9° of latitude.|$|E
5|$|Francium is an {{alkali metal}} whose {{chemical}} properties mostly {{resemble those of}} caesium. A heavy element with a single valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> to be around 27°C (80°F, 300K). The melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677°C (1250°F, 950K) is also uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp's orbital {{position}} <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> as 7.2astronomical units (AU) {{from the}} Sun, placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and {{by far the}} greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs. Most comets at this distance are extremely faint, and show no discernible activity, but Hale–Bopp already had an observable coma. An image taken at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13AU from the Sun, a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable. (Halley's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance from the Sun.) Analysis indicated later that its comet nucleus was 60±20kilometres in diameter, approximately six {{times the size of}} Halley.|$|E

5|$|In all 416,806 Australians {{enlisted in}} the AIF {{during the war and}} 333,000 served overseas. 61,508 were killed and another 155,000 were wounded (a total {{casualty}} rate of 65%). The financial cost to the Australian government <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> at £376,993,052. Two referendums on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war, preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but stretching the reserves of manpower available, particularly {{towards the end of the}} fighting. Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war.|$|E
5|$|In the 2016 Paris–Nice, three jerseys were awarded. The general {{classification}} <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> {{by adding}} each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were {{awarded to the}} first three finishers on road stages (Stages 1–7): the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for {{the second and third}} riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints (three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third). The leader of the general classification received a yellow jersey.|$|E
5|$|Sedna {{will come}} to {{perihelion}} around 2075–2076. This close approach to the Sun {{provides an opportunity for}} study that will not occur again for 12,000 years. Although Sedna is listed on NASA's Solar System exploration website, NASA is not known to be considering any type of mission at this time. It <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> that a flyby mission to Sedna could take 24.48 years using a Jupiter gravity assist, based on launch dates of 6 May 2033 and 23 June 2046. Sedna would be 77.27 or 76.43AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives.|$|E
