The TLBP {{deals with the}} optimization of design solutions for serial machining lines. Such lines consist of a sequence of <b>unit</b> <b>head</b> <b>machines.</b> The operations are grouped into blocks at every station. These blocks are executed sequentially and the operations within each block are performed simultaneously by the same multi-spindle head. The objective is to assign the operations to blocks and the blocks to stations minimizing {{the total number of}} station and spindle heads. The challenge is to minimize the line cost and time for line design. Experimental results are presented. They help to choose the best optimization method for each situation...|$|R
40|$|IFAC-PapersOnline. net (ISSN 1474 - 6670) International audienceIn this paper, we {{introduce}} a new optimization problem that aims to minimize the reconfiguration cost of a transfer line. A line has to be reconfigured if a new product has to be produced by an existing line or any changes in product characteristics occur. In such cases, new operations have to be integrated on existing equipment while some previously assigned operations are deleted. Since transfer lines consist of a sequence of <b>unit</b> <b>head</b> <b>machines,</b> their reconfiguration {{is not an easy}} issue because of numerous constraints on compatibility of operations to be taken into account. In this paper, a Mixed Integer Program is proposed for solving this problem with objective to minimize the cost of the final line configuration. An illustrative example is presented...|$|R

40|$|URL] {{machining}} {{lines are}} considered. Such lines {{consist of a}} sequence of <b>unit</b> <b>head</b> <b>machines</b> (stations). The operations to manufacture a product are grouped into blocks at every station. The blocks are executed sequentially and the operations within each block are performed simultaneously by the same spindle head. The inclusion and exclusion constraints for combining operations into blocks and stations {{as well as the}} precedence constraints are given. The problem is to assign the operations to blocks and the blocks to workstations minimizing the total line cost. The solution must provide a desired productivity (cycle time), it must also satisfy all technological constraints. In this paper a hybrid approach is proposed, which tries to improve a feasible solution obtained by a heuristic. The approach is based on decomposition of the initial problem into several sub-problems in accordance with a heuristic solution and solving the obtained sub-problems by a shortest path algorithm. Computational tests show the efficiency of the proposed approach for large-scale problems in comparison with simple heuristic algorithm...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} optimal control of pull manufacturing systems. We study a fluid model of a flow shop, with buffer holding costs non-decreasing along the route. The system is subject to a constant exogenous demand, thus incurring additional shortfall/inventory costs. The objective {{is to determine the}} optimal control for the production rate at each machine in the system. We exhibit a decomposition of the flow shop into "sections" of contiguous machines, where, in each section, the <b>head</b> <b>machine</b> is the bottleneck for the downstream system. We exhibit the form of an optimal control, and show that it is characterized by a set of "deferral times," one for each <b>head</b> <b>machine.</b> Machines which are upstream of a <b>head</b> <b>machine</b> simply adopt a "just [...] in [...] time" production policy. The <b>head</b> <b>machines</b> initially stay idle for a period equal to their deferral time, and thereafter produce as fast as possible, until the initial shortfall is eliminated. The optimal values of these deferral times are s [...] ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{articles}} {{describes a}} way to increase operational reliability of selective <b>heading</b> <b>machines</b> by preventing sudden failures and adjusting the repair cycle {{based on the results}} of runtime diagnostics of executive unit drive in terms of technical conditions. Based on the statistical examination of <b>heading</b> <b>machine</b> reliability, the authors have worked out a range of parts and assembly units with limited failure-free lifetime and subject to operational control. There have been developed techniques for expeditious diagnostics of executive unit drive technical condition based on values of engine current with measured data presented in frequency domain, diagnostics being performed without interrupting the technological process of underground development. There have been found identification frequencies in current range corresponding to defects and failures of separate parts of the electro-mechanical drive of the executive unit. There has been developed a microprocessor diagnostic complex that analyses compliance of hardware-obtained amplitude-frequency characteristics with actual technical conditions of the examined <b>heading</b> <b>machine</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|R
