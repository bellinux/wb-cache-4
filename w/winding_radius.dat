40|$|The {{principle}} of using hollow spiral winding is not novel, but the study {{on this topic}} is far from complete. In this paper, how hollow the central region of the coreless printed spiral winding (CPSW) inductor should be for a given footprint area {{in order to achieve}} the maximal quality factor Q max and to maintain high inductance value is explored. A hollow factor based on the ratio of the inner hollow radius and the outer <b>winding</b> <b>radius</b> τ = R in/R out, is proposed as for optimization and quantifying how hollow a spiral winding is. The relationship between τ and Q max, which depends on the operating frequency and the dimensional parameters of CPSW inductor, is established. For a specific operating frequency, it is discovered that if the conductor width is comparable with the skin depth, or the conductors are placed relatively far away from each others, the hollow design of the CPSW inductor has little improvement on Q but reduces the inductance. If the conductor width is much larger than the skin depth and the conductors are closely placed, the hollow spiral design is recommended. The optimal range of τ with which the Q max can be achieved is found to be around 0. 45 - 0. 55. © 2006 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|We numerically {{solve the}} {{equations}} of motion (EOM) for two models of circular cosmic string loops with windings in a simply connected internal space. Since the windings cannot be topologically stabilized, stability must be achieved (if at all) dynamically. As toy models for realistic compactifications, we consider windings on a small section of R^ 2, which is valid as an approximation to any simply connected internal manifold if the <b>winding</b> <b>radius</b> is sufficiently small, and windings on an S^ 2 of constant radius R. We then use Kosambi-Cartan-Chern (KCC) theory to analyze the Jacobi stability of the string equations and determine bounds on the physical parameters that ensure dynamical stability of the windings. We find that, for the same initial conditions, the curvature and topology of the internal space have nontrivial effects on the microscopic behavior of the string in the higher dimensions, but that the macroscopic behavior is remarkably insensitive {{to the details of}} the motion in the compact space. This suggests that higher-dimensional signatures may be extremely difficult to detect in the effective (3 + 1) -dimensional dynamics of strings compactified on an internal space, even if configurations with nontrivial windings persist over long time periods.

40|$|We {{modify the}} {{standard}} Abelian-Higgs model by introducing spatially-dependent couplings for the scalar and vector fields. We investigate static, non-cylindrically symmetric solutions {{of the resulting}} field equations and propose a pinch solution which interpolates between degenerate vacua along the string, labelled by ± |n|. This configuration corresponds to a vortex which shrinks to Planck scale before re-emerging as an anti-vortex, resulting {{in the formation of}} a bead pair with one bead at either side of the intersection. The solution is then topologically stable. A key assumption is that quantities such as phase and winding number, along with those which depend on them like the magnetic flux, become undefined at the Planck scale so that regions of opposite winding may be joined via a Planck-sized segment of neutral string. Similarities between this solution and the extra-dimensional windings of strings in type IIB string theory are discussed and a correspondence between field theory and string theory parameters is suggested. The spatial-dependence of the field couplings is found to have a natural interpretation in the dual string picture and results from the variation of the <b>winding</b> <b>radius,</b> giving rise to a varying (effective) string coupling. An interesting result is an estimate of the Higgs mass (at critical coupling) in terms of the parameters which define the Klebanov-Strassler geometry and which, in principle, may be constrained by cosmological observations.

40|$|Abstract: Currently {{operational}} {{tropical cyclone}} structure change forecasts consist of the forecast of maximum intensity {{in terms of}} maximum surface winds and the radial extent of winds exceeding various wind thresholds, commonly 34 -kt, 50 -kt, and 64 -kt. A survey of operational forecasters suggests {{that the process of}} making intensity and <b>wind</b> <b>radii</b> forecasts has changed little since IWTC- 5. During the same time, verification shows that intensity guidance has been steadily improving, albeit slowly, and is driving operational forecast improvements. This result was determined by using the historical databases available in the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast System and conducting a long-term verification of operational intensity forecasts and intensity guidance methods. Two metrics are used to verifying intensity change forecasting including the traditional measure of mean absolute errors (MAE) and the percent reduction in variance of the observed intensity change. Findings show that MAEs have very small decreasing trends and the percent reduction of variance has small increasing trends. Guidance for <b>wind</b> <b>radii</b> forecasting is currently not skillful and the best <b>wind</b> <b>radii</b> guidance is produced by statistical methods based on climatology and/or persistence.

In that context, we report on the capabilities {{of a new generation of}} satellite microwave radiometers operating at L-band frequency (~ 1. 4 GHz) and dual C-band (~ 6. 9 and 7. 3 GHz). These radiometers provide wide swath (> 1000 km) coverage at a spatial resolution of ~ 40 km and revisit of ~ 3 days. L-band measurements are almost unaffected by rain and atmospheric effects, while dual C-band data offer an efficient way to significantly minimize these impacts. During storm conditions, increasing foam coverage and thickness at the ocean surface sufficiently modify the surface emissivity at these frequencies, and in turn the brightness temperature (Tb) measurements. Based on aircraft measurements, new geophysical model functions have been derived to infer reliable ocean surface wind speeds from measured Tb variations. Data from these sensors collected over 2010 - 2015 are shown to provide reliable estimates of the gale-force (34 -kt), damaging (50 -kt), and destructive winds (64 -kt), within the Best-track <b>wind</b> <b>radii</b> uncertainty.
