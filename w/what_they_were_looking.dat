5|$|Visual effects {{producer}} James Tichenor {{claimed that}} visual effects work better when not highlighted, {{and that a}} major part of effective visual effects are the actors' reactions to nonexistent things. Replicator models were used to give the actors an idea at <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> and to match their eyelines. One model was mounted on a plexiglass rod and shown on-screen, giving the impression of an organic Replicator hologram. The computer-generated Replicators on board the submarine were tracked with small lights, some of which post-production left in for good looks. The reflections of the green screen on the floor aboard Thor's ship ("green spill", usually an undesired side effect) were used to key selective patches for the reflection of the big spaceship screen.|$|E
5|$|Smith was {{released}} by Chesterfield after he was not offered a new contract {{at the end of}} 2007–08. He trialled with Darlington of League Two, but was told by manager Dave Penney he was not <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> for. He then had a trial with newly relegated Conference Premier club Wrexham and eventually signed a contract with Gainsborough Trinity of the Conference North in late August. Smith made a goalscoring debut for Gainsborough with the team's goal in a 1–1 draw at home to Vauxhall Motors on 30 August. He joined York City in the Conference Premier on loan on 27 November, becoming Martin Foyle's first signing as manager, in a deal that would expire on 6 January 2009. Smith made his debut after coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for Craig Farrell in a 1–1 draw with Salisbury City. His first goal came after scoring the opener for York with a close range finish in a 3–1 victory over Ebbsfleet United. Following this, Foyle stated his intention of extending Smith's loan at York. Smith said he was looking to join the club on a permanent contract and that Gainsborough manager Steve Charles would allow him to leave for a club in a higher division on a free transfer. However, a move to York stalled in January as Gainsborough were holding out for a fee, although Foyle refused to pay this. York eventually made an offer of a quarter of Gainsborough's asking price, which was rejected.|$|E

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, shortly {{after the release of}} the first demo, Seppälä and Kuri began searching for a female vocalist with high {{technical}} skills to replace Goodman, feeling he wasn't right for the music. Around the time they placed an ad, they found another for soprano vocalist Heidi Parviainen, who had grown tired of her keyboard duties of Iconofear. After listening to her samples, they decided to set up a demo with her and the band. It turned out that she was exactly <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> for, due to her ability to both sing and contribute lyrics, after writing the lyrics to Passing Bells. This completed the band's lineup, now under the name of Amberian Dawn, the result of a day of brainstorming.

25|$|Herb Stempel was a {{contestant}} on Twenty One who was {{coached by}} the show's producer Dan Enright. While Stempel {{was in the}} midst of his winning streak, both of the $64,000 quiz shows were in the top-ten rated programs but Twenty One did not have the same popularity. Enright and his partner Albert Freedman were searching for a new champion to replace Stempel to boost ratings. They soon found <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> for in Charles Van Doren. Van Doren was an English teacher at Columbia University when a friend suggested he try out for a quiz show. Van Doren decided to try out for the quiz show Tic-Tac-Dough. Enright, who produced both Tic-Tac-Dough and Twenty One, saw Van Doren's tryout and was familiar with his prestigious family background that included multiple Pulitzer Prize-winning authors and highly respected professors at Columbia University. As a result, Enright felt that Van Doren would be the perfect contestant to be the new face of Twenty One.|$|E

McQuarrie was introduced to the project while directing Cruise in Jack Reacher. [...] While reading the earlier script McQuarrie [...] "understood very clearly what the premise of the story was and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> for in terms of characters".

In Smallville, Doomsday is represented as a [...] "nice guy" [...] paramedic, who grew up moving from foster home to foster home. His storyline is considered [...] "very dark" [...] in that the character uncovers horrible truths about himself as season eight progresses. Brian Peterson explained that he, {{and the rest of}} the new executive producers, were looking for a villainous character that was [...] "as great as Lex", with Michael Rosenbaum's departure at the end of the seventh season, and Doomsday fit <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> for. Although Witwer portrays Davis Bloome, who becomes the creature known as Doomsday, he does not actually wear the prosthetic body suit that was created for when Davis transforms into his monstrous counterpart.

500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Crosetti and Lewis {{looking for clues}} in a dark alley. Levinson and Attanasio {{specifically}} wanted a dialogue-driven prologue scene that did not immediately clarify {{the fact that the}} two men were detectives or <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> for. The dialogue and staging of the scene were imitated in the final scene of the last Homicide episode, [...] "Forgive Us Our Trespasses", which aired on May 21, 1999. In that final scene, Detective Rene Sheppard (played by Michael Michele) says to Lewis, [...] "Life is a mystery, just accept it", a line spoken by Crosetti in the first episode. Lewis also said, [...] "That's what's wrong with this job. It ain't got nothin' to do do with life", a line also spoken by Crosetti in the first episode. Early scenes in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] also involved Giardello introducing rookie detective Bayliss to the homicide unit.

500|$|Brady {{admitted}} under police questioning {{that he and}} Evans had fought, but {{insisted that}} he and Smith had murdered Evans between them; Hindley, he said, had [...] "only done {{what she had been}} told". Smith told police that Brady had asked him to return anything incriminating, such as [...] "dodgy books", which Brady then packed into suitcases. Smith had no idea what else the suitcases contained or where they might be, but he mentioned in passing that Brady [...] "had a thing about railway stations". The police consequently requested a search of all Manchester's left-luggage offices for any suitcases belonging to Brady, and on 15 October British Transport Police found <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> for at Manchester Central railway station—the left-luggage ticket was found several days later in the back of Hindley's prayer book. Inside one of the suitcases were nine pornographic photographs taken of a young girl, naked and with a scarf tied across her mouth, and a 13-minute tape recording of her screaming and pleading for help. Ann Downey, Lesley Ann Downey's mother, later listened to the tape after police had discovered the body of her missing 10-year-old daughter, and confirmed that it was a recording of her daughter's voice.|$|E

When Star Trek was first broadcast, he was {{concerned}} that it might turn into something similar to Lost in Space, which he described as [...] "one full-color hour of trash reaching into millions of homes". His first story outline was sent into Star Trek after his agent suggested that he waited until the shows started to air under the theory that the show might drop an existing episode in favor of a better script. The story was entitled [...] "Tomorrow is Yesterday" [...] and was about the Enterprise coming across a generation ship which had descended into a two-tier class system. His agent received a rejection letter from producer Gene L. Coon dated October 3, 1966. The letter stated that the [...] "outline was by no means inadequate. It is, as a matter of fact, very adequate." [...] It {{went on to say that}} it would require a budget larger than that available to television, but would have made a good film treatment. Coon offered to meet with Gerrold and explain <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> for, because they were not purchasing scripts at that time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{invention}} of Lofty {{had been an}} afterthought, and during the casting he was still considered as something of an [...] "enigma" [...] to the creators and writers alike.

Holland and Smith liked that his physical appearance (gauche and childlike) made him stand out (they likened him to the accident-prone sitcom character, Frank Spencer).
