25|$|The {{flood of}} Scots-Irish, German, and others {{immigrants}} kept coming. Over 200,000 pioneers {{came over the}} Wilderness Road, enduring severe hardships. In the winter of 1778-79, the weather <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> that the Kentucky River froze {{to a depth of}} two feet. The frontier settlements alongside the road struggled to survive. Many of the cattle and hogs froze to death. The settlers had to eat frozen cattle and horses to survive.|$|E
25|$|The pilot episode (1979) {{and first}} two series (1980–1981) were all filmed during early spring before the holiday camp was {{opened to the}} public for the summer. This is {{noticeable}} during outdoor scenes, because most of the trees on the camp site are bare. Since it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> during filming a lot of the outdoor scenes, the cast were continuously complaining about having to appear in summer clothing, and Jeffrey Holland was treated for hypothermia during the first series because his character spent most of the time in the swimming pool.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, he bowled 422 overs {{for his new}} county, conceding just 516 {{runs and}} {{capturing}} 41 wickets. The following year, at Trent Bridge (when it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> that KS Ranjitsinhji kept {{his hands in his}} pockets and fielded the ball with his feet), Shaw bowled 100.1 five-ball overs as his former team accrued a gargantuan 726. He finally retired again two matches later, when Sussex drew against Middlesex, and only ever returned to the first-class scene in 1897 to play the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. He subsequently became a publican and died aged 64.|$|E

25|$|After {{purchasing}} {{the more powerful}} Hiller 12E, Wes began to operate more lift jobs. One of these large jobs {{was working on the}} John Day Dam on his company's name sake Columbia River. Here Wes began performing precision lift jobs by using a longer than average cable. The concept was the pilot could lean out the side of the aircraft and see directly where they are placing the load. A few years later Wes' brother Jim was flying a Sikorsky S-61 in the Colorado Rockies. Jim <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> he was forced to land. In need of an enclosed cockpit Columbia went on to develop the first pilot bubble window.|$|E
25|$|Wanyan Heda's army {{still had}} more than 100,000 men after the battle at Mount Yu, and the Mongols adopted a {{strategy}} of exhausting the enemy. The Jin troops had little rest {{all the way from}} Dengzhou, and had not eaten for three days because of the severing of their supply lines. Their morale was plummeting and their commanders were losing confidence. When they reached Three-peaked Hill, a snowstorm suddenly broke out, and it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> that the faces of the Jin troops went as white as corpses, and they could hardly march. Rather than attack them when they were desperate with their backs to the wall, the Mongols left them an escape route and then ambushed them when they let down their guard during the retreat. The Jin army collapsed without a fight, and the Mongols pursued the fleeing Jin troops relentlessly. Wanyan Heda was killed, and most of his commanders also lost their lives. After the Battle of Three-peaked Hill, Kaifeng was doomed and Emperor Aizong soon abandoned the city and entered Hebei Province in a vain attempt to reestablish himself there. Thousands of people offered a stubborn resistance to the Mongols, who entrusted the conduct of the attack to Subutai, the most daring of all their commanders. Emperor Aizong was driven south again, and by this time Kaifeng had been taken by the Mongols so he established his new capital at Caizhou (present-day Runan County, Henan Province). Subutai wished to massacre the whole of the population. But fortunately for the Khitans, Yelü Chucai was more humane, and under his advice Ögedei Khan rejected the cruel proposal.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in October 2008. The weather <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> during filming that one scene {{taking place in}} a lake had to be {{shortened}} when Prescott {{was taken to a}} standby ambulance with suspected hypothermia. [...] "Naomi" [...] brought in 957,000 viewers and was E4's highest-rated programme of the week. Critical reviews of the episode were generally positive.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the severe}} damage to Bågenholm's body, no {{permanent}} brain damage was diagnosed. Gilbert commented on this: [...] "Her body {{had time to}} cool down completely before the heart stopped. Her brain <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> when the heart stopped that the brain cells needed very little oxygen, so the brain could survive for quite a prolonged time." [...] Gilbert also noted that therapeutic hypothermia, a method used to save victims of circulatory arrest by lowering their body temperature, has become more frequent at Norwegian hospitals after Bågenholm's case gained fame.|$|E
500|$|However, the FIVB's mandating of the bikini {{ran into}} problems. Some sports {{officials}} consider it exploitative and impractical in colder weather. It also drew {{the ire of}} some athletes. At the 2006 Asian Games at Doha, Qatar, only one Muslim country– Iraq– fielded a team in the beach volleyball competition because of concerns that the uniform was inappropriate. They refused to wear bikinis. The weather during the evening games in 2012 London Olympics <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> that the players sometimes had to wear shirts and leggings. Earlier in 2012, FIVB had announced it would allow shorts (maximum length [...] above the knee) and sleeved tops at the games. Richard Baker, the federation spokesperson, said that [...] "many of these countries have religious and cultural requirements so the uniform needed to be more flexible".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was shot on a stretch of beach {{on the coast of}} California in Malibu and {{directed}} by Marcus Raboy. In an interview with MTV News, Rihanna spoke about the development of the shoot for the video, saying [...] "The water <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold...</b> but oh my gosh, we had so much fun... We were bumping each other off the Jet Skis and just had a ball". During the interview, the singer elaborated further upon the content of the video and the meaning behind it, saying [...] "This video is about having fun, giving off the vibe of the Caribbean... we did some mermaid-looking stuff down on the sand...and I'm just [...] to the camera as if it were my boyfriend. Now we're going to do [...] the Tiki torches. It's going to be incredible". [...] The dance routines in the video were choreographed by noted choreographer Fatima Robinson.|$|E
500|$|... "Naomi" [...] {{was filmed}} in October 2008, {{in the same}} {{production}} block as the series' fourth episode, [...] "Pandora", and the series' opening title sequence. The riot scene {{in front of the}} college was filmed with 100 extras; Cook's petrol-bombing of the car was described by costume assistant Ros Marshall as [...] "probably the most hi-tech special effect we've had while filming Skins". The students' college common room was filmed in the show's production canteen. Originally, an entire scene was supposed to be filmed with Naomi and Emily in the lake, but the water <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> that the actors were unable to stay in the water, and Kathryn Prescott was taken to a standby ambulance with suspected hypothermia. Director Simon Massey choreographed Naomi and Emily's sex scene prior to filming so that, on the set, the actions would come instinctively to the actors and {{they would be able to}} complete the scene in a limited number of takes. While Lily Loveless enjoyed filming those scenes because [...] "stuff like that gives you experience", Prescott said that it concerned her, though she said that she was not pressured to do anything in the script that made her uncomfortable.|$|E
500|$|The battle's {{main focus}} was around a road dubbed [...] "Route 29", a {{strategically}} important line of communication to the UN forces in central Korea. Wonju {{was a critical}} crossroad village on Route 29 which ran north to south and connects Chuncheon on the 38th parallel with Daegu on the Pusan Perimeter. Another road, which ran from the northwest, connected Route 29 and the South Korean capital of Seoul at Wonju. Between Chuncheon and Wonju stood the town of Hoengseong, and from Wonju to Daegu were a series of towns such as Chechon, Tanyang, Punggi and Andong. The entire road network was situated within the rough hilly terrains of the Taebaek Mountain Range. The fighting around Wonju occurred during {{some of the worst}} Korean winter conditions, with temperatures as low as [...] and snow as thick as [...] on the ground. Indeed, the weather <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> that metal on artillery pieces would crack, while water could take an hour-and-a-half to boil. At times the cold weather alone was enough to stall all military activities, while frostbite caused more casualties than combat {{during the course of the}} battle.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dreamlover" [...] was {{directed}} by Diane Martel and filmed in upstate New York in June 1993. The video features scenes of Carey swimming in a small pond by a waterfall, boarding a colorful hot air balloon, and dancing alongside several shirtless male dancers. As the video begins, Carey is swimming underwater while wearing clothing. She is soon gasping for air and climbing into a flower bed above. As she frolics and rolls in a field, scenes of Carey boarding a hot air balloon are inter-cut. Her dog Jack makes a cameo appearance, as he follows her through the field and pond. After a short interval of dancing alongside several male dancers, Carey leaves with her dog as the video concludes. After filming the video, Carey revealed that the water <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> that she refused to swim until the director, Martel, dived in first. Author Chris Nickson felt the video captured the song's soft and relaxed nature: [...] "The casual feel, almost like clips from home movies edited together, captured the song's off-the-shoulder airiness." [...] The video received heavy rotation on several video music channels, which added to the song's chart performance.|$|E
500|$|In Haygarth's Cricket Scores and Biographies, Roe is {{described}} as a [...] "fine, free hitter with excellent defence", who could also [...] "bowl a very useful medium-paced ball". He got more of a go at Cambridge during his third year, playing five matches for the university side in 1882. Roe, who was known for his cricket tales, related a tale from one match that season in which the weather <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> that catches were difficult to take. George Nash, the Lancashire professional, was missed off every ball of an over from Robert Ramsay. [...] "C. T. Studd bowled the next ball, and a catch came to me at mid-off, the crowd began to boo, and I felt certain I should not make the catch, but by great good fortune the ball stuck!" [...] Roe did not excel with bat or ball in any of his five university matches, and was not selected for the match against Oxford University {{at the end of the}} season. In his final year at Cambridge, Roe played seven times for the university, and achieved his Blue—the awarding of the Cambridge [...] "colours" [...] to sportsmen—by appearing in the University match against Oxford. He was out without scoring any runs in his only innings of the match, which Cambridge won by seven wickets. In all, during his time at Cambridge, Roe played 13 first-class matches for the university, scoring 246 runs at an average of 11.18, with just one score greater than 50. He also took ten wickets at 15.60.|$|E
500|$|Another of Bradley's {{concerns}} in his {{message to the}} legislature was {{the condition of the}} Governor's Mansion. In his address, he declared [...] "As to the Executive Mansion, for years its floors have been propped up to prevent them from falling, and it required more than seven hundred feet of weather strips to make it comfortable in the winter. The present site is disagreeable, the view from one side overlooks the walls of the penitentiary, and from the other the smokestack of a large flouring mill nearby." [...] Instead of addressing Bradley's concerns, the General Assembly passed a [...] "ripper bill" [...] taking control of the mansion from the governor and putting it {{under the supervision of the}} Court of Appeals. On February 10, 1899, the mansion caught fire as a result of a faulty flue in the governor's bedroom. The day <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>cold</b> that the fireman had difficulty keeping the water in their hoses unfrozen, and the mansion suffered extensive damage. Though the mansion was insured and a reporter for the Courier-Journal opined that the sensible thing to do would be to demolish the old structure and construct a new one or purchase another house in Frankfort to serve as the governor's mansion, the legislature was disinclined to make more than minimal accommodations for a Republican governor. Consequently, the mansion was once again repaired. The Bradleys stayed with a neighbor in Frankfort immediately after the fire. Thereafter, Governor Bradley stayed in Frankfort's Capitol Hotel, while Mrs. Bradley and daughter Christine returned to the family's home in Lancaster. The family re-occupied the residence prior to the end of Bradley's term.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ability of}} the Franklin {{air-cooled}} engine to get maximum power under all conditions was [...] "conclusively proved" [...] in a test at Dayton, Ohio where a standard Franklin automobile engine flew a Waco airplane throughout the day under extremely adverse weather conditions.
