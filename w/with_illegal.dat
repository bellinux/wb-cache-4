5|$|While Wallis was {{researching the}} book, the Guardian's Office, Scientology's {{intelligence}} agency, investigated him.

The agent inquired if Wallis was involved <b>with</b> <b>illegal</b> drugs. Wallis later discovered forged letters purportedly sent by him and designed to implicate him in controversial acts. Wallis assumed this was a reaction by the Guardian's Office to The Road to Total Freedom.|$|E
5|$|Under {{common law}} tradition, civilians could possess {{firearms}} except artillery and insidious weapons (e.g. firearms that had appearance of other objects, etc.). First gun control laws were enacted during early 18th century and dealt <b>with</b> <b>illegal</b> use of firearms for poaching. At the time, hunting was an exclusive noble privilige {{with little to}} no legal option for participation of common folk. Despite tough sentences of 12 years of hard labor or death introduced by a 1727 enactment, poaching with use of firearms remained widespread {{to the point that}} a 1732 Royal Gamekeeping Rules noted that gamekeepers were in constant danger of being shot by poachers.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Allen became {{chairman}} of the MCC's Cricket Committee. The committee looked at ways to improve cricket, for example analysing whether reducing {{the size of the}} ball would help bowlers. Allen also began to pursue bowlers <b>with</b> <b>illegal</b> bowling actions; commentators were aware that this was a growing issue but no action had been taken, and Allen took the lead. Three English bowlers were no-balled for throwing in 1959 and another five in 1960. Geoff Griffin, a bowler who toured England with the South African team in 1960, was perceived to have a suspect action; when the bowler was no-balled for throwing in a Test match, the South African press suggested that Allen had played a prominent part. Later that year, Allen met Bradman, Australia's representative at the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC); the pair wanted to ensure that bowling actions would be fair in future, and the ICC agreed to take action. When Australia toured England in 1961, no bowlers whose actions had been questioned were included in either team. Allen later took the lead in re-drafting the law on throwing.|$|E

5|$|On July 18, 1998 a Yugoslav Army (VJ) {{border patrol}} ambushed over 200 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) insurgents and foreign mujahideen {{just west of}} Dečani, on the {{frontier}} between Albania and Yugoslavia. The ambush resulted {{in the deaths of}} four KLA fighters and 18 mujahideen (mostly citizens of Saudi Arabia). Another six KLA fighters were arrested by the Yugoslav authorities and charged <b>with</b> <b>illegal</b> entry and gunrunning. The VJ reported seizing a significant amount of arms and ammunition that the militants had been smuggling. One Yugoslav border guard was seriously wounded in the clash. According to Israeli historian Shaul Shay, the ambush represented the first clash of the Kosovo War between the VJ and foreign mujahideen. Human Rights Watch advisor Fred C. Abrahams suggests {{it is possible that the}} mujahideen were deliberately led into a trap by the KLA as part of a plan to reduce the influence of Islamic extremists within the KLA's ranks.|$|E
5|$|Police {{seized a}} rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and three pistols {{from the men}} {{at the time of the}} arrest. They were {{detained}} in Bells, Tennessee for a few days before being moved to another facility. During interrogation, the men told authorities of their plan to kill Obama. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives handled the initial federal investigation of the case. The United States Secret Service became involved in the investigation once the assassination plot was discovered. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was also involved in the investigation. Both men were charged <b>with</b> <b>illegal</b> possession of a sawed-off shotgun, conspiracy to rob a firearms dealer and making threats against a presidential candidate; a superseding indictment additionally charged the pair with civil rights conspiracy and conspiracy, and charged Cowart with destruction of religious property and a related firearms charge. Authorities have found no evidence that anyone besides the two men were involved in the plot, but as of October 2008 authorities were said to be investigating the possibility.|$|E
