5|$|On August 3, 2015, divers {{found the}} wreck of the USNS Mission San Miguel (T-AO-129) within the monument. She had sunk there on October 8, 1957 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground on Maro Reef while running at full speed and in ballast. Researchers will map and study the wreck in situ.|$|E
5|$|She {{remained}} in service until 8 February 1945, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground in the Alverstraumen narrows. Kommandøren remained aground for five weeks, and was filled by sea water before being salvaged and towed to Bergen to await repairs. Although the ship's hull was intact, {{the interior and}} engine were heavily water damaged.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1928, Kommandøren ran aground at Opdalseldet in Bårdsundet off Tysnesøy Hordaland; she was refloated {{after all}} 350 {{passengers}} {{had been taken}} off. She ran aground yet again in April 1938, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> into the island Segløya while en route from Skjerjehamn to Eivindvik.

5|$|HMS Howe was an Admiral-class ironclad {{battleship}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the 1880s. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Channel Fleet in mid-1890 and was badly damaged <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground in late 1892. After repairs were completed, Howe was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in late 1893. She returned home in late 1896 and became a guardship in Ireland. Howe remained there until late 1901 when she was assigned to the Reserve Fleet. The ship was paid off in three years later and then sold for scrap in 1910.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this {{assignment}} that she suffered a near-catastrophe <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground on Pearl Rock, near Gibraltar in 1871 and nearly sank. Agincourt was leading the inshore column of ships, contrary to normal practice where the senior flagship lead the inshore column, and gently ran aground sideways when the senior flagship's navigator failed {{to compensate for the}} set of the tide. Warrior, immediately following her, nearly collided with her, but managed to sheer off in time.|$|E
5|$|The Italian cruiser San Giorgio was {{the name}} ship of her class of two armored cruisers built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century. Commissioned in 1910, the ship was badly damaged <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground before the start of the Italo-Turkish War in 1911, {{although}} she was repaired before its end. During World War I, San Giorgios activities were limited by the threat of Austro-Hungarian submarines, although the ship did participate in the bombardment of Durazzo, Albania, in late 1918.|$|E

5|$|The replica Endeavour visited various European ports before {{undertaking}} {{her final}} ocean voyage from Whitehaven to Sydney Harbour on 8 November 2004. Her arrival in Sydney was delayed <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground in Botany Bay, {{a short distance}} from the point where Cook first set foot in Australia 235years earlier. The replica Endeavour finally entered Sydney Harbour on 17 April 2005, having travelled , including twice around the world. Ownership of the replica was transferred to the Australian National Maritime Museum in 2005 for permanent service as a museum ship in Sydney's Darling Harbour.|$|E
5|$|The two Odin-class {{ships were}} also rebuilt, in 19011904, and {{received}} the same modifications as the Siegfried-class vessels. Their service histories were largely identical to the Siegfrieds; they served with the fleet from their commissioning, and were mobilized at the outbreak of war in August 1914 before being relegated to secondary duties in August 1915. Both ships were rebuilt as merchantmen {{after the end of}} the war; Odin served in this capacity until she was scrapped in 1935, while Ägirs career was cut short <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground off the Swedish island of Gotland in December 1929.|$|E
5|$|Atlanta was a casemate ironclad {{that served}} in the Confederate and Union Navies during the American Civil War. She was {{converted}} from a Scottish-built blockade runner named Fingal by the Confederacy after she made one run to Savannah, Georgia. After several failed attempts to attack Union blockaders, the ship was captured by two Union monitors in 1863 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground. Atlanta was floated off, repaired, and rearmed, serving in the Union Navy {{for the rest of}} the war. She spent most of her time deployed on the James River supporting Union forces there. The ship was decommissioned in 1865 and placed in reserve. Several years after the end of the war, Atlanta was sold to Haiti, but was lost at sea in December 1869 on her delivery voyage.|$|E

5|$|In Baby Face Stanwyck {{moves to}} New York and sleeps {{her way to}} the top of Gotham Trust. Her {{progress}} is illustrated in a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward along the front of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men are driven mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from post Code films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration of the picture is a black woman named Chico (Theresa Harris), whom she took with her <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> away from home at age 14.|$|E
5|$|Ohioans post-war {{career was}} {{relatively}} uneventful until 8 October 1936, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground near Seal Rock at the Golden Gate, {{the entrance to}} San Francisco Bay. Attempts to free the ship were unsuccessful and, because of the close proximity of the wreck to San Francisco, the grounded Ohioan drew large crowds to watch salvage operations. Angelo J. Rossi, the mayor of San Francisco, toured the wreck on 19 October. Ohioans hulk caught fire in March 1937, and the wreck broke into two pieces in a storm in December. As late as 1939, some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1800, Agamemnon {{was damaged}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> onto the Penmarks Rocks. She came into Falmouth on 25 March 1800. On {{her way to}} port she had {{encountered}} , which assisted her and accompanied her into port. With {{the assistance of the}} crews from two sloops, the guardship , and troops from Pendennis Castle at the pumps, the crew managed to stop the water level in the hold rising any further. Agamemnon made for Plymouth for repairs. Movement caused the leak to gain on the men at the pumps once more, and when she was off Penlee Point, Agamemnon fired a gun for assistance. When she reached Plymouth she was lashed to a sheer hulk to prevent her sinking.|$|E

5|$|Richard Beitzen {{spent much}} of 1943 escorting ships to and from Norway until November <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground in November. Badly damaged, repairs lasted until August 1944 when she {{returned}} to Norway and resumed her former duties. The ship had another grounding incident in November and was under repair until February 1945. While escorting a convoy in April, she was badly damaged by aircraft and was still under repair when the war ended on 9 May. Richard Beitzen was eventually allocated to the British when the surviving warships were divided between the Allies after the war. They made no use of the ship before scrapping her in 1949.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{returned}} to Norway in mid-1942, but was badly damaged <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground in July {{and did not}} return until April 1943. Hans Lody participated in the German attack (Operation Zitronella) on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen, well north of the Arctic Circle and then spent {{the next six months}} on convoy duties in southern Norway. The ship began a lengthy refit in April 1944 and was not operational for the next year. She spent April 1945 escorting convoys in Danish waters before making one voyage to rescue refugees in East Prussia in May. Hans Lody was assigned to the Royal Navy after the war and used as a training ship and then a barracks ship before being broken up for scrap in 1949.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{laid down in}} 1896–97 by Normand at their Le Havre shipyard, {{as the last of}} the four s. She was named after a French type of blunderbuss; all of the ships in her class were named after weapons. Espingole was {{launched}} on 28 June 1900 and completed around September <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> her speed trials. Construction costs were 1,690,994 francs. She was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet in December and made a number of port visits in France, Corsica and French North Africa throughout 1901. Her rudder was damaged after striking the bottom off Golfe-Juan and Espingole was under repair 3–27 September.|$|E

5|$|By the age {{of twenty}} Lie had a good command of Sundanese and Malay; he also spoke fair Dutch, a rarity for ethnic Chinese at the time. Lie {{assisted}} van der Linden at the missionary school, and in the mid-1870s operated a general school for poor Chinese children. He also worked for the missionary's printing press, Zending Press, earning forty gulden a month while serving as editor of two religious magazines, the Dutch-language monthly De Opwekker and the Malay-language bi-weekly Bintang Djohor. He married Oey Pek Nio, seven years his junior, in 1876. Tio, {{in an interview with}} the scholar of Chinese Malay literature Claudine Salmon, stated that Lie had been betrothed to Oey's elder sister, but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> away the night before the ceremony, he was told to by his parents to marry Oey Pek Nio to save face. Although displeased with the arrangement, he obeyed. The pair soon grew close. The following year they had their first child, although the baby died soon after birth. Lie's mother died in 1879, and his father died the next year.|$|E
5|$|HMS Esk was an E-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. She {{was designed to be}} easily converted into a fast minelayer by removing some guns and her torpedo tubes. Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36, during the Abyssinia Crisis. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, she spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of the}} conflict. Esk was converted to a minelayer when World War II began in September 1939, and spent most of her time laying mines. During the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940, the ship laid mines in Norwegian territorial waters before the Germans invaded, but was recalled to home waters to resume her minelaying duties in early May. During one such sortie, Esk was sunk during the Texel Disaster on the night of 31 August 1940, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> into a newly laid German minefield.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Sartain met Mary Cassatt in Philadelphia and the {{following}} year they left for Paris, London, Parma, and Turin to study painting. The women spent the first winter in Italy and studied printmaking with Carlo Raimondi, who taught engraving at the Academy of Fine Arts in Parma. Sartain {{spent the rest of}} the four-year stay in Paris and studied under Évariste Vital Luminais. She shared a studio with Jeanne Rongier. Florence Esté, Sartain's friend, also worked in the studio occasionally. The women copied each other's work and provided one another criticism and encouragement. Two of Sartain's paintings, genre painting Le Piece de Conviction (The Reproof) and a portrait of Mlle. Del Sarte, were accepted at the Paris salon in 1875. Sartain returned to the United States that year, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> out of money. Harriet (Hattie) Judd Sartain, who was her brother Samuel's wife and a successful homeopathic physician, had lent Emily Sartain money for her education. Emily believed Hattie was likely to continue to help with education expenses in Philadelphia where expenses were lower and she would more likely sell her works.|$|E
