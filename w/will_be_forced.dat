5|$|Congestion pricing or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of surcharging users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the congestion pricing concept, postulates that users <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to pay for the negative externalities they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E
5|$|The Privy Council {{identified}} one of {{the extreme}} circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court of South Australia held that an action may proceed against a legislator accused of libel where the whole {{subject matter of the}} alleged libel relates to the legislator's conduct in the legislature so that the effect of parliamentary privilege is to exclude virtually all the evidence necessary to justify the libel. If such an action is not allowed to proceed, not only will there be injustice to the defendant, but there will also be a real danger that the media <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to abstain from the truthful disclosure of the legislator's misbehaviour in Parliament. This would be a most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible.|$|E
5|$|Violet {{explains}} to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie {{will be coming}} {{to pick up the}} money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.|$|E

25|$|To win a Null game, declarer {{must not}} take a single trick. Null games are often not played through to the end, either because declarer is forced to take a trick, ending the game prematurely, or because it becomes {{apparent}} to the defenders that they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to {{take the rest of}} the tricks. There are no card points in a Null game.|$|E
25|$|In {{an op-ed}} in Haaretz, Jamie Levin {{suggests}} {{that the success of}} the Iron Dome system will likely increase demands to field additional systems across Israel. Budget shortfalls mean that Israel <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to weigh spending on missile defenses against other expenditures. Such funds, he argues, will likely come from programs intended to help the most vulnerable sectors of society, such as social welfare.|$|E

25|$|But with {{a knight}} pawn (see the diagram on the right), the {{attacker}} has no file equivalent to 2... Rh2, {{so he can}} not make progress. Here, the defender should avoid the active defense (attacking the pawn from behind while {{it is on the}} fifth with the rook). It fails because his king <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to the long side (stepping the other way would lose immediately because of the corner, allowing immediate mate).|$|E

25|$|The {{distance}} between the defender line and the midfielder line should be kept constant at about 15 metres. However, the defensive line should back up and thus increase this distance, stand off, {{when there is no}} pressure on the opponent in possession, as this increases the possibility of a through ball. With tough pressure on the opponent, the distance may be reduced to below 15 metres. Also, as opponents move in close to the penalty area, the defending team <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to move their midfielders ever closer to their defenders.|$|E

Teams that run 00 to 09 are listed as 100 to 109 for NASCAR's scoring purposes. Except for those numbers (which {{have been used for}} {{full-time}} teams), part-time teams may be assigned a three-digit number for scoring purposes only (such as Nos. 141 and 241). If two such teams arrive with the same two digit number, the team higher in championship points prevails, and the other team <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to change their number for the race.|$|E

25|$|Another {{powerful}} {{tactic of}} nonviolent intervention invokes public {{scrutiny of the}} oppressors {{as a result of}} the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression.

If the resisters are persistent, the military or police <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to accept the fact that they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.|$|E
