5|$|Cairo protesters had {{gathered}} {{in the morning in}} front of the High Court in the centre of Cairo. The demonstration was larger than expected. It broke through the security cordon and moved to Tahrir Square. Thousands protested in Cairo, with 15,000 occupying Tahrir Square (Liberation Square). Police used tear gas and <b>water</b> <b>cannons</b> against the protesters, who in turn threw stones at police, eventually forcing them to retreat.|$|E
5|$|Solidarity {{now joined}} forces with its {{erstwhile}} enemy, the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ), and some protests were organized by both trade unions. The following year, Solidarity organized many strikes over {{the state of the}} Polish mining industry. In 1995, a demonstration before the Polish parliament was broken up by the police (now again known as policja) using batons and <b>water</b> <b>cannons.</b> Nonetheless, Solidarity decided to support Wałęsa in the 1995 presidential elections.|$|E
5|$|Operation Badr was {{preceded by}} {{training}} exercises starting in 1968, operational planning from 1971 onwards and a deception operation. In the opening stages of the attack, known as The Crossing (العبور; al-'obour), combat engineers used <b>water</b> <b>cannons</b> to rapidly clear numerous passages through the sand wall lining the east bank of the canal, laid bridges and operated ferries, allowing armor to cross. Egyptian infantry assaulted the Bar-Lev fortifications and were counterattacked by Israeli armor and infantry.|$|E

2500|$|Newark MP Colonel Patrick Mercer {{called for}} the {{deployment}} of <b>water</b> <b>cannon.</b> In December 2010 Theresa May, the Home Secretary, had said that the deployment of <b>water</b> <b>cannon</b> by police forces on the British mainland was an operational decision which had been [...] "resisted until now by senior police officers." [...] On 9 August 2011, May rejected their use and said: [...] "The way we police in Britain is not through use of <b>water</b> <b>cannon.</b> The way we police in Britain is through consent of communities." [...] Ken Livingstone, the former London mayor, said [...] "The issue of <b>water</b> <b>cannon</b> would be very useful given the level of arson we are seeing here." [...] Scotland Yard said officers {{did not have any}} <b>water</b> <b>cannon</b> and if their use was approved they would have to be brought over from Northern Ireland.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the day, police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, and <b>water</b> <b>cannons</b> into crowds during violent {{clashes between}} {{authorities}} and protesters throughout Egypt. In Port Said {{tens of thousands}} gathered and multiple government buildings were set ablaze. In Suez, police shot and killed at least one protestor. Protestors in Suez took control of a police station, freed arrested protesters and then burned down a nearby smaller local police post. The government issued an 18:00 to 7:00 curfew, but protesters ignored it and were met by police. In the evening, one of the National Democratic Party (NDP) headquarters buildings in Cairo was set on fire by an unidentified culprit. While protesters paused for evening prayers, police continued firing tear gas. The day's defiance was summed up by the plethora of Tunisian national flags and anti-Mubarak graffiti that the protesters had created in the Greater Cairo region, Alexandria, Beni Suef, Mansoura and Manufiya.|$|E

40|$|Gašenje požara sustavom vodenog topa pokazuje se pouzdanim u urbanim ili teže dostupnim područjima gdje se zahtijevaju precizna djelovanja vodom. Zbog ukupnih tehničkih i operativnih značajki sustava helikoptera i vodenog topa, razvijeno je nekoliko različitih taktika za gašenje određene vrste požara. Ovisno o režimu rada vodenog topa na helikopter djeluju trenutne i kontinuirane sile (impulsi) čiji momenti utječu na ukupne performanse helikoptera te mogu dovesti do ugrožavanja sigurnosti letenja. Tijekom rada topa u različitim taktičkim uvjetima gašenja može doći do narušavanja stabilnosti i kvalitete upravljanja helikoptera. Primjenom linearnog modela helikoptera s vodenim topom analiziran je utjecaj vodenog topa s impulsnim i kontinuiranim mlazom na dinamiku helikoptera. Fire {{extinguishing}} with {{system of}} <b>water</b> <b>cannon</b> is proved very reliable in urban or remote {{areas as well}} as on the ships at sea, where precise water action is required. Because of the overall both technical and operational features of helicopter and <b>water</b> <b>cannon,</b> several different tactics for firefighting are developed and practiced. Depending on the mode of the <b>water</b> <b>cannon</b> operation, on a helicopter may act both impulse and continualy developed forces and moments which affect the overall performance of the helicopter and can lead to degradation of flying safety. While working in a variety of tactical conditions, <b>water</b> <b>cannon</b> may additionaly cause degradation of stability and handling quality of helicopter. Helicopter equipped with <b>water</b> <b>cannon</b> firefighting tactics may be out of position from hovering or progressive flight. Generarly, <b>water</b> <b>cannon</b> may be able to shift both in azimuth and in elevation. Installation of a cannon on a helicopter can be done in two ways - under the helicopter fuselage parallel to its longitudinal axis or inside the passenger or cargo space when the cannon is mounted sideways. Applying a linear model of helicopter with a <b>water</b> <b>cannon,</b> the effect of a <b>water</b> <b>cannon</b> with impulse and continuously jet on helicopter is analized. The mathematical analysis of stability will be considered on generic transport helicopter with a conventional configuration, which is equipped with single-tube <b>water</b> <b>cannon</b> mounted on the longitudinal axis of the helicopter and in both impulse and continuously jet action regimes...|$|R
