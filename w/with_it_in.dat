5|$|After World War I, the {{territory}} was divided between France and the United Kingdom as League of Nations mandates. The Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by France in the 1950s, {{leading to the}} Cameroonian Independence War fought between French and UPC militant forces until early 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President Ahmadou Ahidjo. The southern part of British Cameroons federated <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1961 to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The federation was abandoned in 1972. The country was renamed the United Republic of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, {{and he had no}} dealings <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of his}} life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that the Claimant was Orton, some analysts believe that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist texts {{recount the}} birth of the Buddhist Chinnamunda. One tale tells of Krishnacharya's disciples, two Mahasiddha ("great perfected ones") sisters, Mekhala and Kanakhala, who cut their heads, offered them to their guru, and then danced. The goddess Vajrayogini also {{appeared}} in this form and danced with them. Another story recalls how the Mahasiddha princess Lakshminkara, cut off her head as a punishment from the king and roamed <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the city, where citizens extolled her as Chinnamunda-Vajravarahi.|$|E

5|$|Herring was {{promoted}} to the temporary rank of major general on 14August1941 {{when he took over}} command of the 6th Division. He returned to Australia <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> March 1942. Unaware that the government had already decided that General Sir Thomas Blamey should be appointed Commander in Chief, Herring, along with Major General George Alan Vasey and Brigadier Clive Steele, approached Army Minister Frank Forde with a proposal that all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Major General Horace Robertson appointed Commander in Chief. The 'revolt of the generals' collapsed with the announcement that General Blamey was returning from the Middle East to become Commander in Chief, but seems to have done the participants no harm.|$|E

5|$|In {{southern}} Africa, {{birds of}} both the European subspecies P. d. domesticus and the Indian subspecies P. d. indicus were introduced around 1900. Birds of P. d. domesticus ancestry are confined to a few towns, while P. d. indicus birds have spread rapidly, reaching Tanzania in the 1980s. Despite this success, native relatives such as the Cape sparrow also occur in towns, competing successfully <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> South America, it was first introduced near Buenos Aires around 1870, and quickly became common {{in most of the}} southern part of the continent. It now occurs almost continuously from Tierra del Fuego to the fringes of the Amazon basin, with isolated populations as far north as coastal Venezuela.|$|E

5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females {{do most of the}} caring and socializing of the young. A female often has an older {{offspring}} with her to help in socializing the infant. Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers for {{the first two years of}} their lives. The mother will carry the infant during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the same night nest. For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Raden Soeprapto (27 March 1894– 2 December 1964) was {{the fourth}} Attorney General of Indonesia. Born in Trenggalek, East Java, Soeprapto studied law in Jakarta, finding work {{in the legal system}} soon after graduating in 1920. After {{transferring}} often, in the early 1940s he had reached Pekalongan and become the head of the court for Native Indonesians. Escaping Pekalongan during Operatie Product {{with the help of a}} prisoner he had just sentenced, Soeprapto made his way to Yogyakarta and began to work as a prosecutor. When the government moved to Jakarta in 1950, Soeprapto went <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> January 1951, he was selected to be Prosecutor General of Indonesia, serving until 1 April 1959.|$|E

5|$|On 13 August, the Luftwaffe {{began an}} all-out assault on RAF airfields. Christened Adlertag (Eagle Day), the raids saw the {{heaviest}} fighting thus far. Scrambling at 16:00 to intercept an incoming raid near Dover, 65 Squadron encountered {{large numbers of}} Bf 109s from Jagdgeschwader 51 led by Hannes Trautloft. Finucane claimed a Bf 109 shot down and damaged another, leaving the Messerschmitt streaming smoke. Finucane lost contact <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> cloud and he claimed as a probable. One Bf 109 was lost from JG 51 and the pilot wounded. Two more were 80 percent damaged. 65 Squadron suffered no losses. 0n 18 August Finucane {{was involved in the}} large air battles that characterised the campaign. 65 Squadron engaged Heinkel He 111 bombers from Kampfgeschwader 1 downing one of their number.|$|E
5|$|Persephone– The former Queen of the Underworld {{and main}} {{antagonist}} of Chains of Olympus. Bitter at being abandoned to the Underworld by her fellow gods, Persephone entered into {{an alliance with}} Morpheus and then freed and used the Titan Atlas to capture the god Helios, intending to use Helios' power to destroy the Pillar of the World. Persephone offered to reunite Kratos with his daughter Calliope in the Fields of Elysium. This she did, but Kratos reluctantly abandoned Calliope and killed Persephone to stop her from destroying the Pillar, which would have in turn destroyed the Fields of Elysium and Calliope <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> God of War III, Persephone's remains were seen in a tree casket in Hades' palace and her voice was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Marina Gordon in Chains of Olympus.|$|E

5|$|Swiss {{citizens}} are universally required to {{buy health insurance}} from private insurance companies, which in turn are required to accept every applicant. While {{the cost of the}} system is among the highest, it compares well with other European countries in terms of health outcomes; patients who are citizens have been reported as being, in general, highly satisfied <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> 2012, life expectancy at birth was 80.4 years for men and 84.7 years for women — the highest in the world. However, spending on health is particularly high at 11.4% of GDP (2010), on par with Germany and France (11.6%) and other European countries, but notably less than spending in the USA (17.6%). From 1990, a steady increase can be observed, reflecting the high costs of the services provided. With an ageing population and new healthcare technologies, health spending will likely continue to rise.|$|E
5|$|The Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge, {{the first}} bridge {{to connect the}} two towns, had become {{functionally}} obsolete. Its narrow road had only two lanes with no shoulders. Because of its location near a sharp bend in the Mississippi River, the bridge had become a hazard to river traffic; barges and towboats frequently collided <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> 1994, a study concluded that a new bridge was needed and the old one should be torn down. Construction was begun in 2001 and the new bridge opened in 2010. In 2011, the process of removing the old bridge began.|$|E

5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> {{a small fraction of}} a second. The second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E
