40|$|A Web graph {{refers to}} the graph {{that is used to}} {{represent}} relationships between Web pages in cyberspace, where a node represents a URL and an edge indicates a link between two URLs. A Web graph is a very huge graph as growing with cyberspace. To use it for Web navigation, {{only a small part of}} the Web graph is displayed each time according to a user’s navigation focus. The graph layout has always been a challenge for visualizing systems. In this paper, we present a visualization system of an online Web graph, together with the methods for clustering and filtering large graphs. In this system, a <b>Web</b> <b>crawler</b> <b>process</b> is used to get on-line information of the Web graph. Filtering and clustering processes reduce the graph complexities on visualization. In particular, the filtering removes those unimportant nodes while the clustering groups a set of highly connected nodes and edges into an abstract node. The visualization process incorporates graph drawing algorithms, layout adjustment methods, as well as filtering and clustering methods in order to decide which part of the Web graph should be displayed and how to display it based on the user’s focus in navigation...|$|E

Several similar systems reviewed such as TripAdvisor, Priceline and Expedia Inc to identify the functionalities, strength and weaknesses of the existing system.

40|$|The {{consumer}} electronics market {{has a large}} number of novice shoppers who are not familiar with industry jargon and do not have the knowledge required to make informed decisions about which products to purchase. There is significant de-mand for a service that gathers data from consumers about their needs and preferences by asking simple english-language questions, and recommends products that match these needs. The current alternatives to this are physically traveling to a store or examining jargon-filled online reviews, both of which are tedious, untrustworthy, and generally unattractive op-tions. Many existing recommendation systems do not pro-vide users with adequate descriptions of how recommenda-tions were computed. Others provide recommendations that are not sufficiently (a) trustworthy, (b) accurate, or (c) tai-lored to the individual customer. ElectricDeel is a scalable, extensible platform for providing accurate product recommendations through a user interface that instills trust in the user. The system is also sufficiently modular to allow future updates, enhancements, and prod-uct additions. The web application asks the user a series of simple english questions and passes the answers to a rec-ommendation system that uses these answers to compute a ranking for a set of relevant products. Each of the ranked products is presented along with a link to the online retailer that sells the product at the lowest price. Product data is collected using a distributed <b>web</b> <b>crawler</b> and <b>processed</b> in parallel using Hadoop MapReduce [20][6]. 1...|$|R

40|$|Information {{retrieval}} {{research on}} WWW revealed {{that more than}} 30 % of the web consists of duplicate pages. Mirroring, the systematic replication of content over a pair of hosts, was identified as the principal cause of duplication. Finding mirror sites could help search engines and caching proxies work more efficiently. This project introduces a technique for detecting mirrored hosts from large sets of collected URLs. The syntactic analysis of URL strings is utilized to locate possible mirror host pairs. Only {{a small number of}} pages are retrieved from each host and content analysis is performed to compute their similarity scores that will be used to determine the mirroring classification. The project is composed of a <b>web</b> <b>crawler,</b> mirror-host detecting <b>processes,</b> and a database system. A JSWDK server that supports Servlets and JSP is used for the implementation of this project. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methods are able to detect both partial and total mirroring, and handle cases where the content is not byte-wise identical. This technique could be used by other applications because of its computational efficiency and robustness. 3 TABLE OF CONTENTS...|$|R
