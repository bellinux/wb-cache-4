40|$|Abstraet [...] Vermicular glaucony grains {{observed}} by {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) show three irregularly alternating zones. Zone A has {{a high degree of}} linear orientation, no void space, and relatively defect-free lattice-fringe images. <b>Zone</b> <b>B</b> has an amalgamated bundle texture with a sub-parallel, inear orientation of bundles {{to each other and to}} <b>zone</b> A. <b>Zone</b> <b>B</b> has little or no void space, and lattice images appear to be a combination of those typical of zone C with minor amounts of modified zone A forms. Zone C has a randomly oriented, curved, and circular or semicircular bundle texture. In addition, zone C has much void space and curvilinear and linear lattice-fringe images with numerous defects, including edge dislocations. Such morphologic and crystallographic characteristics indicate that <b>zones</b> <b>B</b> and C probably comprise the glauconitic minerals of the vermicular glaucony grains, and that zone A comprises non-glauconitic micaceous minerals of higher structural order. <b>Zone</b> <b>B</b> is sharply demarcated from <b>zone</b> A, but <b>B</b> <b>zone</b> bundle textures merge gradationally to those of zone C. These spatial relationships suggest that <b>zone</b> <b>B</b> forms first on the surface of zone A. Sub-parallel orientation i the <b>B</b> <b>zone</b> could be produced by initial confinement between adjacent A zones. Once constraints change or are removed, the randomly oriented, curved, and semicircular or circular bundles of zone C develop.

40|$|AbstractWe {{found that}} Msx 2 -interacting nuclear target protein (MINT) competed with the {{intracellular}} region of Notch for binding to a DNA binding protein RBP-J and suppressed the transactivation activity of Notch signaling. Although MINT null mutant mice were embryonic lethal, MINT-deficient splenic B cells differentiated {{about three times}} more efficiently into marginal <b>zone</b> <b>B</b> cells with a concomitant reduction of follicular B cells. MINT is expressed in a cell-specific manner: high in follicular B cells and low in marginal <b>zone</b> <b>B</b> cells. Since Notch signaling directs differentiation of marginal <b>zone</b> <b>B</b> lymphocytes and suppresses that of follicular B lymphocytes in mouse spleen, {{the results indicate that}} high levels of MINT negatively regulate Notch signaling and block differentiation of precursor B cells into marginal <b>zone</b> <b>B</b> cells. MINT may serve as a functional homolog of Drosophila Hairless...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{results for the}} Reference-case model (when the updated and {{extrapolated}} “old” CPUE series {{is used in the}} model fitting procedure) that were requested as well as results for two sensitivity tests. Details of the Reference-case model are provided in Brandão and Butterworth (2009). The Reference-case model using the stratified <b>Zone</b> <b>B</b> FIAS series estimates a pristine spawning biomass, sp B 0 (in tonnes) of 10 069, 5 917, 7 465 and 10 567 for <b>Zones</b> A, <b>B,</b> C and D respectively. Under the revised policing efficiency, these values are 18 785, 6 008, 7 419 and 9 024. The 2010 (inshore+offshore) spawning biomasses of abalone in <b>Zones</b> A, <b>B,</b> C and D are estimated at ca. 29 %, 25 %, 6 % and 11 % respectively of their pre-exploitation levels for the sensitivity test that uses the stratified <b>Zone</b> <b>B</b> FIAS series and at ca. 36 %, 29 %, 6 % and 16 % if the revised policing efficiency trends are used. In essence use of the stratified <b>Zone</b> <b>B</b> FIAS series has little effect on results; however for the revised policing efficiency the estimates for the current status of Zone A particularly, and also <b>Zones</b> <b>B</b> and D, are improved...|$|R
