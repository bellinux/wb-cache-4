5|$|On April 1, 2013, reports {{surfaced}} {{that there}} will be a third G.I. Joe film, and it will likely be in 3D. The studio announced that Chu will return to direct the third film. While at the 2013 San Diego Comic Con, Chu talked about bringing Scarlett back in the next film. The writers of the second film are also thinking about bringing back the Baroness in the sequel. Johnson is interested in returning as Roadblock for the sequel, and Park has talked about a possible return as Snake Eyes and also including his pet wolf Timber. Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura has stated he is open to doing a G.I. Joe/Transformers crossover, which Chu stated that he would be interested in directing. Bonaventura told Beijing News that he hoped that Johnson and Willis would return, the script is still in the writing stage, and that they are considering adding a third important role. On September 10, 2013, Chu was confirmed to direct the film, along with writer Evan Daugherty (Snow White and the Huntsman, Divergent, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) to pen the film's script. On December 5, 2013, Daugherty talked about writing the film's script and his feelings about Duke being killed, but Chu told MTV that Tatum may return as Duke in the sequel. On April 2, 2014, in an interview with Collider, Johnson believes that Chu may not return to direct, due to working on the live action Jem film, but they may find another director for the film. It was revealed that the third film will have a 2016 release date. On June 23, 2014, di Bonaventura told Collider in an interview that they're meeting with new directors and filming may start in early 2015. On July 1, 2014, Variety reported that Jonathan Lemkin <b>will</b> <b>write</b> the script for the film and will focus on Roadblock with Johnson returning. On February 5, 2015, Film Divider reported that the twins Tomax and Xamot and Matt Trakker from the TV series M.A.S.K. will be appearing.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple {{model of the}} decision to <b>write</b> a <b>will</b> prior to death and tests the implications of the model using data from Ireland prior to the advent of state provided old age support. The model assumes that individuals <b>write</b> <b>wills</b> in order to change the distribution of their assets from the distribution that would occur {{in the absence of a}} will and that individuals incur <b>will</b> <b>writing</b> costs. The model leads to the predictions that individuals whose desired distribution differs most dramatically from the default and those who face the lowest costs will be the most likely to <b>write</b> <b>wills.</b> A data set that matches individual Irish estate records from 1901 to 1905 to household records from the 1901 Irish Census is used to test these implications. I find that age, wealth, and landholding influence <b>will</b> <b>writing.</b> I also find that individuals, particularly women and non-landholders, who appear to be dependent on others in old age are more likely to <b>write</b> <b>wills.</b> This result suggests that will writers may be <b>writing</b> <b>wills</b> in order to repay the relatives who provided for them in old age and is consistent with a strategic bequest motive. The data provide little evidence that the characteristics of potential beneficiaries influence the <b>will</b> <b>writing</b> decision. In contrast to studies using modern data that find little evidence of altruistic or strategic bequest motives, I find some evidence that exchange motives partly governed the <b>will</b> <b>writing</b> decision.
