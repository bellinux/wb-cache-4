We characterize equilibria in which there <b>is</b> no <b>trade,</b> there <b>is</b> goods <b>trade</b> only, there <b>is</b> factor <b>trade</b> only, and there <b>is</b> <b>trade</b> in both goods and factors. This generalizes the Heckscher-Ohlin model to explain not only the direction of trade, but also the prior question of how goods and factors are partitioned to tradables and non-tradables.
