40|$|In most {{urban areas}} of United States, newly {{constructed}} buildings have {{to comply with}} building codes from the International Code Council (ICC) or from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). Windows are a crucial building component that affects a building?s heating and cooling energy. Currently, there are two <b>window</b> <b>modeling</b> methods, the Transmittance, Absorptance and Reflectance (TAR) method, and the Multi-Layer Window (MLW) method. MLW method is more accurate than the TAR method, because it includes improved equations that better represent the actual window properties. However, at present both building codes (i. e., ICC or ASHRAE) do not use the MLW method to <b>model</b> the <b>windows</b> in a building.

40|$|This lecture {{discusses}} {{a stream}} model called {{the first in}} first out (FIFO) model, which generalizes the sliding <b>window</b> <b>model</b> we are familiar with. In the FIFO model, we are looking at an unbounded stream of elements, and at any moment of time, are interested in only a set S of most recently received elements. This sounds similar to the sequence-based sliding <b>window</b> <b>model,</b> where S has a fixed size, because the arrival of a new element always implies the deletion of the oldest element in S. FIFO model, on the other hand, allows an arbitrary interleaving of insertions and deletions (namely, there can be any number, including 0, of insertions between two consecutive deletions). The only constraint is that elements must be deleted in the same order as they arrive, and hence the name FIFO. The size of S, which we denote as n, can therefore vary arbitrarily. The sequence-based sliding <b>window</b> <b>model</b> is apparently a special case of the FIFO model. The same is true for the time-based sliding <b>window</b> <b>model,</b> in which elements arrive {{at the end of every}} second 1, and expire (and hence, deleted) after t seconds, where t is a parameter. S includes all the elements that have not expired. Since there is no control on how many elements can arrive in a second, the size of S can fluctuate significantly. For elements that arrive at the same second, there is no relative ordering among them, but we can apply an arbitrary ordering (say, but their ids) t...|$|E

40|$|A sliding <b>windows</b> <b>model</b> is an {{important}} case of the streaming model, where only the most “recent ” elements remain active and the rest are discarded in a stream. The sliding <b>windows</b> <b>model</b> is important for many applications (see, e. g., Babcock, Babu, Datar, Motwani and Widom (PODS 02); and Datar, Gionis, Indyk and Motwani (SODA 02)). There are two equally important types of the sliding <b>windows</b> <b>model</b> – <b>windows</b> with fixed size, (e. g., where items arrive one at a time, and only the most recent n items remain active for some fixed parameter n), and bursty windows (e. g., where many items can arrive in “bursts ” at a single step and where only items from the last t steps remain active, again for some fixed parameter t). Random sampling is a fundamental tool for data streams, as numerous algorithms operate on the sampled data {{instead of on the}} entire stream. Effective sampling from sliding windows is a nontrivial problem, as elements eventually expire. In fact, the deletions are implicit; i. e., {{it is not possible to}} identify deleted elements without storing the entire window. The implicit nature of deletions on sliding windows does not allow the existing methods (even those that support explicit deletions, e. g., Cormode, Muthukrishnan and Rozenbaum (VLDB 05); Frahling, Indyk and Sohler (SOCG 05)) to be directly “translated ” to the sliding <b>windows</b> <b>model.</b> One trivial approach to overcoming the problem of implicit deletions is that of over-sampling. When k samples are required, the over-sampling method maintains k ′> k samples in the hope that at least k samples are not expired. The obvious disadvantages of this method are twofold: (a) It introduces additional costs and thus decreases th...|$|R

40|$|We {{compare the}} out-of-sample {{forecasting}} performance of volatility models using {{daily exchange rate}} for the KRW/USD {{during the period from}} 1992 to 2008. For various forecasting horizons, historical volatility models with a long memory tend to make more accurate forecasts. Especially, we carefully observe the difference between the EWMA and the GARCH(1, 1) model. Our empirical finding that the GARCH model puts too much weight on recent observations relative to those in the past is consistent with prior evidence showing that asset market volatility has a long memory, such as Ding and Granger (1996). The forecasting model with the lowest MSFE and VaR forecast error among the models we consider is the EWMA model in which the forecast volatility for the coming period is a weighted average of recent squared return with exponentially declining weights. In terms of forecast accuracy, it clearly dominates the widely accepted GARCH and rolling window GARCH models. We also present a multiple comparison of the out-of-sample forecasting performance of volatility using the stationary bootstrap of Politis and Romano (1994). We find that the White's reality check for the GARCH(1, 1) expanding <b>window</b> <b>model</b> and the FIGARCH(1, 1) expanding <b>window</b> <b>model</b> clearly reject the null hypothesis and there exists a better model than the two benchmark models.

The Hansen's report the same results. The GARCH(1, 1) expanding <b>window</b> <b>model</b> and the FIGARCH(1, 1) expanding <b>window</b> <b>model</b> are dominated by the best competing model in most of the forecasting horizons.

In this work, we study the efficiency factor that can be gained by approximating the window size. That is, we allow the algorithm to dynamically adjust the window size between W and W(1 +τ) where τ is a small positive parameter. For example, consider the basic summing problem of computing {{the sum of the}} last W elements in a stream whose items are integers in { 0, 1 [...] .,R}, where R=poly(W). While it is known that Ω(WR) bits are needed in the exact <b>window</b> <b>model,</b> we show that approximate windows allow an exponential space reduction for constant τ.

Additionally, for RWϵ additive approximations, we show an Ω(τ^- 11 +τ/ϵ+(W/ϵ)) lower bound [We also provide an optimal bound and algorithm for the τ<ϵ case. ].
