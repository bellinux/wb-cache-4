5|$|In Bakuriani, {{the street}} where Kumaritashvili's {{childhood}} home is located was renamed in his honour. Felix Loch of Germany, who {{won the gold medal}} in luge at the Vancouver Olympics, had his medal melted down and refashioned into two disks, etched <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of Kumaritashvili and the years of his birth and death, one of which he gave to Kumaritashvili's parents. In spite of several donations of money to the Kumaritashvili family, the tragedy was hard on them; twice in the years afterwards Dodo, who continued to fix a meal for Kumaritashvili every day, tried to kill herself, while David dealt with severe health problems resulting in multiple stays in hospital.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1615, however, {{it emerged}} that Overbury had been poisoned. He had died on 15 September 1613 in the Tower of London, {{where he had}} been placed at the King's request. Among those convicted of the murder were Frances and Robert Carr, the latter having been {{replaced}} as the king's favourite in the meantime by Villiers. James pardoned Frances and commuted Carr's sentence of death, eventually pardoning him in 1624. The implication of the King in such a scandal provoked much public and literary conjecture and irreparably tarnished James's court <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of corruption and depravity. The subsequent downfall of the Howards left Villiers unchallenged as the supreme figure in the government by 1619.|$|E

5|$|St Michael's Church survived {{until the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 when, {{except for the}} tower, it was demolished. The Tor was the place of {{execution}} where Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, was hanged, drawn and quartered along {{with two of his}} monks, John Thorne and Roger James. The three-storey tower of St Michael's Church survives. It has corner buttresses and perpendicular bell openings. There is a sculptured tablet <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of an eagle below the parapet.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{the summer}} of 1942 the TRE {{development}} team began experimenting with systems to project the display onto the windscreen, and by October had combined this <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of the existing GGS Mk.

5|$|To avoid violating Edison's patents, Biograph cameras from 1895 to 1902 used a large-format film {{measuring}} 2-23/32 inches (68mm) wide, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> area of 2 × 2½ inches, {{four times}} that of Edison's 35mm format. Biograph film was not ready-perforated; the camera itself punched a sprocket hole {{on each side of}} the frame as the film was exposed at 30 frames per second. Sherlock Holmes Baffled ran to 86.56 metres in length, giving the film a running time of 30 seconds (although in practice, due to the hand-cranked gearing of the Mutoscope this would have varied).|$|E

Aguilera then produces silhouettes of a catwoman style figure, until Aguilera as the catwoman character is shown, wearing a leather catsuit with cat ears, lighting bolts shoot from her hands until another scene featuring the same character shows her alongside a black motorbike holding a gun. Shots of both the blue haired character and catwoman lead to a scene featuring a blond Aguilera moving inside of the screens accompanied by multi-colored digital waves, before shots of the catwoman style character on a motorbike, shooting the gun are presented. Shots of the different scenes including one of Aguilera at the desk accompanied by a toy robot are shown finishing as Aguilera turns the screens off.|$|E

5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metal is {{characterized}} by aggressive, driving rhythms, amplified and distorted guitars, grandiose lyrics, and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal's origins lie in the hard rock bands who took blues and rock and created a heavy sound built on guitar and drums. Most of the pioneers in the field were British; the first major American bands came in the early 1970s, like Blue Öyster Cult, KISS, and Aerosmith. Heavy metal remained, however, a largely underground phenomenon. During the 1980s the first major pop-metal style arose and dominated the charts for several years kicked off by metal act Quiet Riot and dominated by bands such as Mötley Crüe and Ratt; this was glam metal, a hard rock and pop fusion with a raucous spirit and a glam-influenced visual aesthetic. Some of these bands, like Bon Jovi, became international stars. The band Guns N' Roses rose to fame {{near the end of}} the decade <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> that was a reaction against the glam metal aesthetic.|$|E
5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} coupled <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> plate detector. These {{have the}} advantage of being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} these {{religious}} developments on culture, literature, poetry and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of literature and poetry based on the teachings of these philosophers were written during the coming centuries. The Saluva, Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties of Vijayanagar empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of Ramanuja exists in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara. Scholars in the later Kingdom of Mysore wrote Vaishnavite works upholding the teachings of Ramanuja. King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism. The later saints of Madhvacharya's order, Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraja, Vadiraja Tirtha and devotees (dasa) such as Vijaya Dasa, Gopaladasa and others from the Karnataka region spread his teachings far and wide. His teachings inspired later philosophers like Vallabha in Gujarat and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in Bengal. Another wave of devotion (bhakti) in the 17th century–18th century found inspiration in his teachings.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} these {{religious}} developments on the culture, literature, and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of metaphysics and poetry based on the teachings of these philosophers were written over the next centuries. Akka Mahadevi, Allama Prabhu, {{and a host of}} Basavanna's followers, including Chenna Basava, Prabhudeva, Siddharama, and Kondaguli Kesiraja wrote hundreds of poems called Vachanas in praise of Lord Shiva. The esteemed scholars in the Hoysala court, Harihara and Raghavanka, were Virashaivas. This tradition continued into the Vijayanagar empire with such well-known scholars as Singiraja, Mallanarya, Lakkana Dandesa and other prolific writers of Virashaiva literature. The Saluva, Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties of the Vijayanagar empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of Ramanujacharya exists today in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara. Scholars in the succeeding Mysore Kingdom wrote Vaishnavite works supporting the teachings of Ramanujacharya. King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism.|$|E
5|$|The temple is {{surrounded}} by a tall stone boundary wall with minarets at each of the four corners, suggesting a Muslim influence on the architecture. A Muslim chieftain was patron of the temple at one time. The temple has four gates, each facing a cardinal direction and <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of Ganesha, each gate depicting him in the form that he appeared {{in each of the four}} ages (yugas). Each of the four Ganesha forms is associated with a Puruṣārtha (aim of life) and accompanied by two attendants. The image of Ballalvinayaka at the eastern gate, accompanied by god Rama (Vishnu's Avatar) and his consort Sita, symbolises Dharma (righteousness, duty, ethnics) and embodies the preserver-god Vishnu. Vignesha at the southern gate, flanked by Ganesha's parents Shiva and Parvati (Uma) symbolises Artha (wealth and fame) and embodies the dissolver – Shiva. Cintamani at the western gate – representing Kama (desire, love and sensual pleasure) – is attended by the love god Kamadeva and his wife Rati and embodies the formless (asat) Brahman. Mahaganapati at the northern gate standing for moksha (salvation), is accompanied by Varaha (Vishnu's boar avatar) and his wife the earth goddess Mahi embodies Sat Brahman.|$|E

30|$|Because {{there is}} no {{temporal}} information available, rain removal <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single <b>image</b> is more challenging than that <b>with</b> <b>a</b> video. In this paper, we present a weighted median guided filtering method for rain removal <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single <b>image.</b> It consists of two filtering operations. Firstly, a weighted median filter is convoluted <b>with</b> <b>an</b> input rainy <b>image</b> to obtain <b>a</b> coarse rain-free image; then, guided filter is employed to obtain <b>a</b> refined rain-free <b>image,</b> where the coarse rain-free image is used as <b>a</b> guided <b>image</b> and convoluted with the input rainy image via guided filter. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method generated comparable results to the state-of-the-art algorithms with low computation cost.|$|R
