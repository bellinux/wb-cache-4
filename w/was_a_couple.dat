Its length was increased by a few inches, and it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hundred pounds heavier, and had a more rounded roofline. Every body panel, save for the doors, was redesigned. However, many of the redesigned components closely resembled that of the previous generation, leading many to falsely believe that this generation is just a face-lift of the previous generation.|$|E

By 2000, the station began broadcasting via satellite {{at a cost}} that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of million dollars. The station was located in the predominantly Shi'a neighborhood of Haret Hreik in the southern suburbs of Beirut, where the Hezbollah is also headquartered. Originally, the station employed only a few men that had studied media in London during the mid-1980s. But almost a year later, Al-Manar was employing over 150 people.|$|E
25|$|Because of this view, the NAC board {{decided to}} hire a {{professional}} trainer. Englishman Ben Affleck {{was hired as a}} coach and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of months later succeeded by James Moore. When Moore resigned, the NAC board issued a committee, who would select the best 11 NAC players to play a match. In 1931 Antoon Verlegh retired from football. Verlegh, nowadays a club icon for NAC, played for NAC since its foundation. In this year, NAC also had a dispute with the City of Breda. The stadium’s terrain ‘t Ploegske was zoned as a residential area and NAC had to leave these grounds. Because no other option was available in Breda, NAC were forced to move to the town Princenhage. Within two months a complete new stadium, with a capacity of 5,500 people, was built and NAC left Breda. In 1935 NAC was also the first club in the Netherlands to travel by airplane to an away match against GVAV.|$|E

[...] He {{finished}} his rookie season with 16goals and 34points, good for fourth place in team scoring. The Hawks subsequently signed Bourque to a two-year contract extension. He endured an injury-plagued season in 2006–07, appearing in only 44games and scoring 7goals. He was rushed to hospital during a November 12, 2006, game against the Columbus Blue Jackets after suffering a deep cut to the neck from Nikolai Zherdev's skate during a scrum in the crease. The Blackhawks {{announced that he would}} miss 3–6 weeks following surgery to repair the laceration. Bourque considered himself fortunate that the injury was not worse, stating upon his return to action four weeks later that he might not have survived if the cut <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of millimetres deeper.|$|E

2500|$|The entire {{album was}} {{recorded}} in secrecy from the music industry, critics, and fans of the band. Stump recalled: [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> times there was paparazzi that got us outside and didn't put two and two together". The decision to keep recording a secret was partially so that the group members had the option to not make the record if the sessions did not work out. Keeping the secret was difficult, especially for a group so visible on social media; Hurley stayed away from Twitter, and all members got {{as far away from}} one another in public as possible. Rumors began to swirl in late 2012 after a friend of the band tweeted that the band {{was in the process of}} recording new material, though each member of the band was quick to deny any chance of a reunion. The band remained tight-lipped until the very end; when the Chicago Tribune asked Wentz a week prior to the announcement whether a Fall Out Boy reunion was happening, he replied: [...] "It's not." [...] Plans nearly went sideways when Wentz went to dinner with rapper 2 Chainz to discuss plans for the [...] "My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)" [...] video. Following the conversation, 2 Chainz posted to Instagram a photo of Wentz and himself with the caption [...] "Fall Out Boyz feat. 2 Chainz?" [...] To the members of Fall Out Boy's surprise and relief, fans of the band denied the possibility, finding the idea too absurd. Stump recalls he wrote [...] "somewhere near 25%" [...] of the lyrics, the most since on Take This to Your Grave.|$|E

In an interview with hiphopdx.com Raekwon, who also appears on the album, responded saying: [...] "He [...] know damn well he [...] ain’t write that fuckin’ album. I don’t even wanna get into shit like that, because {{it just makes me}} upset that muthafuckas be running they mouth all kinda ways.
