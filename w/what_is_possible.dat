5|$|Zobel and Carson {{helped to}} {{establish}} the nature of noise in electric circuits, concluding that—contrary to mainstream belief—it is not even theoretically possible to filter out noise entirely and that noise {{will always be a}} limiting factor in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> to transmit. Thus, they anticipated the later work of Claude Shannon, who showed how the theoretical information rate of a channel is related to the noise of the channel.|$|E

25|$|The {{high demand}} for {{low-cost}} sequencing has driven {{the development of}} high-throughput sequencing technologies that parallelize the sequencing process, producing thousands or millions of sequences at once. High-throughput sequencing is intended to {{lower the cost of}} DNA sequencing beyond <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> with standard dye-terminator methods. In ultra-high-throughput sequencing, as many as 500,000 sequencing-by-synthesis operations may be run in parallel.|$|E

25|$|Journalists responded skeptically to McCloud's {{idea of the}} {{infinite}} canvas, as five years after Reinventing Comics, the concept had not taken off in large proportions yet.

Various webcomic creators have experimented with {{the infinite}} canvas, however, and extending comics to beyond <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> in print has gained some popularity over the years.|$|E

25|$|Transcriptomics {{has been}} characterised by the {{development}} of new techniques which have redefined <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> every decade or so and render previous technologies obsolete. The first attempt at capturing a partial human transcriptome was published in 1991 and reported 609 mRNA sequences from the human brain. In 2008, two human transcriptomes, composed of millions of transcript-derived sequences covering 16,000 genes, were published and, by 2015, transcriptomes had been published for hundreds of individuals. Transcriptomes of different disease states, tissues or even single cells are now routinely generated. This explosion in transcriptomics has been driven by the rapid development of new technologies with improved sensitivity and economy.|$|E

Scuba has limitations of breathing gas supply, communications between diver and surface are problematic, {{the location of the}} diver may be difficult to monitor, and it is considered a higher-risk mode of diving in most circumstances. Scuba is specifically forbidden for some professional applications. Decompression is often avoided, and if necessary, is generally in-water, but may use a variety of gases.|$|E
25|$|A {{first case}} in which {{seemingly}} unrelated mathematical questions were studied {{with the help of}} permutations occurred around 1770, when Joseph Louis Lagrange, in the study of polynomial equations, observed that properties of the permutations of the roots of an equation are related to the possibilities to solve it. This line of work ultimately resulted, through the work of Évariste Galois, in Galois theory, which gives a complete description of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> and impossible with respect to solving polynomial equations (in one unknown) by radicals. In modern mathematics there are many similar situations in which understanding a problem requires studying certain permutations related to it.|$|E
25|$|In September 2014, Square Enix {{announced}} {{the establishment of}} Shinra Technologies, an autonomous subsidiary offering cloud-based gaming services. Wada, the founder of Shinra Technologies serves as its President.

He also said that their cloud-based gaming service would utilise supercomputers which will allow developers to create games of a higher quality than <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> for modern consoles and personal computers. On May 11, 2015; Metaps, an application analysis and marketing company announced that Wada had joined their company as an outside director.|$|E
40|$|The {{truth of}} {{determinism}} <b>is</b> determined by <b>what</b> <b>is</b> physically <b>possible,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> physically <b>possible</b> <b>is</b> determined by physical laws, and yet physical laws don’t determine whether determinism is true. The {{first of these}} claims follows from definition. The second {{is the essence of}} the received view of physical possibility. The third reflects on a split in our understanding of this received view. We point out that philosophers unwittingly state two different formulations of how physical laws determine <b>what</b> <b>is</b> physically <b>possible.</b> It may <b>be</b> the case that determinism fails under one formulation but reigns under the other. Whether this is so depends on our view on the nature of laws {{as well as on the}} inter-theoretical relationships among our best physical theo- ries, or so shall we argue. A more honest unpacking of our tongue-in-cheek would be thus: there are different formulations of how physical laws determine <b>what</b> <b>is</b> physically <b>possible</b> and the fate of determinism may depend on the formulation we choose...|$|R

500|$|The Clash's politicised lyrics, musical experimentation, and rebellious {{attitude}} had a far-reaching {{influence on}} rock, and alternative rock in particular. They became widely {{referred to as}} [...] "The Only Band That Matters", originally a promotional slogan introduced by the group's record label, CBS. In January 2003, shortly {{after the death of}} Joe Strummer, the band—including original drummer Terry Chimes—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked the Clash number 28 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Critic Sean Egan wrote that the Clash were exceptional because:They were a group whose music was, and is, special to their audience because that music insisted on addressing the conditions of poverty, petty injustice, and mundane life experienced by the people who bought their records. Moreover, although their rebel stances were often no more than posturing, from the Clash's stubborn principles came a fundamental change in the perception of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> in the music industry, from subject matter to authenticity to quality control to price ceilings.|$|E
2500|$|Ernst von Glasersfeld was a {{prominent}} proponent of radical constructivism. This claims that knowledge is not a commodity which is transported from one mind into another. Rather, {{it is up to}} the individual to [...] "link up" [...] specific interpretations of experiences and ideas with their own reference of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> and viable. That is, the process of constructing knowledge, of understanding, is dependent on the individual's subjective interpretation of their active experience, not what [...] "actually" [...] occurs. Understanding and acting are seen by radical constructivists not as dualistic processes, but [...] "circularly conjoined".|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, {{when asked}} if there was any figure in popular culture who aroused {{interest}} in poetry and lyrics, Heaney praised American rap artist Eminem from Detroit, saying, [...] "He has created a sense of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible.</b> He has sent a voltage around a generation. He has done this not just through his subversive attitude but also his verbal energy." [...] Heaney wrote the poem [...] "Beacons at Bealtaine" [...] to mark the 2004 EU Enlargement. He read the poem at a ceremony for the 25 leaders of the enlarged European Union, arranged by the Irish EU presidency.|$|E

He explains, [...] "when you're that age, you sometimes have a great burning enthusiasm that is very deep and very narrow, {{and that is something that}} has always intrigued me - that world of the 11-year-old that is so quickly lost."

2500|$|The High Point Market {{has been}} noted for being a {{significant}} part of the region's larger furniture [...] "cluster", which was discussed most recently by sociologist Richard Florida and initially by economist Michael Porter. [...] The Market and its effects on the city have also been the focus of an extensive case study by urban sociologist John Joe Schlichtman. In this research, High Point's ability to capture the global furniture merchandising market is said to signal a new era in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> for small cities. Along these lines, Schlichtman terms High Point a [...] "Niche City", which is [...] "a city that forges global centrality by creating an economic specialization in a specific segment of the global service economy." [...] In 2005, High Point adopted [...] "North Carolina's International City" [...] as its official slogan, emphasizing the role of international business and especially the High Point Market (formerly called the International Home Furnishings Market), the largest furnishings industry trade fair in the world.|$|E
