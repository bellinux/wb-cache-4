After Gaveston returned, his behaviour became even more offensive, and opposition towards him grew. In addition to this, there was great discontent with Edward II's failure to follow up his father's Scottish campaigns. On 16 March 1310, the king had to agree to the appointment of a committee known as the Lords Ordainers, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> {{be in charge of the}} reform of the royal government.

At the heart of the deteriorating situation was the peers' opinion of Edward II's relationship with Piers Gaveston, and his reputedly outrageous behavior. On 16 March 1310, the king agreed to the appointment of Ordainers, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> {{be in charge of the}} reform of the royal household.
