The fuel in a coal-fired power plant is stored in silos, bunkers or stock piles. Coal is stored in silos in a small plant, Bunkers for handling a day’s operation and Stock piling methods for large plants. So, fuel handling had to done efficiently. To accurately sense the coal height, Real-time feedback is deployed within the bunker or stock pile. The real time range information is then fedback to the control system. Of the different types of ranging sensors, radar based system is used. Also a real-time temperature monitoring system is developed to protect the coal. The range and temperature data from sensors are sent to the main system through GSM modem by means of SMS. The range information is used to start the conveyor belt to draw the coal from coal yard. If the temperature exceeds the limit, the SMS will be sent through the software or it will call the respective person to monitor the process.

40|$|Evaporative cooling by <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> is {{increasingly}} {{used as an}} efficient and environmentally-friendly approach to enhance thermal comfort in built environments. The complex two-phase flow in a <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> is influenced by many factors such as continuous phase velocity, temperature and relative humidity patterns, droplet characteristics and continuous phase-droplet and droplet-droplet interactions. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be a valuable tool for assessing the potential and performance of evaporative cooling by <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> <b>systems</b> in outdoor and indoor urban environments. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of the Lagrangian-Eulerian approach for evaporative cooling provided {{by the use of}} a <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> with a hollow-cone nozzle configuration. The evaluation is based on grid-sensitivity analysis and validated using wind-tunnel measurements. This paper also presents a sensitivity analysis focused on the impact of the turbulence model for the continuous phase, the drag coefficient model, the number of particle streams for the discrete phase and the nozzle spray angle. The results show that CFD simulation of evaporation by the Lagrangian- Eulerian (3 D steady RANS) approach, in spite of its limitations, can accurately predict the evaporation process, with local deviations from the wind-tunnel measurements within 10 % for dry bulb temperature, 5 % for wet bulb temperature and 7 % for the specific enthalpy. The average deviations for all three variables are less than 3 % in absolute values.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In a {{conventional}} down-draft evaporative cool tower (DECT), dry ambient air is drawn {{in at the}} top and cooler moist air is delivered at the bottom. Most of the cooling occurs near the inlet, where water is introduced and air temperature approaches the wet bulb. A novel DECT was developed which incorporates a secondary air inlet and complex longitudinal section that comprises two partly overlapping cones. The complex section and the addition of a secondary air intake near the middle required a sophisticated <b>water</b> <b>spraying</b> <b>system.</b> In addition to maximizing the cooling potential, the spraying system was designed to limit spray drift beyond the base of the tower, to reduce maintenance costs (especially due to clogging of the sprayers) and to minimize pumping energy. Analysis shows that maximum cooling may be obtained either by employing a very fine spray, requiring the introduction of a relatively small volume of water, or by spraying a larger volume of coarser drops. However, spraying fine drops requires more pumping power, finer nozzles are more likely to clog and small drops of water aggravate the problem of drift near the tower base. If full evaporation of the water spray is not required and excess water is collected for reuse, the second option is thus preferable. In addition to the theoretical analysis, the paper presents experimental findings on temperature reduction, water consumption and cooling output of an 8 -meter high prototype tower constructed a...|$|E
40|$|Despite government’s {{repeated}} assertions for {{the sustainable}} mining extraction {{and development of}} rural and tribal communities living near the vicinity of mining areas, these have not been converted into implementable solutions. The natural resources from rural and tribal areas are being exploited to meet the ever-increasing requirements and aspirations of the affluent groups. With the above background, this article, taking both experimental and control villages into account, tried to explore the impact of coal mining on local environment. Although dealing with local environment, it has mostly focused on sociological impact of mining in air, water, and noise pollution. The data collected show that the suspended particulate matter concentration is alarmingly high in few sampling locations, whereas respirable suspended particulate matter concentration which once used to be within acceptable limits is now gradually approaching its standard acceptable value of 300 [*]µg/m 3. Along with uncovered coal transportation, lack of <b>water</b> <b>spraying</b> <b>system</b> and movement of heavy vehicles have brought an addition to air pollution to the locality.
