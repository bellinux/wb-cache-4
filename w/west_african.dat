2500|$|In the {{southern}} United States in the 1800s, geophagia {{was a common}} practice among the slave population. Geophagia {{is a form of}} pica in which the person consumes earthly substances such as clay, and is particularly prevalent to augment a mineral-deficient diet. [...] Noteworthy is the fact that Kaolin was consumed by <b>west</b> <b>Africans</b> enslaved in the South-eastern United States, particularly the Georgia belt, due to the anti-diarrheal qualities in the treatment of dysentery and other abdominal ailments. The practice of consuming Kaolin rocks was thereafter studied scientifically, the results of which led to the subsequent pharmaceutical commercialization of Kaolinite, the clay mineral contained in Kaolin. Kaolinite became the active ingredient in drugs like Kaopectate and Pepto-Bismol, although the formulations have since found additional active ingredients to replace Kaolinite.|$|R

The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the United States Senate dining room added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator Allen Ellender.

In the late 1900s and early 2000s, however, fried chicken has been mass-produced and the price of the dish has gone down significantly.|$|E
