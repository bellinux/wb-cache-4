For why may not God be merciful, and why may not God be just? And since he can be both merciful and just in the salvation of sinners, why may he not also save them from death and hell? Christ is God's salvation, and {{to show that he}} is not ashamed of him, he hath presented him, and the way of redemption by him, before the face of all people (Luke 2:30-32). Nor is the Son, who is become, with respect to the act of redemption, the author of eternal salvation, ashamed of this his doings. 'I gave my back to the smiters,' saith he, 'and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and smiting' (Isa 50:6). This he speaks to show <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his sufferings when he engaged in the work of our redemption, and how heartily he did bear and go through them. 'For,' says he, 'the Lord God will help me,' that is, justify me in it, 'therefore shall I not be confounded, therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed' (v 7). And if God, and his Son Jesus Christ, are neither of them ashamed to own this way of salvation, why should the sinners concerned thereabout be afraid thereupon to venture their soul? I know, saith he, 'I shall not be ashamed'; I shall not, that is, when all things come to light, and everything shall appear above board; when {{the heart and soul of}} this undertaking of mine shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops, I know I shall not be ashamed.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{physiologic}} and endocrinologic {{basis of}} fetal {{development is a}} major goal of perinatal biology. During the past decade a number of technological developments have allowed more precise evaluation of the fetus in utero and diagnosis of abnormalities. Despite these methodological achievements, however, there are no specific biological markers currently available to indicate that exposure to a given xenobiotic {{is associated with a}} cellular, subcellular, or pharmacodynamic event. This paper evaluates the following issues: <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the unique physiologic and endocrinologic features of the fetal milieu interieur? <b>What</b> problems <b>are</b> peculiar to fetal assessment?

[...] She additionally commented positively on Kinney's acting, saying it was: [...] "...the strongest acting we've seen from Emily Kinney, particularly in that final exchange on the porch." [...] Kinney said that the show was never clear on whether Beth and Daryl had a romantic or brother-sisterly connection, but that [...] "it was a situation where they were getting to know each other.

Thousands of clinicians were displaced, and some—like their patients—were forced to relocate permanently to other areas of the country.

Books of fantasy and adventure, the colorful stories of 1001 Arabian Nights, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, and the novels of the eighteenth-century authors Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding entertained and comforted the young boy.

All three groups were convenience samples who answered a two part questionnaire that was given in English, Spanish or Romanian, depending on the sample. The overriding question was whether citizens in countries that have different environmental experiences perceive threats to the biosphere differently and teach about different environmental problems/threats in science classes if at all. Five specific research questions were addressed including the following two: 1) <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> technological and environmental problems and or threats that were discussed in the 2002 Johannesburg Earth Summit? 2) Can you describe any reasons why you do or do not teach about environmental and technological problems and or threats in your science classes? The results indicated considerable differences in the three nationalities perceptions of and understanding of threats to the biosphere. Perhaps the most important conclusions were: First, perceptions of environmental threats are based {{to a large degree}} on citizens personal experiences with the threat/s in the environment in which they live even when those threats {{may not be the most}} urgent global threats; and second, if all citizens, no matter where they live, are to become better informed about global threats to the biosphere faced by the world as a whole, there must be a common global science curriculum that addresses these threats...|$|E
