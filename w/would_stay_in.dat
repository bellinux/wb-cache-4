5|$|The 2011 {{declaration}} by Russia that it <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> DST {{all year}} long was subsequently followed by a similar declaration from Belarus. Russia's plan generated widespread complaints due to the dark of wintertime morning, and thus was abandoned in 2014. The country changed its clocks to Standard Time on October 26, 2014 and intends to stay there permanently.|$|E
5|$|However, the Cabildo {{appointed}} a Junta headed by Cisneros, who <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> power, even if {{under a new}} office. Saavedra was appointed to this Junta, as well as Castelli and two peninsulars. They made the oath of office, but the Junta was received with strong popular unrest, as it was perceived as going contrary to {{the result of the}} open cabildo. By the night, Saavedra and Castelli resigned, convincing Cisneros to do the same.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Alive or Just Breathing, Leach left the band for {{personal}} and health issues. Killswitch Engage quickly recruited Howard Jones to replace Leach. Jones <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the band for nearly ten years, until his departure in 2012, which prompted Leach to rejoin the band on the ten-year anniversary of Alive or Just Breathing. This is also the last album to feature Dutkiewicz on drums, as he would switch to guitar before the touring process. The drumming position was filled by Tom Gomes.|$|E

5|$|When the live-action of the manga was made, Watsuki {{had several}} ideas about Kenshin's mind about his early {{appearances}} in the series. This resulted in the manga reboot Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration where Kenshin's characterization was expanded by the author who thought in retrospective about what he could add to him. Although there were some changes to the cast, Watsuki {{wanted them to be}} subtle such as Kenshin wearing a scarf. He also wrote a prequel chapter to the original series which helped the readers to understand why Kenshin <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Kaoru's dojo.|$|E
5|$|Another {{tradition}} {{says that}} the Black Stone was originally an angel that had been placed by God in the Garden of Eden to guard Adam. The angel was absent when Adam ate the forbidden fruit and was punished by being turned into a jewel — the Black Stone. God granted it the power of speech and placed it {{at the top of}} Abu Qubays, a mountain in the historic region of Khurasan, before moving the mountain to Mecca. When Ibrahim took the Black Stone from Abu Qubays to build the Kaaba, the mountain asked Ibrahim to intercede with God so {{that it would not be}} returned to Khurasan and <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Mecca.|$|E
5|$|By late May, {{the brigade}} {{was back at}} ANZAC Cove and in reserve. On 1 June, the Wellington Battalion moved into the front lines, taking over Courtney's Post, {{previously}} held by the Australian 4th Brigade. Malone was post commander, and it was planned that he <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> command at Courtney's Post while his battalion rotated with the Otago Infantry Battalion in eight-day spells. He immediately set about improving the position, which overlooked the Turkish lines. As well as rectifying the position's neglected field works, he established a squad of snipers and this proved instrumental in gaining ascendency over the Turks in no-man's land.|$|E

Later in the week, defensive leaders Tony Washington (RJr.) and Derrick Malone (Jr.) announced that they too <b>would</b> be <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> Eugene to finish their education.|$|R
5|$|In {{denial about}} the dire situation, Hitler placed his hopes on the units {{commanded}} by Waffen-SS General Felix Steiner, the Armeeabteilung Steiner ("Army Detachment Steiner"). On 21 April, Hitler ordered Steiner {{to attack the}} northern flank of the encircling Soviet salient and ordered the German Ninth Army, south-east of Berlin, to attack northward in a pincer attack. By that evening, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of Berlin. At his afternoon situation conference on 22 April, Hitler was told Steiner's forces had not moved. Hitler fell into a tearful rage when he realised that the attack {{was not going to}} be carried out. He openly declared for the first time the war was lost—and blamed his generals. He announced he <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.|$|E
5|$|Maria Komnene {{conducted}} the negotiations for {{the marriage of}} Alice to Hugh I of Cyprus, Aimery of Lusignan's eldest surviving son and successor, {{in accordance with the}} agreement their fathers had reached. Since the marriage of Alice's mother and Hugh I's father made them step-sister and step-brother, a special dispensation was needed. This was granted by Pope Innocent III. Blanche of Navarre supplied Alice's dowry as she sought to ensure that Alice <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Cyprus rather than attempting to lay claim to Champagne and Brie. To strengthen her son's position, Blanche also persuaded Philip II of France in 1209 to promise that he would not allow anyone to challenge Theobald IV's right to the two counties before Theobald reached the age of majority.|$|E
5|$|Tyresö {{announced}} in August 2013 {{that they had}} agreed a deal to re-sign Engen {{at the end of}} her Liverpool contract. She was expected to move back to Sweden in late September or early October and would be available to play for Tyresö in their UEFA Women's Champions League games. Engen, former UNC teammate Ashlyn Haris, and Ali Krieger all signed short term contracts with the team. They joined United States national team members Christen Press and Meghan Klingenberg, who were already with the club on long-term contracts. In December 2013, Tyresö revealed that Engen had extended her contract and <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Sweden until June 2014 in orto pursue Champions League glory along with Press and Klingenberg.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} 1st Special Service Brigade, No.4 Commando {{took part}} in the Normandy Landings in June 1944. Landing on Sword beach 30 minutes before the rest of the brigade, their first {{objectives}} were to capture a strong point and gun battery in Ouistreham. After the commandos eliminated these positions they rejoined the brigade, reinforcing the 6th Airborne Division at the Orne bridges. Before the invasion the brigade had been informed that they <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> France for only a few days. The commando remained there for a further 82 days, protecting the beachhead's left flank. During that period, No.4 Commando endured over 50 percent casualties. Finally withdrawn to Britain in September 1944, they were reassigned to the 4th Special Service Brigade for the assault on Walcheren island. At {{the end of the war}} No.4 Commando became part of the occupation force in Germany, but together with all other army commando units were disbanded in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Defender Keith Lowe, of Cheltenham, and goalkeeper Nick Pope, of Charlton Athletic, {{were signed}} on loan until January 2014. They both played in York's first league defeat in four weeks, 2–1 away, to Southend United. Kevan Hurst gave Southend the lead early into the match and Bowman {{equalised}} for York {{with a low}} strike during the second half, before Luke Prosser scored the winning goal for the home team in stoppage time. With Pope preferred in goal, Kettings returned to Blackpool on his own accord, although his loan agreement <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> place until January 2014. York then drew 0–0 away to Morecambe. After Pope was recalled from his loan by Charlton, York signed Wolverhampton Wanderers goalkeeper Aaron McCarey on loan until January 2014. McCarey kept a clean sheet in York's 0–0 home draw with Rochdale.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson again moved on, {{this time}} {{accepting}} the player-manager role {{with the new}} Troy Trojans team who began {{their time in the}} National League in 1879, and <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> that role until the team folded after the 1882 season. In 1883, he became the first manager {{in the history of the}} Philadelphia Phillies franchise, which was known at the time as the Quakers, but was relieved of command when the team won only four of its first 17games. On August 21 of that season, his Quakers traveled to Providence, Rhode Island to play the Grays. To increase ticket sales, he gave the day's pitching duty to Rhode Island native Art Hagan in hopes that Hagan's appearance would attract more locals to come watch the game. The strategy worked, but Hagen surrendered 28 runs and the Quakers made 20 errors behind him and did not score a run. Financially sound decision as it was, a bad decision for public relations as Ferguson was labeled a sadist for not relieving Hagen.|$|E

5|$|However, {{this power}} allowed Leiva {{to perform a}} {{maneuver}} that Castelli had not anticipated. Although he approved the end of Cisneros' rule as viceroy, Leiva formed a Junta with Cisneros as its president; Cisneros <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> power. The {{other members of the}} Junta would have been two peninsulars, the priest Juan Nepomuceno Solá and the merchant José Santos Inchaurregui, and two criollos, Saavedra and Castelli. The bulk of the natives rejected the proposal: they did not accept that Cisneros should remain in power, even under a different title. They were suspicious of the intentions of Saavedra, and believed that with Castelli alone in the Junta, little or nothing could be achieved. Castelli and Saavedra resigned that same day to put pressure on Cisneros and force him to resign, and the Junta never came into power.|$|E
5|$|The Reactionary Party (the former {{dissident}} conservative {{elements within}} the Moderate Party) began by passing the Interpretation of the Additional Act, which {{was followed by the}} reform of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Both laws, built upon the 1834 Additional Act, would allow the national government to reassert its control over provincial police and courts. They would provide the means to deal effectively with provincial rebellions and inevitably grant the national government greater sway over the provincial governments. In turn, the party in power would gain greater ascendancy in national politics through patronage and office appointments. Fearful that their adversaries <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> power indefinitely, the Liberals began to call for PedroII to attain majority at a younger age. They hoped to regain their influence by doing away with the regency and dealing directly with a pliable young emperor. Towards that end, the Liberals allied themselves with the Facção Áulica (Courtier Faction), led by Aureliano Coutinho (Feijó's ally in the 1832 coup attempt).|$|E
5|$|In February 1905, {{the federal}} {{government}} of Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier introduced legislation to create two new provinces—Alberta and Saskatchewan—from the Northwest Territories. Though Haultain wanted the new provinces to be governed on the same non-partisan basis as the Territories had been, {{it was expected that}} the Liberal Laurier would recommend a Liberal to serve as Lieutenant-Governor, and it was further assumed that the Lieutenant-Governor would call on a Liberal to form the new province's first government. Oliver was the province's most prominent Liberal, but had just been named federal Minister of the Interior, and was not interested in leaving Ottawa. Talbot was Laurier's preferred candidate, but he expected to be appointed to the Senate and found the prospect more congenial than serving as Premier of Alberta. Both men supported Rutherford, though neither was enthusiastic about doing so. In August, Bulyea was appointed Alberta's first Lieutenant-Governor and later that month the Alberta Liberals selected Rutherford as their first leader. A final barrier was removed a few days later when Haultain, who was a Conservative federally but who was thought to be a potential leader of a coalition government, announced that he <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Regina to lead the Saskatchewan Conservatives. On September 2, Bulyea asked Rutherford to form the first government of Alberta.|$|E
