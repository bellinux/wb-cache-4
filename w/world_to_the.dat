5|$|After 1492, {{a global}} {{exchange}} of previously local {{crops and livestock}} breeds occurred. Maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc were the key crops that spread from the New <b>World</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and turnips traveled from the Old <b>World</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on many cultures. Maize and cassava were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.|$|E
5|$|Link {{can travel}} from the Dark <b>World</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Light World {{at almost any}} outside {{location}} by using the Magic Mirror, and can travel back to the Dark World again from the same location using a temporary portal left behind on the map {{at the point where}} he reappears in the Light World. Otherwise, Link must use hidden warp locations throughout the Light World to travel from the Light <b>World</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dark World. Travel between worlds allows for puzzles in A Link to the Past that exploit structural differences between the Light and Dark Worlds, as Link may travel to otherwise inaccessible areas in one world by warping from parallel but accessible locations in the other world.|$|E
5|$|Beat 'em up games usually employ vigilante crime {{fighting}} and revenge plots with the action {{taking place on}} city streets, though historical and fantasy themed games also exist. Players must walk {{from one end of}} the game <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, and thus each game level will usually scroll horizontally. Some later beat 'em ups dispense with 2D-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player to roam around larger 3D environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems. Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons that they can use as well as power-ups that replenish the player's health.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, Khrushchev's Kremlin colleagues {{managed to}} oust him, but allowed him a {{peaceful}} retirement. Accused of rudeness and incompetence, {{he was also}} credited with ruining Soviet agriculture and bringing the <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brink of nuclear war. Khrushchev had become an international embarrassment when he authorized construction of the Berlin Wall, a public humiliation for Marxism–Leninism.|$|E
5|$|Jack Bros. {{follows the}} three Jack {{brothers}} – Jack Frost, Jack Lantern and Jack Skelton – who have traveled from the fairy <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> human world through a portal that opens {{every year on}} Halloween. Losing track of time, they {{spend too much time}} in the human world, and forget about returning until there only is one hour left to the portal's closing; the fairy Pixie shows them a shortcut, which, while dangerous, {{is the only way to}} return to the portal in time.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{countries}} that retain or adopt Sharia usually determine which {{parts of the}} Sharia are enforceable and codify (and thereby modernize) them. Unlike other Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia regards uncodified Sharia in its entirety as {{the law of the}} land and does not interfere with it. It is, therefore, unique not only when compared to Western systems, but also in comparison to other Muslim countries, and according to one source is the closest system in the modern <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> form of Sharia adopted at the advent of Islam.|$|E

In the first season, Lana and Clark's {{friendship}} is just beginning, as she is dating Whitney Fordman during this time. After Whitney leaves for the Marines in the season one finale, Lana and Clark slowly begin to try to start a romantic relationship. In season seven, Lana leaves Smallville, leaving behind a DVD explaining to Clark that, even though she loves him, {{the only way for}} him to help the <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> best of his ability would be if she left him and Smallville for good.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic nitrogen, {{along with}} mined rock phosphate, {{pesticides}} and mechanization, have greatly increased crop yields {{in the early}} 20th century. Increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well. Further, global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high-yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice, wheat, and corn were introduced {{as a part of}} the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution exported the technologies (including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen) of the developed <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> developing world. Thomas Malthus famously predicted that the Earth would not be able to support its growing population, but technologies such as the Green Revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food.|$|E
5|$|Three major {{theological}} controversies {{occurred during}} Manuel's reign. In 1156–1157 {{the question was}} raised whether Christ had offered himself as a sacrifice {{for the sins of}} the <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Father and to the Holy Spirit only, or also to the Logos (i.e., to himself). In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.|$|E

5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls aim to {{make their way to the}} Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.|$|E
5|$|In late 1809, while {{mourning}} {{the death of}} his 17-year-old fiancée Matilda Hoffman, Irving completed work on his first major book, A History of New-York from the Beginning of the <b>World</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich Knickerbocker (1809), a satire on self-important local history and contemporary politics. Prior to its publication, Irving started a hoax akin to today's viral marketing campaigns; he placed a series of missing person advertisements in New York newspapers seeking information on Diedrich Knickerbocker, a crusty Dutch historian who had allegedly gone missing from his hotel in New York City. As part of the ruse, Irving placed a notice—allegedly from the hotel's proprietor—informing readers that if Mr. Knickerbocker failed to return to the hotel to pay his bill, he would publish a manuscript Knickerbocker had left behind.|$|E

Team Urameshi, consisting of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei and a disguised Genkai, traverse through the strenuous early rounds to face Team Toguro in the finals and win the tournament. They learn that Team Toguro's owner, Sakyo, was attempting to win {{in order to create a}} large hole from the human <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Demon Plane and allow countless demons through. With his loss, Sakyo destroys the tournament arena, killing himself in the process.|$|E
