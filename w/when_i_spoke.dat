2500|$|... {{was staring}} {{straight}} ahead, shaking like a leaf. [...] Even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to him, he paid absolutely no attention. [...] I {{have never seen}} a man so completely wrecked. — Jack Thayer, First Class passenger on Titanic ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 27, 1912, Scott {{was promised}} {{a ride in}} one of Flying Field's {{airplanes}} by [...] First Lieutenant Lewis C. Rockwell. [...] Retired Captain Bernard Rome spoke with Corporal Scott the same day and noted that [...] "He was in high spirits <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to him," [...] and that, with regards to his flight the next day, [...] "...Scott jokingly referred to himself as 'ballast'." [...] Corporal Scott had secured the ride on the aircraft {{as opposed to what}} would normally be an officer's position because of his low weight — having never fully recovered from his illness of 1911.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his solo {{success and}} {{previous}} issues with band members, Morrissey still {{expressed interest in}} a Smiths reunion. On 22 December 1988, Morrissey, Andy Rourke, Mike Joyce and Craig Gannon performed to a sold out Wolverhampton Civic Hall. This would serve as his first solo show, and also the last Smiths live show ever. Many of those in attendance had waited for days to gain admission. After Viva Hate, Morrissey put out two new singles; [...] "The Last of the Famous International Playboys" [...] was about the Kray twins, gangsters who operated in London's East End, and reached number 6 on the UK singles chart. This was followed by [...] "Interesting Drug", which reached number 9. After his songwriting partnership with Street ended {{and was replaced by}} Alan Winstanley and Clive Langer, he recorded [...] "Ouija Board, Ouija Board", released as a single in November 1989; it reached number 18. Christian spokespeople and tabloid newspapers condemned the song, claiming that it promoted occultism, to which Morrissey responded that [...] "the only contact I ever made with the dead was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to a journalist from The Sun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will remember, sir," [...] he said, [...] "that {{it was on}} the {{eleventh}} of May last year <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> to you of this site." ...|$|R
60|$|In her turn, Helen Burns {{asked me}} to explain, and I {{proceeded}} forthwith to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments. Bitter and truculent <b>when</b> excited, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> as <b>I</b> felt, without reserve or softening.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What matter, Holy One?--but {{remember}} {{it is only}} for a night or two. Remember, I can change swiftly. It will all be as it was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> to thee under Zam-Zammah the great gun--' ...|$|R
2500|$|I was {{interested}} {{to hear him}} express as his opinion what I had written him some time ago {{in one of my}} letters, to the effect that if Germany won it would change the course of our civilization and make the United States a military nation. He also spoke of his deep regret, as indeed I did to him in that same letter, that it would check his policy for a better international ethical code. [...] He felt deeply the destruction of Louvain , and I found him as unsympathetic with the German attitude as is the balance of America. He goes even further than I in his condemnation of Germany's part in this war, and almost allows his feeling to include the German people as a whole rather than the leaders alone. He said German philosophy was essentially selfish and lacking in spirituality. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> of the Kaiser building up the German machine as a means of maintaining peace, he said, [...] "What a foolish thing it was to create a powder magazine and risk someone's dropping a spark into it!" [...] He thought the war would throw the world back three or four centuries. I did not agree with him. He was particularly scornful of Germany’s disregard of treaty obligations, and was indignant at the German Chancellor’s designation of the Belgian Treaty as being [...] "only a scrap of paper"....But although the personal feeling of the President was with the Allies, he insisted then and for many months after, that this ought not to affect his political attitude, which he intended should be one of strict neutrality. [...] He felt that he owed it to the world to prevent the spreading of the conflagration, that he owed it to the country to save it from the horrors of war.|$|E
60|$|YOUNG OFF. I say; what's the matter? You {{were crying}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll swear I saw it!' replied Monks, trembling. 'It was bending forward when I saw it first; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke,</b> it darted away.' ...|$|E
60|$|I had not {{lifted my}} veil <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> to the woman, {{which was at}} the moment of our going in. The boy {{staggered}} up instantly and stared at me with a remarkable expression of surprise and terror.|$|R
60|$|And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> protested and <b>spoke</b> of trespassing, he waived {{the point}} with a brusqueness that {{amounted}} almost to anger.|$|R
2500|$|Rowling {{herself was}} {{supportive}} of Watson {{after her first}} screen test. When asked if she thought actors suited the characters, Rowling said, [...] "Yes, I did. Emma Watson in particular was very, very like Hermione <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> to her, <b>I</b> knew she was perfect from that first phone call." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true, Luke; I {{forgot that}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke,</b> an' there's more gospel-smacks comin', I'm told, {{presented}} {{in the same way}} by lib'ral folk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Don't know,' says he, 'but I expect they're some o' {{the other}} {{boarders}}. The {{man said he}} had other boarders <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to him about takin' us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|MORE, Allow for {{the flesh}} and blood in me, too, please. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> the other night it was not without a certain feeling here. [He touches his heart.] ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{am writing}} to {{apologize}} to The New Yorker and Stacy Schiff, and to give some follow-up concerning Ryan Jordan (Editors' Note, March 5). <b>When</b> <b>I</b> last <b>spoke</b> to The New Yorker {{about the fact that}} a prominent Wikipedia community member had lied about his credentials, I misjudged the issue. It was not O.K. for Mr. Jordan, or Essjay, to lie to a reporter, even to protect his identity.|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't try {{any of your}} {{tricks on}} me, you scoundrel Raminez," [...] he said, shaking his fist at the professor. [...] "I know you. I know you better than <b>I</b> did <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>spoke.</b> If you wanted to escape me, {{you ought to have}} shaved off your eyebrows when you trimmed your hair and your beard. But I will be after you yet. The tales you have told here won't help you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Enough, I did {{not mean}} to frighten you, Grace, but only to show you what we must avoid--what we have still {{strength}} left to avoid. There is but one chance of escape; you know what it is--a desperate one, but no more desperate than this passive waiting for a certain end. I ask you again--will you share it with me? <b>When</b> <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> <b>I</b> was less sanguine than now. Since then I have explored the ground carefully, and studied the trend of these mountains. It is possible. I say no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You said 'bother the darlings' <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> of them." [...] Here {{the poor}} mother sobbed, almost {{overcome}} by the contumely of the expression used towards her own offspring.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> next, I {{was back}} in the school-house, sitting there with my bonnet on my head, Gavin looking at me. We had {{forgotten}} the cannon at last.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have seen," [...] said Blood. [...] "He {{died before}} I left the Cinco Llagas. He was hanging {{dead in his}} bonds <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to him before leaving." ...|$|E
60|$|Again {{there was}} a spell of silence, and at last, <b>when</b> Mademoiselle <b>spoke,</b> <b>I</b> was amazed at the calm voice in which she {{addressed}} him, marvelling at the strength and courage of one so frail and childlike to behold.|$|R
60|$|I had a moment's {{weakness}} <b>when</b> she <b>spoke.</b> <b>I</b> {{was within}} an ace of advancing and casting myself upon my knees like any Lenten penitent, to sue forgiveness. But I set the inclination down betimes. Such expedients would not avail me here.|$|R
6000|$|... "You were {{starting}} {{out for a}} fortnight's golf somewhere," [...] Tavernake continued, [...] "and you promised {{to look into the}} affair <b>when</b> you returned. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to you again but you declared that you were far too busy to go into the matter at all for the present, you didn't care about this side of London, you considered that we had enough on hand--in fact, you threw cold water upon the idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw {{you look}} at me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> about that boat race," [...] said Jack to Ruth Stevenson. [...] "Maybe you like to be out on the water?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I call God to witness, it has of late {{been more}} than once on my lips. The other night, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> of Rovigo, I was about to express this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, {{it wants}} proper telling," [...] he continued, turning to Stobell. [...] "Did you notice his eyes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> of it {{bubbling}} and spluttering over the galley fire?" ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{skin was}} like a {{delicate}} white rose leaf, and <b>when</b> she <b>spoke</b> <b>I</b> told my foolish self that never had I heard music before; nor do I ever again think to hear a voice so sweet, so liquid, as that which rippled over her ripe lips.|$|R
60|$|It {{was clear}} that the series of deceptions which had removed Anne Catherick to London, and {{separated}} her from Mrs. Clements, had been accomplished solely by Count Fosco and the Countess, and the question whether any part of the conduct of husband or wife had been of a kind to place either of them within reach of the law might be well worthy of future consideration. But the purpose I had now in view led me in another direction than this. The immediate object of my visit to Mrs. Clements was to make some approach at least to the discovery of Sir Percival's secret, and she had said nothing as yet which advanced me on my way to that important end. I felt the necessity of trying to awaken her recollections of other times, persons, and events than those on which her memory had hitherto been employed, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> next <b>spoke</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> with that object indirectly in view.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{previous}} Toronto chief constables, Grasett largely {{refrained from}} making controversial public statements except during World War <b>I</b> <b>when</b> he <b>spoke</b> out against foreigners in Toronto and banned outdoor anti-conscription meetings. He {{was appointed to}} the Order of St Michael and St George in 1916 for his contributions to the war effort.|$|R
6000|$|Roberts, {{in spite}} of Campbell's dumb-show inciting him to fiction: [...] "I--I--if you will kindly step apart here, I can explain. I was very {{confused}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to Mrs. McIlheny." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{attempted}} to reassure her. I {{tried to tell}} her what was indeed the truth--that I had only been thinking of the ordinary chances and changes of life, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It is I, Runkoor, but I am disguised. I {{was like}} this <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to you through the window a {{fortnight}} since, but you could not then see my figure.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{certainly}} has known her. Though he lied, {{as he always}} lies, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> to him, <b>I</b> brought him {{to admit that he}} and she had been friends down in Suffolk. Of course we know what such friendship means. But I do not think that she came to London at his instance. Of course he would lie about that. He would lie about anything. If his horse cost him a hundred pounds, he would tell one man that he gave fifty, and another two hundred. But he has not lived long enough yet to be able to lie and tell the truth with the same eye. When he is as old as I am he'll be perfect.' ...|$|R
60|$|Ah, me! {{the end of}} that quiet, {{pleasant}} {{life was}} near. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> lightly <b>spoke</b> to the odd stranger of the expiring trade of the town, I never expected that my employer's trade was expiring too. The speculation {{had turned out to be}} a losing one; and all his savings had been embarked in it. He could no longer remain at Sandwich, or afford to keep a governess. His wife broke the sad news to me. I was so fond of the children, I proposed to her to give up my salary. Her husband refused even to consider the proposal. It was the old story of poor humanity over again. We cried, we kissed, we parted.|$|R
60|$|Taking a {{key from}} her pocket, {{she was about}} to open the door of the cottage, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{advanced}} and <b>spoke</b> to her. As far from recognizing her as ever, I found myself nevertheless thinking of an odd outspoken child, living at the mill in past years, who had been one of my poor mother's favorites at our village school. I ran the risk of offending her, by bluntly expressing the thought which was then in my mind.|$|R
