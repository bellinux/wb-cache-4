5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for <b>watering</b> purposes, {{although}} 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. <b>Watering</b> should be done regularly. However, plants {{should not be allowed to}} sit in water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E

Slow-growing, the plant takes four to six years to flower from seed. It is less commonly grown than Banksia serrata. An investigation into optimum temperatures for germination found a nighttime temperature of 20–28°C, and a daytime of 24–33°C gave best results, and recommended summer planting times.|$|E

40|$|<b>Water</b> {{reclamation}} and reuse {{provides a}} unique and viable opportunity to augment traditional <b>water</b> supplies. As a multi-disciplined and important element of <b>water</b> resources development and management, <b>water</b> reuse can help to close the loop between <b>water</b> supply and wastewater disposal. Effective <b>water</b> reuse requires integration of <b>water</b> and reclaimed <b>water</b> supply functions. The successful development of this dependable <b>water</b> resource depends upon close examination and synthesis of elements from infrastructure and facilities planning, wastewater treatment plant siting, treatment process reliability, economic and financial analyses, and <b>water</b> utility management.

5000|$|Technological advancements {{within the}} {{industry}} allow for incorporating timers to limit the operations during specific {{hours of the day}} to reduce energy waste by only operating when occupants are likely to use hot <b>water.</b> Additional advancements in technology include pumps which cycle on and off to maintain hot <b>water</b> temperature versus a continuously operating pump which consumes more electrical energy. Reduced energy waste and discomfort is possible by preventing occurrences of hot <b>water</b> line siphoning in open-loop hot <b>water</b> circulation systems which utilize the cold <b>water</b> line to return <b>water</b> back to the <b>water</b> heater. Hot <b>Water</b> Line Siphoning occurs when <b>water</b> from within the hot <b>water</b> line siphons or is forced into the cold <b>water</b> line due to differences in <b>water</b> pressure between the hot and cold <b>water</b> lines. Utilizing [...] "normally closed" [...] solenoid valve significantly reduces energy consumption by preventing siphoning of non-hot <b>water</b> out of hot <b>water</b> lines during cold <b>water</b> use. Using cold <b>water</b> instantly lowers the <b>water</b> pressure in the cold <b>water</b> lines, the higher <b>water</b> pressure in the hot <b>water</b> lines force <b>water</b> through [...] "normally open" [...] thermostatic crossover valves and backflow check valves (which only prevent cold <b>water</b> from flowing into hot <b>water</b> line), increasing the energy demand on the <b>water</b> heater.|$|R

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{scheme was}} introduced, {{using a combination}} of automatic signalling and modifications to the layout at Liverpool Street. The station introduced coaling, <b>watering,</b> and other maintenance facilities directly at the station, as well as separate engine bays and a modified track and station layout that reduced turnaround times and increased productivity. Services began on 2 July 1920 with trains to Chingford and Enfield running every 10 minutes. The cost of the modifications was £80,000 compared to an estimated £3million for electrification. The service was officially called the Intensive Service (as it allowed a 50% increase in capacity on peak services), but became popularly known as the Jazz Service. It lasted until the General Strike of 1926, following which services generally declined.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>water</b> {{supply systems}} include {{activities}} such as <b>water</b> intake; <b>water</b> purification; and <b>water</b> distribution, many <b>water</b> supply organizations are not always equipped with all three activities. In fact, Japan has two types of <b>water</b> companies: one that operates <b>water</b> intake and <b>water</b> purification (type 1); and the other which mainly operates <b>water</b> distribution (type 2). Many previous studies have attempted to identify scale economies for <b>water</b> supply organizations, but have failed {{to take into account}} which <b>water</b> supply systems operate. In this analysis we categorize Japanese <b>water</b> supply organizations into three types: type 1 - which operates <b>water</b> intake and <b>water</b> purification; type 2 a - which not only operates <b>water</b> distribution, but also operates <b>water</b> intake and <b>water</b> purification; and type 2 b - which operates <b>water</b> distribution, but purchases <b>water</b> from type 1 companies. After that, we estimate scale economies for each type of <b>water</b> supply organization using translog cost function. Furthermore, we take into account their <b>water</b> sources, especially type 1 and type 2 a, because we consider that differences of <b>water</b> sources might affect the cost structure of <b>water</b> supply systems. ...|$|R
