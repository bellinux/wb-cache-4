3000|$|The {{second phase}} of {{fieldwork}} was conducted in 2011 by an anthropologist and included eight interviews centred on the contemporary scientific publications on moths, reindeer and mountain birches (e.g. Klemola et al. 2003, Klemola 2009, Tømmervik et al. 2009, Ammunét 2011). The results put forward in these publications were presented in popular form to the herders, who were asked key questions such as: <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> if outbreaks of both autumnal and winter moth become more common as the climate gets warmer? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{about the impact of}} global warming and reindeer on the growth of birch trees? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the future of reindeer herding? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the future of the mountain birch forests in your area?

"'Decoy,'" [...] said Perkins, in gentle deprecation, [...] "'decoy' {{is hardly}} the word I {{expected}} from a gentleman who has been so unfortunate as to take, unsolicited and of his own free will, another person's place in a boat.

60|$|For {{a minute}} or two {{everybody}} forgot about Buster Bear. Then there was a great crash which made everybody turn to look the other way. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> saw? Why, Buster Bear was running away too, and he was running twice as fast as Farmer Brown's boy! He bumped into trees and crashed through bushes and jumped over logs, and in almost no time at all he was out of sight. Altogether it was the most surprising thing that the little people of the Green Forest ever had seen.|$|E

I tumbled about all night in a rage, when I thought how they had served me, and of Hoxton's believing it all, and how he might only half give in to your representation, and then I gloried in Anderson's coming down from his height, and being seen in his true colours. So it went on till morning came, and I got up. You know you gave me my mother's little 'Thomas a Kempis'. I always read a bit every morning.

He, be!--those methodistical Warringtons! They are not a bit less worldly than their neighbours; and, old as he is, if the Grand Seignior throws his pocket-handkerchief, they will jump to catch it!" ...|$|E
60|$|Here {{was a third}} revolution, {{bought at}} this amazing sum, and this poor, miserable prince first dragged from Moorshedabad to Calcutta, then dragged back from Calcutta to Moorshedabad, the sport of fortune and the plaything of avarice. This poor man is again set up, but is left with no authority: his troops limited,--his person, {{everything}} about him, in a manner subjugated,--a British Resident the master of his court: he is set up as a pageant on this throne, with no other authority but what would be sufficient to give a countenance to presents, gifts, and donations. That authority was always left, when all the rest was taken away. One {{would have thought that}} this revolution might have satisfied these gentlemen, and that the money gained by it would have been sufficient. No. The partisans of Cossim Ali wanted another revolution. The partisans of the other side wished to have something more done in the present. They now began to think that to depose Cossim instantly, and to sell him to another, was too much at one time,--especially as Cossim Ali was a man of vigor and resolution, carrying on a fierce war against them. But <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> did? They began to see, from the example of Cossim Ali, that the lieutenancy, the ministry of the king, was a good thing to be sold, and the sale of that might turn out as good a thing as the sale of the prince.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes, {{this is a}} {{wonderful}} govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>They</b> said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain't the wust. They said he could VOTE when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was 'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I'll never vote agin. Them's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me--I'll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the cool way of that nigger--why, he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way. I says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold?--that's what I want to know. And what do you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. There, now--that's a specimen. They call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the State six months. Here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger, and--" ...|$|E
