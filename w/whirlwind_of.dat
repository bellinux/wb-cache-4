5|$|The corps, part of Georg-Hans Reinhardt's Third Panzer Group, {{was located}} at Kalinin, 160km (100mi) {{northwest}} of Moscow. It was worn out, {{at the end}} of a long and tenuous supply line (Model had been promoted on 28 October, and needed two weeks just to get to Kalinin), and the cold weather was starting to hamper the Germans. Nevertheless, morale remained high, and the final push towards Moscow began shortly after his arrival. Model was a <b>whirlwind</b> <b>of</b> energy, touring the front and exhorting his troops to greater efforts: he also ran roughshod over the niceties of protocol and chains of command, and, in general, left his staff trailing in his wake. By 5 December, XLI Panzer Corps' 6th Panzer Division had reached Iohnca, just 35km (22mi) from the Kremlin. There, the advance stopped, as the winter took hold. Temperatures dropped 20 to 40°C below zero, weapons and vehicles froze solid, and the Germans were forced to call a halt to offensive operations.|$|E

25|$|Any object {{can be used}} as a Portkey; it {{is common}} {{practise}} to select old, worthless items, to discourage unsuspecting Muggles from picking them up and activating them. Portkey objects used in the Potter series include a football and an old Wellington boot. Once the Portus charm is cast upon an object, it glows blue and vibrates gently; once settled it has become a Portkey. When Portkeys are activated, users feel the sensation of a hook being jerked from behind their navel. The floor disappears from beneath their feet, leaving their last position behind them, and they fly forward through a <b>whirlwind</b> <b>of</b> colour and sound, appearing suddenly at their destination. With enough practice it is possible to achieve a graceful landing: After the Portkey trip to the Quidditch World Cup in the fourth film, Mr. Weasley, Cedric and Amos Diggory land on their feet, while the less experienced teenagers, including Harry, fall on the ground.|$|E
25|$|In {{the buildup}} to the Second World War, the United Kingdom had {{embarked}} on a programme to develop cannon-armed fighters. They acquired a licence to build the HS.404, which entered production as the Hispano Mk.I intended as aeroplane armament. Its first use was in the Westland <b>Whirlwind</b> <b>of</b> 1940, {{and later in the}} more powerful Bristol Beaufighter, providing the Royal Air Force with powerful cannon-armed interceptors. The experience of the Battle of Britain had shown the batteries of eight rifle-calibre machine guns to be inadequate and prompted the adoption of auto cannon armament for the primary portion of Royal Air Force (RAF) fighters. The Beaufighter highlighted the need for a belt feed mechanism; as a night fighter the 60-round drums needed to be replaced in the dark by the Radar/Wireless Operator, often while the aircraft was manoeuvering to keep sight of its quarry. In addition, the early trial installations in the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire had shown a tendency for the gun to jam during combat manoeuvres, leading to some official doubt as to the suitability of cannon as the sole main armament. This led to the Air Ministry for a brief period specifying 12-machine gun armament for new fighters.|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} has been widely criticized by legal scholars. [...] David E. Wilkins noted that if the Indian Commerce Clause or Taxation Clause did not contain the authority, and the tribes had not granted it by treaty or consent, then the Major Crimes Act would be unconstitutional and the Court should have declared it void. [...] Phillip P. Frickey describes the Kagama decision as [...] "a <b>whirlwind</b> <b>of</b> circular reasoning", with the Court justifying congressional power due to the tribe's weakness, which it also noted {{was due to the}} tribes dealing with the U.S. government. [...] Frickey felt the decision was an embarrassment to constitutional theory, to logic, and to humanity. [...] Robert N. Clinton stated that [...] "his remarkable decision obviously invoked rhetoric of colonial expansion, rather than the rhetoric of American constitutional discourse." [...] Daniel L. Rotenberg said that Kagama was [...] "one more item on the long litany of injustices to the American Indian." [...] In addition to the law professors, various other authors in law reviews have also been critical of the decision. [...] Warren Stapleton, in the Arizona State University law journal, has stated that the decision was incorrect and that the Major Crimes Act is in fact unconstitutional. [...] In a Comment, the University of Pennsylvania Law Review noted that [...] "the Court promulgated what can be called the 'it-must-be-somewhere' doctrine..." ...|$|E

Allmusic reviewer Hal Horowitz, however, described the music as so [...] "radically doctored" [...] that [...] "it is nothing like what the crowd at the venue heard". He criticised the DVD for being [...] "heavily edited", the vocals for being [...] "heavily and consistently overdubbed" [...] and the editing for being [...] "breathlessly nervous". However, he complimented the band's [...] "high-energy" [...] performance, calling Gwen Stefani [...] "a <b>whirlwind</b> <b>of</b> activity, strutting, preening, pouting, and prancing".

According to Nacy Berry, vice chairman of Virgin Records, Janet marked the first time the label [...] "had centrally coordinated and strategized a campaign on a worldwide basis" [...] which ultimately brought her to a plateau of global recognition. Her historic multimillion-dollar contract made her the highest-paid artist in history, until brother Michael renegotiated his contract with Sony Music Entertainment only days later.

[...] James Robert Parish, author of Today's Black Hollywood (1995) wrote: [...] "She confirmed her status as today's Queen of Pop when, not long ago, she signed a $35-$40 million recording contract with Virgin Records." [...] Music critic Nelson George noted that while surpassing Michael would be next to impossible, Janet had assuredly reached iconic status. He explained: [...] "What worked for Michael 10 years ago is working for her now... Michael was clearly the voice of the '80s, those that grew up with him since Motown. And with the themes (independence, social consciousness and up-front yet responsible sexuality) that she's addressing in her albums and the popularity she's enjoying, she could very well be the voice of the '90s." ...|$|E

It ranked highly in the end of year polls of French and German music magazines, including Les Inrockuptibles, Magic and Spex. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the record was also featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the year and the best albums of the decade. In Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll of 1995, the album placed at number seven. British magazines Mojo, Mixmag, Melody Maker, Select and The Face coincided on including Post in their end of year lists. Vibe included the album in its 1999 list of the 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century. Slant considered it the second best album of the decade in a 2011 list, only behind Björk's next release, Homogenic, writing it: [...] "is [...] most scatterbrained work to date, but it's tied together flawlessly by the singer's singular whimsicality". In 2003, Pitchfork listed it as the 20th best album of the decade, with William Morris writing, [...] "few artists on this list could rival [...] in terms of innovation, vision, talent, and high-yield experimentation, and Post was the record to establish this. In a 2012 article, Paste considered Post to be the sixty-fourth best album of the decade, with Ryan Reed stating: [...] "no Björk album is as weird (or weirdly wonderful) as 1995's Post, a dizzying <b>whirlwind</b> <b>of</b> sonic textures and stylistic shifts that demonstrates every facet of her ever-expanding bag of tricks. [...] Björk clearly aimed to demonstrate the meaninglessness of genre boundaries. She succeeded."
