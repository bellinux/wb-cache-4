Although she is thought to have grown up in London, she lived there for only three years before moving to India. According to Kaif, she then changed her surname to her father's because she thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> pronounce.|$|E

Hines led the Northwest Conspiracy from Canada {{in the fall of}} 1864. Colonel Benjamin Anderson was involved in the plot, along with other Confederate soldiers. It was hoped that Hines and his men would be able to free the Confederate prisoners held at Camp Douglas in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, Charles Cornwallis {{arrived at}} Petersburg with 1,500 men after {{suffering}} heavy casualties at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. He immediately assumed command, as Phillips had recently {{died of a}} fever. Cornwallis had not received permission to abandon the Carolinas from his superior, Henry Clinton, but he believed that Virginia <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> capture, feeling that it would approve of an invading British army.|$|E

5|$|Cleomenes {{estimated}} that Argos <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> capture while filled with festival-goers and spectators to cause panic. During the night, he seized the rugged area above the city's theatre. The {{people of the}} city were too terrified to offer resistance. They accepted a garrison, delivered twenty hostages to Cleomenes and became Spartan allies. The capture of Argos gave Cleomenes' reputation a massive boost, since no Spartan king had ever managed to seize Argos. Even Pyrrhus of Epirus, {{one of the most}} famous generals of the age, had been killed while trying to take the city.|$|E
5|$|Seth MacFarlane voices {{four of the}} show's main {{characters}}: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire. MacFarlane {{chose to}} voice these characters himself, believing it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> portray the voices he had already envisioned than {{for someone else to}} attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses his own voice while portraying Brian.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1992 race, {{controversy}} erupted {{when the}} Alaska {{board of directors}} of Yukon Quest International informed the Yukon board that they were considering dropping the Yukon half of the Quest because Yukon officials did not meet fundraising goals. Alaska officials also believed it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> manage an Alaska-only race. A crisis was averted when the Yukon board of directors agreed to raise more money and the two sides formed a joint board of directors. The 1993 race was run as usual, but Jeff Mann had a more eventful race than most. When a moose attacked his dog team, he was forced to kill it with an axe, then butcher it according to Quest rules. Later, he was penalized 90minutes for borrowing a reporter's head lantern. Finally, after the conclusion of the race, he was fined half his winnings when his dogs tested positive for ibuprofen.|$|E

MacFarlane chose to voice these characters himself, believing it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> portray the voices he already envisioned than {{for someone else to}} attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses his regular speaking voice when playing Brian. The voice of Quagmire was inspired by fast-speaking radio advertising spokesmen from the 1950s. MacFarlane also provides voices for various other recurring and one-time characters, including news anchor Tom Tucker and Lois' father Carter Pewterschmidt.|$|E
5|$|Norio Tsukudani based Himegoto on {{an earlier}} four-panel manga she drew for fun during her time as a student. At that time, the main {{characters}} {{that make up the}} student council were instead members of the drama club. However, Tsukudani decided to change this when developing Himegoto to be serialized in Ichijinsha's Waai! magazine, and she decided it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> manage a cross-dressing character if he was in the student council. Before creating Himegoto, Tsukudani read various works of fiction that featured cross-dressing boys, but many of them featured the boys being paired with other boys. When she proposed the idea of Himegoto, she wanted to pair a cross-dressing boy with girls, which Tsukudani herself wanted to read. In this way, she thought that a variety of different people would enjoy it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he came to}} Hamburg to {{work with}} Pauli, Rabi found Otto Stern working there with two English-speaking {{postdoctoral}} fellows, Ronald Fraser and John Bradshaw Taylor. Rabi soon made friends with them, and became interested in their molecular beam experiments, for which Stern would receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1943. Their research involved non-uniform magnetic fields, which were difficult to manipulate and hard to measure accurately. Rabi {{came up with the}} idea of using a uniform field instead, with the molecular beam at a glancing angle, so the atoms would be deflected like light through a prism. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> use, and produce more accurate results. Encouraged by Stern, and greatly assisted by Taylor, Rabi managed to get his idea to work. On Stern's advice, Rabi wrote a letter about his results to Nature, which published it in February 1929, followed by a paper entitled Zur Methode der Ablenkung von Molekularstrahlen ("On the method of deflection of molecular beams") to Zeitschrift für Physik, where it was published in April.|$|E

5|$|Bolívar {{took control}} of Caracas with his victory {{at the battle of}} Carabobo, and the Congress of Cúcuta issued laws similar to those in Perú. Guayaquil {{declared}} independence, and Bolivar sent Antonio José de Sucre to reinforce them. Sucre's forces were not enough, and requested help from San Martín. Peru sent a military force of 1,300 men. Bolívar entered the city a month later, and claimed that for historical reasons Quito should be part of Colombia. San Martín and Bolívar sought to generate Latin American integration, but disagreed on the type of government: Bolívar proposed a republic, and San Martín a constitutional monarchy, reasoning that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> receive international recognition for the now-independent South American nations. Peru and Colombia signed a treaty of integration, to be proposed to Chile, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata and Paraguay, and at a later point to the United Provinces of Central America and the Empire of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The LT vz. 34, {{formally}} {{designated as}} Lehký Tank vzor 34 ("Light Tank Model 34") was a Czechoslovak-designed light tank used mainly by Slovakia during World War II. Its suspension {{was based on}} that of the Carden-Loyd tankette, of which the Czechs had purchased three, plus a manufacturing license, in 1930. Dissatisfied with the prototypes of the Tančík vz. 33 tankette, the Czech Army decided that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> design a light tank from scratch rather than modify a tankette's chassis to carry a fully rotating armored turret. 50 were built, the last of which was delivered during 1936, of which the Germans captured 22 - including the prototype, when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939, but they promptly scrapped them. The Slovaks seized the remaining 27 (18 + 9 nine LT vz. 34 light tanks which the Czechs had evacuated from Carpatho-Ukraine to Humene and Prešov.) when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. In Slovak service it only saw combat during the Slovak National Uprising.|$|E
5|$|Van den Berg and {{his colleagues}} {{designed}} the EG Vapor Crystal Growth System experiment apparatus for a Space Shuttle flight. The experiment required an in-flight operator and NASA decided that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> train a crystal growth scientist to become an astronaut, {{than it would be}} the other way around. NASA asked EG and Van den Berg to compile a list of eight people who would qualify to perform the science experiments in space and to become a Payload Specialist. Van den Berg and his chief, Dr. Harold A. Lamonds could only come up with seven names. Lamonds subsequently proposed adding Van den Berg to the list, joking with Van den Berg that due to his age, huge glasses and little strength, he would probably be dropped during the first selection round; but at least they would have eight names. Van den Berg agreed {{to be added to the}} list, but didn't really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, on {{receiving}} her diploma, de Bourgoing {{joined the}} Société de Secours aux Blessés Militaires (SSBM), forerunner of the French Red Cross, {{as a volunteer}} and began working at the Beaujon Hospital in Paris. As {{a result of her}} competence and the understanding she showed both patients and doctors, she was appointed president of the SSBM. In 1907, she sailed for Morocco with the French expeditionary force under General Antoine Marius Benoît Drude. As head of a team of SSBM volunteers, she established an infirmary in Casablanca, treating the wounded in the conflicts between the French and Moroccans. As conditions were difficult in Morocco, it was decided the wounded and seriously ill should be transported to Oran in Algeria where it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> provide proper treatment. It was in October 1907 while she and two of her nurses were accompanying the wounded on a French naval crossing to Oran, that she first met General Hubert Lyautey, who was division commander there. After spending fifteen months in North Africa, she returned to France, only to leave shortly afterwards for the Italian port Messina in December where she and her nursing team helped care for the 80,000 victims of the 1908 earthquake. As a result of their exemplary services, they were decorated by Princess Hélène of Orléans.|$|E
5|$|On Saint David's Day (1 March 1915), the new {{division}} was inspected by Lloyd George. During April, the Fourth New Army was broken up to provide reinforcements for deployed combat units. The Fifth New Army, in turn, was renamed the Fourth New Army. As {{part of this}} re-organisation, the 38th Division became the 31st Division. On 29 April, the 43rd was renamed the 38th (Welsh) Division. The division spent most of 1915 dispersed, with the majority located across North Wales with units training at Pwllheli, Colwyn Bay, Llandudno and Rhyl; some units were based in the south at Abergavenny. At these locations, the men undertook basic training, were drilled, and trained for open warfare. On 19 August, the division moved to Winchester, England, where it assembled {{for the first time}} as a division. Final training took place and limited instruction was given on tactics for trench warfare, on the assumption that practical experience <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> gain in France. Following training, it took until November for the division to be fully equipped with rifles. To be declared fit for overseas service, the division's soldiers had to fire 24 rounds on a rifle range. On 29 November, the {{division was}} inspected for the last time before its deployment; Queen Mary and Princess Mary reviewed the troops at Crawley Down.|$|E
5|$|Other enemies {{were created}} to add more variety. Large, indestructible Hulks, {{inspired}} by an enemy in Berzerk, were added to kill the humans on the stage. Though they cannot be destroyed, the developers decided to have the protagonist's projectiles slow the Hulk's movement {{as a way to}} help the player. Levitating Enforcers were added as enemies that could shoot back at the main character; Jarvis and DeMar liked the idea of a floating robot and felt it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> animate. A projectile algorithm was devised for Enforcers to simulate enemy artificial intelligence. The developers felt a simple algorithm of shooting directly at the protagonist would be ineffective because the character's constant motion would always result in a miss. Random elements were added to make the projectile more unpredictable; the Enforcer aims at a random location in a ten pixel radius around the character, and random acceleration curves the trajectory. To further differentiate Enforcers, Jarvis devised the Spheroid enemy as a robot that continually generated Enforcers, rather than have them already on the screen like other enemies. Brains were conceived as robots that could capture humans and brainwash them into enemies called Progs. DeMar devised the final enemies as a way to further increase the game's difficulty; Tanks that fire projectiles which bounce around the screen, and Quarks as a tank-producing robot.|$|E

50|$|For example, it was {{considered}} good practice to have the spacecraft displays show some meaningful attitude value that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> monitor during an important engine burn. Flight controllers at mission control in Houston would calculate what attitude the spacecraft {{had to be at}} for that burn and would devise a REFSMMAT that matched it in some way. Then, {{when it came time for}} the burn, if the spacecraft was in its correct attitude, the crew would see their 8-ball display a simple attitude that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> interpret, allowing errors to be easily tracked and corrected.|$|R

5|$|The bridge {{ceiling was}} redesigned, with Michelson taking {{structural}} inspiration from a jet engine fan. Minor built a central bubble for the ceiling {{to give the}} bridge a human touch. Ostensibly, the bubble functioned {{as a piece of}} sophisticated equipment designed to inform the captain of the ship's attitude. Most of the bridge consoles, designed by Lee Cole, remained from the scrapped television series. Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created. To inform actors and series writers, Lee prepared a USS Enterprise Flight Manual as a continuity guide to control functions. It was necessary for all the main cast to be familiar with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via heat-sensitive plates. The wattage of the light bulbs beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25watts to 6watts after the generated heat began melting the controls. The seats were covered in girdle material, used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed. For the science station, two consoles were rigged for hydraulic operation so that they could be rolled into the walls when not in use, but the system was disconnected when the crew discovered it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> move them by hand.|$|E
