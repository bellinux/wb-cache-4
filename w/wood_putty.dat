2500|$|Since 1994, {{most agree}} that the photo was an {{elaborate}} hoax. It {{had been accused of}} being a fake in a 7 December 1975 Sunday Telegraph article which fell into obscurity. Details of how the photo was taken were published in the 1999 book, Nessie – the Surgeon's Photograph Exposed, which contains a facsimile of the 1975 Sunday Telegraph article. The creature was reportedly a toy submarine built by Christian Spurling, the son-in-law of Marmaduke Wetherell. Wetherell had been publicly ridiculed by his employer, the Daily Mail, after he found [...] "Nessie footprints" [...] {{which turned out to be}} a hoax. To get revenge on the Mail, Wetherell perpetrated his hoax with co-conspirators Spurling (sculpture specialist), Ian Wetherell (his son, who bought the material for the fake), and Maurice Chambers (an insurance agent). The toy submarine was bought from F. W. Woolworths, and its head and neck were made from <b>wood</b> <b>putty.</b> After testing it in a local pond the group went to Loch Ness, where Ian Wetherell took the photos near the Altsaigh Tea House. When they heard a water bailiff approaching, Duke Wetherell sank the model with his foot and it is [...] "presumably still somewhere in Loch Ness". Chambers gave the photographic plates to Wilson, a friend of his who enjoyed [...] "a good practical joke". Wilson brought the plates to Ogston's, an Inverness chemist, and gave them to George Morrison for development. He sold the first photo to the Daily Mail, who then announced that the monster had been photographed.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, Mr. Imagination worked {{extensively}} in sculptures carved from industrial sandstone and incorporating thousands of bottlecaps fastened to {{surfaces of the}} sculpted objects. He used paint, <b>wood,</b> nails, <b>putty,</b> and cement, and also incorporated found objects into his work, including vintage commercial items and discarded objects such as tools, household instruments, and mirrors. Many of his works were thematically influenced by African and Egyptian masks and dress.|$|R
50|$|Putty is a {{material}} with high plasticity, similar in texture to clay or dough, typically used in domestic construction and repair as a sealant or filler. Painter's Putty is typically a linseed oil-based product used for filling holes, minor cracks and defacements in <b>wood</b> only. <b>Putties</b> {{can also be}} made intumescent, in which case they are used for firestopping {{as well as for}} padding of electrical outlet boxes in fire-resistance rated drywall assemblies. In the latter case, hydrates in the putty produce an endothermic reaction to mitigate heat transfer to the unexposed side.|$|R
5000|$|Martin Selley {{established}} the Selleys Chemical Company {{after he left}} Germany for Australia in 1939. He had a formula for <b>wood</b> <b>Putty</b> which {{he and his wife}} mixed up in the laundry sink and sold to hardware stores and glaziers. He then launched two more products, Selleys Metallic Cement, and Selleys Unifix, which are still available today, as is the <b>Wood</b> <b>Putty.</b> The huge success of the company was slow to arrive, but as DIY became more popular, the Selleys product range expanded to meet demands, and eventually Selleys were selling adhesives, sealants and much more, and the Selley's slogan, [...] "If it's Selleys, it works," [...] ( [...] which was conceived in the lounge room of Doug Stewart at 45 Goodwin Tce. Moorooka, Brisbane) became recognised by most people.Doug Stewart (Chief Consultant and Rep for Selleys in Queensland from 1959 to 1977) was sent to Sydney to oversee the use of Selleys Unifix to secure the tiles on the Sails of the Sydney Opera House during construction.|$|E
50|$|Many {{sculpting}} pastes {{have been}} used over the years with varying levels of success and durability. <b>Wood</b> <b>putty</b> and plumber's epoxy was most commonly used in the beginning, but now new epoxy-type products are available which have been designed for artistic use. Products such as Apoxie Sculpt and Gapoxio have longer drying times, a finer texture, and more flexibility than the earlier sculpting materials.|$|E
50|$|Bill Wyman takes {{credit for}} {{creating}} the first fretless bass guitar in 1961 when he converted an inexpensive Japanese fretted bass by removing the frets. The first production fretless bass was the Ampeg AUB-1 introduced in 1966, and Fender introduced a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius created his own fretless bass by removing the frets from a Fender Jazz Bass, filling the holes with <b>wood</b> <b>putty,</b> and coating the fretboard with epoxy resin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>putty,</b> {{also called}} plastic wood, is a {{substance}} used to fill imperfections, such as nail holes, in wood prior to finishing. It is often composed of wood dust {{combined with a}} binder that dries and a diluent (thinner), and, sometimes, pigment. Pore fillers used for large flat surfaces such as floors or table tops generally contain silica instead of or in addition to wood dust. Pores can also be filled using multiple coats of the final finish rather than a pore filler.|$|E
5000|$|The first fretless bass guitar {{was made}} by Bill Wyman in 1961 when he {{converted}} an inexpensive Japanese fretted bass by simply removing the frets and filling in the slots cut into the neck with <b>wood</b> <b>putty.</b> The first production fretless bass was the Ampeg AUB-1 introduced in 1966, and Fender introduced a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Around 1970, Rick Danko from The Band began to use an Ampeg fretless, which he modified with Fender pickups—as heard on the 1971 Cahoots studio album and the Rock of Ages album recorded live in 1971. Danko said, [...] "It's a challenge to play fretless {{because you have to}} really use your ear." [...] In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius had the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass coated in epoxy resin, allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound. Some fretless basses have [...] "fret line" [...] markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks {{on the side of the}} neck.|$|E
