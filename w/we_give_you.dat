In the Qur'an, there is a request to wonder on milk as follows: 'And surely in the livestock there is a lesson for you, <b>We</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> to drink of that which is in their bellies from the midst of digested food and blood, pure milk palatable for the drinkers.'(16-The Honeybee, 66).

500|$|Most other {{movements}} of the mass are parodies of music from earlier cantatas, dating {{back as far as}} 1714. Wenk points out that Bach often used parody to [...] "bring a composition to a higher level of perfection". The original musical sources of several movements are known, for others they are lost but the score shows that they are copied and reworked. Bach selected movements that carried a similar expression and affekt. For example, [...] (<b>We</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> thanks) is based on [...] (We thank you, God, we thank you) and the [...] (Crucified) is based on the general lamenting about the situation of the faithful Christian, [...] (Weeping, lamenting, worrying, fearing) which Bach had composed already in 1714 as one of his first cantatas for the court of Weimar.|$|E

Dating to 1984, this provided an interesting insight into the band's earliest work and [...] "rougher" [...] sound. These recordings pre-dated the other early demos previously made available on the 1990 unofficial, Father Yod release entitled Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To.|$|E

2500|$|The 1940s and the {{establishment}} of Israel saw rapid emigration of Jews out of Yemen, in the wake of anti-Jewish riots and massacres. By the late 1990s, only several hundred remained, mainly in a northwestern mountainous region named Sa'ada and town of Raida. Houthi members put up notes on the Jews' doors, accusing them of corrupting Muslim morals. Eventually, the Houthi leaders sent threatening messages to the Jewish community: [...] "We warn you to leave the area immediately.... <b>We</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a period of 10 days, or you will regret it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite having played {{fewer than}} ten gigs, Spacemen 3 decided {{to produce a}} demo tape. In 1984 they made their first studio {{recordings}} at the home studio of Dave Sheriff in Rugby. This material – which included early iterations of the songs [...] "Walkin' with Jesus", [...] "Come Down Easy" [...] and [...] "Thing'll Never be the Same" [...] – was used for a short demo tape entitled For All The Fucked Up Children Of The World <b>We</b> <b>Give</b> <b>You</b> Spacemen 3. They got a few hundred cassette copies made and produced their own artwork and booklet to accompany it, selling the tapes for £1 at a local record shop. Spacemen 3's music at this stage had a loose, swampy Blues feel; some songs included harmonica and slide guitar, and their style sounded akin to The Cramps. These early demo recordings, which Kember later recalled as being [...] "really dreadful", would later be released unofficially in 1995 on the Sympathy for the Record Industry label, thus providing an insight into the band's embryonic sound.|$|E
