5|$|In the meantime, British {{warships}} bombarded Dar es Salaam {{and destroyed}} the German wireless station there. By this time, Königsbergs engines required a thorough overhaul, and Looff {{needed to find}} a secluded area where the work could be completed. He settled on the Rufiji Delta, which had recently been surveyed by the survey ship Möwe. On 3 September 1914 at high tide, Königsberg passed over {{the bar at the}} mouth of the Rufiji and slowly made her way up the river. Coast watchers were stationed {{at the mouth of the}} river and telegraph lines were run to ensure the Germans <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by British ships searching for them. Zimmer, who was sending small coastal steamers to resupply Königsberg, observed a British cruiser—Pegasus—patrolling the coast for two weeks. He deduced that the ship would likely have to coal at Zanzibar on Sundays, and so Looff decided to attack the ship in port before he began his overhaul. He considered the action justified, since Britain had rejected a German proposal to keep central Africa neutral according to the Congo Act of 1885.|$|E

25|$|Originally, the Vernal Utah Temple (51) {{served as}} the Uintah Stake Tabernacle for Latter-day Saints in eastern Utah. The Tabernacle's {{foundation}} was constructed of nearby sandstone, with walls built of four layers of fired brick from local clay. Constructed using considerable donated labor from the fall of 1899, it was dedicated on August 24, 1907, by LDS Church president Joseph F. Smith. Smith reportedly said he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if a temple was built there some day.|$|E

He 's been fooled on the iron, and fooled on the oysters, and he 's that disgusted he 's liable to do 'most {{anything}} desperate.

25|$|On 22 March at 9:38pm Islamabad, (16:38 GMT), Gillani {{was officially}} {{announced}} by the peoples party as its candidate for the premiership of the country. Many analysts said that they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if Zardari succeeded Gillani after a few months. It was reported on 24 March 2008, that Zardari {{said he was not}} interested in the job of prime minister and that Gillani would serve until 2013 in the position. Speculation that Zardari might be gunning for the premiership grew stronger when he picked the less popular Gillani over Ameen Faheem, a much powerful member of the central executive committee. Fahmida Mirza, the newly elected Speaker of the Assembly, insisted there was no plan to replace Gillani. She added, however, that if Gillani did not do a good job, all options were open.|$|E
500|$|The {{defending}} champion was seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry who defeated O'Sullivan 9–6 in last year's final. Hendry was still angry at his loss at the Grand Prix to McCulloch, explaining, [...] "The way I {{felt at the}} Grand Prix was down {{to the fact that}} I know what I'm still capable of". The total prize fund was £200,000 and the host broadcaster was Eurosport. O'Sullivan was considered the favourite, with his mentor Ray Reardon saying [...] "Ronnie {{is in the form of}} his life and looks very close to being unstoppable at the moment". Although few top players reached the final eight in the Grand Prix, O'Sullivan said he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if they performed well in this tournament.|$|E
500|$|Durand {{was never}} {{informed}} of his character's arc and only learned more of Keamy's {{importance to the}} plot as he received new scripts; thus, he was thrilled when the role was expanded for his third appearance, in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come", when he kills Alex and Durand compared his excitement to that of [...] "a kid in a candy store." [...] He also stated that [...] "you really don't know what's {{going to happen in}} the next episode and you get the scripts pretty late, so it is pretty secretive and it's kind of exciting that way [...] you're really forced to get in the moment and say the words and play the guy". [...] Durand was initially met with negative reaction from fans on the street for this action and he defended his murderous character by arguing that it was actually more Ben's fault for failing to negotiate with Keamy; later, fans warmed up to Keamy. [...] Despite the antagonist's increasing popularity and fanbase, it became apparent to Durand that fans were hoping for Keamy's death in what promised to be a showdown in the season finale. [...] Throughout his nine-episode run, Keamy never receives an episode in which his backstory is developed through flashbacks and Durand holds this partially responsible for the negative reaction to his character, saying that the audience [...] " [...] really seen anything outside of Keamy's mission, so I think they definitely want him put down." [...] Following the season's conclusion, Durand stated that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if his character returned in the fifth season and concluding that [...] "Lost was really fun. [...] If I can have that experience in any genre, I'd take it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 1999, Callaghan told The Oldie Magazine that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to be {{considered}} as Britain's worst Prime Minister in 200 years. He also admitted in this interview that he [...] "must carry the can" [...] for the Winter of Discontent.|$|E
2500|$|A {{reporter}} from Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's most popular left-wing newspaper, questioned Panoramas practices and said: [...] "I am {{becoming more and}} more surprised with what the BBC says.

60|$|Dale had no {{idea how}} his visit would be taken, and he {{certainly}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> to <b>be</b> ordered off the place.

2500|$|But Israel’s {{ambassador}} to the United Nations Dan Gillerman initially accused Hezbollah of being responsible for the civilian deaths: [...] "Israel has [...] and asked repeatedly for the residents of Qana to leave. [...] I <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if the Hezbollah made them stay." [...] According to Human Rights Watch, though many civilians in South Lebanon refused to abandon their homes and act on the IDF's warnings, many others were unable to flee due to crumbled infrastructure. Israel singled out much of Lebanese civilian infrastructure for destruction throughout the war {{and at the end}} of the conflict the damage was estimated to top 2.5 billion dollars.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1874 {{there was}} a further complication. [...] Uruguay, the junior partner in the Triple Alliance, also {{negotiated}} a separate treaty of friendship with Paraguay − and did so {{under the auspices of}} Brazil. [...] Argentina abruptly broke off diplomatic relations with Uruguay. [...] The American minister thought that if war did break out between Argentina and Brazil, Uruguay would be on Brazil's side, and that the Argentine provinces of Corrientes and Entre Ríos (who disliked Buenos Aires, and in those days were virtually self-governing) would break away; he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if, under Brazilian influence, there was formed [...] "a new Riverine Republic … [...] would be composed of Uruguay, Entre Rios, Corrientes and Paraguay" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{eventually}} became the consensus {{candidate of the}} federalists, overcoming competition from like minded men including relative Ludwell Lee, William Fitzhugh, Martin Pickett, {{as well as two}} friends - Leven Powell and Dr. David Stuart. Opposing him for the anti-federalists was state Senator John Pope. Though there is little primary material describing the tenor of this first election, what does exist hints at a hard fought and sometimes dirty campaign. John Pope was called [...] "contemptible" [...] in a letter from John Murray to Horatio Gates, and William Allason writing to John Woodcock described the contest: [...] "I understand one makes very free with the other's Reputation [...] by wch. I <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear of their having Exchanged a few dry blows." [...] Lee eventually outpolled Pope, defeating him nearly 4 to 1 in Fairfax County alone, which included the vote of George Washington.|$|E
60|$|Tom Chist {{leaned forward}} and gazed down into the open box. He <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> to have seen it filled full of yellow gold and bright jewels.

60|$|Then {{we began}} to {{speculate}} {{as to whether it}} had been an ape-man or a Prussian that had abducted Lys. From what we knew of von Schoenvorts, we <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> at anything from him; but the footprints by the spring seemed indisputable evidence that one of Caprona's undeveloped men had borne off the girl I loved.|$|R
5000|$|Standing flat demands {{exceptional}} ball handling skills, {{which were}} {{a hallmark of}} Ella’s game. Ella’s dependable hands were lauded by former Scottish rugby international Norman Mair in The Scotsman: [...] "Ella has hands so adhesive that when he fumbled a ball against Scotland (in 1984) you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> to see those Australians of the appropriate religious persuasion cross themselves." ...|$|R

60|$|The Mormon {{boys and}} several other of her trusted men slept in their {{tarpaulin}} beds {{on the porch of}} the ranch-house that night, so that Helen at least <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised.</b> But the day came, with its manifold duties undisturbed by any event.

6000|$|Meanwhile the King and the Prince were {{considering}} {{how they should}} find the King of the Peacocks, if {{there was such a}} person in the world.

Then they said to her: ...|$|R
6000|$|He sat silent a long time, {{looking at}} the lamp. His face was hard; his long, slim fingers twitched as if longing to {{throttle}} someone; but he positively ignored Josie's presence.

5000|$|Although {{admitting that}} nothing more {{is known of}} his career, Birley notes E. Ritterling's {{suggestion}} {{that he may be}} the same man attested as a centurion in the Praetorian Guard, at some point not earlier than the reign of Septimus Severus. [...] "The rise of such a man to senatorial rank, 'von der Pike', <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a <b>surprise</b> during the reign of Elagabalus." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor thing," [...] said Flora, {{turning from}} her brother, and {{speaking}} with warmth to Fred; [...] "if you {{knew how much}} that unhappy old creature has suffered, you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to find her somewhat cross at times.

60|$|At all events, {{after what}} she had told him, she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if he made love to her.

6000|$|... "Its importance?" [...] {{broke in}} Chauvelin quietly. [...] "I dare say not. On {{the face of}} it, it appears foolish and childish: but it is {{intended}} as a taunt and is really a poor attempt at humour. They are a queer people these English.
