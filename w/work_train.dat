5|$|Located on an embankment, {{the station}} has four tracks {{with only the}} two outer ones in revenue service. The two center express tracks have been {{disconnected}} from the line and have permanently been removed from service. North of this station, {{a portion of the}} southbound express track connects with the southbound local track at its north end, and ends at a bumper block at its southern end. This section of track can be used for revenue service or <b>work</b> <b>train</b> layups, but this use has been made completely redundant because of the nearby Pitkin Yard serving as the primary layup yard instead.|$|E
5|$|A celebration {{broke out}} among the miners, who broke into liquor {{warehouses}} and saloons. That night, some of the miners loaded a flatcar with dynamite and attempted to roll it toward the deputies' camp. It overturned short of its goal and killed a cow. Other miners wanted to blow up every mine in the region, but Johnson quickly discouraged them. Frustrated, several drunken miners then stole a <b>work</b> <b>train</b> and steamed into Victor. They {{caught up with the}} group of fleeing deputies, and a gun battle broke out. One deputy and one miner died, a man on each side was wounded, and six strikers were captured by the deputies. The miners subsequently captured three officials of the Strong mine who had been present when the shafthouse was blown up. A formal prisoner exchange later freed all prisoners on both sides.|$|E

25|$|The {{signalling}} system at Liss Forest was single line telephone and ticket. The block man wrote out the ticket {{even though the}} <b>work</b> <b>train</b> was still in section. The ticket was exchanged for the one engine in steam key which controlled the section from Liss Forest to Liss. This saved the block man the trip of walking up the platform with the ticket after the <b>work</b> <b>train</b> had cleared. It was a misty day and the passenger train armed with the ticket passed the signal at red which then led to the fatal crash.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} week, the {{community}} anxiously watched rescue efforts, {{but each time}} progress was made, further cave-ins occurred; only {{the body of the}} engineer was recovered on October 10. Possibly two workers were missing. Eventually, the Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC) which regulated railroads in Virginia ordered the tunnel sealed for safety reasons. Left inside was the <b>work</b> <b>train</b> complete with a 4-4-0 steam locomotive (engine #231) and 10 flat cars.|$|E
25|$|After {{completion}} of the riverfront viaduct in 1901, the Church Hill Tunnel fell into disuse for over 20 years. Then in 1925, to add capacity, the railroad began efforts to restore it to usable condition. On October 2, while repairs were under way, a <b>work</b> <b>train</b> was trapped by a collapse near the western end. Two workmen crawled under flat cars and escaped out {{the eastern end of}} the tunnel, as did the fireman Benjamin F. Mosby (who died hours later because of the burns caused by the ruptured boiler), but the engineer Thomas Joseph Mason was killed and two other workers were unaccounted for.|$|E

25|$|On February 18, 1903, {{electric}} operation {{began on}} the line from South Ferry to 155th Street. A 66th Street Local-Express powered by Locomotive #135 was the last steam operated passenger train on the line. A few steam locomotives remained in <b>work</b> <b>train</b> service {{for a number of years}} afterwards. On June 3, 1903, the 110th Street station opened, with four elevators to get passengers up from the street to the downtown platform and the mezzanine level for uptown trains. The station had to be built with elevators because it was 63 feet above street level, and was the highest station on the line. Some say that the tower, which had the elevators, lasted into the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|A <b>work</b> <b>train</b> reached Whitehorse in late August, 1988, its intent {{being to}} haul two locomotives, parked in Whitehorse for six years, to Skagway to be {{overhauled}} and {{used on the}} tourist trains. While in Whitehorse for approximately one week, it hauled the parked rolling stock – flatcars, tankers and a caboose – out of the downtown area's sidings, and the following year, they were hauled further south, many eventually sold. Most of the tracks in downtown Whitehorse have now been torn up, and the line's terminus is six city blocks south of the old train depot at First Avenue and Main Street. A single new track along the waterfront enables {{the operation of the}} Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley, a tourist line run by a local historical society.|$|E

In 1925, the tunnel collapsed on a <b>work</b> <b>train,</b> killing four and trapping a steam locomotive and some flat cars. [...] Rescue efforts only resulted in further collapse, and the tunnel was eventually sealed for safety reasons.|$|E
2500|$|A serious {{derailment}} on 3 September 2006 {{resulted in}} the death of one section worker. A <b>work</b> <b>train,</b> Engine 114 pulling eight gravel cars, derailed approximately [...] south of Bennett, injuring all four train crew, two Canadian and two American; one died at the scene and the others had to be airlifted to a hospital. Passenger operations on the blocked section had ended for the season just before the accident. In February 2007, Engine 114 was taken for repair to the Coast Engine and Equipment Company (CEECO) in Tacoma, Washington.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1969 {{discussions were}} had with Pacific Scrap of Auckland {{with a view}} to them {{removing}} the then remaining 40 miles (61 kilometres) of the branch. [...] Pacific Scrap officials did a velocipede trip up the line for scrap assessment in early May 1969 and a contract was subsequently let to them. Removal of the line recommenced on a six-day-a-week basis from mid May 1969. The last <b>work</b> <b>train</b> had left Beaumont by early June 1969 hauled by a DJ locomotive. By early July 1969 the rail line had been removed from under the State Highway 8 road overbridge, tunnel and SH8 level crossing of Big Hill. By late July 1969 removal of the line was nearing Lawrence with the last train ever leaving Lawrence by early August 1969. By mid September 1969, Waitahuna too had seen its last train. By the end of October 1969 the last trains had moved through the Manuka Gorge and its tunnel. The final section into Clarksville was lifted on 24 November 1969. The mainline junction points and siding at Clarksville was finally removed on 29 July 1970 and so ended the Roxburgh Branch. Removal of some bridge structures further back up the line, for example the Waitahuna bridge, continued past this date into 1970, until the local Inspector of Permanent Way was satisfied the line had been demolished to [...] "Railways Department standards".|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{cars for}} the Market Street subway, numbered 1-135 and later designated as Class A-8 by SEPTA's predecessor, the Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC), were {{built by the}} Pressed Steel Car Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. between 1906 and 1911. [...] An additional set of cars, numbered 136-215, were built by the J.G. Brill Co. of Philadelphia, Pa. between 1911 and 1913. [...] The Frankford Elevated portion opened in 1922 along with another set of cars, numbered 501-600, also built by Brill that year, later receiving the designation Class A-15. [...] The two rail lines were soon merged, resulting in a combined fleet of 315 cars (215 Market Street cars, 100 Frankford cars). [...] By 1960, when the PTC began replacing the cars, the Market Street cars had been in operation for 56 years, thus having the longest lifespan of any Philadelphia subway cars, surpassing that of the original Broad Street subway fleet, which had 54 years of operation. The Frankford cars phased out at 38 years of operation. [...] After retirement, two of the [...] "Market" [...] cars (cars 69 and 163) and six of the [...] "Frankford" [...] cars were retained as <b>work</b> <b>train</b> cars (Cars #532, 551, 559, 583, 585, and 589) for some time. It is currently unknown when these cars were withdrawn, but all {{had been removed from}} SEPTA property by the 1970s, with none reported to have been saved for museums.|$|E
