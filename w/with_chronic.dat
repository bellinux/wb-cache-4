5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain.

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the role of}} regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) in the pathogenesis of human chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and its clinical resolution, we evaluated long-term recipients of pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Seventy-one recipients were evaluated, 30 of whom {{had a history of}} chronic GVHD, including 16 <b>with</b> active <b>chronic</b> GVHD and 14 <b>with</b> resolved <b>chronic</b> GVHD. There were no significant clinical differences and no differences in the frequency of Tregs (CD 4 +, CD 127 −, CD 25 +) between the recipients <b>with</b> active <b>chronic</b> GVHD and those <b>with</b> resolved <b>chronic</b> GVHD. Using the Miyara/Sakaguchi classification scheme to identify functional Tregs, a decreased frequency of functional resting Tregs (rTregs) was identified in recipients <b>with</b> active <b>chronic</b> GVHD (P = . 009 compared with normal donors; P = . 001 compared with HSCT recipients without history of chronic GVHD; P = . 005 compared with recipients <b>with</b> resolved <b>chronic</b> GVHD). The frequency and number of recent thymic emigrants in rTregs were normal in recipients <b>with</b> resolved <b>chronic</b> GVHD, but persistently decreased in recipients <b>with</b> active <b>chronic</b> GVHD. These results support the hypothesis that the reestablishment of normal numbers of functional rTregs is required for the clinical resolution of chronic GVHD...|$|R

5|$|The multifidus muscles run up {{and down}} along the back of the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone <b>with</b> <b>chronic</b> low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people <b>with</b> <b>chronic</b> low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E
5|$|Expression of Hsp90A also {{correlates}} with disease prognosis.

In human T-cells, HSP90AA1 expression is increased by the cytokines IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13. HSP90, alongside other conserved chaperones and co-chaperones that interact to safeguard proteostasis, is repressed in aging human brains. This repression was found to be further exacerbated in the brains of patients with age-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{pathology}} of non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis has not {{yet been}} sufficiently studied. AIMS: To identify the major changes of pancreatic tissue in patients surgically treated for non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. PATIENTS: Pancreatectomy specimens from 12 patients <b>with</b> non-alcoholic <b>chronic</b> pancreatitis, including four patients with autoimmune or related diseases (Sjögren's syndrome, primary sclerosing cholangitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease), were reviewed. METHODS: Morphological changes were studied histologically and immunohistochemically (to type inflammatory cells) and compared with the pancreatic alterations found in 12 patients <b>with</b> alcoholic <b>chronic</b> pancreatitis. RESULTS: In patients <b>with</b> non-alcoholic <b>chronic</b> pancreatitis, <b>with</b> or without associated autoimmune or related diseases, pancreatic inflammation particularly involved the ducts, commonly resulting in duct obstruction and occasionally duct destruction. None of these features was seen in alcoholic chronic pancreatitis which, however, showed pseudocysts and calcifications. CONCLUSION: The pancreatic changes in patients <b>with</b> non-alcoholic <b>chronic</b> pancreatitis clearly differ from those <b>with</b> alcoholic <b>chronic</b> pancreatitis.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the expression of}} glucokinase (GCK) mRNA and glucose transporter- 2 (GLUT 2) in the liver tissues of patients <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B and to preliminarily investigate their roles in abnormal glucose metabolism among patients <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B. MethodsThe expression of GCK mRNA in the liver tissues of 10 patients <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B and 10 patients with liver cirrhosis (Child-Turcotte-Pugh grade A) was evaluated by RT-PCR. The expression of GLUT 2 in the liver tissues of the above 10 patients <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B and 10 normal controls was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The t-test was used for mean comparison between groups; the Pearson correlation test was used for correlation analysis. ResultsThe expression level of GCK mRNA in liver tissue was significantly lower in the patients <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B than in those with liver cirrhosis (1. 13 ± 0. 11 vs 1  44 ± 0. 14, P＜ 0. 05). In the patients <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B, the level of GCK mRNA in liver tissue had a positive correlation with the oxidation rate of carbohydrates (r= 0. 845, P＜ 0. 01), but it had no correlation with fasting blood glucose (r= 0. 03, P＞ 0. 05). The expression of GLUT 2 was reduced in the liver tissues of patients <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B, and it was distributed in the hepatic cells around pseudolobuli (nodules). ConclusionThe level of GCK mRNA {{is closely related to}} the oxidation of carbohydrates. The decreased expression of GCK mRNA and GLUT 2 is one of the mechanisms of abnormal glucose metabolism in patients <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that general and {{specific}} cognitive dysfunction may be present during the early stages of chronic kidney disease. These studies, however, were conducted in elderly patients with comorbid conditions and used a limited battery of cognitive tests. Here we determined whether 40 - to 54 -year-old women in a population-based cohort in Taiwan <b>with</b> moderate <b>chronic</b> kidney disease have reduced cognitive performance. In total, 64 women <b>with</b> moderate <b>chronic</b> kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) stage 3) were randomly matched by age and education with 192 control individuals with eGFR stage 2 or better. All patients underwent the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, visual memory, verbal fluency, Trail Making Test, digit spans, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale neuropsychological tests. Women <b>with</b> moderate <b>chronic</b> kidney disease had significantly worse performance in delayed recalls and backward digit span than controls. Mixed effects modeling showed that women <b>with</b> moderate <b>chronic</b> kidney disease had reduced cognitive performance after controlling for body mass index, menopausal status, and psychosocial distress. Thus, in a population-based sample, we found that midlife women have reduced cognitive performance associated <b>with</b> early-stage <b>chronic</b> kidney disease.
