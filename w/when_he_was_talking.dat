500|$|After {{seeing a}} {{commercial}} about starving children in Africa, Cartman, Stan, Kenny and Kyle send money to Sally Struthers' charity organization, the Christian Children's Fund. They {{do not care}} about the cause, but want the free sports watch {{that comes with the}} sponsorship. However, due to a miscommunication, an Ethiopian boy is delivered to the boys instead of the watch. Although initially shocked, the four boys befriend him, and Cartman names the boy Starvin' Marvin ("Marvin" [...] being given to him by the apparent pronunciation of the name <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> in his native language). Meanwhile, mobs of wild turkeys begin attacking and killing South Park residents. Mad scientist Dr. Mephisto tries to warn Mayor McDaniels that genetically engineered turkeys he had been breeding to feed to the poor have gone crazy and are now attacking humans. Mephisto is instead ignored and ridiculed by McDaniels.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Monaco was first prototyped when Andy Schatz {{was working for}} TKO Software, a video game {{development}} company based in Santa Cruz, California. The game was originally inspired by the top-down minimap in the Hitman series and was described by Schatz as being similar to Jason Rohrer's 2014 video game The Castle Doctrine during its early stages of development. His original plans were to release Monaco as an Xbox Live Indie Games title, made within six weeks. He said that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to people about it at this stage, he described it as [...] "The Sims meets Diablo meets Hitman". The development at TKO was done in three weeks while the company solicited paying work. Before TKO shut down in 2005, Schatz left and founded his own independent company, Pocketwatch Games. After Pocketwatch Games experimented with simulation games, such as 2006 Independent Games Festival finalist [...] and Wildlife Tycoon: Venture Dinosauria, Schatz prototyped {{an early version of}} Monaco using Microsoft XNA as to see if it worked on the Xbox 360.|$|E
500|$|Another {{alternative}} and younger version of Mileena {{appears in the}} 2011 live-action webisode series , portrayed by martial artist Jolene Tran in her acting debut. Their story is told in the two-part episode [...] "Kitana & Mileena," [...] which featured both animated and live-action sequences. Mileena is {{shown to be a}} Shang Tsung-created clone like in the games, but of an age similar to Kitana's, as they were together since their infancy, and her scarred but otherwise normal-looking mouth (with lips, except as a baby) changes as her teeth grow when she is overcome by a cannibalistic rage. The adolescent Mileena is clad in violet, {{does not appear to be}} Kitana's twin, and is seen wearing a mask only in some of the animated sections (in which both of them are wearing outfits similar to those in Mortal Kombat II). She is shown spar-dueling against Kitana and losing to her, then killing and devouring a palace guard in a fit of insanity, as well as killing impostors of King Jerrod, Kitana's biological father, in a team together with Kitana. When the two are eventually sent by Shao Kahn on a mission to assassinate the actual King Jerrod, Mileena kills him with a double sai throw to the chest <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to Kitana.|$|E
5000|$|The Monocle is {{mentioned}} in Batman: The Brave and the Bold - The Videogame by Hawkman <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about how Gentleman Ghost {{reminds him of}} the Monocle.|$|R

6000|$|... "Never mind yourself," [...] {{interposed}} Mrs. Milroy, sharply. [...] "Go on {{with what}} your father said. What {{was he doing}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about Miss Gwilt? How did he look?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Prescott {{with some}} hesitation. [...] "I recognize the address, though the English stamp has gone. It was lying near <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> {{to me on}} the night of the trouble in Sebastian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I heerd their Eye-talian jabber," [...] {{answered}} Ithuel; [...] "but supposed it was {{all about}} saints' days and eating fish. No reasonable man makes so much noise <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> sense." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I declare," [...] said Nina, [...] "sometimes, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking,</b> I think him {{perfectly}} lovely. The fire {{comes out}} of his eyes, and he rubs his old red hairs about till they sparkle. Then he shines all over like a carbuncle, and every word he says makes me die of laughter." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kenta <b>is</b> Shikanosuke's classmate. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> {{the guitarist}} of the {{well-known}} band Star Generation in Kirakira, and also coaches d2b. <b>He</b> tends to <b>be</b> frank and cold, but <b>he</b> <b>is</b> passionate <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about music. <b>He</b> holds a Fender Stratocaster.

6000|$|... "Master Micklethwaite always puts up here, when {{he visits}} Dunbar," [...] the {{landlord}} said. [...] "I must have misunderstood him, for one day, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> with me, {{he said that}} it was a trouble to him that he had no sons." ...|$|E
6000|$|Why, {{how could}} I talk <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking?</b> He [...] "held the age," [...] as the poker-clergy say, and two can't {{talk at the}} same time with good effect. It reminds me of the man who was reproached by a friend, who said, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will it ever be as civilised, Dan? I heard father say last week, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to Brossom, that {{he never}} thought it would be,--so long as Texas was joined to Coahuila and belonged to the Mexican Confederation.

5000|$|All {{of these}} {{different}} relationships involve getting on well with someone, though Aristotle at times implies that something more like actual liking <b>is</b> required. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about the character or disposition that falls between obsequiousness or flattery {{on the one hand}} and surliness or quarrelsomeness on the other, he says that this state: ...|$|R
60|$|It is from Auckland {{that one}} goes to Rotorua, {{the region of}} the renowned hot lakes and geysers--one of the chief wonders of New Zealand; but I was not well enough to make the trip. The {{government}} has a sanitorium there, and everything is comfortable for the tourist and the invalid. The government's official physician is almost over-cautious in his estimates of the efficacy of the baths, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about rheumatism, gout, paralysis, and such things; but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about the effectiveness of the waters in eradicating the whisky-habit, he seems to have no reserves. The baths will cure the drinking-habit no matter how chronic it is--and cure it so effectually that even the desire to drink intoxicants will come no more. There should be a rush from Europe and America to that place; and when the victims of alcoholism find out what they can get by going there, the rush will begin.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are three}} times in a man's life <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talked</b> about,--when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> born, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> married, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> dies."

[...] (In reference to a claim by the guests of the bar-room on the man Amasa Richardson for a treat.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor young fellow! He {{always makes}} me feel sad, somehow. He has such a pathetic face. I don't believe I ever saw him look quite happy, except that night at Mrs. Horn's, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> with Miss Vance; and then he made me feel sadder than ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} have much to drive out of you, Skinner," [...] Rupert Clinton laughed. [...] "I believe Easton puts about half of it on, on purpose to excite you.

6000|$|... "He didn't {{have a fair}} test <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> {{with his}} mother, 'cause {{there was no chance}} she would pay him for the information.

5000|$|Brainwave is {{mentioned}} in Batman: The Brave and the Bold - The Videogame. Hawkman mentions him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about villains {{that he used}} to face. Hawkman states that Brainwave had a head [...] "that must've been three feet tall". Batman comments that he always got Brainwave and Doctor Sivana mixed up to which Hawkman replies [...] "You're not the only one, kid." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{an article}} by Robert C. Martin, the {{dependency}} inversion principle and abstraction by layering come together. His reason {{to use the term}} [...] "inversion" [...] is in comparison with traditional software development methods. He describes the uncoupling of services by the abstraction of layers <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about dependency inversion. The principle is used to find out where system borders are {{in the design of the}} abstraction layers.|$|R

Gammelman (name meaning [...] "old man") is the (somewhat senile) elder of the Midgard village, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> an Aesir Gothi aged around 100. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> sexually kinky {{and often}} {{refers to the}} gods' sexual parts <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about them. <b>He</b> uses unrecommended methods to heal people, such as pouring hot water in the anus of the king <b>when</b> <b>he</b> has toothache. He often intends to {{sacrifice}} the monk Peter Nicolaus.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I believe so; I {{know that}} the General is putting him up at his quarters. He has been here about a week. I think he is some man from England, traveling, I suppose, to see the world. I heard the Adjutant speak of him as Mr. Simcoe <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about the affair." ...|$|E
60|$|Abner was so {{interested}} in the matter, and seemed so bright and cheerful <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about it, that Toby's fears regarding his illness were entirely dispelled; {{he came to the}} conclusion that Abner had simply been tired, as Aunt Olive had said, and that he would be better than ever by morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Miss Jones," [...] said Uncle Jaw, [...] "how you talk! Well, to be sure, 'Squire Jones is {{dead and}} gone, and it's as well not to call it cheatin', as I was tellin' Deacon Enos <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about that 'ere lot--that 'ere lot, you know, that he sold the deacon, and never let him have the deed on't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, he clings {{very much}} to me, poor fellow, and is nearly as much cast down as at first. He has persuaded himself that poor Juliana always {{continued}} what <b>he</b> thought her <b>when</b> they met in their youth. Perhaps she had the germs of it in her, but I sometimes hardly know which way to look <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about her, and then I take shame to myself for the hard judgments I cannot put away even now!' ...|$|R
60|$|But Jim was asleep. Tom looked kind of ashamed, {{because you}} know a person always feels bad <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> {{uncommon}} fine and thinks the other person is admiring, and that other person goes to sleep that way. Of course he oughtn't to go to sleep, because it's shabby; but the finer a person talks the certainer {{it is to make}} you sleep, and so when you come to look at it it ain't nobody's fault in particular; both of them's to blame.|$|R
6000|$|When they returned, Anne {{followed}} {{her mother to}} her room, to talk over {{the events of the}} previous day. After much had been said of the Consecration, and also of their wonder and regret at Rupert's absence, Anne said, 'How strange it seems to lose sight of you and Papa as I have done ever since I have been here! Mamma, I have scarcely been with you at all, and never see Papa but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> to Uncle Woodbourne, and everyone else is in the room.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{they could}} have shot us the moment I first fired. But Uncle said, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to me one day, {{that he had heard}} that the Stranglers did not carry firearms, because the reports might attract attention; and that {{it was a matter of}} religion, with them, to kill their victims by strangling; but that if the Strangler failed, which he very seldom did, the other men would then {{despatch}} the victims with their swords and knives.|$|E
60|$|She {{was so far}} {{successful}} that she soon found herself tête-à-tête with the doctor in his own study. She was no whit dismayed by the pair of human thigh-bones which lay close to his hand, and which, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> in that den of his own, {{he was in the}} constant habit of handling with much energy; nor was she frightened out of her propriety even by the little child's skull which grinned at her from off the chimney-piece.|$|E

"Now I {{think of}} it," [...] Malcolm said, [...] "one of the {{officers}} I served under had a relation, a lady, whom I have heard him say, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to another officer, is shut up here, either because she wouldn't marry some one her father didn't want her to, I forget {{exactly what it was}} now. Let me see, what was her name. Elise -- no, that wasn't it. Amelie -- Amelie de Recambours -- yes, that was it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Marvel 1602, Beast {{is known}} as Hal McCoy and retains his {{original}} appearance of a human with lengthy {{arms and legs and}} enormous hands and feet. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> well spoken and eloquent, and a member of Carlos Javier's (Professor X) group of [...] "witchbreeds", though he tends to not give others a chance to speak <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking.</b> <b>When</b> several soldiers stare at him, he glowers and attributes his appearance to his origin as an Orkneyman. He also tells of his mother's humiliation <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born, her cruel neighbours having suggested that Hal's father was an ape.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy {{is being}} {{portrayed as a}} clumsy gay {{flatulent}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> to Grizz and Dot Com about his college days. He {{goes on to say}} that he [...] "went both ways" [...] and was [...] "on the DL." [...] It is then presumed that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> gay because of his misconstrued statements. Angie's gay friend D'Fwan (Tituss Burgess) talks to him about this.
