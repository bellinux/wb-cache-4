50|$|Wall mounted pot racks are {{designed}} to hang on the wall to save space. Wall pot racks can appear like a horizontal bar or can look like a small hanging shelf. Bar pot racks are just a strip of metal that attaches to <b>wall</b> <b>studs</b> in two places. Pots are hung on the knob that protrude from the bar. Wall pot racks are safely attached to screws that are drilled into <b>wall</b> <b>studs,</b> not plaster or drywall.|$|E

50|$|Grab bars {{must bear}} high loads and sudden impacts, and most jurisdictions have {{building}} regulations specifying what loads they must bear. They are generally mounted to masonry walls {{or to the}} <b>studs</b> of <b>stud</b> <b>walls</b> (which {{may need to be}} specially strengthened). They can be mounted through drywall into a strong wooden <b>wall</b> <b>stud</b> or other structural member, but not mounted only on the drywall, as it will not bear the users' weight.|$|R

50|$|Interior {{partitions}} supporting floor, ceiling or roof loads {{are called}} loadbearing walls; others are called non-loadbearing or simply partitions. Interior loadbearing walls are {{framed in the}} same way as exterior <b>walls.</b> <b>Studs</b> are usually 1.5 x 3.5 in lumber spaced at 16 in on center. This spacing may be changed to 12 or 24 in depending on the loads supported and the type and thickness of the wall finish used.|$|R

40|$|To make {{workshop}} {{drawings for}} a wooden frame structure, computer programmes are used that {{also have a}} possibility to transfer data to a CNC machine. In the process of design of wood framing systems it is extremely important to choose the right type of wood joints. In {{order to make the}} design easy to manufacture; to allow for quick transfer to a CNC machine and to fulfil the structural requirements, the right joints between the individual structural elements should be selected. This thesis presents the design development of workshop drawings and data processing for transfer to a CNC machine. The approach is demonstrated on a simple single-family house and makes use {{of some of the most}} commonly used wooden joints between elements: bottom plate – <b>wall</b> <b>stud,</b> <b>wall</b> <b>stud</b> – diagonal bracing, single stud – horizontal plate. Each CNC machine is manufactured according to a request of a customer, who can choose between different aggregates. Some basic types of Hundegger’s CNC machines are shown and described. Wooden joints were analysed on the basis of the time needed by the CNC machine for their production, and so the total processing time for the facility was specified...|$|R

50|$|Ceramic knobs were {{cylindrical}} {{and generally}} nailed {{directly into the}} <b>wall</b> <b>studs</b> or floor joists. Most had a circular groove running around their circumference, although some were constructed in two pieces with pass-through grooves {{on each side of}} the nail in the middle. A leather washer often cushioned the ceramic, to reduce breakage during installation.|$|E
50|$|Although cold-formed {{steel is}} used for several {{products}} in building construction, framing products are different {{in that they are}} typically used for <b>wall</b> <b>studs,</b> floor joists, rafters, and truss members. Examples of cold-formed steel that would not be considered framing includes metal roofing, roof and floor deck, composite deck, metal siding, and purlins and girts on metal buildings.|$|E

The river ran along the city's {{northern}} wall before entering Antioch from the northwest and exiting east through the northern half of the city. Mount Silpius, crested by a citadel, was the Antioch's highest point and rose some 1000 ft above the valley floor. There were six gates through which the city could be entered: three along the northern wall, and one on each of the south, east, and west sides.|$|R
40|$|Moisture {{penetration}} around {{windows and}} doors {{is a problem with}} serious consequences for <b>stud</b> <b>walls</b> and is a common problem regardless of facade systems. The problem has received considerable focus in recent times, as buildings using ETICS (External thermal insulation composite systems) on <b>stud</b> <b>walls</b> have been damaged by penetrating water. In the present paper a robust moisture safe prefabricated window connection for <b>stud</b> <b>walls</b> is proposed. The connector is a device which is linking the facade, <b>stud</b> <b>wall</b> and window and facilitates water sealing. As a result a prototype has been developed and tested in accordance with standard practice. The new window connection is easy to be mounted and is suitable for facades consisting of ETICS, wood paneling or sheet materials and makes it possible to install the window after the facade is complete...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} effort {{focuses on}} the evaluation of existing design standards for cold-formed steel <b>stud</b> <b>walls</b> and the develop-ment of retrofit wall systems. Full-scale wall systems are tested under uniform static pressure using a vacuum chamber. The resistance functions obtained are used to model the dynamic behavior of the walls and to predict performance under blast conditions. This paper focuses on defining the static resistance of nonload-bearing steel <b>stud</b> <b>walls</b> with slip track connections and their performance under external explosions. Simple modifications to existing design practice have significantly improved the blast performance of the steel <b>stud</b> <b>walls.</b> Maximum blast resistance is achieved by using steel angles connected to the studs and anchored {{to the floor and}} ceiling. The static and dynamic performances of five full-scale steel <b>stud</b> <b>wall</b> systems are presented in this paper...|$|R

25|$|The {{nature of}} the Emerald City is changed in the film. In the book, the city is not {{actually}} all green, but everyone is forced to wear green tinted spectacles (ostensibly to protect their eyes from the glory and splendor of the luxurious city), thus making everything appear green. In the film, the city is actually all green. The architecture of the Emerald City in the movie uses a much more contemporary Art Deco style than Baum could have imagined. In the book, a giant green <b>wall</b> <b>studded</b> in glittering emeralds surrounds the entire city, whereas in the movie {{there is only a}} gate opening.|$|R
40|$|The {{radiation}} efficiency of different plasterboard walls was determined through measurements in the direct sound transmission facilities at the University of Applied Science in Stuttgart. The {{radiation efficiency}} was determined using airborne sound excitation in the source room. The velocity on the plasterboard {{on the receiving}} room side was measured using accelerometers and the radiated sound power was calculated from the sound pressure level in the diffuse receiving room. In this study it was identified that the radiation efficiency of identical boards depends strongly {{on the construction of}} the wall (shaft <b>wall,</b> single <b>stud</b> <b>wall,</b> double <b>stud</b> <b>wall)</b> and in the low frequency range also on the mass-spring-mass resonance frequency of the double walls. The typical shape of the radiation factor, going from high to low frequencies, shows a decrease below the critical frequency of the plasterboard (at approx. 3 kHz) down to approx. - 15 dB in the frequency range from 1250 Hz to 250 Hz. Below 250 Hz the radiation factor increases again, almost up to 0 dB in the frequency region close to the resonance frequency of the mass-spring-mass resonance. Why there is this increase of the radiation efficiency at low frequencies is explained through calculations that are related to the stiffness of the complete construction.
