[...] (“In-focus” is defined as when a Web page is the primary window open on a user's screen, unobstructed by any other application window. Web page focus can be affected by: minimizing the browser, opening or switching to another browser window or application, opening or switching to another browser <b>window</b> <b>tab,</b> or placing the curser on the browser address bar or other browser button).|$|E
50|$|The Session Restore feature restores <b>windows,</b> <b>tabs,</b> text {{typed in}} forms, and in-progress {{downloads}} {{from the last}} user session. It will be activated automatically when installing an application update or extension, and users will be asked {{if they want to}} resume their previous session after a system crash.|$|R
50|$|Nomad.NET is a {{freeware}} orthodox {{file manager}} (OFM) for Microsoft Windows. Some features include a built-in FTP client, archive file navigation, folder comparison and synchronization, and a multi-file renaming tool. In {{addition to being}} an orthodox file manager, Nomad.NET features two-windowed mode, tree window for each panel, horizontal and vertical splitting of the <b>windows,</b> <b>tab</b> browsing etc.|$|R

50|$|Pluma is a {{graphical}} application {{which supports}} editing multiple text files in one <b>window</b> (<b>tabs</b> or MDI). It fully supports international text through {{its use of}} the Unicode UTF-8 encoding. As a general purpose text editor, pluma supports most standard editor features, and emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. Its core feature set includes syntax highlighting of source code, auto indentation, and printing support with print preview.|$|R
50|$|Because the tabbed {{document}} interface holds many different documents logically under one window, {{it keeps the}} primary operating system interface free of the clutter that would be created by {{a large number of}} small child windows. Another advantage is that sets of related documents can be grouped within each of several <b>windows.</b> <b>Tabbed</b> web browsers often allow users to save their browsing session and return to it later.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Windowed</b> or <b>tabbed</b> {{interface}} (tabs are multiline and dockable to any side of {{the main}} window; tabs can be preserved across restarts).|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{terminal}} sessions may {{be organized}} within single GNOME Terminal <b>window</b> as <b>tabs.</b> Switching between active session is possible either by using keyboard shortcuts or by using tab bar - {{a row of}} buttons, each corresponding to active session, that appears on top of GNOME Terminal <b>window</b> when multiple <b>tabs</b> are used. Similar to the profile feature, each tab can be assigned a name.|$|R
50|$|Pop-up (or <b>tabbed)</b> <b>windows</b> in the Finder.|$|R
5000|$|The Browser app replaces browser <b>windows</b> with <b>tabs,</b> adds an incognito mode for {{anonymous}} browsing, {{and presents}} bookmarks and {{history in a}} unified view, among other features.|$|R
5000|$|Workspaces: {{groups of}} web browser <b>windows</b> and <b>tabs</b> in them. A user can have {{multiple}} workspaces for different web research topics and quickly switch between {{them with a}} key shortcut or menu choice.|$|R
5000|$|The {{downside}} is that every separate <b>window</b> or <b>tab</b> will initially have an empty [...] property when opened. Furthermore, the property {{can be used for}} tracking visitors across different websites, making it of concern for Internet privacy.|$|R
5000|$|Some window {{managers}} {{provide a}} <b>tabbed</b> <b>windows</b> facility that groups applications together in common frames.|$|R
50|$|In Mac OS X Panther, brushed metal {{was brought}} to the Finder. New buttons were made to appear sunken into their surroundings, {{following}} a general trend of more flattened interface elements in the operating system. The traditional pinstripes were replaced with a much subtler theme, most notably in the menu bar, and the use of transparency was again reduced (for example in the title bars of inactive <b>windows).</b> <b>Tabs</b> also changed; they were made flatter and the whole tab area was sunken rather than raised. Tab buttons were centered on the top border of the tab area. New icons appeared across the system, including a new flatter, glossier Finder icon and a new System Preferences icon.|$|R

5000|$|Break Opens, {{also known}} as breakopens, break open cards, strip tickets, nevada tickets or in some Bingo Halls as [...] "pickles" [...] are lottery or bingo cards on which there are {{concealed}} letters, numbers, or symbols that have been predetermined as winners. The cards are often made of cardboard and contain perforated cover <b>window</b> <b>tabs,</b> behind which the combinations are printed. The purchaser must [...] "break open" [...] the card, or pull up the pull-tabs, to see the information printed within, and then must confirm with winning combinations printed {{on the back of}} the card, various cards may have come from the printer highlighted as winning under the tabs. The winning combination will be highlighted, making the identification of winning tickets easier.|$|R
5000|$|The sudo {{command-line}} utility {{with which}} a user can execute a command as another user, typically as root, is configured with the [...] "tty_tickets" [...] flag by default, restricting the session timeout {{to the terminal}} session (such as a <b>window</b> or <b>tab)</b> in which the user authenticated the program.|$|R
5000|$|Saves {{the current}} set of open <b>windows</b> and <b>tabs</b> (and {{associated}} history), at a preset interval and/or on command.

5000|$|... twm (<b>Tab</b> <b>Window</b> Manager) is {{a window}} manager for the X Window System. Started in 1987 by Tom LaStrange, {{it has been the}} {{standard}} window manager for the X Window System since version X11R4. The name originally stood for Tom's Window Manager, but the software was renamed <b>Tab</b> <b>Window</b> Manager by the X Consortium when they adopted it in 1989. twm is a re-parenting window manager that provides title bars, shaped windows and icon management. It is highly configurable and extensible.|$|R
50|$|The {{interface}} of Path Finder {{follows the}} common navigational file manager paradigm, {{also called the}} browser paradigm, {{as opposed to the}} spatial style. Most operations take place in a single window, although more <b>windows</b> or <b>tabs</b> can be opened. The interface can further be customized by enabling or disabling various panels and/or their corresponding functionality.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in Opera 10.50, users {{could open}} a private {{browsing}} session in a tab {{in the current}} window, instead of a separate <b>window.</b> Private <b>Tabs</b> would not record browsing history, use the web cache, or stored passwords, and forget any information accessed in the Tab when it is closed. This feature was replaced by Private Windows in Opera 15.|$|R
50|$|In {{interface}} design, a tabbed {{document interface}} (TDI) or Tab is a graphical control element that allows multiple documents or panels to be contained {{within a single}} <b>window,</b> using <b>tabs</b> as a navigational widget for switching between sets of documents. It is an interface style most commonly associated with web browsers, web applications, text editors, and preference panes.|$|R
5000|$|In many {{graphical}} applications, {{especially on}} <b>Windows,</b> the <b>Tab</b> key will move the focus to every control or widget such as buttons {{so that the}} user interface can be used without a mouse at all (this {{was part of the}} IBM Common User Access design). On OS X, this is an option called [...] "Full Keyboard Access".|$|R
50|$|If a user is {{logged in}} with their Microsoft account on both their Windows 8.1 device and <b>Windows</b> Phone, their <b>tabs</b> on IE11 will now sync automatically.|$|R
50|$|A special {{version was}} {{designed}} to exploit the new design elements of Vista's Windows Presentation Foundation and entitled a whole new user interface and features. It lacked some basic functions such as webcam support and Chat, and has since been discontinued. It was arguably the better looking and functional in respect to <b>windows</b> and <b>tabs</b> management but was eventually discontinued by Yahoo.|$|R
50|$|ConEmu (short for Console emulator) is a {{free and}} {{open-source}} tabbed terminal emulator for Windows. ConEmu presents multiple consoles and simple GUI applications as one customizable GUI <b>window</b> with <b>tabs</b> and a status bar. It also provides emulation for ANSI escape codes for color, bypassing {{the capabilities of the}} standard Windows Console Host to provide 256 and 24-bit color in Windows.|$|R
50|$|Although the tabbed {{document}} interface does allow for multiple views under one window, {{there are problems}} with this interface. One such problem is dealing with many tabs at once. When a <b>window</b> is <b>tabbed</b> to a certain number that exceeds the available area of the monitor, the tabs clutter up (this is the same problem as with SDI but moved to another place in the user interface).|$|R
50|$|Mudbox's {{interface}} includes menus, <b>tabbed</b> <b>windows,</b> and tool trays, {{and can be}} customized to {{a limited}} extent. It also provides keyboard shortcuts. The navigation in the 3D view {{is similar to that}} of Autodesk Maya.|$|R

50|$|Thus, {{although}} <b>tabbed</b> <b>windows</b> {{are adequate}} in environments {{where there is}} a minimal necessity for tabs (around ten tabs or less), this scheme does not scale, and alternate methods may be required to address this issue.|$|R
5000|$|Better yet, <b>tabbed</b> <b>window</b> {{interfaces}} {{can give}} the user the freedom to position the tabs along any edge, so all four edges are available to organize different groups of tabs as the user or application sees fit. The PSIBER visual PostScript programming environment for NeWS had tabbed views that you could stick onto the stack (represented as a [...] "spike"), and you could move the tabs to any edge. The NeWS pie menu and <b>tab</b> <b>window</b> manager enabled users to position the tabs anywhere along any edge, and the tabs popped up pie menus with window management functions, to uncover and bury windows, etc.|$|R
50|$|In some respects, {{this can}} be more secure than cookies {{due to the fact}} that its {{contents}} are not automatically sent to the server on every request like cookies are, so it is not vulnerable to network cookie sniffing attacks. However, if special measures are not taken to protect the data, it is vulnerable to other attacks because the data is available across different websites opened in the same <b>window</b> or <b>tab.</b>|$|R
50|$|Notepad++ is a {{text editor}} and source code editor {{for use with}} Microsoft <b>Windows.</b> It {{supports}} <b>tabbed</b> editing, which allows working with multiple open files in a single window. The project's name comes from the C increment operator.|$|R
50|$|Reunion 5 was {{announced}} on September 1997 {{and saw the}} introduction of drag and drop capabilities when working with the family card. Editing also became easier with start of <b>tabbed</b> <b>windows</b> to allow for faster, more efficient data entry.|$|R
50|$|Opera {{supports}} tabbed browsing. This means multiple {{web pages}} can be opened {{within the same}} application <b>window.</b> The <b>tabs</b> can be managed in a tab bar (opening, closing, rearranging, etc.). The user is given options to perform actions such as cloning a tab with its complete history or pinning it.Notably, {{the part of the}} tab which displays a page's favicon is used as the indicator of the page loading progress. Also, open tabs can be previewed by hovering your mouse above the tab. This can be disable thought the settings menu.|$|R
