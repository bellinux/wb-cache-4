5|$|Khandoba is {{described}} as doing odd jobs under Banai's orders. Banai first assigns him the task of sweeping the entire vada. He is responsible for cleaning the sheep pens and taking the sheep and lambs for grazing. He completes all tasks by spreading his magical bhandara. The shepherds are astonished how a single old man can handle all the animals. Their vanity is crushed. Banai assigns him the additional responsibility {{of taking care of}} five hundred children. She commands if any sheep or lamb is lost or a child cries, she <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> him his food. But Khandoba fulfils the tasks again by spraying his bhandara. She assigns him the job of washing the sheep and lambs. Instead, Khandoba kills all her sheep and lambs to humble the shepherds and Banai. He skins the sheep and separates the meat. A repentant Banai begs his forgiveness; he agrees to revive her flock on the condition that Banai marries him. Khandoba revives the sheep by spreading his bhandara and reveals his true form.|$|E

5|$|On DS9, Sisko informs Nog that he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> him a {{recommendation}} {{as he has}} concerns {{that it is a}} scheme. Nog confesses that he wants to do it so that he doesn't turn out like his father Rom (Max Grodénchik), whom he describes as an engineering genius but his culture won't let him pursue it. Sisko, stunned by this confession of a Ferengi having such upstanding ambitions, responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy. Odo is suspicious of Kira's responses and points a phaser at her, demanding to know who she is. Kira and the crystal suddenly morph into the female Founder (Salome Jens), who reveals that she stole the Maquis ship and she was hoping to convince Odo to return to the Dominion.

The next day {{there is a}} story in the paper of how the painting mysteriously disappeared. A letter from the thief appears in the newspaper, telling the public that he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> back A Lady Writing until they prove which Vermeer paintings were truly painted by him.

A ball that is rolled too fast <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> the pins enough time to “mix” with other pins, or in other words, to knock each other down in a domino effect motion. Conversely, a ball rolled too slowly will deflect too much and {{will not be able to}} knock down all the pins.|$|E

He states that Marlo expects his people to stand behind him, yet he himself does not stand behind people who work for him. He tells McNulty that the game is rigged and that he feels like a pawn on a chessboard, showing that some of D'Angelo Barksdale's teachings were not lost on him. He offers McNulty information to bring down Marlo, but openly tells McNulty that he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> any information on any former Barksdale associate. McNulty, out of genuine respect, tells Bodie that he is a soldier.|$|E

Mary must return to the village as the family will discuss the problem and it is only Mary to which her sister listens. Alexis <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> Mary permission to leave work although Mary insists that she can complete the clothing while away. Alexis is not persuaded. Mary finds out that her boyfriend is married and she breaks up with him. Alexis takes pity on Mary and allows her to take time off from work in order to sort out her problems. Alexis books a flight ticket for Mary so that the dust and dirt of regular ground travel will not mar the clothing that Mary is given permission to take with her while away during that busy time of work.|$|E
25|$|Ice {{cream is}} a {{colloidal}} emulsion having dispersed phase as fat globules. It is an emulsion {{which is in}} the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which is frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in far are non polar and will adhere to itself by van der Waals interactions. Water is polar thus, emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> hard texture.|$|E

This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder.

25|$|The French army {{arrives at}} the {{barricade}} and demands that the students surrender ("At the Barricade—Upon These Stones"). Though Javert tells the students {{that the government will}} not attack that night ("Javert's Arrival"), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert ("Little People"). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that all the people of Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. Éponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms ("A Little Fall of Rain"). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over Éponine's death. Valjean {{arrives at the}} barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier ("Night of Anguish"), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels are suspicious of him at first, but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras {{to be the one to}} execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean says there are no conditions to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty. ("The First Attack").|$|E
