Scratch tests were conducted on <b>wet</b> <b>enamel</b> surface under constant load of 1000  μN. The length of the scratch was 10  μm; the sliding speed was 0.5  μm/s. Ten scratches were made on each sample, and the distance between them was at least 10  μm. During each scratch test, normal load, normal displacement, and lateral force were continuously recorded.|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: The use of dentine bondings on enamel and dentin {{in total}} etch {{protocols}} has recently become popular. Unfilled resin is hydrophobic and dentin bonding is hydrophilic in nature. This chemical difference could {{be effective in}} enamel bonding process. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the shear bond strength of unfilled resin to dry enamel and dentin bonding to dry and moist enamel. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, a total of 30 incisor teeth were used. The specimens were randomly assigned to three groups of 10. 37 % phosphoric acid etchant was applied to the enamel surfaces in each group for 15 seconds, rinsed with water for 20 seconds and dried for 20 seconds with compressed air in groups one and two. After conditioning, group 1 received unfilled resin (Margin Bond, Colten) and group 2 received dentin bonding (Single Bond, 3 M) and in group 3 after conditioning and rinsing with water, a layer of dentin bonding (Single Bond) was applied on <b>wet</b> <b>enamel.</b> The enamel and dentin bonding were light cured for 20 seconds. A ring mold 3. 5 mm in diameter and 2 mm height was placed over the specimens to receive the composite filling material (Z 100, 3 M). The composite was cured for 40 seconds. The specimens were thermocycled and shear bond strengths were determined using an Instron Universal Testing Machine. The findings were analyzed by ANOVA One-Way and Tukey HSD tests. Results: Shear bond strength of dentin bonding to dry enamel was significantly less than unfilled resin to dry enamel (P< 0. 05). There was no significant difference between the bond strength of dentin bonding to moist and dry enamel. In addition bond strength of dentin bonding to <b>wet</b> <b>enamel</b> was not significantly different from unfilled resin to dry enamel. Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, it is suggested that enamel surface should remain slightly moist after etching before bonding with single bond but when using unfilled resin, the enamel surface should be kept dry...|$|R
40|$|The damage {{promoted}} on {{two different}} kinds of enamelled specimens was evaluated. One was coated with a single layer of pyrolytic electrostatic powder enamel (referred to as black enamel), {{and the other was}} coated with ground coat <b>wet</b> <b>enamel</b> (white enamel). Specimens were cyclically subjected to the action of an oven cleaner and temperatures of about 250 °C. After a few cycles the surfaces lost their smooth, shiny appearance, revealing that some damage was induced during the treatment. Roughness measurements and electrochemical tests showed that the degradation of the coating was rather superficial and that the metal substrate was still very well protected. Further tests showed different performances {{depending on the type of}} coating. While the black enamel revealed some pits with brown corrosion products across the surface, indicating the onset of attack of the base metal, the white enamel displayed a surface that was highly porous compared with the untreated specimens. Potentiodynamic polarisation curves showed the presence of a pitting potential together with a hysteresis loop for the black enamel, indicating the presence of small pores providing access for electrolyte (chloride) to corrode the metal base. Conversely, polarisation curves for the white enamel only displayed higher values of passive current density, suggesting a difference in the dielectric properties of the enamels. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the shear bond strength and site of failure of brackets bonded to dry and <b>wet</b> <b>enamel.</b> Study design: 50 teeth {{were divided into}} ten groups of 5 teeth each (10 surfaces). In half the groups enamel was kept dry before bonding, {{and in the other}} half distilled water was applied to wet the surface after etching. The following groups were established: 1) Acid/Transbond-XT (dry/wet) XT; 2) Transbond Plus Self Etching Primer (TSEP) /Transbond-XT paste (dry/wet); 3) Concise (dry), Transbond MIP/Concise (wet), 4) FujiOrtho-LC (dry/ wet); 5) SmartBond (dry/wet). Brackets were bonded to both buccal and lingual surfaces. Specimens were stored in distilled water (24 hours at 37 ºC) and thermocycled. Brackets were debonded using a Universal testing machine (cross-head speed 1 mm/min). Failure sites were classified using a stereomicroscope. Results: No significant differences in bond strength were detected between the adhesives under wet and dry conditions except for SmartBond, whose bond strength was significantly lower under dry conditions. For all the adhesives most bond failures were of mixed site location except for Smartbond, which failed at the adhesive-bracket interface. Conclusions: Under wet conditions the bonding capacity of the adhesives tested was similar than under dry conditions, with the exception of SmartBond which improved under wet conditions...|$|R
40|$|Translucency {{of human}} dental enamel was {{determined}} by total transmittance of wavelengths from 400 to 700 nm. The transmission coefficient at 525 nm was 0. 481 mm- 1. Total transmission of light through human dental enamel increased with increasing wavelength. Human tooth enamel is more translucent at higher wavelengths. The translucency of <b>wet</b> human <b>enamel</b> and enamel after dehydration was also measured by total transmittance. The transmission coefficient at 525 nm decreased from 0. 482 to 0. 313 mm- 1 after dehydration and was reversed on rehydration.

40|$|Background. Acid etching {{prior to}} {{orthodontic}} bracket bonding {{may result in}} enamel wear or cracks following bracket removal. The manufacturer of Fuji Ortho LC glass-ionomer (GI) claims that it can bond brackets to <b>wet</b> unetched <b>enamel.</b> This study aimed to compare the bracket bond strength to etched and unetched enamel under dry and wet conditions. Methods. In this in vitro study, 60 intact premolar teeth {{were randomly assigned to}} 6 groups (etched and dried, etched and moistened with distilled water, etched and moistened with saliva, unetched and dried, unetched and moistened with water, unetched and moistened with saliva). In all the groups, Leon 4 brackets were bonded to the enamel using Fuji Ortho LC GI. The teeth were immersed in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 hours and subjected to shear loads at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min in a Zwick machine for bond strength testing. Data were analyzed with ANOVA, Tukey test and independent ttest. Results. The mean bond strength values in groups 1 (etched, dry), 2 (etched, moistened with water), 3 (etched, moistened with saliva), 4 (unetched, dry), 5 (unetched, moistened with water) and 6 (unetched, moistened with saliva) were 21. 86, 16. 46, 10. 49, 8. 12, 9. 15 and 9. 52 MPa, respectively. Significant differences in bond strength were detected between groups 1 and 2 and all the other groups (P 0. 05). Conclusion. Fuji Ortho LC GI provided adequate bond strength between brackets and enamel. To acquire higher bond strength, brackets must be bonded to etched and dried enamel...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{porcelain}} enamels are inorganic coatings for metallic components {{based on}} a special ceramic-vitreous matrix in which specific additives are randomly dispersed. The ceramic-vitreous matrix is made by a mixture of various raw materials and elements and in particular {{it is based on}} boron-silicate glass added with metal oxides(1) of titanium, zinc, tin, zirconia, alumina, ecc. These additions are often used to improve and enhance some important performances such as corrosion(2) and wear resistance, mechanical strength, fracture toughness and also aesthetic functions. The coating process, called enamelling, depends {{on the nature of the}} surface, but also on the kind of the used porcelain enamel. For metal sheets coatings two industrial processes are actually used: one {{based on a}} <b>wet</b> porcelain <b>enamel</b> and another based on a dry-silicone porcelain enamel. During the firing process, that is performed at about 870 °C in the case of a steel substrate, the enamel raw material melts and interacts with the metal substrate so enabling the formation of a continuous varying structure. The interface domain between the substrate and the external layer is made of a complex material system where the ceramic vitreous and the metal constituents are mixed. In particular four main regions can be identified, (i) the pure metal region, (ii) the region where the metal constituents are dominant compared with the ceramic vitreous components, (iii) the region where the ceramic vitreous constituents are dominant compared with the metal ones, and the fourth region (iv) composed by the pure ceramic vitreous material. It has also to be noticed the presence of metallic dendrites that hinder the substrate and the external layer passing through the interphase region. Each region of the final composite structure plays a specific role: the metal substrate has mainly the structural function, the interphase region and the embedded dendrites guarantee the adhesion of the external vitreous layer to the substrate and the external vitreous layer is characterized by an high tribological, corrosion and thermal shock resistance. Such material, due to its internal composition, functionalization and architecture can be considered as a functionally graded composite material. The knowledge of the mechanical, tribological and chemical behavior of such composites is not well established and the research is still in progress. In particular the mechanical performances data about the composite coating are not jet established. In the present work the Residual Stresses, the Young modulus and the First Crack Failure of the composite porcelain enamel coating are studied. Due to the differences of the porcelain composite enamel and steel thermal properties the enamelled steel sheets have residual stresses: compressive residual stress acts on the coating and tensile residual stress acts on the steel sheet. The residual stresses estimation has been performed by measuring the curvature of rectangular one-side coated specimens. The Young modulus and the First Crack Failure (FCF) of the coating have been estimated by four point bending tests (3 - 7) monitored by means of the Acoustic Emission (AE) technique(5, 6). In particular the AE information has been used to identify, during the bending tests, the displacement domain over which no coating failure occurs (Free Failure Zone, FFZ). In the FFZ domain, the Young modulus has been estimated according to ASTM D 6272 - 02. The FCF has been calculated as the ratio between the displacement at the first crack of the coating and the coating thickness on the cracked side. The mechanical performances of the tested coated specimens have also been related and discussed to respective microstructure and surface characteristics by double entry charts...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: The bonding {{mechanisms}} of self etching primers, {{based upon the}} simultaneous etching and priming of dentin, simplifies the bonding technique, but the efficiency of these systems is still controversial. This study compared the shear bond strength of three self etch adhesive systems in dry and wet conditions. Materials and Method: In this experimental study, 77 intact bovine lower incisors with flat 600 grit sanded enamel surface were fixed in acrylic molds and divided into 7 groups, of 11 teeth. The enamel surfaces were treated according to a special procedure as follows: Group 1 : Prompt L-Pop (PLP) in dry condition, Group 2 : Prompt L-Pop in wet condition, Group 3 : Clearfield SE Bond (CSEB) in dry condition, Group 4 : Clearfield SE Bond in wet condition, Group 5 : iBond (iB) in dry condition, Group 6 : iBond in wet condition, Group 7 : Margin Bond (Control) in dry condition. Surfaces were air dried for ten seconds, or blot dried in wet condition. Composite resin was bonded on the enamel and built up by applying a cylindric teflon split mold (4 mm height 2 mm diameter). After 24 hours storage in dionized water at room temperature, all specimens were thermocycled and shear bond test was employed by a universal testing machine (Instron) with a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min. The shear bond strength was recorded in MPa and data were analyzed with ANOVA and Scheffe statistical tests. P< 0. 05 was considered as statistically significant. The mode of failure was examined under a stereomicroscope. Results: 1 - Shear bond strength of CSEB in dry condition (21. 5 ± 4. 8 MPa) {{was significantly higher than}} PLP and iB groups (p< 0. 0001). 2 - Shear bond strength of iB and PLP groups in dry condition (9. 60 ± 2. 2, 9. 49 ± 3 MPa) were significantly lower than CSEB and control (2. 99 ± 5. 1 MPa) (P< 0. 0001). 3 - There {{was no significant difference between}} PLP and iB groups in dry condition (P= 1). 4 - Shear bond strength of CSEB in wet condition (21. 8 ± 3 MPa) was significantly higher than PLP and iB groups (P= 0. 0). 5 - Shear bond strength of CSEB (10. 8 ± 3 MPa) and PLP (10. 6 ± 4 MPa) in wet condition were significantly lower than CSEB and Control groups (P= 0. 0). 6 - There was no significant difference between PLP and iB groups in wet condition (P= 0. 99). 7 - Shear bond strength of the three adhesives had no significant difference in dry and wet conditions (PLP: P= 0. 53, CSEB: P= 0. 84, iB: P= 0. 53). The mode of failure in two groups of PLP and two groups of iB was predominantly in the adhesive bond and in the two groups of CSEB, mixed failure (adhesive with cohesive in composite) was predominantly observed. Conclusion: CSEB had higher while iB and PLP showed lower bond strength to ground enamel.
