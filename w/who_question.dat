5|$|Prior to the Enlightenment, {{the gospels}} were usually {{regarded}} as accurate historical accounts, {{but since then}} scholars have emerged <b>who</b> <b>question</b> {{the reliability of the}} gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus, and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of Jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.|$|E
5|$|As a newly {{inducted}} {{member of}} the Scions, the player follows Thancred to Thanalan to investigate abductions and the theft of crystals along trade routes in the area. The culprits {{are members of the}} Amalj'aa beast tribe who capture the adventurer to be sacrificed to their primal god, Ifrit. The attempt fails as the Echo protects the player from Ifrit's brainwashing. The adventurer counters by defeating Ifrit and is hailed as a hero, with emissaries from all three Grand Companies jockeying for the privilege of recruiting said hero. While attending rallies at each of the three cities honoring the memory of those fallen at Carteneau, the player meets the twins Alphinaud and Alisaie <b>who</b> <b>question</b> the purpose of such nationalist displays. The adventurer's next mission is to forge relations with the Sylphs of the Black Shroud, a peaceful beast tribe whose radical sect once summoned Ramuh to defend the forest from Garlean incursion. While searching for the Sylph elder, the player encounters Lahabrea for the first time—an immortal Ascian bent on destroying the Mothercrystal. The Scions, Thancred in particular, resolve to investigate this new foe.|$|E

25|$|This bill {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} by the Bush administration's Department of Justice, {{as well as}} the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. The political context surrounding the Akaka Bill is both controversial and complex. Proponents, who consider the legislation an acknowledgement and partial correction of past injustices, include Hawaiʻi's Congressional delegation, {{as well as the}} former Republican Governor, Linda Lingle. Opponents include the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, (<b>who</b> <b>question</b> the constitutionality of creating race-based governments), libertarian activists, (who challenge the historical accuracy of any claims of injustice), and other Native Hawaiian sovereignty activists, (who feel the legislation would thwart their hopes for complete independence from the United States).|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{complexity}} and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry; the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations. Those focusing on the exoteric, such as historians of science Lawrence M. Principe and William R. Newman, have interpreted the 'decknamen' (or code words) of alchemy as physical substances. These scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts. At {{the opposite end of}} the spectrum, focusing on the esoteric, scholars, such as George Calian and Anna Marie Roos, <b>who</b> <b>question</b> the reading of Principe and Newman, interpret these same decknamen as spiritual, religious, or psychological concepts.|$|E
25|$|The Hersilia {{departed}} from Stonington, Connecticut for the Antarctic Ocean in July 1819. Over {{a decade later}} Edmund Fanning claimed that it was sent to go exploring the southern Pacific Ocean. However this has been challenged by later historians, <b>who</b> <b>question</b> Fanning's assertion. Sheffield served as its captain, W. Fanning as supercargo and Nathaniel Palmer as second mate. The Hersilia stopped in the Falkland Islands to procure much needed water and food supplies. It is uncertain the precise date the Hersilia reached the South Shetland Islands, but it was primarily stationed at Hersilia Cove on Rugged Island. An estimated 9,000 Antarctic fur seal {{were killed by the}} crew for their valuable pelts over the span of two weeks. Afterwards, the Hersilia returned to Stonington in early 1820.|$|E

25|$|Eddy and Boyd, <b>who</b> <b>question</b> {{the value}} {{of several of the}} Talmudic {{references}} state that the significance of the Talmud to historical Jesus research is that it never denies the existence of Jesus, but accuses him of sorcery, thus indirectly confirming his existence. R. T. France and separately Edgar V. McKnight state that the divergence of the Talmud statements from the Christian accounts and their negative nature indicate that they are about a person who existed. Craig Blomberg states that the denial of the existence of Jesus was never part of the Jewish tradition, which instead accused him of being a sorcerer and magician, as also reflected in other sources such as Celsus. Andreas Kostenberger states that the overall conclusion that can be drawn from the references in the Talmud is that Jesus was a historical person whose existence was never denied by the Jewish tradition, which instead focused on discrediting him.|$|E
