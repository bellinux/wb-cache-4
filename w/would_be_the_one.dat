5|$|At age 11, {{he came to}} the {{attention}} to the prefect of Grenoble, Joseph Fourier, who had accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte on the Egyptian expedition which had discovered the Rosetta Stone. An accomplished scholar in addition to a well known mathematical physicist, Fourier had been entrusted by Napoleon with the publication {{of the results of the}} expedition in the monumental series of publications titled Description de l'Égypte. One biographer has stated that Fourier invited the 11-year-old Champollion to his home and showed him his collection of Ancient Egyptian artefacts and documents. Champollion was enthralled, and upon seeing the hieroglyphs and hearing that they were unintelligible, he declared that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> to succeed in reading them. Whether or not the report of this visit is true, Fourier did go on to become one of Champollion's most important allies and supporters, and surely had an important role in instilling his interest in Ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Cape {{sold the}} US {{rights to the}} {{recently}} formed publishing house of Pascal Covici and Donald Friede. Friede had heard gossip about The Well at a party at Theodore Dreiser's house and immediately decided to acquire it. He had previously sold a copy of Dreiser's An American Tragedy to a Boston police officer to create a censorship test case, which he had lost; he was awaiting an appeal, which he would also lose. He took out a $10,000 bank loan to outbid another publisher which had offered a $7,500 advance, and enlisted Morris Ernst, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, to defend the book against legal challenges. Friede invited John Saxton Sumner of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to buy a copy directly from him, to ensure that he, not a bookseller, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> prosecuted. He also travelled to Boston to give a copy to the Watch and Ward Society, hoping both to further challenge censorship of literature and to generate more publicity; he was disappointed when they told him they saw {{nothing wrong with the}} book.|$|E
5|$|Tom {{is arrested}} {{by the police and}} the guests prepare to leave. Lois goes to comfort Tom's co-anchor, Diane Simmons, only to {{intuitively}} realize she is the true murderer when Diane shows a dress for her solo debut on the news, even though she couldn't have known Tom would be leaving. Diane reveals that she had dated Woods until he dumped her upon her fortieth birthday, around which Tom arranged her to be replaced on the Channel 5 News. Seeking revenge, Diane bribed Priscilla to make James become a born-again Christian and throw the dinner party so she could murder Woods and frame Tom for the crime, but was forced to kill the other guests after her plan went awry upon Stephanie's accidental death. Priscilla woke up when she was removing the knife due to Joe pointing out her fingerprints were on it, so had her throat slit. When Diane was hiding the body in Tom's room, Muriel saw her so was stabbed. The murderess did not have time to conceal the knife, but was able to wipe her fingerprints clean. She killed Derek to stop the police getting involved. Diane then attempts to silence Lois by forcing her outside to a nearby cliff, only to be be shot down herself with a suppressed sniper rifle fired by Stewie, who proclaims if anyone were to kill Lois, he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> to do it.|$|E

Johann von Klenau would later be awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa for his actions at the battle of Wagram and gallant rearguard actions after that battle. Meanwhile, Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen regrouped a large force at Jetzelsdorf, on the Pulkau river, but he later evacuated this position, after receiving intelligence that a French force was approaching Znaim from the east.

Steve Austin came out to confront Vince about it, and Vince stated that Austin <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> to defect. Because of this announcement, many Alliance members began to distrust Austin, who vehemently denied the charges and called Vince a liar. Stone Cold went on to interrogate members of Team Alliance, questioning Booker T and sitting Rob Van Dam down {{in a room with}} a light shining on him.

[...] Muller {{designed}} the video around the song's lyrics because she felt that [...] "there are very few [...] that reveal as much in their lyrics". [...] The scenes were storyboarded so that Muller could give the band a chance to act out the scenes more. [...] She set the band members up with props and filmed after giving loose suggestions. [...] Muller originally intended for the dream sequence to show Stefani over a sea of orange juice but changed the scene based on Stefani's performance.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{assuming}} the presidency, Truman asked {{all the members}} of Roosevelt's cabinet to remain in place, and told them he was open to their advice.

Although Truman was told briefly on the afternoon of April 12 that the Allies had a new, highly destructive weapon, it was not until April 25 that Secretary of War Henry Stimson told him the details. Truman benefited from a honeymoon period after Roosevelt's death, and from the Allies' success in Europe, ending the war against Nazi Germany. Truman was pleased to issue the proclamation of V-E Day on May 8, 1945, his 61st birthday.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} guest stars Kirk Acevedo, Ryan McDonald, Seth Gabel, and Philip Winchester. New guest actors included Michael Eklund as the antagonist Milo Stanfield, Malcolm Stewart as Dr. Levin, and Kacey Rohl as Madeline. Eklund and other actors auditioned in Vancouver, and the producers reviewed tapes of their previous work. As executive producer Jeff Pinkner explains, [...] "We got incredibly lucky casting Michael Eklund for this role... he really created this character." [...] "The Plateau" [...] was the first episode of the third season to feature [...] "Alt-Astrid", the prime universe Astrid's doppelganger. Actress Jasika Nicole depicted her to have autistic characteristics, as Nicole has a sister with the disorder. The producers decided this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> doppelganger to have actual genetic differences with their counterpart, with Nicole believing her two characters possessed the greatest contrast among all of the doppelgangers.|$|E
500|$|Because the Army {{reached its}} {{greatest}} extent in 1942 and shrank in size thereafter, Blamey {{was faced with}} a limited number of senior appointments and more senior officers than he needed to fill them. He faced public and political criticism over [...] "shelving" [...] senior officers, including Robertson. That Robertson and Bennett, two troublesome potential rivals of Blamey's, had been sent to Western Australia did not escape [...] comment. However, it was always more likely that Robertson <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> recalled. Nevertheless, Blamey had serious concerns about Robertson's health, after the latter was hospitalised with internal haemorrhaging in July 1944 and sent to the eastern states to convalesce. While there he joined Vasey and Brigadier Bertrand Coombes, the Commandant of Duntroon, in conducting an inquiry into the future training and organisation of the Royal Military College. Their report, submitted to Blamey in January 1945, called for a number of reforms, the most significant being that the postings of regular officers should alternate between staff and regimental duties.|$|E

50|$|Americans founded their Revolution and {{government}} on popular sovereignty, but <b>the</b> term <b>was</b> {{also used in}} the 1850s to describe a highly controversial approach to slavery in the territories as propounded by senator Stephen A. Douglas. It meant that local residents of a territory <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> to decide if slavery <b>would</b> <b>be</b> permitted, and it led to bloody warfare in Bleeding Kansas as violent proponents and enemies of slavery flooded Kansas territory in order to decide the elections. An earlier development of popular sovereignty arose from philosopher Francisco Suarez and {{became the basis for}} Latin American independence.

500|$|In 1994, the Canadian House of Commons debated {{changing}} {{the name of}} the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the Canadian Charter of Rights, Freedoms and Responsibilities. As Parliamentary Secretary Russell MacLellan pointed out, this would have to be done through a constitutional amendment, particularly to section 34, since section 34 [...] "establishes the charter's title. [...] The charter's title is thus part of the Constitution." [...] MacLellan believed the amending formula needed <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> requiring the support of seven provincial governments representing at least half of Canada's population. [...] Edmonton Southwest MP Ian McClelland had suggested the change, believing it to be necessary because [...] "I felt we were becoming a nation of entitlement." [...] MacLellan replied that [...] "The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is and aspires to be a statement by Canadians about the rights and freedoms which we as Canadians deeply value in our democratic society." [...] MacLellan added that section 1 implied a need for responsibilities, so [...] "It is not necessary to change the title of this charter to emphasize the integral relationship between the individual's rights and his or her responsibility to the rest of society." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Red Woman" [...] {{was written}} by the series' creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. Some {{elements}} in the episode {{are based on the}} sixth novel in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, The Winds of Winter, which author George R. R. Martin had hoped to have completed before the sixth season began airing. It also contains elements from the chapters [...] "The Sacrifice" [...] and [...] "The Blind Girl" [...] from A Dance with Dragons. With this episode, Jonathan Pryce (High Sparrow) is promoted to series regular. The episode has the introduction of new recurring cast member Joe Naufahu, who plays Khal Moro. It was the first episode followed by After the Thrones, HBO's after-show hosted by Andy Greenwald and Chris Ryan. The episode had a premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre two weeks before the premier of the episode on HBO. There was a lot of speculation prior to the episode regarding Jon Snow.

500|$|Homer Jay Simpson, {{voiced by}} Dan Castellaneta, is {{the protagonist of}} the show {{and the father of}} the Simpson family. He embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, clumsy, thoughtless and a {{borderline}} alcoholic. He has occasionally displayed flashes of great intellect and fitness whenever the situation calls for it, and an integrity reflecting his own values, including a fierce devotion to and protectiveness of his family. His voice started out as an impression of Walter Matthau but eventually evolved into a more robust voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions. Homer has since {{become one of the most}} influential fictional characters and has been described by the UK newspaper The Sunday Times as the greatest comedic creation of modern time. He has inspired an entire line of merchandise, and his catchphrase, the annoyed grunt [...] "D'oh!", has been included in the Oxford English Dictionary. During the production of the episode Insane Clown Poppy the writers toyed with the idea of giving Homer a long lost legitimate biological daughter, but when the shows showrunner and writer Mike Scully, as well as Matt Groening rejected the idea, the writers changed the story so the clown Krusty <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who finds he has a lost daughter.|$|E
