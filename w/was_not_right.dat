5|$|There was a South Park {{game for}} the Game Boy Color in {{development}} at Acclaim but it was cancelled by Parker and Stone because they thought the game <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> for the system as the main demographic was kids. Parker and Stone have the prototype cartridge of the game, making it the first South Park video game ever made. Only one screenshot was published in Nintendo Power issue 114 in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Annette O'Toole plays Martha Kent, Clark's adoptive mother. She and her husband, Jonathan, give Clark wise {{advice about}} coping with his {{increasing}} abilities. In season five Martha takes a state-senate seat, and in season six {{she leaves the}} show. Although Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, during filming everyone (including Ettinger) realized that she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> for the part. O'Toole was committed to the television series The Huntress when Ettinger filmed the original pilot. Around the time the creators wanted to recast Martha Kent when The Huntress was canceled, allowing O'Toole to join the cast. The actress had played Lana Lang in Superman III.|$|E
5|$|Gilliam {{originally}} {{believed that}} Pitt <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> {{for the role}} of Jeffrey Goines, but the casting director convinced him otherwise. Pitt was cast for a comparatively small salary, as he was still relatively unknown at the time. By the time of 12 Monkeys release, however, Interview with the Vampire (1994), Legends of the Fall (1994), and Se7en (1995) had been released, making Pitt an A-list actor, which drew greater attention to the film and boosted its box-office standing. In Philadelphia, months before filming, Pitt spent weeks at Temple University's hospital, visiting and studying the psychiatric ward to prepare for his role.|$|E

5|$|John Schneider {{was brought}} in to play Jonathan Kent. Schneider was already well known as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard, and Gough {{believed}} Schneider's experience from The Dukes of Hazzard added believability to the idea that he could have grown up running a farm. Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, but during filming it was generally agreed—Ettinger included—that she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> for the role. Annette O'Toole, who previously portrayed Lana Lang in Superman III, and who was fresh off the recent cancellation of her television series The Huntress, was cast in Ettinger's place, reshooting the scenes Ettinger had filmed.|$|E
5|$|On 28 January 2014, the DA {{announced}} that Mamphela Ramphele had accepted {{an invitation to}} stand as its presidential candidate in the 2014 general election, and the DA and Agang South Africa were set to merge. On the 31st, Ramphele stated {{that she would not}} take up DA party membership and would remain the leader of Agang South Africa, resulting in confusion. On 2 February, Helen Zille stated that Ramphele had reneged on her agreement to stand as the DA's presidential candidate. Ramphele subsequently apologised for the reversal of her decision, saying that the timing <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> as the reaction to it had shown people were unable to overcome race-based party politics.|$|E
5|$|The final whistle blew {{with the}} score {{remaining}} at 1–1. The Scottish players began celebrating their achievement with the estimated 12,000 Scotland fans {{who had made}} the trip to Cardiff, but were immediately aware that something <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> on the touchline, although with the level of commotion they were unclear precisely what was happening. It was Alex Ferguson, who went onto the pitch after the final whistle, who began informing some of the players of Stein's collapse, news of which began to filter through to all of them {{as they made their way}} back to the dressing room.|$|E

5|$|With {{the defeat}} of Napoleon in 1815, there were calls {{for the return of}} the Portuguese Monarch to Lisbon; the Portuguese Prince Regent enjoyed life in Rio de Janeiro, where the monarchy was at the time more popular and where he enjoyed more freedom, and he was thus unwilling to return to Europe. However, those advocating the return of the Court to Lisbon argued that Brazil was only a colony and that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> for Portugal to be governed from a colony. On the other hand, leading Brazilian courtiers pressed for the {{elevation}} of Brazil from the rank of a colony, so that they could enjoy the full status of being nationals of the mother-country. Brazilian nationalists also supported the move, because it indicated that Brazil would no longer be submissive to the interests of Portugal, but would be of equal status within a transatlantic monarchy.|$|E
25|$|Wolfgang was {{complaining}} of his eyes. I noticed {{his head was}} warm, that his cheeks were hot and very red, but that his hands were cold as ice. Moreover, his pulse <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right.</b> So we gave him some black powder and put him to bed. During the night he was rather restless {{and in the morning}} he still had the dry fever.|$|E

During the run of the play, she heard that the casting {{director}} was auditioning for more singers, and it marked the first time she sang in pursuit of a job. Although the director felt she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> for the part, he encouraged her to begin including her talent as a singer on her résumé when looking for other work.|$|E

Curbishley made an {{impressive}} start with a victory over the current Premiership leaders Manchester United, his first ever victory over them in his managerial career, in which he won the game 1–0 with a late 75th-minute winner from captain Nigel Reo-Coker.|$|E
25|$|David O. Stewart, on {{the other}} hand, insists that while Burr was not {{explicitly}} guilty of treason according to Marshall's definition, evidence exists that links him to treasonous crimes. For example, Bollman admitted to Jefferson during an interrogation that Burr planned to raise an army and invade Mexico. He said that Burr believed {{that he should be}} Mexico's monarch, as a republican government <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> for the Mexican people. Many historians believe the extent of Burr's involvement may never be known.|$|E
25|$|When President Gates {{resigned}} in 1912, Fisk trustees began a national search to select his replacement. Although some Fisk alumni and the Nashville Banner, the city's Black newspaper, {{argued that a}} Black man should replace Gates, Booker T. Washington, a Fisk trustee {{and perhaps the most}} important voice in the presidential search process, counseled the timing <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> for a Black Fisk president. Instead, the trustees, in consultation with Dr. Wallace Buttrick, Executive Officer of the General Education Board, turned to Thomas Jesse Jones.|$|E

25|$|In February 1999, {{after just}} twelve games and one goal for Inter, Kanu {{was signed by}} Arsenal for {{approximately}} £4.15 million. He made his debut for Arsenal, against Sheffield United in the FA Cup. With the score 1–1 and ten minutes to go, the Sheffield United goalkeeper Alan Kelly kicked {{the ball out of}} touch so that treatment could be given to Lee Morris. When the ball was thrown back into play by Ray Parlour, although it was intended for Kelly, Kanu chased the throw-in down the right wing unchallenged and centered the ball for Marc Overmars, who scored to make the match 2–1. After the match, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger accepted that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> sport-wise and offered to re-play the match which was again won by Arsenal.|$|E
25|$|After {{his short}} stint at San Lorenzo, he {{was traded to}} his {{hometown}} team, Talleres and later Racing de Córdoba. In 1996, he joined Belgrano of the Primera B Nacional Argentina; {{for the next two}} years he would be the starter winning Belgrano a promotion to the Primera División Argentina. He moved on to Los Andes, again helping his club to a promotion to the Primera División. Sala's good play earned him a look from Argentine powerhouse River Plate who bought his rights. After earning a few non-league match starts, he was loaned out to rival Independiente where he started for two seasons. After two seasons Independiente were looking to buy Sala, but the price <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right.</b> As the Argentine economy unraveled, River officials looked to loan him to a team that could actually afford Sala's price tag; Deportivo Cali in Colombia was that club.|$|E
25|$|Clifford Wearden: {{described}} as the 'god father of the project', he, with Peter Deakins, {{was responsible for the}} overall layout of the estate. He was born in Preston; his father was a plumber and his mother ran a café. Clifford studied architecture at the University of Liverpool from 1938-40 and 1946-48, where he was interested in social housing. Heb spent the war years in the Air Force. From 1949-54, Clifford was chief-partner for Sir Basil Spence, and when they got the commission for rebuilding Coventry Cathedral he was responsible for preserving the ruins. He moved to London and set up his own practice in Homer Street Marylebone. He took his children to watch the house being fired and demolished for the film Leo the Last. He got the contract for designing the estate. The tower block was a necessity, and a good building but he felt strongly that vertical living <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

She also exonerated David Smith from any part in the murders, except that of Edward Evans.|$|E

The director said that Roshan's innocence <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> for the role, and instead cast Shah Rukh Khan for the part that had been portrayed by Amitabh Bachchan in the 1978 film. Akhtar believed that Khan was the most suitable for the role, saying, [...] "He has the personality, the style, the flair, the larger than life persona, the sense of humour and the sheer magnetism that this character requires".|$|E
