5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{watches the}} aftermath of the explosion on the news, knowing that the group <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> for his assistance with the case. Dees is among the rescuers seen on the broadcast. Black travels to DC and meets up with fellow group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). The two join the FBI task force investigating the bombing, led by special agents Pierson (Sam Anderson) and Takahashi (Hiro Kanagawa). Watts and Black quickly dismiss several false claims of responsibility by terrorist groups. Black listens to the 911 call left by Dees, deducing that the numbers dialled spell the word kaboom on a telephone keypad.|$|E
5|$|Sri {{is left in}} {{the living}} room as Aminah and their mother go to tend to Aminah's child, while their father goes to read the newspaper. Mahmud comes in, and quietly asks Sri to help him. He reveals that he had {{registered}} to join PETA several weeks prior and was to leave for training that very night, but was unsure of how Aminah would accept it. Sri tells him that she <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> her sister and has Mahmud hide in a wardrobe. After she leaves the room, Supono and Aminah enter from other doors. Supono, unknown to him, is in a similar situation to Mahmud, and Aminah convinces him to hide beneath a table as she asks Sri.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} related to battles is demon negotiation, {{the process by}} which new demons are invited to join the Protagonist and can fight {{alongside}} them. The majority of demons can be talked to in battle by the Protagonist, and some allied demons. After selecting the option to talk, the player selects a demon, which initiates a negotiation. For those demons who can talk, the responses vary by both situation and a demon's temperament: some demons can be bribed with Macca and items, some <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> questions related to subjects like philosophy, while others can be influenced by the Protagonist's skills of flattery or eloquence. A negotiation can fail if the wrong responses are chosen, if the Protagonist's demon roster is full, or if another enemy demon interrupts. When in the party, demons can be summoned or dismissed from battle. The level of assigned Magatama can also affect how negotiation goes.|$|E
40|$|The <b>will</b> to <b>ask</b> {{questions}} {{and the ability to}} formulate the questions are two features of creativeness which might be related to the teaching-learning climate and the pattern of how the children are brought up within the family. The sample comprisses 401 students, 401 parents and 9 teachers. From the analysis it is evident that the <b>will</b> to <b>ask</b> actual-verbal questions is low, though the <b>will</b> to <b>ask</b> is potentially high. There are low correlations between the teaching-learning climate and the <b>will</b> to <b>ask</b> questions, between the pattern of how they are brought up by parents and the <b>will</b> to <b>ask</b> questions, as well as between the <b>will</b> to <b>ask</b> and the ability to formulate the questions...|$|R

5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E

25|$|Preparation and Timing: The rider {{prepares for}} the {{transition}} by using half-halts to balance the horse, and bends him slightly in the intended direction. Since the first footfall of the canter is the outside hind leg, the rider times the aids {{to ask for the}} canter when the outside hind leg is engaged (i.e. under the body). So, at the trot the rider would ask when the inside front leg touches the ground (its shoulder will be forward). At the walk, the rider <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> when the outside shoulder starts to move back.|$|E

Just prior to Yom Kippur, Jews <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> forgiveness of those they have wronged during the prior year (if they have not already done so). During Yom Kippur itself, Jews fast and pray for God's forgiveness for the transgressions they have made against God in the prior year. Sincere repentance is required, and once again, God can only forgive one for the sins one has committed against God; this is why it is necessary for Jews also to seek the forgiveness of those people who they have wronged.|$|E

25|$|Flemish Interior Minister Marino Keulen (Open VLD) {{announced}} on November 14 {{that he had}} decided not to appoint the French-speaking mayors of Kraainem, Linkebeek and Wezembeek-Oppem, three municipalities with linguistic facilities in the Flemish Periphery of Brussels, because they had sent letters of convocation (letters calling citizens to vote and informing them where their polling station is) in French for the 2006 municipal elections and the 2007 federal election. This was a violation of rules established by the Flemish Government. The three mayors are all members of the FDF.

25|$|On 15 June 2007, the Government of Ontario {{announced}} its MoveOntario 2020 plan, {{that calls for}} a major overhaul and expansion of the Greater Toronto Area's transit systems, including the Transit City proposal, that will cost an estimated $17.5 billion in provincial and federal funding over a 12-year period. The provincial government proposes to provide two-thirds of the funds ($11.5 billion), and <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> {{the federal government to}} pay the remaining one-third ($6 billion). However, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government is currently not committed to this spending plan.

25|$|Another {{theme is}} {{confidentiality}} {{and this is}} an important principle in many nursing ethical codes. This is where information about the person is only shared with others after permission of the person, unless it is felt that the information must be shared to comply with a higher duty such as preserving life. Related to information giving is the debate relating to truth telling in interactions with the person in care. There is a balance between people having the information required to make an autonomous decision and, on the other hand, not being unnecessarily distressed by the truth. Generally the balance is in favour of truth telling due to respect for autonomy, but sometimes people <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> not to be told, or may lack the capacity to understand the implications. Finally, the role of empirical ethics has become prominent in recent years.|$|E
25|$|It {{is typical}} {{for only one}} timpano to be struck at a time, but {{occasionally}} composers <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> for two notes. This is called a double stop, a term borrowed from the string instrument vocabulary. Ludwig van Beethoven uses this effect in the slow third movement of his Ninth Symphony, as do Johannes Brahms in the second movement of his German Requiem and Aaron Copland in El Salón México. Some modern composers occasionally require more than two notes. In this case, a timpanist can hold two sticks in one hand much like a marimba player, or more than one timpanist can be employed. In his Overture to Benvenuto Cellini, for example, Hector Berlioz realizes fully voiced chords from the timpani by requiring three timpanists and assigning one drum to each. He goes as far as ten timpanists playing three- and four-part chords on sixteen drums in his Requiem, although {{with the introduction of}} pedal tuning, this number can be reduced.|$|E
