5|$|At least 150 {{black women}} were lynched between 1880 and 1965 in the American South. Historian Kerry Segrave {{highlights}} 115 recorded cases between 1851 and 1946. Ninety of the 115 were black, 19 white, and six Hispanic or uncertain. Women were usually not lynched alone, but {{tended to be}} treated as accomplices of men <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> lynched. Of 97 incidents examined by Segrave, 36 were of women lynched alone.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Concord, Pierce {{resumed his}} law work; in one notable case he defended the {{religious}} liberty of the Shakers, the insular sect <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> threatened with legal action over accusations of child abuse. His {{role as a}} party leader, however, continued to take up most of his attention. He continued to wrangle with Senator Hale, who was stridently anti-slavery and had opposed the war, stances that Pierce regarded as needless agitation.|$|E

5|$|The two villages {{were to be}} {{assaulted}} simultaneously—Gberi Bana, {{where the}} Royal Irish were held, by the SAS and Magbeni by the paras. In addition to the remaining Royal Irish soldiers, the SAS were also tasked with extracting Lieutenant Musa Bangura—the patrol's SLA liaison, whose extraction was given the same priority {{as that of the}} Royal Irish—and a group of Sierra Leonean civilians <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> held by the West Side Boys.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to march}} with the able-bodied prisoners <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> {{directed}} to Fort Malden, Hart paid a friendly Indian {{to take him}} to the fort. Along the way they encountered other Indians, who shot and scalped Hart. Hart and an estimated 30–100 unarmed prisoners were killed by Indians on January 23, the day after the battle, in what became known as the River Raisin Massacre.|$|E
5|$|While the ACLU {{rushed to}} defend its image against {{allegations}} of being a communist front, it also worked to protect witnesses <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> harassed by the HUAC. The ACLU {{was one of the}} few organizations to protest (unsuccessfully) against passage of the Smith Act in 1940, which would later be used to imprison many persons who supported Communism. The ACLU defended many persons who were prosecuted under the Smith Act, including labor leader Harry Bridges.|$|E

5|$|During the Seven Years' War (in America, {{known as}} the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone {{population}} remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the {{rate of natural increase}} was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas. The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.|$|E
5|$|Following the Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, NASA {{conducted}} a safety {{review of the}} Apollo program. In response to this review, McDonnell proposed the Universal Lunar Rescue Vehicle, a repackaged version of the Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft with an enlarged capsule {{to make room for}} the three astronauts <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> rescued. It was intended to rescue an Apollo crew at almost any point whilst they were at the Moon, should an anomaly occur. Some ULRV designs included five seats, with two astronauts piloting it to the Moon. The proposal was considered, but rejected due to lack of funds.|$|E
5|$|In August 1900, the {{commander}} of German forces at Victoria (present-day Limbe) appointed Atangana interpreter for 500 Bulu hostages, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> pressed into labour. Atangana kept the post {{for six months and}} took up extra duties as a nurse. The colonisers next sent Atangana to Buea to work as an office clerk. At some point between the end of his schooling in Kribi and the end of his service in Victoria, Atangana met Marie Biloa, a woman from a village called Mekumba. Although she was a little older and living as a kept woman by a German functionary, Atangana married her. She would eventually bear him two children: Jean Ndengue and Katerina (or Catherine) Edzimbi.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 209 BC, Philip {{received}} requests for help from his ally the Achaean League in the Peloponnesus <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> attacked by Sparta and the Aetolians. He also heard that Attalus had been elected {{one of the two}} supreme commanders of the Aetolian League, and rumors that he intended to crossover the Aegean from Asia Minor. Philip marched south into Greece. At Lamia he was met by an Aetolian force, supported by Roman and Pergamene auxiliaries, under the command of Attalus' colleague as strategos, the Aetolian Pyrrhias. Philip won two battles at Lamia, inflicting heavy casualties on Pyrrhias' troops. The Aetolians and their allies were forced to retreat inside the city walls, where they remained, unwilling to give battle.|$|E
5|$|Now {{free from}} threat of prosecution, Hergé {{continued}} {{to support his}} colleagues at Le Soir <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> charged as collaborators; six of them were sentenced to death, and others to lengthy prison sentences. Among those sentenced to death was Hergé's friend, Jamin, although his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. In May 1946, Hergé was issued a certificate of good citizenship, which became largely necessary to obtain employment in post-war Belgium. Celebrations were marred by his mother's death in April 1946; she was aged 60.|$|E
5|$|One night {{towards the}} end of 1942, Gröning and his comrades in their SS barracks on the {{outskirts}} of Birkenau were awakened by an alarm. They were told that a number of Jews <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> taken to the gas chambers had escaped and hidden in the woods. They were ordered to take pistols and search the woods. When his group arrived at the extermination area of the camp they saw a farmhouse, in front of which were SS men and the bodies of seven or eight prisoners who had been caught and shot. The SS men told Gröning and his comrades that they could go home but they decided to hang around {{in the shadows of the}} woods.|$|E

5|$|As {{referenced}} in {{the larger}} ACLU article, in 1929, the ACLU defended Margaret Sanger's right to educate the general public about forms of birth control. In 1980, the Project filed Poe v. Lynchburg Training School after 8,000 women had been sterilized without their authorization. In 1985, the state decided to provide counseling and medical treatment for problems caused by what had happened 5 years prior. In 1977, the ACLU took part in and litigated Walker v. Pierce, the Supreme Court case that created federal regulations to prevent Medicaid patients from being sterilized without their knowledge or consent. In 1981-1990, the Project litigated Hodgson v. Minnesota, a case defending the rights of teenagers who chose not {{to comply with a}} state law requiring them to receive parental permission for an abortion. In the 1990s, the Project provided legal assistance and resource kits to those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> attacked for educating about sexuality and AIDS. In 1995, the Project filed Curtis v. School Committee of Falmouth, the U.S.'s first condom availability program.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} debut on 24 September 1921 in a 1–0 victory over Chelsea and scored six goals {{in his first}} eleven appearances, {{including}} a brace against West Bromwich Albion on 6 May 1922, for the side as {{they went on to}} win the Football League First Division title with Beadles being praised for a bright future at the club. However, he was never a regular in the side, making just eighteen appearances in all competitions during his three years at the club, and struggled to displace the more established players, although, following being part of back-to-back league titles, Beadles, along with each member of the squad, was given a gold watch by the club. During his time at Anfield, he played in the 1922 FA Charity Shield defeat against Huddersfield Town, however he became frustrated with his lack of playing time and the club not allowing him to play for Wales in order to cover for players <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> called up by England.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the ships}} sailed into port at Canton, they alarmed the Chinese {{residents}} and officials there by discharging cannon fire, {{what they believed}} was a friendly salute since the Chinese merchants had done so when the Portuguese earlier arrived in Malacca. Chinese officials became even more cautious {{in dealing with the}} Portuguese, since the deposed King of Malacca had been a loyal tributary to the imperial Ming court. The Portuguese explained that in deposing the Malaccan king, they were helping the Chinese merchants there <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> oppressed under his rule. In the eyes of the Canton officials, this added further negative speculations about the Portuguese visitors, because private Chinese overseas trade was banned under the current hai jin laws that stated only the Chinese government could conduct foreign trade.|$|E

5|$|The {{governor}} received {{money from}} the Crown to support the prisoners, with the amount varying on rank: the governor received 19 livres a day for each political prisoner – with conseiller-grade nobles receiving 15 livres – and, {{at the other end}} of the scale, three livres a day for each commoner. Even for the commoners, this sum was around twice the daily wage of a labourer and provided for an adequate diet, while the upper classes ate very well: even critics of the Bastille recounted many excellent meals, often taken with the governor himself. Prisoners <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> punished for misbehaviour, however, could have their diet restricted as a punishment. The medical treatment provided by the Bastille for prisoners was excellent by the standards of the 18th century; the prison also contained a number of inmates suffering from mental illnesses and took, by the standards of the day, a very progressive attitude to their care.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners found A and B wings {{unsupervised}} as {{the prison}} officers had already evacuated, {{and began to}} free other prisoners who were still locked in their cells. The prison officer {{in charge of the}} first landing of C wing was ordered to evacuate, {{and with the help of}} three other officers evacuated the 73 Rule 43(a) prisoners being held there, being fearful for the safety of the prisoners who were regarded as sex offenders. Due to rioting prisoners entering the wing, the officers were unable to evacuate a further seven Rule 43(a) prisoners <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> held on the second landing. Rioting prisoners also gained access to E wing, where the Rule 43(a) prisoners had been left locked in their cells after the prison officers evacuated. A number of these Rule 43(a) prisoners were attacked by rioting prisoners. One such prisoner was Derek White, who was being held on remand on charges of indecent assault and buggery. White later died in North Manchester General Hospital on 3 April after being admitted suffering from head wounds, a dislocated shoulder and chest pains.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final stage of the Borneo Campaign was the capture of Balikpapan on the central east coast of the island. This {{operation}} had been opposed by General Blamey, who {{believed that it was}} unnecessary, but went ahead on the orders of Macarthur. After a 20-day preliminary air and naval bombardment the 7th Division landed near the town on 1 July. Balikpapan and its surrounds were secured after some heavy fighting on 21 July but mopping up continued {{until the end of the}} war. The capture of Balikpapan was the last large-scale land operation conducted by the Western Allies during World WarII. Although the Borneo Campaign was criticised in Australia at the time, and in subsequent years, as pointless or a waste of the lives of soldiers, it did achieve a number of objectives, such as increasing the isolation of significant Japanese forces occupying the main part of the Dutch East Indies, capturing major oil supplies and freeing Allied prisoners of war, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> held in deteriorating conditions.|$|E
