5|$|M-123 is {{designated}} as a Scenic Heritage Route north of M-28. Here it continues northwest to East–West Road and turns to run along the shores of <b>Whitefish</b> Bay and cross the Tahquamenon River near its mouth. Continuing along the bay as <b>Whitefish</b> Road, M-123 meets the community of Paradise, the northernmost point along the highway. It is here that M-123 intersects <b>Whitefish</b> Point Road, which continues north to <b>Whitefish</b> Point, home of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. In either direction, M-123 runs southbound from Paradise, changing direction. Continuing east of Paradise, M-123 is the only paved road that serves the Tahquamenon Falls State Park and the <b>Whitefish</b> Point region.|$|E
5|$|The American Bird Conservancy {{designated}} <b>Whitefish</b> Point a Globally Important Bird Area. <b>Whitefish</b> Point's {{land and}} water features create a natural corridor that funnels thousands of birds during spring and fall migrations, providing unique opportunities for research, education, and conservation programs. Golden eagles, peregrine falcons, merlins, boreal owls, great gray owls, red-throated loons, red-necked grebes, scoters, and jaegers (also known as skuas) {{are just some of}} the birds that can be seen during migration.|$|E

In addition to Wikwemikong, Ottawa communities on Manitoulin Island are, west to east: Cockburn Island, Sheshegwaning, West Bay, Sucker Creek, and Sheguiandah. Other Ottawa {{communities in}} southwestern Ontario in addition to Walpole Island are: Sarnia, Stoney and Kettle Point, and Caradoc (Chippewas of the Thames), near London, Ontario.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Whitefish</b> Bay National Forest Scenic Byway is a National Forest Scenic Byway {{that runs}} along <b>Whitefish</b> Bay in the Hiawatha National Forest in the U.S. state of Michigan. The byway mostly follows Federal Forest Highway42 (FFH42) through Chippewa County in the Upper Peninsula. As a forest highway, it is {{maintained}} {{jointly by the}} Chippewa County Road Commission (CCRC) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The route of the byway first existed as an earth road by the 1930s; it was improved into a gravel road in the 1940s and paved between the 1950s and the 1980s. The byway designation was created in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald {{is among}} the largest and best-known vessels lost on the Great Lakes {{but she is not}} alone on the Lake Superior seabed in that area. In the years between 1816, when Invincible was lost, and 1975, when Fitzgerald sank, the <b>Whitefish</b> Point area had claimed at least 240ships.|$|E
25|$|Around 1908 {{the last}} Indians left. John Young {{and many of}} his {{followers}} moved on to McCord and eventually became part of the Forest County Potawatomi. The <b>Whitefishes</b> moved to Diamond Lake near Lublin.|$|R
50|$|In {{previous}} taxonomic classifications, the ciscoes {{have been}} identified as a subgenus Leucichthys of the genus Coregonus. Based on molecular data this is not a natural classification however, as the ciscoes are polyphyletic, comprising two different lineages within the freshwater <b>whitefishes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fishery is an {{important}} activity on the lake. About 17 species are being fished commercially, mostly European cisco, smelt, <b>whitefishes,</b> roaches, burbot, pike-perch, perch, ruffe, carp bream, lake salmon, pike and somewhat less ide, graylings, common dace, common bleak and crucian carp.|$|R
5|$|<b>Whitefish</b> and vendace are {{the most}} common fish species in Lake Inari, the latter having been accidentally naturalized. Lake trout can be caught in creeks. Other fish found in the park include Arctic char, grayling, pike, perch, burbot, three-spined stickleback, ninespine stickleback and minnow. Stocking with fish has {{resulted}} in the introduction of Atlantic salmon, vendace and lake trout.|$|E
5|$|John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company was {{centered}} on Mackinac Island after the War of 1812 and exported beaver pelts for thirty years. By {{the middle of}} the 19th century, commercial fishing for common <b>whitefish</b> and lake trout began to replace the fur trade as the island's primary industry. As sport fishing became more popular in the 1880s, hotels and restaurants accommodated tourists coming by train or lake boat from Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Under the Ontario Heritage Act, {{activities}} on registered archeological sites require a license. In March 2005, the <b>Whitefish</b> Point Preservation Society accused the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) of conducting an unauthorized dive to Fitzgerald. Although {{the director of}} the GLSHS admitted to conducting a sonar scan of the wreck in 2002, he denied such a survey required a license {{at the time it was}} carried out.|$|E
50|$|Salmonidae is {{a family}} of ray-finned fish, the only living family {{currently}} placed in the order Salmoniformes. It includes salmon, trout, chars, freshwater <b>whitefishes,</b> and graylings, which collectively are known as the salmonids. The Atlantic salmon and trout of the genus Salmo give the family and order their names.|$|R
5000|$|Coregonus is {{a diverse}} genus {{of fish in}} the salmon family (Salmonidae). The Coregonus species are known as <b>whitefishes.</b> The genus {{contains}} at least 68 described extant taxa, but the true number of species {{is a matter of}} debate. The type species of the genus is Coregonus lavaretus.|$|R
50|$|Reaching {{a maximum}} {{recorded}} length of 36 cm (14 in) {{and a maximum}} recorded weight of 540 g (1 lb 3 oz), the shortnose cisco is distinguished from the other <b>whitefishes</b> by its thicker body (nearly circular in cross-section), short head (the source of the fish's common name), and small eye.|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{species of fish}} reside in park waters and native game fish species found in the lakes and streams include the westslope {{cutthroat}} trout, northern pike, mountain <b>whitefish,</b> kokanee salmon and Arctic grayling. Glacier {{is also home to}} the threatened bull trout, which is illegal to possess and must be returned to the water if caught inadvertently. Introduction in previous decades of lake trout and other non-native fish species has greatly impacted some native fish populations, especially the bull trout and west slope cutthroat trout.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath {{today is}} mostly {{known for its}} {{connection}} with the Scottish fishing industry. After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who {{would be interested in}} migrating to Arbroath in order {{to take advantage of the}} new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby Auchmithie and further afield, including Shetland. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 <b>whitefish</b> and pelagic vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as fishermen, hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated <b>whitefish</b> landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish. There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from Aberdeen and ports further north. The fish processing sector remains one of the largest employers in the town however, but fish for processing now comes from Aberdeen, Peterhead and occasionally from Iceland, Norway and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|M-67 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US41 near Trenary {{east of the}} West Branch of the <b>Whitefish</b> River. From that intersection the highway runs east crossing Scott Creek before running into downtown Trenary along relatively flat terrain. East of town, the highway turns north running parallel to the AuTrain River Basin. The trunkline crosses Dexter Creek between Paulsen and Trout Lake roads. About halfway along the north–south segment of the highway, M-67 passes through the community of Limestone and crosses Johnson Creek. After running for , M-67 ends at a four-way intersection with M-94 and Tunteri Road.|$|E
5000|$|Coregonus Linnaeus, 1758 - <b>whitefishes</b> and ciscoes, which {{according}} to some authors number more than 60 species. There are differing opinions on the classification of some species within the genus and {{the overall number of}} species. Some species in Arctic regions of Asia and North America forage in marine waters.|$|R
25|$|Another {{major and}} {{historical}} {{activity in the}} gulf is fishing, especially on the northern coast near Vyborg, Primorsk and on the southern coast near Ust-Luga. Commercial fish species are herring, sprats, European smelt, <b>whitefishes,</b> carp bream, roaches, perch, European eel, lamprey and others. In 2005, the catchment was 2000 tons by the ships of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast alone.|$|R
50|$|Like all <b>whitefishes,</b> it is a silvery, {{fusiform}} fish. The {{average length}} of mature fish is 33 cm and weight of 1-2 kg, and it can reach a length of 75 cm and a weight of 7-8 kg. Depending on population, the muksun can live up to 16-25 years of age. It is valuable commercially as well as locally {{as a source of}} food.|$|R
5|$|The section {{through the}} Naomikong Point area was built {{starting}} in 1967 by the Michigan State Highway Department {{under contract to}} the USFS. The road, at the time, {{was intended to be}} part of a longer scenic highway that would connect a proposed lakeshore road through the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore with roads running along <b>Whitefish</b> Bay and the St. Marys River south of Sault Ste. Marie. The western end was realigned and paved in the late 1970s, moving the roadway closer to Tahquamenon Bay west of Naomikong Point. The former roadway was removed in the process. The last section was paved in 1987 between the two paved sections at Naomikong and Iroquois points.|$|E
5|$|Of the 28 {{fish species}} {{present in the}} forest, 11 are not native and have been {{introduced}} by humans. Rainbow trout, chinook salmon, westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, and mountain <b>whitefish</b> are all native {{to some of the}} forest's waterways, while brook trout are a common invasive species that compete with the forest's salmonids. The forest's management indicator species is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions. Sockeye salmon are native to the Salmon River watershed {{in the northern part of}} the forest, but dam construction on the Columbia and Snake rivers has hampered the migration of this anadromous fish and caused its population to collapse. Warm Lake supports the forest's only native population of Kokanee salmon, the resident (non-migratory) form of sockeye salmon. However, due to introductions by humans, Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, Lucky Peak, and Deadwood reservoirs now support populations of Kokanee salmon. To provide additional recreational fishing opportunities, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game stocks several of the forest's waterways with rainbow trout, while reservoirs are also stocked with Kokanee or chinook salmon and Lake Cascade is stocked with coho salmon and steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River fine-spotted {{cutthroat}} trout (or Snake River {{cutthroat trout}}) {{is the only}} native trout species in Grand Teton National Park. It is also the only subspecies of cutthroat trout that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers. Various researchers {{have not been able}} to identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species of trout such as the rainbow trout and lake trout were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five trout species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the mountain <b>whitefish,</b> longnose dace, mountain sucker and non-native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling.|$|E
50|$|Lake Onega {{features}} a large variety {{of fish and}} water invertebrates, including relicts of the glacial period such as lamprey. There are about 47 fish species from 13 families; they include sturgeon, landlocked salmon, brown trout, European smelt, grayling, roaches, Crucian carp, <b>whitefishes,</b> char, pike, European cisco, common dace, silver bream, carp bream, sabre carp, spined loach, wels catfish, European eel, rudd, ide, gudgeon, pike-perch, European perch, ruffe and burbot.|$|R
5000|$|Recorded {{items in}} the broad <b>whitefish's</b> diet are chironomid midges, {{mosquito}} larvae, snails, bivalves, and crustaceans. It migrates upstream to spawn, except in some estuaries. These migrations are difficult for it, and many individuals become heavily scarred from infestations, lampreys, and fishing nets. It prefers streams with gravel bottoms, especially those with finer gravel, for spawning. After hatching, larval fish move downstream. In Russia, spawning occurs between July and November in various populations.|$|R
50|$|The Bering cisco {{feeds on}} amphipods and other {{invertebrates}} and small fish such as sculpins. It migrates to clear and shallow streams {{in the late}} summer, not feeding during migration. Not eating during migration is typical among salmon, but rare in <b>whitefishes.</b> Spawning occurs in clear, cool streams with 1 to 3 inch gravel. A year after hatching, young ciscoes drift downstream to estuaries. The Bering cisco becomes sexually mature when it is four to nine years old.|$|R
5|$|The {{streams and}} lakes around Adams offer {{a number of}} fish for the angler to seek out. The two most common species, eastern brook trout and rainbow trout (Columbia River redband trout), are in nearly every lake and stream. Brown trout and {{cutthroat}} trout appear {{in most of the}} lakes in the High Lakes Area and three lakes are home to tiger trout. All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are periodically replanted with varying species of trout. Bull trout {{can be found in the}} upper reaches of the Klickitat and Lewis Rivers. Westslope cutthroat trout can be found the Klickitat and cutthroat trout are found in the Lewis River and upper reaches of the Cispus River. <b>Whitefish</b> can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers. Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and Cowlitz Rivers, falls on the White Salmon River), the only river where anadromous fishes can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. Chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead, in several different runs, make for the upper reaches of the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.|$|E
25|$|Snow coach {{tours are}} offered at Big Sky, <b>Whitefish,</b> West Yellowstone and into Yellowstone National Park.

5000|$|The {{specific}} epithet of the bloater {{is given}} after Dr. P. R. Hoy of Racine, Wisconsin. Dr. Hoy collected the first specimens {{of this species}} in 1870 while dredging in Lake Michigan at least 16 mi off Racine, at depths of 50 to 70 fathoms (90-130 m). Hoy did not describe the fish himself, but had ichthyologist James W. Milner name the species. Milner placed it in the genus Argyrosomus, now considered a junior synonym of Coregonus, the genus in which the bloater is now placed. The generic name Coregonus, given by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturæ, is derived from Greek and means [...] "angled eye", referring to the tilted pupil of <b>whitefishes.</b> It {{is closely related to}} the cisco or lake herring, Coregonus artedi, and the shortjaw cisco, both of which it is known to hybridise with. The common name of the bloater comes from the swollen appearance it has after being brought up from the deep waters it inhabits. The same name is given to certain type of smoked herring in Britain, which is swelled in its preparation. The bloater is one of the several taxa in the Coregonus artedi complex of freshwater <b>whitefishes,</b> which sometimes all are considered to belong to a single species.|$|R
2500|$|The omul has {{traditionally}} been regarded as a subspecies of the Arctic cisco Coregonus autumnalis. However, recent genetic studies have shown it actually belongs to the circumpolar Coregonus lavaretus-clupeaformis complex of lake <b>whitefishes,</b> which also has other members in Lake Baikal, {{and it is now}} considered its own species within Coregonus. The four or five traditionally accepted subpopulations of omul within Lake Baikal are: North Baikal (северобайкальский), Selenga (селенгинский), Chivyrkui (чивыркуйский) and Posolsk (посольский). [...] These vary in size, feeding behaviors and preferred spawning habitats. [...] The extent of their reproductive isolation is debated.|$|R
