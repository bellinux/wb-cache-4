500|$|Located in {{the holy}} [...] "Valley of the Saints", the International Academy of Meditation, also called the Chaurasi Kutia ashram, was a [...] compound. It stood across the River Ganges from Rishikesh, the [...] "yoga capital of the world" [...] and home to many ashrams {{in the foothills of}} the Himalayas, [...] above the river and {{surrounded}} by jungle. The Maharishi's facility was built in 1963 with a $100,000 gift from American heiress Doris Duke, on land leased from the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department. [...] The training centre was designed to suit Western habits and was described variously as [...] "luxurious" [...] and [...] "seedy". Starr later compared the ashram to [...] "a kind of spiritual Butlins" [...] (a low-cost British holiday camp). It was built to accommodate several dozen people and each of its stone bungalows contained five rooms. Each was equipped with electric heaters, running water, toilets, and English-style furniture. According to DeHerrera, the Maharishi obtained many [...] "special items" [...] from a nearby village so that the Beatles rooms would have mirrors, <b>wall-to-wall</b> <b>carpeting,</b> wall coverings, [...] "foam mattresses" [...] and bedspreads. She wrote that [...] "by the standard of the other" [...] bungalows, the Beatles' cottages [...] "looked like a palace".|$|E

2500|$|The East Room was radically redecorated in 1873 {{during the}} {{administration}} of Ulysses S. Grant. Architects Orville Babcock (Commissioner of Public Buildings and Grounds), Richard Ezdorf, William J. McPherson, and Alfred Mullett were faced with both a decorative and structural task. The heavy walls above the East Room as well as inadequate structural support had caused the ceiling to sag appreciably. Furthermore, the Grants wanted to renovate the East Room into a far more modern space reflective of their Midwest tastes. The architects added new load-bearing beams across the ceiling, which made the room appear to be much lower in height. Corinthian columns were added to support these beams. To integrate the beams into the room, they extended the 1815 freize decoratively across the beams. The ceiling, divided into three sections by the beams, was refrescoed as well. Elaborately carved new fireplaces painted in white and gold replaced the simpler 1829 fireplaces. To help integrate the load-bearing columns into the room, white and gold painted pilasters {{were added to the}} room. White-painted carved paneling with Greek Revival designs; massive, low-hanging, cut-glass chandeliers (replacing those which had hung since 1834); pearl gray and gilt wallpaper, and <b>wall-to-wall</b> <b>carpeting</b> in a floral pattern completed the redecoration. Much of the furniture in the room was sold at public auction (a common and unremarkable practice until the 20th century). The architects called the style [...] "Pure Greek", and architectural historian Patrick Phillips-Schrock called it [...] "sumptuous", but it was widely derided as [...] "Steamboat Gothic". Nellie Grant's lavish wedding took place in the East Room on May 21, 1874.|$|E

40|$|This project {{demonstrates}} how the functional life of <b>wall-to-wall</b> <b>carpet</b> {{can be extended}} through the visual design process. The judicious selection of visual design strategies {{and the way they}} are integrated into the woven surface has the capability of retaining vibrancy and a fresh appearance in Axminster <b>wall-to-wall</b> <b>carpet</b> In carrying out this research I have studied and then exploited the historical and contemporary languages of design, including: pattern structure, illusion of depth, the psychological and physiological influence of colour and the characteristics of optical colour mixing. The carpet prototypes illustrating the research outcomes have been specifically designed for the high foot-traffic demands of today's hospitality and leisure industries. In developing the outcomes of my research I have investigated historical precedents which have significantly contributed to present-day <b>wall-to-wall</b> <b>carpet</b> design. This includes the appropriation of central and western Asian cultural motifs by English weavers in the 16 th century, the influence of fashion on carpet from the Neo-Classic period, the adoption of flat-coloured woven surfaces in Modernism and the influence of Postmodernism on interior architecture. The project also shows how forgotten design techniques such as those employed in Mamluk carpets can be applied in contemporary <b>wall-to-wall</b> <b>carpet</b> designs. While the research addresses the specific functional requirements of the hospitality and leisure industries, it also seeks to imbue the carpet prototypes with a sense of time and place by integrating imagery from Australia's natural environment and cultural heritage.
