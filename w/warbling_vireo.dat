The Canada warbler inhabits blueberry thickets with white-throated sparrow, while the black-throated blue warbler is found in the forests atop the plateau with the least flycatcher. Common raven are regularly seen soaring over the forests of the park looking for carrion. Canada goose are present in the park and have been classified as a [...] "pest" [...] due to their high numbers and the large amount of fecal waste they leave on the shores of Lake Jean.

50|$|One {{significant}} {{issue that}} has the potential to alter bird species composition at Quinebaug Woods is the loss of eastern hemlock trees from hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA).

40|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of bird species in the Great Basin region are found in riparian habitats. However, most previous research {{on the impact of}} change in habitat condition through degradation on these bird communities failed to account for the large intersite differences in both habitat type and extent of degradation. We examined songbird communities in 4 riparian habitat types (meadows, willow-, birch-, and aspen-dominated forest stands) during summers 1994 (last year of a 7 -yr drought) and 1995 (following the 6 th wettest winter recorded) in the Toiyabe Mountain Range of central Nevada. Habitat degradation significantly influenced bird species richness in riparian areas, but the impact was dependent upon habitat type. While meadow bird communities were affected adversely by habitat degradation, with significant drops in species richness on degraded sites, bird species richness in forested riparian habitats was consistently greater on degraded sites. Data for the 6 most common species seen during our study indicated that degradation may have influenced distribution of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and Yellow Warblers (Dendroica petechia), but habitat type was the best predictor of abundance for House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon), Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), <b>Warbling</b> <b>Vireos</b> (Vireo gilvus), and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s Blackbirds (Euphagus cyanocephalus). Avian species diversity in meadow habitats may be linked to moisture levels during specific times of the year. Diversity increased during the pre-migratory period of the dry year (1994) when compared with that of the breeding season, but was unchanged in the wet year (1995) ...|$|R

50|$|Despite the barrens name, {{many plants}} and animals call Spread Eagle home. The large grasslands and barrens are {{dominated}} by scattered jack pine, red pine, scrub oak, and quaking aspen trees. The open landscape is maintained by timber harvesting and controlled burns.

40|$|Long term {{projects}} like the Idaho Bird Observatory’s Lucky Peak banding station provide valuable information on bird conservation and life history traits. We explored banding data from 1997 - 2009 to examine yearly patterns of abundance and survivorship for the 10 most common breeding species. We found that survivorship patterns vary by species. We documented Nashville and Yellow warblers {{living up to}} 4 years, while some Dusky Flycatchers, MacGillivray’s Warblers and Chipping Sparrows lived 7 years or more. In fact several Western Tanagers and Dusky Flycatchers exceed or match longevity records in the USGS Bird Banding Lab database. The ratio of hatch year birds (hatched that spring) to adults lends insight into survivorship, productivity and recruitment in the community. Species may have low numbers of hatch years one year yet high numbers of second year birds (hatched the previous spring) the next year. This was particularly seen in <b>Warbling</b> <b>Vireos</b> and suggests that immigration is important for this species. In contrast, the number of hatch year Spotted Towhees in one year correlated {{with the number of}} second years in the next year, implying that many towhees hatched at the site return to breed. Analysis also showed trends in population dynamics and striking annual difference in species’ abundance. Neotropical migrants like MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s and Yellow warblers peaked in both 2000 / 01 and 2006 / 07 but Nashville Warblers (another Neotropical species) peaked in 2005. Interestingly, short distant migrants such as Chipping Sparrow and Spotted Towhee also peaked in 2005. Further investigation is required to determine which factors—possibly including weather, diet, timing of breeding and migration strategy—contribute to these fluctuations...|$|R

25|$|Birds are an {{especially}} {{important component of}} the local ecosystem for historical reasons. Bicknell's thrush was first observed on the summit of Slide in 1881; today, after recently being declared a separate species from the gray-cheeked thrush, it is considered a threatened species and its summer breeding areas in the boreal forests important enough that in 1999, New York governor George Pataki augmented the wilderness status of the area with Bird Conservation Area status that applied to almost all the Catskill High Peaks. This protects not only the Bicknell's but other species such as the black-and-white warbler, black-throated blue warbler, Canada <b>warbler,</b> red-eyed <b>vireo,</b> Louisiana waterthrush, scarlet tanager and rose-breasted grosbeak, some of which require large unbroken forests to nest.|$|R
