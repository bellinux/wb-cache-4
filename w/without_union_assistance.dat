A series of poaching incidents, {{resulting in the}} killing of over 100 elephants, was carried out from May to August, 2006 in the vicinity of Zakouma National Park. This region has a decades-old history of poaching of elephants, which has caused the population of the region, which exceeded 300,000 in 1970, to drop to about 10,000 today. The African bush elephant officially is protected by Chadian government, but the resources and manpower provided by the government (with some European <b>Union</b> <b>assistance)</b> have proven insufficient to stop the poaching.|$|R
