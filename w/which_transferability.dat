40|$|AbstractObjectiveThere {{are several}} methodological and {{practical}} issues surrounding the transferability of economic {{data that are}} important to address. A review of what national guidelines for economic evaluations say about transferability is important to understand the context in <b>which</b> <b>transferability</b> is currently practiced and discussed. Aim of this editorial is to discuss the results of a study reviewing the positions of various national guidelines in relation to the transferability and generalizability of data and the methods suggested for addressing issues of transferability presented in this issue. ConclusionThe recommendations on good research practices for dealing with aspects of transferability are filling an important gap. However, in order for the applied science of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research to make up for its epistemological aim and the aim of providing normative judgments, the methodological foundation of normative judgments has to be given the same importance as the methodological foundation the scientific community is seeking to establish as good research practices...|$|E
40|$|Technical {{variation}} in metagenomic analysis must be minimized to confidently assess {{the contributions of}} microbiota to human health. Here we tested 21 representative DNA extraction protocols on the same fecal samples and quantified differences in observed microbial community composition. We compared them with differences due to library preparation and sample storage, which we contrasted with observed biological variation within the same specimen or within an individual over time. We found that DNA extraction had the largest effect {{on the outcome of}} metagenomic analysis. To rank DNA extraction protocols, we considered resulting DNA quantity and quality, and we ascertained biases in estimates of community diversity and the ratio between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We recommend a standardized DNA extraction method for human fecal samples, for <b>which</b> <b>transferability</b> across labs was established and which was further benchmarked using a mock community of known composition. Its adoption will improve comparability of human gut microbiome studies and facilitate meta-analyses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{rubber tree}} (Hevea brasiliensis) {{is native to}} the Amazon region {{and it is the}} major source of natural rubber in the world. Rubber tree {{breeding}} is time-consuming and expensive. However, molecular markers such as microsatellites can reduce the time required for these programs. This study reports new genomic microsatellite markers developed and characterized in H. brasiliensis and the evaluation of their transferability to other Hevea species. Findings We constructed di- and trinucleotide-enriched libraries. From these two libraries, 153 primer pairs were designed and initially evaluated using 9 genotypes of H. brasiliensis. A total of 119 primer pairs had a good amplification product, 90 of which were polymorphic. We chose 46 of the polymorphic markers and characterized them in 36 genotypes of H. brasiliensis. The expected and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0. 1387 to 0. 8629 and 0. 0909 to 0. 9167, respectively. The polymorphism information content (PIC) values ranged from 0. 097 to 0. 8339, and the mean number of alleles was 6. 4 (2 – 17). These 46 microsatellites were also tested in 6 other Hevea species. The percentage of transferability ranged from 82 % to 87 %. Locus duplication was found in H. brasiliensis and also in 5 of other species in <b>which</b> <b>transferability</b> was tested. Conclusions This study reports new microsatellite markers for H. brasiliensis {{that can be used for}} genetic linkage mapping, quantitative trait loci identification and marker- assisted selection. The high percentage of transferability may be useful in the evaluations of genetic variability and to monitor introgression of genetic variability from different Hevea species into breeding programs. </p...|$|E

30|$|Shaw (1984) also {{developed}} a measure of occupational skills transferability by examining the occupational movement across years using the Current Population Survey (CPS). However, this method introduces {{a significant amount of}} noise due to the occupational coding errors of the CPS (Kambourov and Manovskii 2004). In addition, it assumes skills transferability to be symmetric, in <b>which</b> the skills <b>transferability</b> from occupation i to j is equal to the skills transferability from occupation j to i. In other words, the direction of the skills transfer is irrelevant. Ormiston’s skills transferability, on the other hand, is a non-symmetric method, in <b>which</b> the skills <b>transferability</b> from occupation i to j {{does not have to be}} equal to that from occupation j to i.

Beyond symmetry concerns, short-run occupational switching rates are significantly lower – as will demonstrated {{later in this}} paper – than the cross-occupation transferability estimates produced by Ormiston (2014). While the symmetry issue can be quickly remedied by estimating different rates for ij occupational changes separately from ji vocational switches, the difference in estimated transferability rates introduces the potential for measurement error to undercut future research on occupation-specific human capital. Another limitation of Shaw’s approach is {{that it must be}} driven by demand. If there is little demand for a given occupation, there will be little movement into it (i.[*]e., low transferability), even from very similar occupations.|$|R

30|$|The {{last two}} {{theories}} {{focus on how}} codes can be designed to be understood and learned easier, both of which, in turn, increase relevance. First, cognitive load theory (Sweller 1988) {{can be used to}} explain that using worked examples, which “consist of a problem formulation and the final solution” (Renkl 2014, p. 392), is an effective and efficient way to promote learning. By worked examples, there is a shift from ‘means-end analysis’ typically used by ‘novices’ to solve unfamiliar problems, which induces high extraneous cognitive load, to a deep understanding of the problem, <b>which</b> allows <b>transferability,</b> i.e., the creation of schemata (Sweller 1988), which alleviates to apply known rules to new situations. Applying the worked-examples approach to the design of codes, we posit that including examples in the code helps code users (e.g., employees) to better understand the underlying rules, principles, and the general intent of the code. While the qualitative study by Schwartz (2004) indicates that code users perceive examples as a factor, which clarifies a code’s content and, thus, improve comprehension, experimental evidence on this is lacking.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{success of}} {{transfer}} to improve learning on a target task is {{highly dependent on}} the selected source data. Instance-based transfer methods reuse data from the source tasks to augment the training data for the target task. If poorly chosen, this source data may inhibit learning, resulting in negative transfer. The current best performing algorithm for instance-based transfer, TrAdaBoost, performs poorly when given irrelevant source data. We present a novel set-based boosting technique for instancebased transfer. The proposed algorithm, TransferBoost, boosts both individual instances and collective sets of instances from each source task. In effect, TransferBoost boosts each source task, assigning higher weight to those source tasks <b>which</b> show positive <b>transferability</b> to the target task, and then adjusts the weights of the instances within each source task via AdaBoost. The results demonstrate that TransferBoost significantly improves transfer performance over existing instancebased algorithms when given a mix of relevant and irrelevant source data.

30|$|This method thus proposes using a {{modified}} SVM called Correlation-Transfer SVM <b>which</b> takes such <b>transferability</b> into account by enforcing a {{suppression of the}} learned SVM along such dimensions with lower ρ values as they {{have little or no}} beneficial knowledge for transfer to the target task.

This method does not require labeled target data and it utilizes the available unlabeled target and source pairs to select a kernel parameter which results in the highest correlation performance. Experiments were performed for cross-view action recognition, handwritten digit recognition, and image-to-text/text-to-image classification to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The proposed method was compared with combinations of linear and kernel SVM and CCA where the proposed method was shown to be effective. The results also indicate that deriving a common subspace better suited for domain adaption is more important than designing a complex classifier in a standard feature space.|$|R

40|$|Given {{the large}} {{projected}} {{increase in the}} proportion of Australian older adults (13 % in 2004 to 22 % in 2031) and the personal importance placed on spirituality in the lives of older adults, it is timely to investigate the role of spirituality in the everyday lives of older adults. The present paper analyses the literature pertaining to the psychological implications of spirituality in older adulthood. The points of discussion identified in the review include the relationship between spirituality and religion, theories of spiritual development, psychosocial wellbeing, health, end of life issues, culture, and psychological practice. It is concluded that the paucity of Australian research into spirituality in older adulthood results in a gap in the body of knowledge. Addressing this gap would be beneficial as it could inform policy makers, inform psychological and educational practice, and potentially bridge intergenerational tensions. The present study explored the role and meaning of spirituality in older adulthood. Ten Western Australians aged over 65 years (M= 75. 7, SD = 5. 64; seven females and three males) participated in individual in-depth semi-structured interviews. Principles of interpretative phenomenological analysis were utilised as a theoretical framework. The research questions were: What is the meaning of spirituality in older adulthood and {{what is the role of}} spirituality in older adulthood? Three themes emerged from the data: connection with a transcendent force, spirituality provides meaning, and fruition of spirituality. The findings indicated that spirituality promotes psychological wellbeing, both in everyday life and when faced with crisis.

Our key contribution is {{the design of a}} new search space <b>which</b> enables <b>transferability.</b> In our experiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or "cell") on the CIFAR- 10 dataset and then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking together more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters. Although the cell is not searched for directly on ImageNet, an architecture constructed from the best cell achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82. 7 % top- 1 and 96. 2 % top- 5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1. 2 % better in top- 1 accuracy than the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS [...] a reduction of 28 % in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of our models exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For instance, a smaller network constructed from the best cell also achieves 74 % top- 1 accuracy, which is 3. 1 % better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile platforms. On CIFAR- 10, an architecture constructed from the best cell achieves 2. 4 % error rate, which is also state-of-the-art.

Since Darwin’s work {{on the origin of}} species, intensive efforts have been mounted to find a criterion for biological species that is common to all organisms, prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes, making species natural units. This has led to numerous species concepts, but none have met the requirement of universal application. Additionally, many concepts are based on criteria that can be used only for recognizing species (operational criteria), not defining the ‘being’ or make-up of the species (explanatory criteria).

Interconnectivity within such pools is given by <b>transferability,</b> <b>which</b> means the potential to transfer complete genomes or genome halves to the next generation, perpetuating transferability.

40|$|Biotechnology is {{integral}} to the application of robust, high through-put detection of species-specific and species or genus-transferred microsatellites, or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. These short, tandemly repeated stretches of DNA of variable motifs and lengths are relatively evenly distributed throughout eukaryotic nuclear, chloroplasts, and mitochondrial genomes. Microsatellites are inherited as Mendelian co-dominant markers that provide insights into non-Mendelian inheritance such as microsatellite evolution, replication, repair, recombination, and mutation. These characteristics have made microsatellites the genetic marker of choice for most technologically-driven applications in plant and insect genetic studies such as mapping, marker-assisted selection (MAS), and genetic diversity studies. MAS and linkage mapping analyses has greatly assisted breeding programs through the discovery and isolation of many important agronomic genes that underlie respective phenotypes. Linkage maps and genome sequences have provided comparative genomic insights in plants and insects regarding microsatellite distribution, occurrence, and adaptive phenotypic evolution. Furthermore, genomic synteny and SSR sequence conservation have not only provided maximum annotated information for model plants and insects, but have demonstrated cross-species/genera <b>transferability,</b> <b>which</b> is indicative of long evolutionary history.

The paper describes how such methodology was applied and the outcomes of the <b>Transferability</b> Exercise <b>which</b> simulated the <b>transferability</b> of the experience of the seven Use Cases to a cluster of target cities across Europe. The resulting key factors for tranferring (or not) the innovations and for developing a new generation of buses far beyond Europe’s borders are reported...|$|R
40|$|Current {{research}} on wound infections is primarily conducted on animal models, <b>which</b> limits direct <b>transferability</b> {{of these studies}} to humans. Some of these limitations can be overcome by using-otherwise discarded-skin from cosmetic surgeries. Superficial wounds are induced in fresh ex vivo skin, followed by intradermal injection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa under the wound. Subsequently, the infected skin is incubated for 20 hours at 37 °C and the CFU/wound are determined. Within 20 hours, the bacteria count increased from 107 to 109 bacteria per wound, while microscopy revealed a dense bacterial community in the collagen network of the upper wound layers as well as numerous bacteria scattered in the dermis. At the same time, IL- 1 alpha and IL- 1 beta amounts increased in all infected wounds, while-due to bacteria-induced cell lysis-the IL- 6 and IL- 8 concentrations rose only in the uninfected samples. High-dosage ciprofloxacin treatment resulted in a decisive decrease in bacteria, but consistently failed to eradicate all bacteria. The main benefits of the ex vivo wound model are the use of healthy human skin, a quantifiable bacterial infection, a measureable donor-dependent immune response and a good repeatability of the results. These properties turn the ex vivo wound model into a valuable tool to examine the mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions and to test antimicrobial agents...|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{predictive}} accident models (PAMs) {{are essential}} to design and maintain safe road networks however, ongoing changes in road and vehicle design coupled with road safety initiatives, mean that these models can quickly become dated. Unfortunately, because the fitting of sophisticated PAMs including {{a wide range of}} explanatory variables is not a trivial task, available models tend to be based on data collected many years ago and seem unlikely to give reliable estimates of current accidents. Large, expensive studies to produce new models are likely to be, at best, only a temporary solution. This paper thus seeks to develop a practical and efficient methodology to allow currently available PAMs to be updated to give unbiased estimates of accident frequencies at any point in time. Two principal issues are examined: the extent to <b>which</b> the temporal <b>transferability</b> of predictive accident models varies with model complexity; and the practicality and efficiency of two alternative updating strategies. The models used to illustrate these issues are the suites of models developed for rural dual and single carriageway roads in the UK. These are widely used in several software packages in spite of being based on data collected during the 1980 s. It was found that increased model complexity by no means ensures better temporal transferability and that calibration of the models using a scale factor can be a practical alternative to fitting new models...|$|R
