5|$|A furious Holiday Inn {{management}} {{presented the}} groups <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> for $24,000, which was reportedly settled by Herman's Hermits tour manager Edd McCann. Townshend {{claimed that the}} Who were banned for life {{from all of the}} hotel's properties, but Fletcher wrote that they stayed at a Holiday Inn in Rochester, New York a week later. He also disputed a widely held belief that Moon drove a Lincoln Continental into the hotel's swimming pool, as claimed by the drummer in a 1972 Rolling Stone interview.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Congress {{passed the}} Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the {{president}} to cancel items from an appropriations bill (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which governs {{what the president is}} permitted to do <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> once it has passed both houses of Congress. Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers. Scalia indicated he felt that authorizing {{the president to}} cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.|$|E
5|$|The new bridge {{remained}} in place along Route31A, however, no new {{portions of the}} freeway were constructed in terms of creating the Route31A Freeway, as proposed in1938. In1950, then-governor of New Jersey, Alfred E. Driscoll, cited {{the need for the}} expressway as an important truck and passenger car highway from Trenton to the Jersey Shore. Route31A itself was decommissioned in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, and replaced by the designation of Route64. The route was truncated from both ends toward Princeton and Hightstown, leaving just the bridge in West Windsor. Route31A {{remained in}} the state highway statutes for several decades after decommissioning, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> in1991 being proposed. The bill passed, and Route31A was stripped from the statutes on January18,1992.|$|E

25|$|The Second Amendment was {{relatively}} uncontroversial {{at the time}} of its ratification.

25|$|The land reform, {{liberating}} peasants {{from the}} last corvées, freeing their movements and redistributing some land (1864), was less successful. In attempting to create a solid support base among the peasants, Cuza soon found himself {{in conflict with the}} group of Conservatives. A liberal bill granting peasants title to the land they worked was defeated. Then the Conservatives responded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that ended all peasant dues and responsibilities, but gave landlords title to all the land. Cuza vetoed it, then held a plebiscite to alter the Paris Convention (the virtual constitution), in the manner of Napoleon III.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{attempts to}} maintain top secrecy regarding bills debated; MPs generally receive copies of bills {{only a few}} days before they are debated, and newspapers are rarely provided with copies of the bills before they are debated. In some cases, such as a 1968 amendment to the Constitution, an MP may be presented <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> to be debated on the same day it is tabled, and all three readings may be carried out that day itself. In rare circumstances, the government may release a White paper containing particular proposals that will eventually be incorporated into a bill; this has been done for legislation such as the Universities and University Colleges Act.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{separated}} from the sea by a low coastal plain, which made contact with the wider world difficult, Louth had become a prosperous market town with a forward-looking town corporation by the eighteenth century. Realising that {{a link to the}} North Sea would provide opportunities for trade and expansion, they commissioned the engineer John Grundy, Jr. to survey a route in October 1756. He suggested a route from Louth to Tetney Haven, and on 28 January 1760, subscriptions were invited to pay for a full survey and an Act of Parliament. The fund soon reached £850, and on 18 February 1760 the town clerk approached John Smeaton to carry out this survey. Smeaton advised caution, suggesting that they obtained the consent of as many landowners as possible before proceeding <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill,</b> as opposition in Parliament could be difficult to counter.|$|E

25|$|In November 2014, the Australian {{state of}} Victoria {{modified}} its existing sexting laws. In addition to prohibiting the sending of nude pictures without consent, the amendment also added safeguards to prevent minors from receiving child pornography charges for self-made content. The legislation followed an upsurge {{in the practice}} and the case Giller v Procopets, {{which had to be}} argued on the equity of breach of confidence and tort grounds. South Australia followed in 2016, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> making it illegal to distribute or threaten to distribute invasive nude photographs. New South Wales passed a Bill that criminalised the distribution, or threatened distribution, of intimate photos or videos, which commenced on 25 August 2017.

25|$|With the PAVN onslaught moving southwestwards of the PDJ {{towards the}} Hmong heartland, Vang Pao {{thought of a}} diversionary effort east of the PDJ a la Operation Counterpunch III. Instead, his CIA backers {{supplied}} him with a guerrilla regiment imported from Military Region 3 to the south. Landed on 28 February 1971, Groupement Mobile 31 (GM 31) was tasked with sweeping north from Skyline Ridge overlooking Long Tieng. They swept north toward the refugee center at Sam Thong. However, the operation's start was delayed by insubordination among the troops. Desertions began from Bataillon Guerrier 318 (BG 318) and Bataillon Guerrier 308 (BG 308) on 6 March. BG 318 refused its duties for two days until they were paid their overdue salaries. BG 308 retreated to Long Tieng <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> of complaints. They were appeased by relief of their commanding officer and the elevation of his deputy. Only after those matters were settled did the guerrillas resume operations.|$|E
25|$|Astronaut Alan Shepard, a {{long time}} Corvette owner, was invited by then GM Chief Engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov to drive {{pre-production}} Corvette models. General Motors executives later gave Shepard a 1972 model <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bill</b> Mitchell interior. Jim Rathmann, a Melbourne, Florida Chevrolet dealer and winner of the 1960 Indy 500, befriended astronauts Shepard, Gus Grissom, and Gordon Cooper. Rathmann convinced GM President Ed Cole {{to set up a}} program which supplied each astronaut with a pair of new cars each year. Most chose a family car for their wives and a Corvette for themselves. In his memoir Last Man On The Moon, Gene Cernan describes how this worked. The astronauts received brand-new Corvettes which they were given the option to purchase at a 'used' price after they'd been driven 3000 miles. Alan Bean recalls Corvettes lined up in the parking lot outside the astronaut offices at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and friendly races between Shepard and Grissom along the Florida beach roads and beaches themselves as local police turned a blind eye.|$|E

25|$|On 4 January 1974, Harry Schwarz met and had {{discussions with}} Gatsha (later Mangosuthu) Buthelezi, Chief Executive Councillor {{of the black}} {{homeland}} of KwaZulu. They agreed on a five-point plan for racial peace in South Africa that {{became known as the}} Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith. The declaration's purpose was to provide a blueprint for government of South Africa for racial peace in South Africa. It called for negotiations involving all peoples, in order to draw up constitutional proposals stressing opportunity for all <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights to safeguard these rights. It suggested that the federal concept was the appropriate framework for such changes to take place. It also first affirmed that political change must take place though non-violent means. The concept of a non-discriminatory society had been outlined in the 'Act of Dedication' of 1973 that Schwarz had written, while Leader of the Opposition in the Transvaal. Schwarz had called for the Transvaal and South Africa to adopt and subscribe to the act. While the United Party Transvaal caucus unanimously adopted the initiative, the National Party refused for it to come to debate. The principles of the act were adopted at the 1973 National United Party Congress.|$|E
25|$|Tyler {{had joined}} the Whig ticket largely due to his {{perceived}} personal closeness with Clay, but he quickly proved to have political views of his own. Tyler retained Harrison's Cabinet, but quickly made it known that he had reservations about re-establishing a national bank, a key priority of Clay's. Clay saw the re-establishment of a national bank as policy in reviving the weak national economy, and Clay sought to compromise with Tyler to create national bank legislation {{that the president would}} not veto. In August 1841, Tyler was presented <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that incorporated some of Tyler's proposals. Tyler vetoed the bill over concerns that the national bank would compete with state banks. After Tyler told Whig Congressman Alexander Stuart that he would sign a similar bill that addressed his concerns, Congressional Whigs wrote another bill that they hoped would satisfy Tyler. On September 9, Tyler vetoed this bill as well. Tyler's second veto infuriated his fellow Whigs, and Tyler's Cabinet resigned, with the exception of Secretary of State Daniel Webster. Reflecting his belief in legislative supremacy and his anger at Tyler's actions, Clay unsuccessfully proposed Constitutional amendments removing the president's veto power and giving Congress the authority to appoint the Secretary of the Treasury.|$|E

McCartney frequently visited gambling clubs in London, such as Curzon House, Epstein's favourite club, where he often ran into Epstein.

Epstein often lost thousands of pounds by playing baccarat or chemin de fer, the original version of baccarat when it was introduced to France, but would stay at Curzon House the whole evening, eating an expensive meal and drinking fine wines.
