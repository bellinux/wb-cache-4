There's still {{too much of a}} drinking culture in English football but it's not as bad as it used to be.

But that also means that we use a lot of chemicals that spread and go down to a ground water and makes the ground water worse.

5000|$|I don’t think there’s been a {{significant}} change in terms of our attitude towards libertarians. Two things have happened. We’ve grown, and we’ve gotten to a size where we don’t just do educational programs, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more outreach and a lot more policy and working with other organizations. I also believe the libertarian movement has changed. It’s become less influenced by Rothbard, less influenced by the anarchist, crazy {{for lack of a better}} word, wing of libertarianism. As a consequence, because we’re bigger and doing more things and because libertarianism has become more reasonable, we are doing more work with them than we have in the past. But I don’t think ideologically anything of substance has changed at the Institute.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{reported}} that the £1m Sorted posters campaign was the pro-bono work of three advertising companies: Booth Lockett and Makin (media buyers), Knight Leech and Delaney (advertising agency), and FFI (youth marketing consultants).

5000|$|The {{music on}} Phormula, {{including}} that of the bonus tracks on Rephormula, was mainly written by Giuliano Mogicato, then the band's main composer.

In a 2002 interview with webzine Chronicles of Chaos, Davide Tiso stated that Ephel Duath compositions are made in a [...] "very spontaneous" [...] way, and noting the band's complex arrangements, he added: [...] "It just flows from within us. We Tiso and Giuliano Mogicato love to have spontaneity with what <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of it comes from the initial guitar lines that act as a skeleton for the song at hand. ... We try to keep our ideas very open to every style of influence and bring that somehow into what we do." ...|$|E

5000|$|Despite the {{sessions}} in Chicago not entirely working out, it allowed the band to be well-prepared {{for what would}} become the album's proper recording sessions. According to singer/guitarist Guy Picciotto, “I think we really worked much harder on getting the songs together. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more pre-session demos, not just with Albini, but also using an 8-track reel-to-reel that we had bought to record our practices.
