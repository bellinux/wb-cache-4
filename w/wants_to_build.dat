5|$|Ellsworth M. Toohey, {{who writes}} a popular {{architecture}} {{column in the}} Banner, is an outspoken socialist who shapes public opinion through his column and a circle of influential associates. Toohey sets out to destroy Roark through a smear campaign. He recommends Roark to Hopton Stoddard, a wealthy acquaintance who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a Temple of the Human Spirit. Roark's unusual design includes a nude statue modeled on Dominique; Toohey convinces Stoddard to sue Roark for malpractice. Toohey and several architects (including Keating) testify at the trial that Roark is incompetent as an architect due to his rejection of historical styles. Dominique speaks in Roark's defense, but he loses the case. Dominique decides that since she cannot have the world she wants, in which men like Roark are recognized for their greatness, she will live entirely in the world she has, which shuns Roark and praises Keating. She marries Keating and turns herself over to him, doing and saying whatever he wants, such as persuading potential clients to hire him instead of Roark.|$|E

25|$|North of {{the railway}} line, which crosses Astana in an east-west direction, are {{industrial}} and poorer residential areas. Between the railway {{line and the}} Ishim river is the city centre, where at present intense building activity is occurring. To the west and east are more elevated residential areas with parks and the new area of government administration {{to the south of}} the Ishim River. Here many large building projects are under way; for example, the construction of a diplomatic quarter, and a variety of different government buildings. By 2030, these quarters are to be completed.

25|$|Recently {{there has}} been a spate of {{companies}} acting to improve their energy efficiency. Possibly the most prominent of these companies is Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the US, has announced specific environmental goals to reduce energy use in its stores and pressure its 60,000 suppliers in its worldwide supply chain to follow its lead. On energy efficiency, Wal-Mart wants to increase the fuel efficiency of its truck fleet by 25% {{over the next three years}} and double it within ten years, moving from 6.5 mpg. This seems an attainable goal, and by 2020, it is expected to save the company $494 million a year. The company also <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a store that is at least 25% more energy efficient within four years.|$|E
25|$|In the Lefay Fragment, Digory is {{born with}} the ability to speak to trees and animals, and lives with an Aunt Gertrude, a former school {{mistress}} with an officious, bullying nature, who has ended up as a Government minister after a lifetime of belligerent brow-beating of others. Whenever his aunt is absent, Digory finds solace with the animals and trees, including a talking squirrel named Pattertwig. Polly enters the story as a girl next door who is unable to understand the speech of non-human creatures. She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a raft to explore a stream which leads to an underground world. Digory helps construct the raft, but ends up sawing a branch from a talking tree necessary to complete it, in order not to lose face with Polly. This causes him to lose his supernatural powers of speech. The following day he is visited by his godmother MrsLefay who knows that Digory has lost his abilities and gives him a card with the address of a furniture shop which she instructs him to visit. At this point the fragment ends.|$|E

[...] For the Russos in The Winter Soldier, they {{had to deal with the}} idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. being infiltrated by Hydra, with Joe saying, [...] "how we get there is all up to us. And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film." [...] Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team [...] "come up with conceptually what we want to do" [...] for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film? That's where you start looking for the interconnectedness, but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble because you have to protect the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling.

[...] He contrasted the approach in Queensland with the practices developed in NSW during after the 1955 Hunter Valley floods, that aimed to move homes out of dangerous areas and establish warning systems. Keys also stated the NSW practices were being undone by reduced funding and unsafe housing developments, giving the example of Maitland where [...] "the council now <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> hundreds of dwellings on the flood plain in and round the CBD".
