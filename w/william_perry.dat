25|$|Similarly, the Iraqi nuclear {{scientist}} Imad Khadduri {{wrote in}} 2003 that {{the bombing of}} Osirak convinced the Iraqi leadership to initiate a full-fledged nuclear weapons program. United States Secretary of Defense <b>William</b> <b>Perry</b> stated in 1997 that Iraq refocused its nuclear weapons effort on producing highly enriched uranium after the raid. Its interest in acquiring plutonium as fissile material for weapons continued, but at a lower priority.|$|E

25|$|Longstreet {{gave the}} order to move at 11:10a.m. and Johnson's {{division}} proceeded across the Brotherton field, by coincidence to precisely the point where Wood's Union division was {{pulling out of the}} line. Johnson's brigade on the left, commanded by Col. John S. Fulton, drove directly through the gap. The brigade on the right, under Brig. Gen. Evander McNair, encountered opposition from Brannan's division (parts of Col. John M. Connell's brigade), but was also able to push through. The few Union soldiers in that sector ran in panic from the onslaught. At {{the far side of the}} Dyer field, several Union batteries of the XXI Corps reserve artillery were set up, but without infantry support. Although the Confederate infantrymen hesitated briefly, Gregg's brigade, commanded by Col. Cyrus Sugg, which flanked the guns on their right, Sheffield's brigade, commanded by Col. <b>William</b> <b>Perry,</b> and the brigade of Brig. Gen. Jerome B. Robertson, captured 15 of the 26 cannons on the ridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{most obvious}} {{took place between}} 1869 and 1871, when American <b>William</b> <b>Perry</b> Fogg {{traveled}} the world, describing his tour {{in a series of}} letters to The Cleveland Leader newspaper, entitled, Round the World: Letters from Japan, China, India, and Egypt (1872). But long before Fogg, Greek traveller Pausanias (c. 100 AD) wrote a work that was translated into French in 1797 as Voyage autour du monde ("Around the World"). Verne's friend Jacques Arago had written a very popular Voyage autour du monde in 1853. In 1869–70 the idea of travelling around the world reached critical popular attention when three geographical breakthroughs occurred: the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in America (1869), the linking of the Indian railways across the sub-continent (1870), and the opening of the Suez Canal (1869). In 1871 appeared Around the World by Steam, via Pacific Railway, published by the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and an Around the World in A Hundred and Twenty Days by Edmond Planchut. In early 1870, the Erie Railway Company published a statement of routes, times, and distances detailing a trip around the globe of 23,739 miles in seventy-seven days and twenty-one hours.|$|E

500|$|In April 1994, Bosnian Serbs forces {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the UN Safe Area of Goražde. [...] Initially, US Secretary of Defense <b>William</b> <b>Perry</b> told reporters that the United States would [...] "not enter the war to stop" [...] the Serbs from overrunning Goražde, and other senior officials publicly downplayed the possibility of using air strikes. Several days into the attack, however, a number of UNPROFOR soldiers were injured, and one was killed by Serb fire. Thus, General Michael Rose, the UNPROFOR Commander, requested NATO strikes under the mandate of UNSCR 836.|$|E
500|$|The Fleet {{arrived in}} New South Wales in January 1788, with the Marines {{disembarking}} first at Botany Bay. Six days later they reboarded the ships for the voyage to Port Jackson, {{where they were}} reorganised into four companies under the commands of Captains James Campbell and John Shea, and Captain-Lieutenants Watkin Tench and James Meredith. Baker was promoted to sergeant and assigned to Tench's company alongside fellow sergeants <b>William</b> <b>Perry</b> and [...] Edward Campion.

Aretha Franklin appeared at the third WrestleMania and sang a rendition of [...] "America the Beautiful." [...] Franklin appeared 20 years later at WrestleMania 23 and sang another rendition of the same song. At times, WWE has inducted celebrities into their Hall of Fame. For example, Chicago Bears defensive lineman <b>William</b> <b>Perry</b> wrestled in a match that involved other NFL football players, and he {{was inducted into the}} WWE Hall of Fame as a [...] "Celebrity Inductee" [...] in 2006. Another celebrity was Mike Tyson, who appeared at WrestleMania XIV and was originally planned to enforce the ringside area, although he was involved in a physical altercation with Shawn Michaels (Michael Hickenbottom). Pete Rose has made the most celebrity appearances at WrestleMania, with four overall appearances. Overall, there have been 99 celebrities involved at WrestleMania: 32 athletes, 29 musicians, 19 actors, and 20 others from different backgrounds.|$|E
500|$|Clark {{was sent}} to Bosnia by Secretary of Defense <b>William</b> <b>Perry</b> {{to serve as the}} {{military}} advisor to a diplomatic negotiating team headed by assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke. Holbrooke later described Clark's position as [...] "complicated" [...] because it presented him with future possibilities but [...] "might put him into career-endangering conflicts with more senior officers." [...] While the team was driving along a mountain road during the first week, the road gave way, and one of the vehicles fell over a cliff carrying passengers including Holbrooke's deputy, Robert Frasure, a deputy assistant Secretary of Defense, Joseph Kruzel, and Air Force Colonel Nelson Drew. Clark and Holbrooke attempted to crawl down the mountain, but were driven back by sniper fire. Once the fire ceased, Clark rappelled down the mountain to collect the bodies of two dead Americans left by Bosnian forces that had taken the remaining wounded to a nearby hospital. Following funeral services in Washington, D.C., the negotiations continued and the team eventually reached the Dayton Agreement at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, and later signed it in Paris on December 14, 1995.|$|E
500|$|The {{ease with}} which the HV {{achieved}} victory surprised many observers as Western intelligence services predicted a Croatian defeat. International reactions to Operation Storm quickly evolved from emotive arguments, supportive of either side in the battle, to those calmly assessing {{the situation on the}} ground. UN officials and most international media criticised Croatia. Carl Bildt, an EU negotiator working for the former Yugoslavia, publicly condemned Croatia, while UN Special Representative Stoltenberg urged the UN Secretary General Personal Representative Yasushi Akashi to request NATO strikes against the HV. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel expressed regret but added that [...] "...the years of Serb aggression... have sorely tried Croatia's patience". The US response was mixed. While Secretary of Defense <b>William</b> <b>Perry</b> reflected favourably on the military development, the US ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, declared his disapproval. On 10 August, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 1009 demanding that Croatia halt military operations, condemning the targeting of UN peacekeepers, and calling for the resumption of talksbut not calling for a HV withdrawal. By 18 August, US diplomats on Robert Frasure's team tasked to mediate in the Bosnian War believed Operation Storm lent their diplomatic mission a chance to succeed, reflecting the opinion of US President Bill Clinton that the Serbs would not negotiate seriously unless they sustained major military defeats.|$|E
