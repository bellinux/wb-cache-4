5|$|As {{a result}} of the Railways Act 1921, on 1 January 1923 the North Eastern Railway became the North Eastern area of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The {{passenger}} service was <b>withdrawn</b> north of Tow Law on 1 May 1939. Britain's railways were nationalised on 1 January 1948 and the lines were placed under the control of British Railways. In the early 1950s control was split between the North Eastern and London Midland regions with Kirkby Stephen as the boundary. Local passenger trains were <b>withdrawn</b> between Kirkby Stephen and Tebay on 1 December 1952. The service along Weardale was <b>withdrawn</b> on 29 June 1953 and services north of Crook on 11 June 1956.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the {{discovery}} of wing cracking led to the quick retirement of all Hunter F.58As. The end of the Cold War also allowed Switzerland to retire its Hunters earlier than expected; the Hunter was completely <b>withdrawn</b> from Swiss service in 1994. The Swiss Air Force lost the capability to carry out air-to-ground operations when the Hunters were <b>withdrawn</b> from service.|$|E
5|$|Metropolitan line {{services}} <b>withdrawn</b> between Latimer Road and Kensington Olympia following bomb damage at Uxbridge Road.|$|E
5|$|A fastidious and {{somewhat}} <b>withdrawn</b> individual, Balfour succumbed to alcoholism in his fifties. This brought about his early death.|$|E
5|$|After {{a return}} to the United States in mid-1970, Yancey entered {{inactive}} status at Norfolk on 1 October of that year. The ship was decommissioned at Norfolk on 20 January 1971, and entered the James River berthing area of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Yancey was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 January 1977. The vessel remained in the James River fleet until 16 August 1984 when she was <b>withdrawn</b> to be stripped of useful equipment by the U.S. Navy. She re-entered the fleet one year later, on 28 August 1985, but was <b>withdrawn</b> for the final time on 15 December 1989 to be prepared for sinking as an artificial reef.|$|E
5|$|As {{discussion}} continued, {{the battalion}} was <b>withdrawn</b> {{from the front}} lines, leaving Task Force Wahl on 23 January. It returned to 12th Armored Division, where three platoons were committed to combat to support the fighting in the Colmar Pocket {{in the first week}} of February. The remainder of the battalion was kept in reserve, where the disciplinary problems, including assaults on civilians, grew to the point at which the commander had to request outside assistance to restore control on 5 February. The battalion was removed from its attachment to the 12th Armored on 12 February—by request of the divisional command—and <b>withdrawn</b> to the rear area of XV Corps to take up guard duties.|$|E
5|$|Both vessels were {{involved}} in the operations off Lissa in July 1866, but neither took part in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July. Formidabile had been damaged by Austrian coastal fortifications the day before, and had <b>withdrawn</b> for repairs; Terribile was ready for action, but had been preparing to attack Lissa and was too far south to {{take an active role in}} the battle. Both ships saw minimal use in the 1870s and 1880s, until both were <b>withdrawn</b> from service for use as training ships. Formidabile and Terribile served in this capacity until 1903 and 1904, respectively, when they were sold and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|By 1843, public {{dissatisfaction with}} him had reached crisis {{proportions}} {{and there were}} demands for a Constitution. Initially Otto refused to grant a Constitution, {{but as soon as}} Bavarian troops were <b>withdrawn</b> from the kingdom, a popular revolt was launched.|$|E
5|$|C# was {{originally}} {{submitted to the}} ISO subcommittee JTC 1/SC 22 for review, under ISO/IEC 23270:2003, was <b>withdrawn</b> and was then approved under ISO/IEC 23270:2006.|$|E
5|$|Cantieri Navali Riuniti of Italy {{proposed}} a design {{based on their}} Sauro-class submarine, scaled up by 25%. The age of the early 1970s design was a concern, and the proposal was <b>withdrawn</b> early in the process.|$|E
5|$|FES {{was sold}} and then <b>withdrawn</b> in the UK in 1976 as Guinness XXX Extra Strong Stout; it {{returned}} in 1990 when interest in craft beer increased. The beer was again <b>withdrawn</b> from the UK market, returning in 2003 to cater for the increasing African diaspora. The British market is supplied {{with both the}} Irish and the Nigerian brewed variants of the beer, the latter of which has annual sales of £2 million. Official imports of FES into the US were resumed in 2010, following a resurgent interest in craft beer; this was {{after a period of}} grey imports, predominantly for African and Caribbean expatriates.|$|E
5|$|He 111 B-2: As B-1, {{but with}} DB600GG engines, and extra {{radiators}} {{on either side}} of the engine nacelles under the wings. Later the DB 600Ga engines were added and the wing surface coolers <b>withdrawn.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{fourteen}} standard stock {{motor cars}} were <b>withdrawn</b> from passenger service, and {{were converted to}} ballast motor cars, with the final one completed in early 1955. All of the vehicles chosen had been built in 1923, four by Cammell Laird and ten by the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Co. At least {{three of them were}} chosen because they were at Acton Works for repairs to collision damage. They were numbered L62 to L75, and were painted grey. In 1957, they were all repainted in Metropolitan maroon. L72 was the first to be scrapped, after a collision in 1963. At the time, the standard stock was being <b>withdrawn</b> and replaced by 1959/62 Stock, and so rather than repair it, it was replaced by a 1927 motor car. The replacement also carried the number L72. A 1931 motor car was used to replace L73 when it was badly damaged in 1967, but in this case it carried a new number, becoming L77. During the 1970s, the ballast motor cars were gradually <b>withdrawn.</b> The last two to be used were L63 and L68, which performed leaf-clearing duties in late 1977, and all had been scrapped by September 1978.|$|E
5|$|In 1963 Richard Beeching {{published}} his report The Reshaping of British Railways, which recommended closing the network's least used stations and lines. This included the remaining former S lines {{except for the}} line between Darlington and Saltburn via Stockton and Middlesbrough. Passenger service between Nunthrope and Guisborough was <b>withdrawn</b> in 1964; the service between Middlesbrough and Nunthrope was retained. The line between Darlington and Barnard Castle and the branch to Middleton-in-Teesdale were closed to passengers on 30 November 1964. Trains were <b>withdrawn</b> north of Bishop Auckland on 8 March 1965, but the passenger service to Bishop Auckland was saved because of regional development concerns.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{following}} the largest trans-national election in history, despite the European Council choosing a President from the largest political group (the EPP), the Parliament again exerted {{pressure on the}} Commission. During the Parliament's hearings of the proposed Commissioners MEPs raised doubts about some nominees with the Civil Liberties committee rejecting Rocco Buttiglione from the post of Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security over his views on homosexuality. That {{was the first time}} the Parliament had ever voted against an incoming Commissioner and despite Barroso's insistence upon Buttiglione the Parliament forced Buttiglione to be <b>withdrawn.</b> A number of other Commissioners also had to be <b>withdrawn</b> or reassigned before Parliament allowed the Barroso Commission to take office.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, five Merlin Mk3s were {{operating}} in Afghanistan, transporting troops and supplies. The deployment to Afghanistan was criticised as the aircraft reportedly lacked protective Kevlar armour. By July 2010, the Merlin fleet was fully fitted with ballistic armour. The deployment of Merlins to Afghanistan allowed the detachment of Sea Kings to be <b>withdrawn</b> {{from the region}} in October 2011. As part of the UK drawdown in Afghanistan, Merlins were <b>withdrawn</b> from theatre in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|In June 1981, new once-weekly routes linking Horsham to Steyning and Cranleigh/Ewhurst to Brighton were introduced, {{the second}} to replace a <b>withdrawn</b> Southdown Motor Services service. To improve profits on the Brighton route, beer was carried from the Sussex Brewery near Edburton to public houses along the route {{alongside}} passengers. The scheduled service operations of coach firm McCann's were acquired, together with three vehicles, on 1 November 1982, although some were <b>withdrawn</b> a year later.|$|E
5|$|In May 1976, the company's {{long-established}} route between Guildford and Peaslake {{was extended}} to Cranleigh via Ewhurst, and a once-daily schoolday service to and from The Haven, the first bus route to serve the community, was introduced. A number of service changes saw Tillingbourne vehicles operating to Croydon and Chichester {{one day a week}} each by 1977, although both were <b>withdrawn</b> after three years. The service to Colgate was <b>withdrawn</b> and replaced by a local half-hourly route in Horsham in 1979. In September 1980, the company moved depots again to a larger site in Cranleigh.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, {{the unit}} {{was sent to}} Gibraltar before moving to North Africa in April from where they were {{involved}} in the Allied invasion of Sicily and operations in Italy prior to being <b>withdrawn</b> to Britain to prepare for Operation Overlord. On D-Day they went ashore on 6 June 1944 as part of the 1st Special Service Brigade tasked with linking up with the 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword before being <b>withdrawn.</b> Later they took part in the Allied counterattack during the Ardennes Offensive in early 1945 before taking part in the advance into Germany as part of Operation Plunder.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to concerns and recommendations {{raised by the}} Banff-Bow Valley Study, a number of development plans were curtailed in the 1990s. Plans to add nine holes at the Banff Springs Golf Resort were <b>withdrawn</b> in 1996.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{reported}} back to Menoher and Lieutenant General Hunter Liggett {{that the}} Germans had indeed <b>withdrawn,</b> and {{was awarded a}} fourth Silver Star. He was also awarded a second Croix de guerre and made a commandeur of the Légion d'honneur.|$|E
5|$|Nigerian Air Force ordered 13 Jaguar SNs & 5 Jaguar BNs in 1983, with {{delivery}} from 1984, being {{operated by}} a squadron at Makurdi. <b>Withdrawn</b> from use in 1991 as an economy measure.|$|E

5|$|On 1 July 1905, the Met and the District both {{introduced}} electric {{units on}} the inner circle until later that day a Met multiple unit overturned the positive current rail on the District and the Met service was <b>withdrawn.</b> An incompatibility {{was found between the}} way the shoe-gear was mounted on Met trains and the District track and Met trains were <b>withdrawn</b> from the District and modified. Full electric service started on 24 September, reducing the travel time around the circle from 70 to 50 minutes.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 2011, the Australian Minister for Defence Materiel, Jason Clare, {{announced}} that the Sea Kings would be <b>withdrawn</b> from service in December 2011; having flown in excess of 60,000 hours in operations in Australia and overseas in that time. The farewell flight was conducted on 15 December 2011, three Sea Kings flew over Sydney Harbour and across to Canberra, passing Lake Burley Griffin and the Australian War Memorial before landing at Nowra. On 16 December 2011, the Chief of Navy presided over the ceremonial decommissioning of 817 Squadron RAN at NAS Nowra. Five of the <b>withdrawn</b> helicopters have been made available for sale. The replacement for the Sea King is the MRH 90.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March 1980, {{an empty}} stock train {{comprising}} five Hastings Unit vehicles derailed at Appledore due to excessive speed through {{a set of}} points. The driver was killed. A motor coach was consequently <b>withdrawn</b> from service due to extensive damage.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 1993, the Joondalup railway line {{came into}} {{operation}} {{as part of}} the Northern Suburbs Transit System, resulting {{in the creation of the}} 449 and 457 services to replace the 387 service. The 449 operated only during the morning and evening rush-hour, while the 457 operated after-hours and at weekends. These services operated virtually unchanged until 6 November 2011, when the 347 was replaced with the present-day 387, and the 457 and weekday evening services were <b>withdrawn.</b> On 31 January 2016, the 449 was also <b>withdrawn,</b> leaving Hamersley without weekend bus services.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September the {{battalion}} was relieved by American forces. At {{this time they}} were <b>withdrawn</b> from the line {{along with the rest}} of the 1st Division. They would take no further part in the fighting. In early October, the rest of the Australian Corps, severely depleted due to heavy casualties and falling enlistments in Australia, was also <b>withdrawn</b> upon a request made by Prime Minister Billy Hughes, to re-organise in preparation for further operations. On 11 November, an armistice came into effect, and as hostilities came to an end, {{the battalion}}'s personnel were slowly repatriated back to Australia for demobilisation and discharge. This was completed in May 1919.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April 2007, Rollcentre Racing {{announced}} that its LMP2 Radical-Judd entry had been <b>withdrawn</b> {{due to the}} car being purchased by Embassy Racing. The PSI Experience Chevrolet Corvette C6.R took its place on the entry list.|$|E

5|$|Several {{locomotives}} {{have been}} given the name Great Western. The first was an Iron Duke class broad-gauge locomotive built in 1846, the first locomotive entirely constructed at the company's Swindon locomotive works. This was <b>withdrawn</b> in 1870, but in 1888 a newly built locomotive in the same class was given the same name; this was <b>withdrawn</b> four years later when the broad gauge was taken out of use. A standard-gauge 3031 class locomotive, number 3012, was then given the name. The last GWR locomotive to carry the name was Castle class number 7007, which continued to carry it in British Railways days.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1916, {{the ships}} of the Braunschweig class were <b>withdrawn</b> from active service, {{primarily}} because of manpower shortages. Braunschweig {{was used as a}} training ship, and on 20 August 1917, was converted into a barracks ship in Kiel. Elsass was also used as a barracks and training ship in Kiel, having been <b>withdrawn</b> from active service on 25 July 1916. Hessen was converted into a depot ship in Brunsbüttel in 1917, while Preussen became a depot ship in Wilhelmshaven that same year.
