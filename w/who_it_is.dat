5|$|In {{the process}} of {{destroying}} NESTS, he becomes allied with Maxima, a cyborg whose best friend was killed by NESTS agents and is seeking to avenge the death. While Maxima sees K' as a friend and his partner, K' is stoic and cynical. He also meets Whip, <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> revealed is a clone of his sister, Seirah. Even though Whip reveals her identity to K', he ignores this, saying he will do what he pleases. Although he hates The King of Fighters tournaments, he commonly enters them, being asked by someone, or to find NESTS. The participants often criticize him for being antisocial. After destroying NESTS, K' starts recovering his memories, but he suspects he could forget all the people he has met. He also becomes determined to prove he is better than Kyo, instead of being only a clone.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor {{discovers that}} the volcano {{is being used}} by the Pyroviles to convert the human race and conquer Earth. The Doctor realises the volcano will not erupt if the energy {{converter}} is running, and tells Donna that the volcanic eruption is a fixed point in time and must always happen. The Doctor and Donna get into an escape pod and together press a lever which overloads the converter and triggers the eruption, killing the Pyroviles and launching the pod clear of the blast. The Doctor and Donna run for the TARDIS and the Doctor coldly leaves Caecilius and his family cowering in their home using the TARDIS in order to not interfere too deeply with history. However, Donna tearfully begs him to go back and at least save one person, regardless of <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> The Doctor finally relents and goes back for Caecilius and his family. He leaves them on a hill overlooking the destruction, and together with Donna slips out quietly as the family mourns Pompeii. The Doctor comments to Donna that she was right - he does need someone to stop him.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey driving up {{to a large}} movie theater, the Los Angeles Theatre in {{downtown}} Los Angeles, with several of her female friends. As they {{pull up to the}} front doors, they tell Carey that her boyfriend is inside with another woman, leading her to try to convince them to abort the plan of confrontation. After convincing her, they enter the theater and begin a series of small dance routines alongside some of the theater employees. As the music begins, scenes of them dancing and Carey entering the movie projection room inter-cut. Carey sits behind her boyfriend (played by Jerry O'Connell) and the woman he is cheating with, and spy on them in a comedic way with her female lackeys. Soon after, the still unidentified woman walks towards the bathroom, prompting Carey to follow her during a short interlude in the video. After running into each other by the washroom, the woman appears to be Carey sporting a short brown wig and red seductive clothing. Carey pokes her, starting a large brawl in between the two women. Afterwards, Carey appears to have defeated the woman named Bianca, and heads back towards the movie room. During this scene, Jay-Z's rap verse is played, while an animated clip of Jay-Z and Carey is projected onto the screen. Later a version of the video leaked where Jay-Z was rapping his verse in a jacuzzi. During the verse, Carey's friends begin throwing popcorn and other candies at O'Connell, prompting a small food fight in between them. As they halt their attack on him, Carey walks towards O'Connell's seat and acts as though she is Bianca. After she sits next to him and he notices <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> Carey spills a large soda on his lap and bids him farewell, leaving the theater with her friends smiling.|$|E

25|$|Customization was {{significantly}} overhauled, specifically by allowing equipment {{and other items}} to modify their appearance based on <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> equipped to. Depending upon which party member has received it, a piece of armour would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining their identity. Players can craft and customize armour or weapons using the materials they have collected; rarer materials give the particular weapon or armour piece better attributes. Players can customize their keeps, such as rebuilding a garden as a Chantry church or a herb garden. These upgrades have minor effects on the Inquisitions espionage, commerce or military capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Badiou's {{ultimate}} ethical maxim {{is therefore}} one of: 'decide upon the undecidable'. It is {{to name the}} indiscernible, the generic set, and thus name the event that re-casts ontology in a new light. He identifies four domains in which a subject (<b>who,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important to note, becomes a subject through this process) can potentially witness an event: love, science, politics and art. By enacting fidelity to the event within these four domains one performs a 'generic procedure', which in its undecidability is necessarily experimental, and one potentially recasts {{the situation in which}} being takes place. Through this maintenance of fidelity, truth has the potentiality to emerge.|$|E

In Rosie's room, they confront Terry about being at the lake when Rosie died. As Stan and Mitch enter the room, Terry apologizes, asking them to not be mad at her.|$|E

25|$|Many {{magazines}} {{began in}} Tamil Nadu during the 1920s and '30s. The humour magazine Ananda Vikatan started by S.S.

It is still running successfully after 80 years and the Vikatan group today also publishes Chutti Vikatan, Junior Vikatan, Motor Vikatan and other special interest magazines. R. Krishnamurthy serialised his short stories and novels in Ananda Vikatan and eventually started his own weekly Kalki. The name Kalki denotes the impending tenth Avatar of Lord Vishnu in the Hindu religion, <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> said, will bring to an end the Kali Yuga and reinstate Dharma or righteoueness among the worldly beings. He used the name because he wanted to bring about liberation of India.|$|E

25|$|In West Virginia, the owners, surveyors, and {{builders}} of the Deepwater Railway ran into lots of conflicts {{with both the}} C and the N There was a nasty dispute with C forces over a contested tunnel site near Jenny Gap which landed in court. The Raleigh County court ruled for the C, but the West Virginia Supreme Court reversed the ruling {{in favor of the}} Deepwater Railway. In another court case, Page had what may have been a near-miss with a perjury charge. Upon interrogation by N attorneys in a West Virginia legal confrontation over right-of-way, Col. Page representing the Deepwater Railway, identified the estate of the late Abram S. Hewitt, a former mayor of New York as one of his investors. Page never mentioned Rogers, <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now known had been an associate of Hewitt and may have been acting through the Hewitt estate. The N attorneys were unsuccessful in learning more at that time, or during many other confrontations as they attempted to stop the progress of the Deepwater in West Virginia. Ultimately, both the C and the N lost the battle and the Deepwater routing was successfully secured east to the Virginia state line near Glen Lyn.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{diagnosis of}} EVD {{is confirmed by}} isolating the virus, detecting its RNA or proteins, or detecting antibodies against the virus in a person's blood. Isolating the virus by cell culture, detecting the viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and detecting proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are methods best used {{in the early stages}} of the disease and also for detecting the virus in human remains. Detecting antibodies against the virus is most reliable in the later stages of the disease and in those who recover. IgM antibodies are detectable two days after symptom onset and IgG antibodies can be detected 6 to 18 days after symptom onset. During an outbreak, isolation of the virus via cell culture methods is often not feasible. In field or mobile hospitals, the most common and sensitive diagnostic methods are real-time PCR and ELISA. In 2014, with new mobile testing facilities deployed in parts of Liberia, test results were obtained 3–5 hours after sample submission. In 2015 a rapid antigen test which gives results in 15 minutes was approved for use by <b>WHO.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> able to confirm Ebola in 92% of those affected and rule it out in 85% of those not affected.|$|E
