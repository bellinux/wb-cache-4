The unemployment rate in Northern England is 5.3% compared to an England-wide and UK-wide average of 4.8%, and the North East has the highest unemployment rate in the UK, at 7.0% as of December 2016, more than one percentage point higher than any other region. As of 2015, the gross value added (GVA) of the Northern English economy was £316 billion, and if it were an independent nation, it would be the tenth largest economy in Europe. The region does have poor growth and productivity rates compared to Southern England and to other EU countries.|$|E
25|$|Aerospace was a {{well-developed}} {{industry in}} the Soviet Union. In late 1980s, the Soviet Union accounted for 25% of the worldwide civilian and 40% of the worldwide military aircraft production. The consequences of the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 were however catastrophic. The <b>whole</b> <b>manufacturing</b> sector was devastated by imports, while the aerospace and automobile industries barely managed to survive under highly protective tariffs. On the positive side, the military aircraft industry managed to benefit from improving export possibilities. It profited from a large stock of components and parts which had been produced during Soviet times. The civilian aircraft industry fared much worse: while in 1990, the country had produced 715 civilian aircraft, by 1998 the number had dropped to 54 and in 2000 only 4 civilian aircraft were produced.|$|E

50|$|In 1921 Thomas De La Rue & Co Ltd {{was sold}} by the family to a {{consortium}} of 3large companies.

60|$|With that view, and {{to furnish}} a cheap supply of {{materials}} to the manufactures of England, {{they formed a}} scheme which tended to destroy, or at least essentially to impair, the <b>whole</b> <b>manufacturing</b> interest of Bengal.

60|$|But {{that is not}} the {{question}} now. It is conspired against; and we have given a few proofs of the conspiracy, as they shine out of various classes engaged in it. An indictment against the <b>whole</b> <b>manufacturing</b> interest need not be longer, surely, than the indictment {{in the case of the}} Crown against O'Connell and others. Mr. Cobden may be taken as its representative--as indeed he is, by one consent already. There may be no evidence; but that is not required. A judge and jury are all that is needed. And the Government know where to find them, or they gain experience to little purpose.|$|E
60|$|The present Government, having shown {{itself to}} be {{particularly}} clever in its management of Indictments for Conspiracy, cannot do better, we think (keeping in its administrative eye the pacification {{of some of its}} most influential and most unruly supporters), than indict the <b>whole</b> <b>manufacturing</b> interest of the country for a conspiracy against the agricultural interest. As the jury ought to be beyond impeachment, the panel might be chosen among the Duke of Buckingham's tenants, with the Duke of Buckingham himself as foreman; and, to the end that the country might be quite satisfied with the judge, and have ample security beforehand for his moderation and impartiality, it would be desirable, perhaps, to make such a slight change in the working of the law (a mere nothing to a Conservative Government, bent upon its end), as would enable the question to be tried before an Ecclesiastical Court, with the Bishop of Exeter presiding. The Attorney-General for Ireland, turning his sword into a ploughshare, might conduct the prosecution; and Mr. Cobden and the other traversers might adopt any ground of defence they chose, or prove or disprove anything they pleased, without being embarrassed by the least anxiety or doubt in reference to the verdict.|$|E

50|$|Ideal Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems possess six core characteristics: Modularity, Integrability, Customized flexibility, Scalability, Convertibility, and Diagnosability.

30|$|We apply our {{decomposition}} to {{data from}} 18 OECD countries by employing EU KLEMS. We focus on the period 1995 – 2006, for which data is available for {{the largest number of}} countries. For each country, we decompose the ULC of the <b>whole</b> country, <b>manufacturing</b> sector, and electricity, gas, and water supply sector. This allows us to quantify empirically by how much the conventional measure of wage effect overestimates or underestimates the comprehensive impact on ULC of wage changes. Since the underlying technology varies across sectors, the magnitude of bias in the conventional wage effect is also likely to vary.|$|R

The paper presents method of the risk value evaluation for serial-production structures and conceptions of weight coefficients in the method. The pro-posed method of risk evaluation {{may be helpful to}} determine the risk level in chosen production line and eventually for the <b>whole</b> enterprise <b>manufacturing</b> systems.

50|$|A casting {{system can}} be {{combined}} with many different production steps within a production line. So casting becomes an integrated part of the <b>whole</b> <b>manufacturing</b> of a part. To account for the delicate requirements of dispensing in all production steps in the best way, the most significant manufacturers are active in automation as well. The newest development {{in this area is}} the design of a production line from prefabricated, ideally adapted modules. This speeds up the development of individual solutions and decreases their costs.|$|E
5000|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) refers to long-term capital investment, {{such as the}} purchase or construction of machinery, buildings, or <b>whole</b> <b>manufacturing</b> plants. If foreigners are investing in a country, that represents an inbound flow and counts as a surplus item on the capital account. If a nation's citizens are investing in foreign countries, that represents an outbound flow and counts as a deficit.

5000|$|The {{stabilizing}} and thickening {{agents are}} employed {{to improve the}} viscosity and consistency of dispersion or solution of the strip preparation solution or suspension before casting.
