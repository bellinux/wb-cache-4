5|$|Although the new Phantoms were {{assigned}} a British designation as the F.3, they were generally {{referred to as}} the F-4J(UK). They {{were assigned}} to 74 Squadron at RAF Wattisham, which stood up in October 1984, two months after the first flight. The aircraft remained in service through the transition to the Tornado, which began entering service in 1987. In 1990, thanks to the conversion of F-4M squadrons to the Tornado, the RAF were able to transfer the best of its remaining FGR.2s to 74 Squadron, which meant that the F.3 was able to be withdrawn in January 1991. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of exceptions, all of the RAF's F-4Js were broken up for scrap. One of the 15 airframes was lost in a crash in 1987, killing both crew members.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} large debts, which {{at one point}} {{amounted}} to 4million euros, the club {{could not afford to}} buy new players. As a consequence, the first team at the time consisted mostly of youth players mixed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of foreign players brought to the club on free transfers. In the autumn of 2006, the leadership of the club changed, with the debt still amounting to over 3million euros, and it was not until January 2011 that the club announced that the debt had been paid in full. During this period, Maribor never finished above third place in the Slovenian league, and were runners-up in the Slovenian Cup twice. They were, however, one of the 11 winners of the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup, in which they defeated Spanish side Villarreal in the final round, only a couple of months after Villareal had played in the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|The only goal of {{the game}} {{followed}} shortly thereafter. Curtis went on a run for Cardiff, who passed it forward near the box to Ferguson. He shot the ball towards the goal, but it had little power and was easily picked up by Lewis. However, as he did so, the ball squirmed out of Lewis' hands and slipped in between {{the crook of his}} left elbow and body. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of Cardiff City forwards closing in, Lewis tried to reclaim the ball but only succeeded in knocking it into the net with his elbow. Arsenal sought to attack immediately after the kick off, but despite it looking promising, Brain was caught offside. Cardiff countered, and possibly could have had a second goal, but Curtis chose to shoot himself rather than pass to Davies, who would have been presented with an open goal had he received the ball as Lewis was out of position. The match ended with a victory for Cardiff City by one goal to nil. The King presented the trophy to Cardiff's captain Keenor, and medals to each of the players from both teams.|$|E
40|$|An {{empirical}} model of daily fluxes {{at the sea}} surface is proposed. The model, referred to as EMAD (Empirical Model of Atmospheric Dynamics), concentrates on the linear dynamics of the time-varying part of the air-sea fluxes. It {{is based on a}} general formulation that allows different types of air-sea interactions depending on the relative dominance of the model parameters. The parameters are obtained by fitting the model to <b>a</b> long integration <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupled</b> atmosphere ocean general circulation model. EMAD is able to reproduce air-sea interactions found in <b>a</b> <b>coupled</b> general circulation model. In particular, EMAD reveals realistic stationary responses to different sea surface conditions. The variance distributions produced by EMAD are comparable to those obtained from <b>an</b> integration <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupled</b> general circulation model. Finally, the characteristic air-sea interactions as described by the cross-correlation functions and found in <b>an</b> integration <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupled</b> general circulation model are captured by EMAD. Given these properties of EMAD, the ocean circulation and its variability can be studied using an ocean general circulation model driven by EMAD...|$|R

The second break comes to the Lions when Buddy Garrity reveals to Eric that the address on file for the Panthers new prodigy running back, Luke Cafferty, is nothing more than a mailbox in front of an empty lot, and Luke is really zoned for East Dillon. Tami is faced with a struggle as the principal of West Dillon. A new character on the show, Becky, is introduced when Tim Riggins rents a trailer on her mother's property. Although she is in love with Tim, she and Luke are both shopping at a convenience store and she allows Luke to drive her home. The two have sex and Becky becomes pregnant. Even though she is a student at East Dillon, she seeks out Tami's help with the situation. Tami discusses all of the options with her and Becky decides to get an abortion.

When Tami refuses to apologize, as she followed procedure, she is put on leave. She decides to return to her role as a guidance counselor, but at East Dillon.|$|E
5|$|Each NBA and WNBA {{franchise}} {{seeks to}} add new players through their respective annual draft. The NBA uses a draft lottery {{to determine the}} first three picks of the NBA draft; the 14teams that {{did not make the}} playoffs the previous year are eligible to participate. After the first three picks are decided, the rest of the teams pick in reverse order of their win–loss record. To be eligible for the NBA Draft, a player in the United States must be at least 19years old during the calendar year of the draft and must be at least one year removed from the graduation of his high school class. From 1967 until the ABA–NBA merger in 1976, the American Basketball Association (ABA) held its own draft. The WNBA Draft is similar to the NBA <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of exceptions. Only fourWNBA teams are eligible for the draft lottery, compared to the 14 eligible teams in the NBA. Also, all non-playoff teams that participate in the draft lottery select their picks in the order of the lottery outcome; the remainder of the league selects in reverse order of their win–loss record. The WNBA requires that players be at least 22years old during the calendar year of the applicable seasons, have either graduated from a four-year university or have completed their intercollegiate basketball eligibility, or have played at least two seasons for another professional basketball league.|$|E

The regular season ran from 18 September 2010 to 20 February 2011. After two years of leading the league, Halla slipped to fourth place and Oji Eagles took the regular season honors with 76 points. Shunhei Kuji of Oji lead the league with 24 goals, while his teammate Yosuke Kon led with 45 assists. However, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of second-place finishes, Go Tanaka of the Free Blades led the overall points race with 59. The League also maintained the number of play-off teams at four. Anyang faced Oji while Nippon faced Tohoku. Halla managed to take two of three in Japan and defeat Oji on home ice to advance. The Free Blades needed all five games to defeat the Cranes but the team came back with two straight wins to advance to the final {{for the first time in}} their short time in the league. However, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake near the Free Blades hometown forced the League to cancel the finals. Halla had already in Japan just an hour before the disaster struck the area. Fortunately, both teams survived, but the League felt the final could not go on. On 22 March 2011 the League declared that both Halla and the Free Blades would be declared co-champions. Though shortened, Masato Domeki of Oji led the playoffs with four goals, Bruce Mulherin led with six assists and fellow Free Blade Brad Farynuk had eights points overall.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of extra time began with yet another chance for Manchester United, this time {{constructed}} from a Giggs break down the left wing, but Van Nistelrooy failed {{in his attempt to}} back-heel Giggs' cross into the goal and the opportunity was wasted. Five minutes into the second half, Reyes committed another late tackle on Silvestre, for which he received a final warning from referee Styles. Reyes himself was then the victim of a late tackle by Scholes, who was shown a yellow card. The match threatened to descend into a mass brawl soon after, when Fortune caught Ljungberg in the face with a flailing arm and then committed a high tackle on Edu, provoking a reaction from the Arsenal players. A shoulder-charge by Rooney on Cole resulted in an Arsenal free kick on the left wing; Van Persie swung the ball over and it was only cleared as far as Ljungberg, but the Swede struck a shot with his shin and the ball spun wide. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of minutes left in the extra period, Manchester United won a free kick on the left corner of the Arsenal penalty area when Vieira lazily tripped Ronaldo and received a booking, but Giggs' cross from the free kick was headed away.

5|$|Staley met guitarist Jerry Cantrell at a {{party in}} Seattle around August 1987. A few months before that, Cantrell had watched a concert of Staley's then-band, Alice N' Chains, in his {{hometown}} at the Tacoma Little Theatre and was impressed by his voice. Cantrell was homeless after being kicked out of his family's house, so Staley invited Cantrell to live with him at the rehearsal studio Music Bank, and the two struggling musicians became roommates. Alice N' Chains soon disbanded, and Staley joined a funk band. Cantrell's band, Diamond Lie, broke up and he wanted to form a new band, so Staley gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, the girlfriend of drummer Sean Kinney, so that Cantrell could talk to him. Cantrell called the number and set up a meeting with Kinney. Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank and listened to Cantrell's demos, who mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them, and he had someone in mind: Mike Starr, with whom Cantrell had played in a band in Burien called Gypsy Rose. Kinney then mentioned that his girlfriend was actually Mike Starr's sister, and that he had been playing in bands together with Starr since they were kids. Kinney called Starr and a few days later he started jamming with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank, but they didn't have a singer. Staley's funk band also required a guitarist at the time, and Staley asked Cantrell to join as a sideman. Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join his band, because Cantrell, Starr and Kinney wanted Staley to be their lead singer, so they started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint. The last straw for Staley was when they auditioned a male stripper – he decided to join the band after that. Eventually the funk project broke up, and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis. Two weeks after the band's formation, they were playing a gig at the University of Washington, trying to fill out a 40-minute set <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of original material along with Hanoi Rocks and David Bowie covers.|$|E
