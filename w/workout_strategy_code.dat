40|$|Abstract- We {{investigate}} cooperative wireless relay {{networks in}} which the nodes can help each other in data transmission. We study different <b>coding</b> <b>strategies</b> in the single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the myriad {{of ways in which}} nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing problem, i. e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the decodeand-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative <b>coding</b> <b>strategy,</b> achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by the usual multi-hop <b>coding</b> <b>strategy,</b> which is a point-to-point non-cooperative <b>coding</b> <b>strategy.</b> We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms of rate maximizing) for the decode-andforward strategy. Since the algorithm runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these <b>coding</b> <b>strategies</b> using practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of the strategies on different routes. I...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a novel inter-session network <b>coding</b> <b>strategy</b> for a general connection problem. Our <b>coding</b> <b>strategy</b> allows fairly general random linear coding over a large finite field, in which decoding is done at receivers and the mixture of information at interior nodes is controlled by evolutionary mechanisms.

40|$|The primate {{prefrontal cortex}} (PF) plays {{a central role}} in {{choosing}} goals and strategies. To better understand its mechanisms, we recorded from PF neurons as monkeys used abstract response strategies to select a spatial goal. A visual cue, selected randomly from a set of three cues, appeared on each trial. All three cues were novel when neuronal recording commenced. From trial to trial, the cue could have either been repeated or changed from the previous trial; these were called repeat trials and change trials, respectively. On repeat trials, the monkeys used a Repeat-stay strategy to gain a reward by choosing the same spatial goal as on the previous trial; on change trials, they used a Change-shift strategy to reject the previous goal in favour of an alternative. We reported previously that when monkeys performed the task correctly, many PF neurons had activity encoding one of these two strategies. The monkeys sometimes chose the incorrect <b>strategy,</b> however. <b>Strategy</b> <b>coding</b> was weak or absent during the cue period of error trials which was, for correct trials, the time when the monkeys used a strategy to choose a future goal. By contrast, later in the trial, after the chosen goal had been attained and the monkeys awaited feedback, <b>strategy</b> <b>coding</b> was present and it reflected the strategy used, whether correct or incorrect. The weak cue-period strategy signal could, whatever its cause, have contributed to the errors made, whereas the activity prior to feedback suggests a role in monitoring task performance. © The Authors(2008) ...|$|R
