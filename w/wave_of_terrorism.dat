The story unfolds in two years, 1978 and 1979, during a critical period for Italy, marked by a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>terrorism.</b> In 2000 the director Antonello Grimaldi has made the film Un delitto impossibile from this novel, which is also considered (with the coeval L'oro di Fraus by Giulio Angioni), the origin of a genre of Sardinian detective stories (giallo sardo).|$|E

40|$|Dissertation Abstract Ewan Gordon 20163085 The recent <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> Islamist-inspired <b>terrorism</b> {{throughout}} Britain, Europe, and the Western world, {{as well as}} {{the rise}} of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has meant that the British Government has needed to respond to this security threat. One aspect of formulating a successful and effective security strategy is the political discourse which takes place amongst members of the elected Government when formulating the strategy to combat jihadist violence. This political discourse seeks to explain the current security context and to justify future security decisions. Thus, by understanding the foundational theoretical, philosophical, and political ideologies which underlie and influence this political discourse, future policy decisions can be better implemented. This dissertation examines the political discourse of British Members of Parliament in the House of Commons relating to the securitization of British Muslims and Islam between 2014 - 2017 in the context of both the recent <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> Islamist-inspired <b>terrorism</b> within Europe {{and the rise of the}} Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

5000|$|Eileen MacDonald is a British {{journalist}} who {{was intrigued by}} {{the question of whether}} women terrorists are more ruthless than their male counterparts. According to MacDonald, members of a German counterterrorism unit were told to shoot female terrorists first. A senior government security official explains, [...] "Women terrorists have much stronger characters, more power, and more energy than men. There are several examples where men who have been cornered have waited a moment before they fired, but the women shot at once." [...] MacDonald interviewed a total of twenty women terrorists from predominantly leftist terrorist groups, including members of Germany's Red Army Faction, Irish Republican Army, Italy's Red Brigades, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). All of these terrorist groups can be categorized under the third or [...] "New Left" [...] <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>terrorism.</b> This wave was stimulated by the Vietnam War, and many of these third wave groups saw themselves as vanguards for the Third World masses. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) replaced the Viet Cong as the heroic model. Groups purposefully went after targets with international significance, thrusting local conflicts on to the global stage.|$|E

After a devastating attack on Sarif's headquarters which leaves him near-death, Adam is forced to undergo radical augmentation surgery, and he becomes embroiled both in the search for the attackers and the political and ethical repercussions of augmentation technology. The Fall is a parallel story, set after the spin-off novel Icarus Effect.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophySecurity StudiesDale R. HerspringSince {{the late}} 1970 s Saudi Arabia has {{experienced}} transnational terrorism in sporadic waves whose character {{has evolved over}} time. While most {{of the literature on}} these <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>terrorism</b> focuses on religious extremism this dissertation argues that terrorism in Saudi Arabia, although framed in religious terms, is not the result of religious factors alone, but more importantly a function of external variables. Taking the role of religious extremism into consideration, this dissertation underlines the importance of external factors on the mobilization of transnational terrorist groups throughout the Islamic world and particularly in Saudi Arabia. It argues that religious extremist terrorism cannot be examined in isolation from the context of the developments that ignite it and revolutionize its doctrine. This dissertation examines three key regional political developments – the Iranian revolution, the 1990 Gulf war, and the 2003 Iraq war – together with terrorist violence in their aftermath to show how the significant political events transformed extremist worldviews from passive to violent to organized terrorism. Though the character of these three political events and the terrorist acts that they unleashed differ widely in context, scope, and character, there are common threads among all three that illuminate how different dynamics contribute to the evolution of transnational terrorist mobilization. The dissertation identifies how the development of a politico-religious ideology, shaped and revolutionized by the presence of political crises, became a driving force behind much <b>of</b> the <b>terrorism</b> following these major political events. By exploring the interplay of popular perceptions, political entrepreneurs, and state responses, this dissertation seeks to better understand the complex dynamics involved in the evolution <b>of</b> transnational <b>terrorism</b> in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
