50|$|The Met Office, the NWS's {{counterpart}} in the United Kingdom, does not issue separate weather <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> watches, but has an analogous system of flash <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> advance <b>warnings</b> that serve {{the same general}} role of weather <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> weather watches, respectively. Other official meteorological departments may use similar systems but use different terms.|$|R
40|$|Travel <b>Warnings</b> <b>and</b> Travel Alerts are {{documents}} {{issued by}} the United States Department of State to inform U. S. citizens traveling to other countries about the safety conditions of the desired destination. Travel Warnings are created for protracted conditions while Travel Alerts are meant for temporary circumstances. Scant research exists about official State Department travel advice, {{and there is an}} absence of knowledge about its components. This qualitative study seeks to answer the questions, {{what is the nature of}} State Department Travel <b>Warnings</b> <b>and</b> Alerts and what is their function? This study explores and seeks to describe the nature of Travel <b>Warnings</b> <b>and</b> Alerts and analyzes their function. The qualitative research design employs content analysis of archived Travel <b>Warnings</b> <b>and</b> Alerts and is anchored in Social Construction Theory, which provides a framework for understanding the social construction of target populations. This study then asks, is there a relationship between how a foreign country is socially constructed from the perspective of the United States and the issuance of State Department Travel <b>Warnings</b> <b>and</b> Alerts? Social Construction Theory is extended here to countries of the world and shows that there is indeed a relationship between the issuance of Travel <b>Warnings</b> <b>and</b> Alerts and the foreign countries for which they are issued based on their social construction...|$|R

5|$|On September29, {{shortly after}} Keith formed, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for the Yucatán peninsula from Chetumal to Cabo Catoche in Quintana Roo. The next day as Keith was nearing hurricane intensity, the watch was upgraded to a <b>warning,</b> <b>and</b> {{a tropical storm}} <b>warning</b> <b>and</b> hurricane watch was issued for the Belize coastline from Belize City to the Mexican border. At that time, the trajectory was expected to go more to the northwest, and when the storm turned to a slow westward drift, hurricane warnings were issued for the Belize coast with only about 24hours of lead time for the offshore islands. The warnings for the Yucatán peninsula were dropped as Keith weakened.|$|E

Crews from NJG 2 and NJG 4 were able to deliver beam and Schräge Musik attacks against the unwary crews. Pilots that were alerted in time were able to carry out a corkscrew manoeuvre, and evade the attack. Some bombers were able to land but were then subjected to strafing attacks and destroyed though the crews were presented with a greater chance to escape.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued at 0900UTC for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti from Port-au-Prince to the Dominican border. This advisory was upgraded {{the next morning}} to a {{tropical storm}} <b>warning</b> <b>and</b> a hurricane watch, and that night was further upgraded to a hurricane warning. The Haitian coastal authority advised all small craft to stay in port, while at Port-au-Prince, all flights to southern Haiti from Toussaint Louverture International Airport were canceled. More than 1,000people were evacuated from low-lying areas and workers from World Vision again pre-positioned relief supplies.|$|E
5|$|About {{nine hours}} after Ernesto became a {{tropical}} storm, {{the government of}} Haiti issued a tropical storm watch from its border with the Dominican Republic to the southwestern tip of the country. As the storm strengthened, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm <b>warning,</b> <b>and</b> about 15hours prior to its closest approach the warning was replaced with a hurricane warning. Several low-lying citizens in Gonaïves were evacuated after local meteorologists anticipated up to 20inches (500mm) of rain in some mountainous areas. Additionally, authorities advised residents in shanty towns near the ocean to evacuate to emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|About {{nine hours}} after the system {{developed}} on August24, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a tropical storm watch from the Seven Mile Bridge to Vero Beach. Later that day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm <b>warning</b> <b>and</b> hurricane watch from Florida City to Vero Beach after the storm's intensification became apparent. About 25hours before Katrina made landfall, the tropical storm watch was extended northward to Titusville, and a tropical storm <b>warning</b> <b>and</b> a hurricane watch was issued for Lake Okeechobee. Early on August25, a hurricane warning was issued from Florida City to Vero Beach and for Lake Okeechobee. In southeastern Florida, the lead time for the hurricane watch and warning occurred 31.5 and 19.5hours before landfall, respectively; both were 16.5hours less than the desired lead time. A tropical storm warning was also issued from Florida Key, southward through the Florida Keys to the Dry Tortugas, and northward along the western coast to Longboat Key. The warning in the Florida Keys occurred only nine hours {{before the onset of}} tropical storm force winds.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the storm, the Guam National Weather Service {{issued a}} typhoon watch for Agrihan, Pagan, and Alamagan, {{as well as}} a high surf {{advisory}} for Guam. The watch was later upgraded to a <b>warning,</b> <b>and</b> was canceled after the typhoon exited the region. Flights were delayed or canceled to the region due to the storm and problems with the local aircraft communication system. During the storm, there were minor power outages on Saipan in two villages that were quickly restored. On Alamagan where the storm struck, six people rode out the storm in a concrete bunker.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 300 {{people in}} Guam evacuated to emergency shelters {{in advance of}} Typhoon Tingting. Several schools throughout Guam were being used as shelters. A tropical storm <b>warning</b> <b>and</b> a flash flood warning, which were issued several hours before the typhoon warning, were kept in place for Guam until June29. A small craft advisory was also issued for rest of the Mariana Islands. A typhoon warning was declared {{for most of the}} islands on June27. The United States Air Force Base in the Mariana Islands was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness Four, the lowest level of readiness, as Tingting approached.|$|E

By going through private documents in WBN's file room, Roger finds that the victims all previously worked together at a radio station in Peoria, Illinois, which he then correlates into a secretive FCC scandal. King (laughing gas) and General Whalen (falls down an elevator shaft) are the next to die after Roger's warning, causing even more suspicion from the police.|$|E
