5|$|If Stellenbosch marked Smuts's {{intellectual}} awakening, it also <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> came {{to mature}} socially. Here {{he began to}} cast off the shyness and reserve which afflicted him, joining the local militia, becoming {{a regular contributor to}} the college magazine, and becoming leader of the Victoria College debating society. For the first time, in both verbal and literary debate, Smuts began to grapple with the political and social issues facing South Africa.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, Kavanagh College {{expanded}} from its restricted main site by purchasing buildings and a carpark {{on the opposite}} side of Tennyson Street from Otago Polytechnic and thus increasing the area of the college by 25%. Two of the buildings were demolished, their sites becoming a green area used for school recreation. One of the buildings was kept and used for 5 classrooms.

25|$|Elliott {{also set}} an {{unprecedented}} NASCAR record of winning five consecutive pole qualifying sessions in that season; the June Pocono race, the Firecracker 400, the July races in Pocono and Talladega, and the August Michigan race. That {{did not include}} the June Michigan race where qualifying was rained out, and the July Pocono race pole <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> started second, but further investigation led NASCAR to throw out the winning pole time for illegal fuel additives, retroactively awarding Elliott the pole award, money, and credit towards the season-long award for most poles won.|$|E

25|$|During Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, Xigbar shows {{interest}} in Roxas and drops several hints about his true nature.

Xigbar confronts Sora, whose glare reminded him of the look Ventus gave him ages ago, various times during Kingdom Hearts II until he reaches the World That Never <b>Was,</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> confuses him by calling him Roxas and cryptically mentioning his three predecessors. After losing to Sora, Xigbar refuses to answer Sora's question on why he is calling him Roxas.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1836 that non-whites were given their first newspaper, which was called the New Times. Prescod served for eight months without being paid, before the job was taken away from him as {{it was felt that}} his ideas were too radical. Prescod moved on to another paper, The Liberal, which <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> found his voice. This paper was {{targeted}} at working- and middle-class people irrespective of colour. The paper got into financial difficulties and Prescod was able to buy it in partnership with a man called Thomas Harris. Harris allowed him editorial freedom and this led to problems with the establishment, who saw him as challenging the plantocracy.|$|E

O'Neal was looking to expand his business ventures with real-estate development projects aimed at assisting Orlando home owners facing foreclosure. His plans involved buying the mortgages {{of those who had}} fallen into foreclosure and then selling the homes back to them under more affordable terms. He would make a small profit in return, but wanted to make an investment in Orlando and help out homeowners.|$|E
25|$|Returning {{to teach}} high school after his German stint, {{he became a}} {{professor}} at the literature faculty in Iași in 1893, retaining the post until his death. He was initially a substitute professor in the newly created department, rising to full professor in 1896. A Neogrammarian, he taught courses {{on the history of the}} Romanian language, general linguistics, Vulgar Latin, the physiology of the human voice and the origin of the Romanians. The initiator of an original theory of linguistics, this was developed and augmented by his student Gheorghe Ivănescu. His books, studies and articles total some 4000 pages, while his course materials number another 1500. The latter, in which he traced the history of the Romanian language, complemented his published work. It <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> tested new ideas and drafted outlines for the full-length Originea românilor.|$|E
25|$|Conrad Buff III FAIA (August 5, 1926 - 1989) {{was born}} in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, California, to the creators of children's books Mary and Conrad Buff.

Buff III attended local Eagle Rocks school. He graduated from U.S.C. School of Architecture in 1952. For ten years Buff was a faculty member of USC contributing design curriculum.

25|$|In 1805 Munroe married Patty, {{daughter}} of Captain John Stone. Patty’s family was wealthy {{and her father}} had died before they were married. They immediately took up residence {{in a part of}} the brick house that was Patty's mother's. In 1806 their first child was born, William Jr. Two years later they moved to a part of the building where the shop <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was working as a clockcase-maker. Munroe also made some furniture, besides clockcases, which he took to Boston to sell. In 1810 he traded some clocks in Norfolk for some corn and flour. He traded the flour to a Mr. Prescott, a baker in Concord, in a round about way for a shop at the Concord Mill-Dam Company that Mr. Prescott owned. There was a credit crunch in the economy at this time and Mr. Prescott didn't have cash to pay for the flour. In 1811 Munroe moved his family to a small house closer to his shop.|$|E
25|$|The tension {{was high}} {{between the two}} Mercedes {{teammates}} going into the weekend when Hamilton {{was found to have}} altered his car settings during the latter stages of the Spanish Grand Prix, using a higher-powered engine setting than the team had previously allowed in order to stay ahead of teammate Rosberg. Rosberg was then discovered to have done the same while chasing down Hamilton {{at the end of the}} Bahrain Grand Prix, though he failed to get past. Despite losing the Drivers' Championship lead to teammate Hamilton in Spain, Rosberg stated he would not be changing his approach and was not heavily focused on the championship but expected the battle to remain tight. Hamilton reckoned his increased comfort with the F1 W05 Hybrid would put Rosberg under pressure in Monaco, saying it was a track where he performed well but the 2013 race <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was unable to extract the most amount of performance from his car although he hoped to get more out of his Mercedes and wanted to have the Ferrari and Red Bull cars battling him for the victory.|$|E
25|$|Authors {{frequently}} {{draw their}} portraits of characters from people they have known in real life. David Copperfield is regarded {{by many as}} a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in Bleak House reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright. Dickens's father was {{sent to prison for}} debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in Little Dorrit resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution. Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in David Copperfield and Lucie Manette in A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody.|$|E
