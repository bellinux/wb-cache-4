5|$|In the episode, Amy Pond, Rory and River Song are {{summoned to}} Utah, United States, by the Eleventh Doctor, who is {{killed by a}} mysterious figure in a space suit. The dead Doctor is {{revealed}} to be an older self, after his younger version returns. They try {{to understand what the}} future Doctor said and are sent to Washington D.C. The team deals with the Silence, a race of aliens with the ability to make people forget their encounter <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> look away.|$|E
5|$|The local Cathars held {{a special}} place in their {{religion}} for horses, especially through their belief in the transmigration of souls. There was also a belief in Pamiers that knights took their horses <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> died. In the 12th century, the Cathar princess Esclarmonde of Foix climbed to the fortress of Château de Montségur {{on the back of a}} small, sure-footed black horse. In the 14th century, the same small black horses are mentioned as accompanying the armies of Gaston III, Count of Foix.|$|E
5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's base {{on the side of}} Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pokémon Groudon is found here, rather than in the Cave of Origin. Even though the locations of the legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes the mistake of taking the blue orb to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes the mistake of taking the red orb to Kyogre. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> get to the Battle Frontier.|$|E

It's natural he should be disappointed at not having any children: every man likes to have somebody to work for and lay by for, and he always counted so on making a fuss <b>with</b> <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were little. There's many another man 'ud hanker more than he does. He's the best of husbands." ...|$|R

5|$|Julius Caesar {{mentions}} {{small black}} horses that resemble the Mérens in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic War), when discussing {{the defeat of}} Crassus by the Sotiates and their cavalry. Historian Paul Prunet {{was the first to}} link the animals discussed by Caesar to the Mérens, although the relationship has not been definitely established. The location of the Sotiates is the subject of controversy, with some authors placing them in the district of Nerac and others near Foix. The Mérens may have been used as a pack animal by the Romans, who may have taken some of the animals <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> left. The small black horse from the Pyrenees is described throughout antiquity.|$|E
5|$|The English Great Horse was valued {{during the}} reign of Henry VIII, when stallions {{measuring}} less than 'fifteen handfuls' could not be kept, but the increasing role of gunpowder brought an end to the use of heavy horses in battle. Oliver Cromwell's cavalry favoured lighter, faster mounts and the big horses began to be used for draught work instead. During the 16th century, Dutch engineers brought Friesian horses <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> came to England to drain the fens, and these horses probably had a significant influence on what became the Shire breed.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans prized saffron as a perfume or {{deodoriser}} {{and scattered}} it about their public spaces: royal halls, courts, and amphitheatres alike. When Nero entered Rome they spread saffron along the streets; wealthy Romans partook of daily saffron baths. They {{used it as}} mascara, stirred saffron threads into their wines, cast it aloft in their halls and streets as a potpourri, and offered it to their deities. Roman colonists took saffron <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> settled in southern Roman Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until the AD 271 barbarian invasion of Italy. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century Moors or with the Avignon Papacy in the 14th century.|$|E

5|$|Diving beetles, {{such as the}} Dytiscidae, carry {{a bubble}} of air <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> dive. Such a bubble may be {{contained}} under the elytra or against the body by specialized hydrophobic hairs. The bubble covers {{at least some of}} the spiracles, permitting air to enter the tracheae. The function of the bubble is not only to contain a store of air, but to act as a physical gill. The air that it traps is in contact with oxygenated water, so as the animal's consumption depletes the oxygen in the bubble, more oxygen can diffuse in to replenish it. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than either oxygen or nitrogen, so it readily diffuses out faster than in. Nitrogen is the most plentiful gas in the bubble, and the least soluble, so it constitutes a relatively static component of the bubble and acts as a stable medium for respiratory gases to accumulate in and pass through. Occasional visits to the surface are sufficient for the beetle to re-establish the constitution of the bubble.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 13th century Henry III began to {{redesign}} his favourite castles, including Winchester and Windsor, building larger halls, grander chapels, installing glass windows and decorating the palaces with painted walls and furniture. This marked the beginning of a trend towards the development of grand castles designed for elaborate, elite living. Life in earlier keeps had been focused around a single great hall, with privacy for the owner's family provided by using an upper floor for their own living accommodation. By the 14th century nobles were travelling less, bringing much larger households <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> did travel and entertaining visitors with equally large retinues. Castles such as Goodrich were redesigned in the 1320s to provide greater residential privacy and comfort for the ruling family, while retaining strong defensive features and a capacity to hold over 130 residents at the castle. The design influenced subsequent conversions at Berkeley and by the time that Bolton Castle was being built, in the 1380s, it was designed to hold up to eight different noble households, each with their own facilities. Royal castles such as Beaumaris, although designed with defence in mind, were designed to hold up to eleven different households at any one time.|$|E

In the lines of graft we've worked we took money from the people the Lord made to be buncoed--sports and rounders and smart Alecks and street crowds, that always have a few dollars to throw away, and farmers that wouldn't ever be happy if the grafters didn't come around and play <b>with</b> <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> sold their crops.

50|$|The Peppermint Rainbow was an American {{sunshine}} pop {{group from}} Baltimore, Maryland.

25|$|During that January though, {{the food}} {{ran out and}} none {{was left in the}} {{district}} — already affected by famine, the population took what little there was <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> fled. The rainy season brought malaria and dysentery, all four surviving officers fell sick, and floods cut Bunkeya off from the game-rich plains to the north where they might have hunted. Moloney recovered first and took charge of the expedition's task of building a more permanent fort and trying to find food. 76 of the expedition's askaris and porters died that month of dysentery and starvation. Stairs had severe fevers, and in his delirium he imagined Thomson had arrived, and yelled for his revolver with which to repel the BSAC man; Moloney had wisely taken it from him.|$|E
25|$|I am {{unable to}} state with {{certainty}} what language the Pelasgians spoke, but we could consider the speech of the Pelasgians who still exist in settlements above Tyrrhenia {{in the city of}} Kreston, formerly neighbors to the Dorians who at that time lived in the land now called Thessaliotis; also the Pelasgians who once lived with the Athenians and then settled Plakia and Skylake in the Hellespont; and along with those who lived with all the other communities and were once Pelasgian but changed their names. If one can judge by this evidence, the Pelasgians spoke a barbarian language. And so, if the Pelasgian language was spoken in all these places, the people of Attica being originally Pelasgian, must have learned a new language when they became Hellenes. As a matter of fact, the people of Krestonia and Plakia no longer speak the same language, which shows that they continue to use the dialect they brought <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> migrated to those lands.|$|E
25|$|According to Fage (2013), the Tutsi are serologically {{related to}} Bantu and Nilotic populations. This in turn rules out a {{possible}} Cushitic origin for the founding Tutsi-Hima ruling {{class in the}} lacustrine kingdoms. However, the royal burial customs of the latter kingdoms are quite similar to those practiced by the former Cushitic Sidama states in the southern Gibe region of Ethiopia. By contrast, Bantu populations {{to the north of}} the Tutsi-Hima in Kenya were until modern times essentially without a king, while there were a number of Bantu kingdoms to the south of the Tutsi-Hima in Tanzania, all of which shared the Tutsi-Hima's chieftaincy pattern. Since the Cushitic Sidama kingdoms interacted with Nilotic groups, Fage thus proposes that the Tutsi may have descended from one such migrating Nilotic population. The Tutsis' Nilotic ancestors would thereby in earlier times have served as cultural intermediaries, adopting some monarchical traditions from adjacent Cushitic kingdoms and subsequently taking those borrowed customs south <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> first settled amongst Bantu autochthones in the Great Lakes area.|$|E
