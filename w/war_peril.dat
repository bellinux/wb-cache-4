40|$|After a brief {{survey of}} war {{circumstances}} in Croatian medieval lands following Bosnia’s surrender to Ottoman rule in 1463, basic sociological typology of displaced persons and findings revealed by historical scholarship regarding the Croatian Diaspora {{resulting from the}} Ottoman war threat, the author highlights {{the fact that the}} basic classification of the migrant population into different types of displacees was made according to the levels of <b>war</b> <b>peril</b> to which they had been exposed in their domicile areas. He states that the endangered, not excluding the already occupied area, may be divided into three levels of <b>war</b> <b>peril,</b> which in different ways influenced the behaviour of the threatened population and their decision to abandon domicile territory during the extended period of Ottoman pressure on medieval Croatian lands. The exact moment of departure often depended on the interest and will of each individual to defend spiritual values, social positions, and inherited wealth. The author emphasises that it was this ever-present threat upon the indigenous population which contributed {{to the creation of a}} very refined glossary of different terms for displacees in the Croatian language. By the end of the 16 th century, this glossary differentiates between four basic groups of displaced persons: fugitives, refugees, exiles, and renegades. Moreover, the author points to the fact that the thesaurus of terms for displacees in the languages of those nations giving shelter to the displacees, was developed exactly from such origin and was, as a rule, very simple in comparison to the mere descriptive vocabulary used by the displacees themselves. Similar to the 16 th century German thesaurus, which used only two different terms (Fluchtig for a refugee and Vertrieben for a displaced person), a modern terminology of international institutions taking care of people displaced by force is limited to only two terms (refugees and displacees) ...|$|E
50|$|Open perils {{cover all}} the causes of loss not {{specifically}} excluded in the policy. Common exclusions on open peril policies include damage resulting from earthquakes, floods, nuclear incidents, acts of terrorism, and <b>war.</b> Named <b>perils</b> require the actual cause of loss to be listed in the policy for insurance to be provided. The more common named perils include such damage-causing events as fire, lightning, explosion, and theft.|$|R
60|$|This was Robert, {{third of}} that name, {{and the second}} of the ill fated family of Stuart who filled the throne of Scotland. He had many virtues, and was not without talent; but it was his great misfortune that, like others of his devoted line, his merits were not of a kind suited to the part which he was called upon to perform in life. The king of so fierce a people as the Scots then were ought to have been warlike, prompt, and active, liberal in {{rewarding}} services, strict in punishing crimes, one whose conduct should make him feared as well as beloved. The qualities of Robert the Third were the reverse of all these. In youth he had indeed seen battles; but, without incurring disgrace, he had never manifested the chivalrous love of <b>war</b> and <b>peril,</b> or the eager desire to distinguish himself by dangerous achievements, which that age expected from all who were of noble birth and had claims to authority.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to compare the rules on causation and incidence of loss from a hull insurance perspective in the Nordic countries. As a consequence of there being underlying differences in how these questions are resolved, it therefore results in an interesting comparison. In addition, {{in light of the}} proposal of a common Marine Insurance Plan for the entire Nordic market a comparison is relevant for the same reasons. In the Norwegian Marine Insurance Plan the scope of the insurers liability when covered and uncovered perils have contributed to a loss is based on an apportionment principle, cf. § NMIP 2 - 13. This solution is unique in relation to the corresponding rules in the Nordic Countries, which operate with the dominant cause principle. However, the NMIP was used as a prototype to the revision of the Finnish Marine Hull Conditions (FHC) in the year of 2001. As a result, today the FHC has a corresponding rule of apportionment. Nevertheless, an exception is made to the apportionment principle when the loss is attributed to a combination of marine and <b>war</b> <b>perils.</b> In this case the starting point is the dominant cause principle as well. Another question related to causation arises in cases where a loss is caused by a peril that {{can be traced back to}} a previous insurance period. According to the NMIP § 2 - 11 first subparagraph the liability of the insurer is triggered when the interest insured is struck by an insured peril during the insurance period. The starting point is thus a peril has struck principle which is a different point of departure to the damage principle which the remaining Nordic countries operate with. The approach to the question of causation and incidences of loss differ within the Nordic countries. These differences may provide implications both in changing between the insurance conditions and with an implementation of a common Nordic Marine Insurance Plan. The question to be answered is what the differences really are, their impact and which solution would be best suited for the whole common Nordic marine insurance market. Although an all comprehensive comparison between the Nordic rules of marine insurance would be both interesting and relevant at time, the aim of this work will be limited to compare and analyse the selected sections from a hull insurance perspective. Focus is foremost put on a comparison between the relevant Swedish and Norwegian rules...|$|R
40|$|Maritime {{transportation}} {{is the oldest}} of the transportation forms of moving larger quantities of cargo with long tradition and culture. As ancient as the transport at sea, so is also the history of pirates. Some say that they should be regarded as a “necessary evil”, {{the other side of the}} shield that creates a balance in the world, others merely accept the presence. In any event it creates the background for fascination and intrigue, even though the brutality in reality is extensive. This elucidates the need for knowledge of which challenges this problem creates, and this thesis will look upon this in relation to marine insurance. Also, the difference between piracy and armed robbery both in international law and Norwegian marine insurance has been looked into. After researching the subject, the difficulties of separating the terms piracy and armed robbery became more pronounced. It was therefore necessary to look further into these in an international and domestic perspective. Particularly it became important to find out more about how it would be treated in Norwegian marine insurance. When establishing the difference in cover between hull and war insurance, the two main insurances a vessel signs, the discussion of piracy and armed robbery is very important. As the war insurer mainly covers piracy, but will not take responsibility in cases of armed robbery, the hull insurer is possibly the one covering the latter. This separation also influences the other insurers, at least the P&I and loss of hire insurer, as neither of these cover <b>war</b> <b>perils</b> as a starting point. In the situations regarded as piracy, the war insurer will have to cover losses from all insurances, while if armed robbery, the cover will be exactly the same as if it had been another crime. The cover from hull, war, P&I, loss of hire and cargo insurance regarding both piracy and armed robbery is included. The last part of the thesis describes a real case from 1999, the situation of Alondra Rainbow. The vessel was hijacked by pirates in the Strait of Malacca while steaming. After a few weeks a vessel matching the description of the vessel, but with another name, was observed in Indian waters and the Indian Coast Guard was alerted. This proved to be the first case ever where UNCLOS’ encouragement to intercept a vessel hijacked by pirates, was used and the pirates was convicted afterwards in a country with no relation to the attacked ship. This particular case is thereafter looked upon from a Norwegian marine insurance view. The final outcome of this thesis is that there would be beneficial for the marine insurance industry to look further into, and perhaps create some guidelines as to how to handle cases in the grey zone between piracy and armed robbery...|$|R

60|$|Both {{men looked}} at me in astonishment, and then I had to explain all over again as I had {{explained}} to the girl. Bradley and Olson were delighted. Immediately I was put in command, {{and the first thing}} I did was to go below with Olson and inspect the craft thoroughly for hidden boches and damaged machinery. There were no Germans below, and everything was intact and in ship-shape working order. I then ordered all hands below except one man who was to act as lookout. Questioning the Germans, I found that all except the commander were willing to resume their posts and aid in bringing the vessel into an English port. I believe that they were relieved at the prospect of being detained at a comfortable English prison-camp {{for the duration of the}} <b>war</b> after the <b>perils</b> and privations through which they had passed. The officer, however, assured me that he would never be a party to the capture of his vessel.|$|R
6000|$|In the meanwhile, {{events were}} {{pressing}} towards a still more trenchant opposition. On the 20th, the three consuls met and parted without agreement, Knappe {{announcing that he}} had lost men and must take the matter in his own hands to avenge their death. On the 21st the Olga came before Matafangatele, ordered the delivery of all arms within the hour, {{and at the end of}} that period, none being brought, shelled and burned the village. The shells fell for the most part innocuous; an eyewitness saw children at play beside the flaming houses; not a soul was injured; and the one noteworthy event was the mutilation of Captain Hamilton's American flag. In one sense an incident too small to be chronicled, in another this was of historic interest and import. These rags of tattered bunting occasioned the display of a new sentiment in the United States; and the republic of the West, hitherto so apathetic and unwieldy, but already stung by German nonchalance, leaped to its feet for the first time at the news of this fresh insult. As though to make the inefficiency of the war-ships more apparent, three shells were thrown inland at Mangiangi; they flew high over the Mataafa camp, where the natives could [...] "hear them singing" [...] as they flew, and fell behind in the deep romantic valley of the Vaisingano. Mataafa had been already summoned on board the Adler; his life promised if he came, declared [...] "in danger" [...] if he came not; and he had declined in silence the unattractive invitation. These fresh hostile acts showed him that the worst had come. He was in strength, his force posted along the whole front of the mountain behind Apia, Matautu occupied, the Siumu road lined up to the houses of the town with warriors passionate for war. The occasion was unique, and there is no doubt that he designed to seize it. The same day of this bombardment, he sent word bidding all English and Americans wear a black band upon their arm, so that his men should recognise and spare them. The hint was taken, and the band worn for a continuance of days. To have refused would have been insane; but to consent was unhappily to feed the resentment of the Germans by a fresh sign of intelligence with their enemies, and to widen the breach between the races by a fresh and a scarce pardonable mark of their division. The same day again the Germans repeated one of their earlier offences by firing on a boat within the harbour. Times were changed; they were now at <b>war</b> and in <b>peril,</b> the rigour of military advantage might well be seized by them and pardoned by others; but it so chanced that the bullets flew about the ears of Captain Hand, and that commander is said to have been insatiable of apologies. The affair, besides, had a deplorable effect on the inhabitants. A black band (they saw) might protect them from the Mataafas, not from undiscriminating shots. Panic ensued. The war-ships were open to receive the fugitives, and the gentlemen who had made merry over Fangalii were seen to thrust each other from the wharves in their eagerness to flee Apia. I willingly drop the curtain on the shameful picture.|$|R
