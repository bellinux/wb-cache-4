40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{identify}} factors at the commencement of university study that may enable prediction of both estimate of gains and experience of stresses. This was done {{in order to provide}} information that may enable early identification of risk factors in respect to student attrition. To this end, the thesis examined individual differences amongst students that relate to perception of both estimated gains and stress early in the university experience. Initially, the individual differences studied were those relating to student demographics of age, gender, whether the student performed additional part-time work and the number of hours of work performed and the influence of finances. This first round of testing was performed by distributing questionnaires examining the aforementioned via student <b>welcome</b> <b>packs</b> at commencement of university study. The results of this first round of testing suggested particular importance of intrinsic values on estimated gains. In addition to some influence of finances, gender and hours of work. From open questions present in this first round of testing, focus group questions were formulated in order to further develop the questionnaire. From the findings of study two, this was then expanded to include the influence of perceived demands, control and support and locus of control on estimated gains and subjective perceived stress. This was again performed by distributing a questionnaire at inception, albeit personally to help response rate and answer any queries. This third round of testing, as implied by the focus group responses, found an additional influence of locus of control and the perception of demands, control and support on estimated gains and stress. Finally, the fourth round of testing included biological indicators of stress, namely salivary cortisol levels through the use of analysis of levels of salivary cortisol, collected using a salivette. This final study suggested a difference in the effects of perceived demands, control and support on both perceived and biological responses to stress The study in all found that there is a definite prediction of estimate of gains from the university environment by the work values studied. Although it was found that gains were primarily influenced by intrinsic values (achievement, advancement, autonomy, personal development), an influence of extrinsic values (economics, prestige, social interaction) was also evident. In addition to work values, demographics of gender, age and hours of work were also found to influence differences in estimated gains and stress. None of the values studied were found to predict perceived stress, however the distinction between perceived and objective biological measures of stress was highlighted. In particular, with regard to the perception of demands, control and support from the university environment. The results of the study also suggested that the extent to which students perceive demands, control and support from the university environment may also {{have an impact on the}} student experience of stress, particularly biological stress, which can result in potential harm to physical well-being...|$|R
500|$|Dehaka is {{a primal}} zerg pack leader from Zerus who is fixated on {{adaptation}} and collecting raw genetic material, which {{he refers to}} as [...] "essence"; for Dehaka, [...] "essence" [...] is survival against extinction. Dehaka lost his large right arm prior to the Swarm's return to Zerus; it was later {{to be found in the}} same area where Sarah Kerrigan defeated the other primal pack leaders. When the Zerg Swarm returned to Zerus, Dehaka initially opted to simply observe the Swarm and Kerrigan. He witnessed the newcomers awaken Zurvan and the primal-infestation of Kerrigan. Dehaka perceived Kerrigan as the strongest of the zerg pack leaders. He and his <b>pack</b> <b>welcomed</b> the new power by allying with the Swarm, believing Kerrigan would lead them to new [...] "essence". Dehaka correctly predicted that the other zerg pack leaders would refuse to submit and [...] "adapt"; the other pack leaders were destroyed by Kerrigan, including Zurvan. Kerrigan confronted Dehaka afterwards, confirming that Dehaka had known that Zurvan would turn on her. Dehaka did not deny this, responding with [...] "one zerg would grow strong, the other would fall". Dehaka remained with the Zerg Swarm.|$|R
500|$|MadWorld was {{the first}} game to be released. Produced by Inaba, the game was {{designed}} {{to appeal to a}} western audience and had a unique art style inspired by that of Sin City. The original story was written by Yasumi Matsuno, who had previously worked on Square Enix's Ogre Battle and Final Fantasy Tactics, while PlatinumGames and Sega jointly localized the title for the West. The team created the game with a vision of bringing a unique game to the Wii. One of the game's main themes is violence and brutality which led to controversy as it tarnished the family-friendly image of the Wii console. While the game received positive reviews, it was a commercial failure, selling poorly in both Japan and the West, despite Sega's heavy marketing. Though the game was a commercial failure, Sega felt that sales were [...] "encouraging", and said that they would continue to make mature games for the Wii. They released the <b>Welcome</b> To Violence <b>pack,</b> which bundles MadWorld with , and The Conduit, each of which were commercial failures. In 2010, Sega announced that they would cease publishing mature video games for the Wii, citing the disappointing sales of MadWorld as a contributing factor. However, PlatinumGames announced several days later {{that they would like to}} do a sequel to the game.|$|R

5000|$|The house {{used was}} the one from Big Brother 2008 and was largely unchanged, aside from a few minor modifications. Some of the wall panels near the stairs were {{modified}} to include stars in them {{to go with the}} format of the series. As the housemates entered the house there was a <b>welcome</b> <b>pack</b> available for housemates to read. The floor pattern in the basic bedroom were changed from the red segment of the BB9 eye, to a sequence of stars, and the beds were larger and more comfortable than in BB9. There was also a sign saying [...] "You don't have to be mad to live here....but it helps" [...] on one of the walls. The bathroom was completely gold, leaving no blue decor. The showers were closed off to give the celebrities privacy, although there were microphones in the showers. The garden house walls are now mainly blue and the pool has been taken out. The jail is now larger and includes a bench and mirror. A new heated sitting area was put in place and there appeared to be no spa or pool replacement. The smoking area, which contained a wall with dolls' faces with no eyes on, was moved for protection against the elements. The living area remained largely unchanged apart from some added weights and gym equipment. A specially designated entrance for housemate Verne was located {{to the side of the}} main door.

40|$|Background: Promoting {{physical}} activity (PA) via primary care exercise referral schemes (ERS) is common {{but there is}} no rigorous evidence for long term changes in PA (Pavey et al, 2011) among those with chronic conditions. From July 2015, for 15 months, the e-coachER trial began to recruit 1400 patients (in SW England, Birmingham and Glasgow) with one or more chronic conditions including diabetes, obesity, hypertension, osteoarthritis, or depression, who are eligible and about to attend an ERS. The two-arm parallel RCT is powered to determine if the addition of a web-based, interactive, theory-driven and evidence-based support system (hosted on the ‘LifeGuide’ platform) will result in at least 10 % more patients who do 150 mins or more per week of accelerometer assessed moderate or vigorous {{physical activity}} (MVPA) at 12 months. Aims: This presentation will provide details on the intervention development and data to be captured to inform a process evaluation. Methods: An initial version of e-coachER was produced, building on experiences from obesity and diabetes self-management interventions using the Lifeguide platform, and beta tested over 7 months. Co-applicants and researchers then provided feedback on a time-truncated version, and ERS patients on a real-time version, for 5 months before it was locked for the RCT. Within the trial, after participants are screened, provide consent and complete baseline assessments, they are randomised to receive usual ERS at each site or usual ERS plus a mailed <b>Welcome</b> <b>Pack</b> (including a user friendly guide to register for e-coachER access in-line, a free pedometer and a fridge magnet with daily recording strips for step counts or minutes of MVPA). Contact details for an e-coachER facilitator are provided for additional technical support. Results: At the core of the intervention are ‘ 7 Steps to Health’ aimed to last 5 - 10 mins each, to encourage patients to think about the benefits of PA, seek support from an ERS practitioner (and friends/family, and the web), to self-monitor PA with a pedometer and upload steps or minutes of MVPA, set progressive goals, build confidence, autonomy and relatedness (from Self-Determination Theory), find ways to increase sustainable PA more broadly, and deal with setbacks. An avatar (to avoid having to represent a range of individual characteristics such as age, gender, and ethnicity) and brief narratives are used throughout to normalise and support behaviour change and encourage e-coachER use. Automatic or patient chosen e-mails from the Lifeguide system promote on-going use of functions such as recording weekly PA and goal setting. For each site, participants are able to access links to reputable generic websites for further information about chronic conditions and lifestyle, links to other sites and apps for self-monitoring health behaviour and health, as well as modifiable options for local physical activity options. Conclusion: The Lifeguide platform for e-coachER is able to collect data on individual usage, and this will be used, along with semi-structured interviews, to conduct a process evaluation to fully understand if, for whom, and how the intervention facilitated long-term PA changes.

The two-arm parallel RCT is powered to determine if the addition of a web-based, interactive, theory-driven and evidence-based support system called e-coachER (hosted on the ‘LifeGuide’ platform) will result in at least 10 % more patients who do 150 mins or more per week of accelerometer assessed moderate or vigorous {{physical activity}} (MVPA) at 12 months. Recruitment into the trial is within primary care, using both mail-merged patient invitations and opportunistic GP invitations (and exercise referrals). Within the trial, after participants are screened, provide consent and complete baseline assessments, they are randomised to receive usual ERS at each site or usual ERS plus a mailed <b>Welcome</b> <b>Pack</b> with registration details to access e-coachER on-line. Inclusion criteria for entering the trial are: (1) Aged 16 - 74 years; (2) with {{one or more of the}} following: obesity (BMI 30 - 35), hypertension (SBP 140 - 179 or DBP 90 - 109, type 2 diabetes, lower limb osteoarthritis, recent history of treatment for depression; (3) Participants who are in the two lowest (of four) groups using the GP Physical Activity Questionnaire; (4) have an e-mail address and access to the internet; (5) Eligible for an ERS. The intervention rationale, design and content are reported in another presentation. Aims: This presentation will provide initial findings from a 3 month internal pilot phase with a focus on trial recruitment and initial intervention engagement. We will present data on the achievement of our targets for recruiting 180 participants across the three sites and proportion who initially go online to register and use e-coachER. We also aim, based on detailed process evaluation work, to present a summary of factors influencing recruitment and intervention engagement, and any adaptations needed for the recruitment process. Methods: Data is being captured to inform a CONSORT chart with details on number of patient invitations, number and reasons for trial exclusion, and numbers and characteristics of those recruited. The LifeGuide system will provide data on numbers/proportion assigned to the intervention arm who register and start to use e-coachER. Qualitative data on recruitment processes and intervention engagement, as part of the process evaluation, will be summarised. Results: Due to a number of factors recruitment began 2 - 4 months later than planned across the 3 sites. Data will be presented on achieved recruitment and e-coachER engagement relative to our targets in the internal pilot trial. Qualitative data will be presented on the acceptability and feasibility of the trial methods and intervention. Conclusion: A summary of what we have learned about recruitment and intervention engagement will be presented and ideas for improvement, as appropriate.
