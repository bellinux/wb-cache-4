500|$|The American public, {{the church}} {{organizations}} that have been helping—Protestants, Catholics and Jews will know {{you for what you}} are—an evil beast. So will others who have backed you. You are done. King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>You</b> have just 34 days in which to do (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significant [...] ). You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy fraudulent self is bared to the nation.|$|E
500|$|As {{characters}} {{from the previous}} chapters of the game gather around to congratulate him, Conker realizes {{that he should have}} brought Berri back to life when he was negotiating with programmers. He calls them out to bring her back to life, only to realize that they have left already. Conker then gives a closing monologue, in which he discusses appreciating what one already has instead of always wanting more, stating that [...] "the grass is always greener, and you don't really know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> have until it's gone." [...] The credits roll, and afterwards Conker is seen back at the same pub he was seen in {{at the start of the}} game, drowning his sorrows in Scotch whisky. He drunkenly exits the bar as it begins to storm outside, and leaves in the direction opposite the one he took previously.|$|E
500|$|David Julyan {{composed}} the film's synthesized score. Julyan acknowledges several synthesized soundtracks that inspired him, such as Vangelis's Blade Runner and Hans Zimmer's The Thin Red Line. While composing the score, Julyan created different, distinct sounds {{to differentiate between}} the color and black-and-white scenes: [...] "brooding and classical" [...] themes in the former, and [...] "oppressive and rumbly noise" [...] in the latter. Since he describes the entire score as [...] "Leonard's theme", Julyan says, [...] "The emotion I was aiming at with my music was yearning and loss. But {{a sense of loss}} you feel {{but at the same time}} you don't know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> have lost, a sense of being adrift." [...] Initially, Nolan wanted to use Radiohead's [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] during the end credits, but he was unable to secure the rights. Instead, David Bowie's [...] "Something in the Air" [...] is used, although another of Radiohead's songs, an extended version of [...] "Treefingers", is included on the film's soundtrack.|$|E
5000|$|Decision. Know {{definitely}} <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that <b>you</b> want, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that <b>you</b> {{want to do}} or have, and {{be willing}} to pay in spiritual values.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! I see now <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you</b> gave up your {{precious}} ring for. I perceived {{you had some}} cunning plan to give me pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Horribly!" [...] he answered, {{gazing at}} her in amazement--"horribly! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> dreadful. Are <b>you</b> ill? You have no idea <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>You</b> {{have no idea what}} I suffered." ...|$|R
2500|$|A lot {{of people}} say, [...] "I'm it. I'm the divine incarnation. I'm here and let me hip you." [...] … But Prabhupada was never like that … I always liked his humility and his simplicity: [...] "the servant of the servant of the servant" [...] is really <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> know. None of us are God – [...] just His servants.|$|E
2500|$|Okereke {{released}} his first solo album, titled The Boxer, produced by XXXChange, on 21 June 2010, through Wichita / Polydor in the UK and Europe and Glassnote Records {{for the rest}} of the world. The album was released under the name Kele, dropping his surname. Okereke explained the album title, saying [...] "as a boxer, you have to rely on nobody else but yourself to achieve <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> want to achieve. Even though you take hits, you have to keep focus on your priorities and keep going. I thought that was an inspiring image." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "Tenderoni", was released on 14 June 2010.|$|E
2500|$|In the Washington, D.C., office, Giles and O'Keefe {{ask about}} how to account for Giles' {{anticipated}} prostitution income on tax forms. Giles asks, [...] "is there a way I can make up two years of tax returns?" [...] The ACORN employee replies, [...] "no you can't make it up", but tells Giles that she could form a business and state that she provides a service. The employee says, [...] "you can have a business. She's {{not going to put}} down that she's doing prostitution", and [...] "you don't have to sit back and tell people <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> do." [...] Giles later tells an ACORN employee that she will be giving the money earned from prostitution to O'Keefe. The employee says, [...] "when the police ask you – you don't know where it's coming from." ...|$|E
60|$|WIRTHIN. Indeed I do mean it. I tell you, Mr. Stephenson, {{that plan}} {{was just an}} inspiration--that's <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>You</b> could teach a cat German by it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Couldn't I eat {{something}} besides people?" [...] she asked. [...] "Couldn't I eat just one house, or a side-walk or something? I wouldn't mind much <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>you</b> know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Haha!' he cried, {{lifting his}} eyebrows, folding his arms, and {{leaning back in}} his chair. 'Assuredly, Madame Flintwinch is an oracle! How shall we {{interpret}} the oracle, you and I and the old intriguer? He said that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not--? And <b>you</b> burst out and stopped him! <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not? Say then, madame!' ...|$|R
2500|$|The Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Sazonov sent {{a message}} to all of the great powers asking them to {{pressure}} Austria to extend the deadline of the ultimatum. Sazonov asked the Austrian government to back its claims of Serbian complicity in the killing of Franz Ferdinand by releasing the results of its official inquiry, which the Austrians refused to do as they lacked any conclusive as opposed to circumstantial evidence. Several times, the Austrians refused Russian requests to extend the deadline, despite warnings that an Austro-Serbian war could easily cause a world war. Sazonov told the Austrian ambassador [...] "I know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>You</b> mean to make war on Serbia...? You are setting fire to Europe... Why was Serbia given no chance to speak and why the form of an ultimatum? The fact is you mean war and you have burnt your bridges... One sees how peace-loving you are." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Good woman," [...] {{said the}} {{magistrate}} to this shrewish supplicant--"tell us <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> want, {{and do not}} interrupt the court." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] sneered Reddy Fox, who {{had been}} listening. [...] "You're a coward. I wouldn't have run! I would have waited and found out <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>You</b> and Peter Rabbit would run away from your own shadows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps you don't? No, Liz, I {{should think}} not. If <b>you</b> knew <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>you</b> {{would give me}} a very {{different}} answer. There; let go; be sensible. I wonder you don't remember that Mr Headstone is looking on.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] {{she went}} on confidentially, [...] "something has come into my mind lately. I spoke about it yesterday, but I did not tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>You</b> need never <b>be</b> afraid of me any more. I understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aren't I {{always at}} your service?" [...] protested Mr. Brumley with a {{responsive}} playfulness. [...] "And I don't even know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something is {{the matter}} with you this evening, Zoe," [...] he said anxiously. [...] "Tell me <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>You</b> don't like this place, perhaps?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jupiter, I {{should like}} to {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> are talking about. You say your master is sick. Hasn't he told you what ails him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, tell {{us about}} your old lady, and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you</b> said to her," [...] spoke impatiently the Girton Girl, who is always eager when the subject under {{discussion}} happens to be the imbecility or criminal tendency of the opposite sex.|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>is</b> that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> saying, Fitzwilliam? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> talking of? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll do <b>it,</b> Sandy. But <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> {{saying about}} unsacrilegious things, which people expect to get, {{and will be}} {{disappointed}} about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't remember--anything here--without any books," [...] he muttered. [...] "Tell me <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> want, Phipps? I {{am ready}} to do any thing--you know that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you {{members of}} the Minute-Boy company intent on blundering into the very midst of our Lord Cornwallis's army without knowing <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> count on doing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Back to me,--to my house,--to your {{duties as}} a wife! Why cannot you say at once <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> want? You {{wish to be}} {{separated}} from me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> mean, Dr Crofts? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> saying? Why do {{you talk}} that nonsense, {{trying to see if}} you can provoke me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! ha! And it {{has come}} to that, has <b>it?</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> said to Dr. O'Shaughnessey when we were off Point de Galle?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't look so ashamed," [...] he said, smiling faintly. [...] "I'm {{not afraid}} of him. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{going to tell me}} about him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! hush!" [...] said Isabelle [...] "for {{your own}} sake--for mine--be silent {{on such a}} theme. Tell me rather <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> have to ask of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't want it dismissed," [...] was the answer. [...] "Your office being <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> {{should be}} prosecuting me {{instead of asking}} me to make up with this--this fellow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{do nothing}} of the kind. Will you please to tell me <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> are afraid of? Do you think that Frank {{is going to make}} love to me again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who <b>are</b> <b>you,</b> pray?" [...] said I, {{with much}} dignity, {{although}} somewhat puzzled; [...] "how {{did you get}} here? and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> talking about?" ...|$|R
