25|$|When one is {{reminded}} of true beauty {{by the sight}} of a beautiful boy, he is called a lover. While all have seen reality, as they must have to be human, not all are so easily reminded of it. Those that can remember are startled <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> reminder, and are overcome with the memory of beauty.|$|E
25|$|Promoting {{intrinsic}} motivation {{and problem solving}} are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake. To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students {{with a choice of}} activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.|$|E
25|$|The plains zebra is {{a highly}} social species, forming harems with a single stallion, several mares and their recent offspring; there are also {{bachelor}} groups. Groups may come together to form herds. The animals keep watch for predators rather than attempting to hide; they bark or snort <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> predator, and the harem stallion attacks predators to defend his harem. The species population is stable and not endangered, though some populations such as in Tanzania have declined sharply.|$|E
50|$|The hunters cannot {{have any}} sort of {{communication}} with the escapees. They can only sprint <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> escapee, and <b>they</b> cannot determine the escapee's location by looking for the cameramen. If the escapees manage to hide or run away from the hunter, the hunter will give up the chase.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyzes}} whether {{experienced and}} new Internet users react differently to online discounts and gifts. The results obtained in a multi-group SEM analysis show that experienced users are more influenced by online sales promotions {{and have a}} greater purchase intention than new users. However, although both groups of Internet users show a predisposition to purchase the promoted service, experts form an opinion about the Web advertisements <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> online discount and they change their attitude toward the brand <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> online gift, while no significant differences are observed in the novice users’ response to promotional incentives. The findings of this research help us understand better the way Internet users process different types of promotional incentives communicated through banners, {{and to what extent}} the experience in the use of Internet affects that process...|$|R
40|$|Nitasha Kaul {{argues that}} {{economic}} violence refers {{not only to}} violence caused for economic reasons, but also to violence caused by spurious economics. It is economic violence when people lose their jobs and livelihoods, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> witness massively divergent rewards for work and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> endless perpetuation of inequality around them. Such involuntary unemployment {{in the long run}} leads to social breakdown and community fragmentation. ...|$|R

The crew of Deep Core leave the platform, {{surprised}} they are not suffering from decompression sickness, when they see Bud walking out of the alien ship, and Lindsey races to hug Bud.|$|E
25|$|In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), males {{sometimes}} {{see their}} nest full of eggs {{fall prey to}} groups of marauding females; some males, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> group of females approaching, swim away from their nest and start poking their snout into the substrate, as would a female raiding a nest. This distraction display commonly fools the females into behaving as if a nest has been discovered there and they rush to that site, leaving the male's real nest alone. Bowfin (Amia calva) males caring for their free-swimming fry exhibit a related distraction display when a potential fry-predator approaches; they move away and thrash about as if injured, drawing the predator's attention toward himself.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} four sections, the moods of the men fluctuate from anger at their desperate situation, to a growing empathy for one another and the sudden realization that nature is indifferent to their fates. The men become fatigued and bicker with one another; nevertheless, the oiler and the correspondent take turns rowing toward shore, while the cook bails water to keep the boat afloat. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> lighthouse on the horizon, their hope is tempered with {{the realization of the}} danger of trying to reach it. Their hopes dwindle further when, after seeing a man waving from shore, and what {{may or may not be}} another boat, they fail to make contact. The correspondent and the oiler continue to take turns rowing, while the others sleep fitfully during the night. The correspondent then notices a shark swimming near the boat, but he does not seem to be bothered by it as one would expect. In the penultimate chapter, the correspondent wearily recalls a verse from the poem [...] "Bingen on the Rhine" [...] by Caroline Norton, in which a [...] "soldier of the Legion" [...] dies far from home..|$|E

2500|$|Modern Catholic {{scholarship}} also {{tends to}} see a theophany presented in the preponderance of the [...] "I am" [...] statements in the Gospels. Raymond Brown, sees a play on words in the story recounted in John 6:20 where the disciples in the boat are terrified <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> man walking towards them on the water, and Jesus reassures them, ‘I AM; do not be afraid.’ Brown sees a twofold meaning: the obvious story line meaning of 'it is I' and a higher sacral meaning inherent in Jesus' walking calmly on the storm-tossed waves and then bringing them safely ashore.|$|E
2500|$|Beauty, he states, {{was among}} the most radiant things to see beyond heaven, and on earth it sparkles through vision, the clearest of our senses. Some have not been {{recently}} initiated, and mistake this reminder for beauty itself and only pursue desires of the flesh. This pursuit of pleasure, then, even when manifested in the love of beautiful bodies, is not [...] "divine" [...] madness, but rather just having lost one's head. The recent initiates, on the other hand, are overcome <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> bodily form that has captured true beauty well, and their wings begin to grow. When this soul looks upon the beautiful boy it experiences the utmost joy; when separated from the boy, intense pain and longing occur, and the wings begin to harden. Caught between these two feelings, the lover is in utmost anguish, with the boy the only doctor for the pain.|$|E
2500|$|The bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) {{performs}} a service for “client” fishes (belonging to other species) by removing and eating their ectoparasites. Clients can invite a cleaning session by adopting a typical posture or simply by remaining immobile near a wrasse's cleaning station. They can even form queues while doing so. But cleaning sessions {{do not always}} end up well, because wrasses (or wrasse-mimicking parasitic sabre-toothed blennies) may cheat and eat the nutritious body mucus of their clients, rather than just the ectoparasites, something that makes the client jolt and sometimes flee. This system {{has been the subject}} of extensive observations which have suggested cognitive abilities on the part of the cleaner wrasses and their clients. For example, clients refrain from soliciting a cleaning session if they have witnessed the cleaning session of the previous client ending badly. [...] Cleaners give the impression of trying to maintain a good reputation, because they cheat less <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> big audience (a long queue of clients) watching. Cleaners sometimes work as male-female teams, and when the smaller female cheats and bites the client, the larger male chases her off, as if to punish her for having tarnished their reputation.|$|E

Soon, a motorcycle speeds past them and crashes. The driver is seemingly all right, and Maggie insists they take him on board. The Hitcher (Jake Busey) is insistent on making small talk and joking with them, but Jim is overwhelmed and evicts him from the car.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, {{the bombers}} have {{suffered}} significant losses. The German interceptors focus their {{attacks on the}} leading aircraft in the formation. The first lead bomber, Windy City, loses its engines and explodes {{in front of the}} Belle, piloted by Captain Dennis Dearborn (Matthew Modine) and co-pilot 1st Lt. Luke Sinclair (Tate Donovan). More attacks ensue, and the replacement lead bomber, C Cup, is forced to break formation when its nose is crippled by a Bf 109.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{considered}} where firms internalize the regret costs that consumers experience <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> unexpected price change. Regret costs {{are assumed to}} be increasing in the size of price changes and this can explain why the size of price increases is less sensitive to inflation than in models with fixed costs of changing prices. The latter predict unrealistically large responses of price changes to inflation for firms that do not frequently reduce their prices. Adjustment costs that depend on the size of price changes also raise the variability on the size of price increases. Lastly, it is argued that the common practice of announcing price increases in advance is much easier to rationalize with regret concerns by consumers than with more standard approaches to price rigidity. ...|$|R
