5|$|The {{common loon}} {{is also known}} as the great {{northern}} diver in Eurasia. (Another former name, great northern loon, was a compromise proposed by the International Ornithological Committee.) It is one of five loon species that make up the genus Gavia, the only genus of the family Gaviidae and order Gaviiformes. Its closest relative is another large black-headed species, the yellow-billed loon or <b>white-billed</b> <b>diver</b> (Gavia adamsii). There are no recognised subspecies of the common loon.|$|E
25|$|The island's {{location}} {{means that}} migrants may be found, sometimes in huge numbers {{when the weather}} conditions are right. These may include vagrant rarities, such as an isabelline shrike in 2003, a <b>white-billed</b> <b>diver</b> in 2002, and a dusky warbler in 2000.|$|E
40|$|During April 2010 – February 2011, monthly {{surveys of}} seabirds and marine mammals were {{conducted}} aboard ships engaged in plankton surveys. After {{many years of}} little or no effort in far offshore areas of the DCS, this series of surveys provided the first recent ship-based data on seabirds, covering a large area (the entire Dutch Continental Shelf (DCS), including some Belgian and British waters) almost yearround. Due {{to changes in the}} design of the survey grid, the use of several ships, spells of bad weather conditions and seasonal differences in the number of daylight hours, the resulting coverage is not evenly spread in space and time. Still, both in terms of areas covered and detailed data gathered, this series of surveys complement the aerial surveys carried out under the same programme Shortlist Masterplan Wind. By surveying beyond the designated areas for round II offshore wind farms on the DCS, areas that might be targeted for round III, such as the shallow Dogger Bank area, got a first boost in T-zero survey effort. From April 2010 till February 2011 11 surveys, totalling to 48 at-sea days, 4610 5 -minute counts were conducted over a distance of 9021 km. At a counting strip width of mostly 300 m (200 m over a very small percentage of the counts), this amounts to a total surveyed area of 2706 km 2. The surveys have provided rough data on seabird distribution in far offshore areas. In total, 54, 593 individuals of 90 bird species were recorded, from which 15, 003 individuals of 36 species were recorded within the counting strip. Marine mammals were represented by 616 individuals of seven species, of which 389 individuals of six species were seen within the counting strip. Flying heights were noted for 5044 clusters of individuals, covering 75 species. Behaviour was noted for 1790 (clusters of) individuals. Apart from birds and marine mammals, 352 balloons were counted (of which 164 were within the counting strip) and proved omnipresent in periods of offshore winds. These surveys have identified several issues that should be taken into account in future planning of wind farms. Divers, which are the highest ranked species in terms of sensitivity to wind farms, can be encountered migrating anywhere in offshore waters and sightings of <b>White-billed</b> <b>Divers</b> at the Dogger Bank suggest the existence of a small wintering population of this near-threatened species. In relation to this, potential effects of wind farms on offshore species, such as Northern Fulmars, Atlantic Puffins, Little Auks and cetaceans, are unknown as current wind farms are located near shore where these species do not occur in large numbers...|$|R

50|$|The yellow-billed loon (Gavia adamsii), {{also known}} as the <b>white-billed</b> <b>diver,</b> is the largest member of the loon or diver family. Breeding adults have a black head, white underparts and {{chequered}} black-and-white mantle. Non-breeding plumage is drabber with the chin and foreneck white. The main distinguishing feature from great northern loon is the longer straw-yellow bill which, because the culmen is straight, appears slightly uptilted.|$|E
50|$|Elsewhere, other rarities {{reported}} in 2006 include a <b>white-billed</b> <b>diver</b> at Gairloch, a black-browed albatross in the Western Isles, a laughing gull in Shetland and a buff-breasted sandpiper at Lossiemouth. Accidentals recorded in earlier years include an American bittern in 1888 and a purple heron {{in the same}} year, a Baikal teal in 1958, and a black stork in 1977. Birds are also presumed to have escaped from captivity, such as a lanner falcon in 1976, Chilean flamingos in 1976 and 1979, a black-necked swan in 1988, and a red-tailed hawk in 1989. These records are but a small selection from two counties in the north-east and give only a flavour of the complexity and diversity of avian life in Scotland.|$|E
40|$|The second {{report of}} the Croatian Rarities Committee {{presents}} 37 records of rare birds received after 2002. Four species and one subspecies: Western Reef-egret Egretta garzetta gullaris, Bewick’s Swan Cygnus columbianus, Terek Sandpiper Xenus cinereus, Ring-billed Gull Larus delawarensis and Yellow-browed Warbler Phylloscopus inornatus {{were added to the}} list of Croatian birds and one, Arctic Redpoll Acanthis hornemanni was omitted, giving the total number of 381 bird species recorded in Croatia. Two species, <b>White-billed</b> <b>Diver</b> Gavia adamsii and Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax were observed {{for the first time in}} last 50 years. The list of rare species now includes 50 species. Checklist of bird species is given in the Appendix of this Report...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{incidence}} of hybridisation in birds differs greatly between orders {{and is expected}} to be low in or-ders comprising few species. The divers or loons (Gavi-iformes) are a species-poor group in which apparent hybridisation has been reported infrequently. Here we report on a hybrid diver stored in the collections of the Zoological Museum Amsterdam. The bird shows a heterogeneous set of characters, some shared with the putative parent species <b>White-billed</b> <b>Diver</b> Gavia adamsii and Great Northern Diver G. immer, others being intermediate between the two. A Canonical Discrimi-nant Function analysis positions the bird between these two putative parent species, making a hybrid status quite likely. We evaluate the evidence for hybridisation in the order Gaviiformes and conclude that hybridisa-tion has been suspected in four of the five species, though documentation is limited. If this high incidence could be confirmed, it would rank among the highest of any avian order, contradicting the assumption that {{incidence of}} hybridisation in small orders is relatively low...|$|E
40|$|Loons {{are large}} diving birds having long, straight, and acutely pointed bills, with {{feathers}} covering the lores (region between eye and bill) and extending to the linear nostrils. There are 10 functional primaries and 22 – 23 secondaries, the inner secondaries {{shorter than the}} primaries. Molting of the remiges (flight feathers) is simultaneous, and the wings are not used for underwater propulsion. The 16 – 20 rectrices (tail feathers) are short and stiff. The body feathers are shiny and water-resistant; aftershafts and adult down feathers are present. The legs are set extremely far back on the body, making standing very difficult and walking or takeoff from land nearly impossible. The tarsus is laterally compressed, with reticulated (network-like) scales, and is unserrated behind. The lobed hallux (hind toe) is long and slightly elevated, the front toes are fully webbed, and all the toes have sharp claws. The wings are long and pointed, and the body is somewhat elongated, with a fairly long neck. The adults have white underparts, and in most species both sexes are spotted or striped with black and white {{on the back and}} neck during the breeding season. All species are monogamous, with distinct breeding and wintering plumages that lack sexual dimorphism. The nests are built of vegetational debris and placed at the water 2 ̆ 7 s edge. The eggs (usually 2) are spotted and are elliptical to ovate, and the young are unpatterned and nidifugous, with two successive coats of uniformly brownish down. The family has a Holarctic distribution, and all the species are migratory, wintering primarily on salt water and breeding solitarily on freshwater lakes or large tundra ponds. Their foods are primarily fish and aquatic invertebrates, but they also eat small amounts of plant materials. Four extant species are usually recognized, all having breeding ranges that include North America, primarily in boreal and arctic regions.
