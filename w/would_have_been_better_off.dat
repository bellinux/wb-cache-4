5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> without free will, {{he argued that the}} possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault {{on the part of the}} agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E
25|$|A craft unionist {{might argue}} the miners <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> {{sticking}} {{to their own}} business. After all, both the miner's union and the fledgling mill worker's unions had been destroyed. But Haywood took away from this experience the conviction that labor needed more, not less, industrial unionism. The miners had struck in sympathy with the smeltermen, but other unions—notably, craft unions—had not.|$|E
25|$|Domitius was Consul in 32 and {{appointed}} by Tiberius as a commissioner in early 37. His son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, later Emperor Nero, {{was born on}} 15 December 37 in Antium. According to Suetonius, when Domitius was congratulated by his friends {{for the birth of}} his son he replied that any child born to him and Agrippina would have a detestable nature and become a public danger, a fact that became true during the second part of Nero's reign. When Nero castrated a boy named Sporus and married him as a wife, Suetonius quoted one Roman who lived around this time who remarked that the world <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> if Nero's father had married someone more like the castrated boy.|$|E

25|$|An early {{milestone}} {{in the rise}} in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story. Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.|$|E
25|$|Pope Callixtus III took King Thomas very seriously: {{he ordered}} that the King of Bosnia be handed the Crusaders' cross, the papal flag and the crusading fund, marking {{him as the}} leader of the {{coalition}} in July 1457. Thomas relied not on his own dubious strength, however, but on assistance of Western rulers. His emissaries to King Alfonso V of Aragon, Doge Francesco Foscari of Venice, Duke Francesco I Sforza of Milan, and Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy all reported refusals of help. Cardinal Carvajal was sent to Bosnia to meet with King Thomas. Cardinal Giovanni Castiglione skeptically wrote that Carvajal <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> if he had stayed in Buda. Indeed, Carvajal found Thomas ill-equipped to deal with the enemy. The Pope became disillusioned with him, and the leadership of the Christian coalition was transferred to the Albanian lord Skanderbeg.|$|E
25|$|Shares in Eurotunnel {{were issued}} at £3.50 per share on 9 December 1987. By mid-1989 the price {{had risen to}} £11.00. Delays and cost overruns led to the price dropping; during {{demonstration}} runs in October 1994 it reached an all-time low. Eurotunnel suspended payment on its debt in September 1995 to avoid bankruptcy. In December 1997 the British and French governments extended Eurotunnel's operating concession by 34years, to 2086. Financial restructuring of Eurotunnel occurred in mid-1998, reducing debt and financial charges. Despite the restructuring, The Economist reported in 1998 that to break even Eurotunnel would have to increase fares, traffic and market share for sustainability. A cost benefit analysis of the tunnel indicated that there were few impacts on the wider economy and few developments associated with the project, and that the British economy <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> {{if it had not}} been constructed.|$|E

25|$|Venables {{was signed}} by Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £80,000, and made his debut for the club in a North London derby defeat to Arsenal on 9 May 1966. His bad start to life at White Hart Lane {{continued}} when he punched club legend Dave Mackay during training, though no long-term rift developed because of the incident. Spurs went on {{to have a good}} 1966–67 season though, finishing third in the league and beating Millwall (after a replay), Portsmouth, Bristol City, Birmingham City (after a replay) and Nottingham Forest to reach the 1967 FA Cup Final to face his former club Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. Spurs won the cup with a 2–1 victory, Jimmy Robertson and Frank Saul providing the goals before Bobby Tambling scored a late consolation goal for Chelsea. Ironically, earlier in the season Venables had bet £25 on Chelsea to win the cup at odds of 25/1, which would have paid out £500 if Spurs had lost the game, exactly the same figure as the £500 cup bonus he would receive for winning the match; in fact after tax deductions, Venables <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> financially if Chelsea had won.|$|E

GameTrailers criticized the limited roster size, stating that the tag-based battling felt underdeveloped as a result. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer pointed out the lack of online features, such as a spectator mode, replays, and endless lobbies. Jordan Mallory of Joystiq reprimanded the game for its [...] "goofy and immature" [...] premise, sexualized art style, and unoriginal character movesets. Mallory concluded that the series <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> spending another year in development.|$|E

As he departs Detroit on a bus, he angrily remarks to Homer that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> if he never met him and that as far as he is concerned, he has no brother.

500|$|In a mixed review, Alexey Eremenko from AllMusic {{awarded the}} album three stars out of five. Eremenko was {{positive}} towards the album's [...] "meticulously arranged music, and multiple stylistic layers {{ensure that the}} record does not wear thin {{after the first few}} listens". However, he furthered stated, [...] "but although Rock'n'Roll Circus is a testament to veritable professional skills of Hamasaki and her producers and songwriters, its emotional power is questionable, to put it mildly." [...] Although criticizing the album's addition of J-pop music, its additional [...] "clichés", and labelling the ballads as the [...] "worst offenders on the album", he concluded, [...] "This is Hamasaki's eleventh album, and so song writing routine is to be expected, to a degree, but she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> going all the way with the alt-rock gimmick instead of meekly complying with the already trite conventions of J-pop, even if she had created those herself." [...] Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express was mixed in his review. Although he commended Hamasaki's transition to rock music and her song writing, he said he became [...] "worried" [...] about the production and found it regressive in comparison to Next Level.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of MDNA, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph gave a mixed to {{positive}} review, praising its dance-friendly nature, but calling the lyrics banal.

Is it about her doomed relationship with Guy Ritchie? Who knows? Who cares?". Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media criticized Solveig's [...] "unimaginative arrangements". Sian Rowe from NME found the track to be [...] "flat", this view was also shared by Alex Macpherson from Fact magazine. Robert Leedham from Drowned in Sound website called the song [...] "mediocre", describing it as [...] "synth-flavoured filler of the garden variety". Jon Pareles from The New York Times called it shallow, effective club fodder, describing it as containing [...] "blippy stereo-hopping synthesizers and generic title".

A writer from the Leader-Post praised Lee's [...] "stunning notes" [...] on [...] "Lithium" [...] which he further described as the equivalent of [...] "My Immortal" [...] from the band's debut studio album Fallen (2003). Saying that it [...] "could blow a hole in the wall", a writer from Billboard went on to describe the song as [...] "the kind of number Evanescence was born to perform: cinematic production, gripping orchestration and Amy Lee's voice gliding through verses and soaring over choruses". The writer finished off his review by noting that Lee's [...] "latest musical affair with darkness is captivating" [...] and it would almost make listeners [...] "wish [...] heart was broken". A more mixed review came from R.J. Carter of the music website The Trades, who felt that [...] "Lithium" [...] was one of The Open Doors two songs which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> as bonus tracks, adding [...] " [...] stretches Lee's glass-shattering capabilities to a level which, at one point, I'm sure deafened the German Shepherd down the street".|$|E
500|$|... "Secrets" [...] {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} political commentators for its [...] "potentially misleading perception" [...] of emergency contraception. Shawn Rhea of Planned Parenthood cited that the morning-after pills do not induce abortion, as the episode implies.

Both {{of those things are}} dangerous and might not work, but they're about as effective as OD'ing on levonorgestrel." [...] Ryan prescribed that actual abortion pills are administered by medical professionals and are not available at pharmacies. Danielle Aronson of ACLU summated that the effectiveness of terminating a pregnancy with emergency contraception would be equivalent to [...] "cutting a zombie's finger off to kill it." [...] Similarly, Slate Amanda Marcotte opined: [...] "The problem with this storyline, outside the tedious fear of getting letters from irate anti-choicers that dictates TV's near-absolute approach to unintended pregnancy, is simple: Morning-after pills are not abortion." [...] Marcotte asserted that abortion pills, commonly RU-486, were only provided by medical personnel.

2500|$|A large {{advertising}} push by Taco Bell {{was begun}} in late February 2011 {{in response to}} a consumer protection lawsuit filed against the company by an Alabama law firm. The promotion sought to counter allegations that the company falsely advertised the ratio of ingredients in its beef filling for its tacos. The spots featured employees and franchisees stating that the filling has always been a mixture of 88% beef and various spices and binders and nothing else. The ad followed several full-page print ads in the New York Times and other newspapers that featured the headline [...] "Thank you for suing us." [...] Additionally, the chain added a new social campaign using Twitter and Facebook. The company invested heavily in the campaign, spending more than $3 million (USD) putting out its message—about 20 percent more than the company usually spends on an advertising program. The various campaigns came shortly before the company began its official response to the suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and were designed to bring public opinion into their camp. Various analysts stated that the company <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> using a grass-root campaign that involved in store advertising and other non-broadcast media. The suit was eventually withdrawn, and the company continued its advertising response by publicly requesting an apology from the suing firm of Beasley Allen. Analyst Laura Ries, of marketing strategy firm Ries & Ries, stated she believed Taco Bell's latest response was a mistake. She commented that reviving memories of a suit {{that the majority of the}} public had forgotten after the initial burst of publicity was the wrong strategy from Taco Bell.|$|E
