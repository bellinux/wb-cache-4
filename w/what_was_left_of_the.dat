5|$|Suslov was {{becoming}} progressively {{more critical of}} Khrushchev's policies, his political intransigence, and his campaign to eliminate <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Stalinist guard. There were also deep-seated divergences in foreign and domestic policy between Suslov and Khrushchev. Suslov opposed the idea of improving Soviet Union–United States relations, and was against Khrushchev's attempts at rapprochement with Yugoslavia. Domestically, Suslov opposed Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinisation and his economic decentralisation scheme.|$|E

The total number of volunteer rescue personnel in Leninakan totalled 2,000, with teams from Austria, Canada, Switzerland, the United States and Yugoslavia.

He made his stage debut in December 1920 with Growcott's St Nicholas Players at the St Nicholas Hall, Brighton, a converted bacon factory. He played a gendarme in an adaptation of Les Misérables, and was soon entrusted with larger parts including Banquo in Macbeth and Malvolio in Twelfth Night.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} on March 15, 44 BC. The {{assassination}} {{was led by}} Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus. Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations for carrying out the assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms {{in favor of the}} landless classes. Virtually all the conspirators fled the city after Caesar's death in fear of retaliation. The civil war that followed destroyed <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{reports that}} Xerxes sent his {{commander}} Hydarnes that evening, {{with the men}} under his command, the Immortals, to encircle the Greeks via the path. However, he does not say who those men were. The Immortals had been bloodied on the first day, so {{it is possible that}} Hydarnes may have been given overall command of an enhanced force including <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Immortals; according to Diodorus, Hydarnes had a force of 20,000 for the mission. The path led from east of the Persian camp along the ridge of Mt. Anopaea behind the cliffs that flanked the pass. It branched, with one path leading to Phocis and the other down to the Malian Gulf at Alpenus, the first town of Locris.|$|E

5|$|On 28 March 2003 the {{pavilion}} at the pierhead caught fire. Fire crews {{were unable to}} save the building from destruction because the collapsed walkway prevented them from reaching it. The cause of the fire remains unknown, since fire investigators were unable to access the site for safety reasons, although it {{is thought to have}} been arson. A more severe fire burned through 11 and 12 May 2003, consuming most of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concert hall. On 23 June 2004, high winds caused the middle of the pier to collapse completely. The following month, English Heritage declared the pier to be beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March the {{division}} {{was ordered to}} proceed to the coast at Qui Nhơn for evacuation. North Vietnamese forces attacked them there {{from the north and}} two of {{the division}}'s regiments had to fight their way through to the beaches for pick-up. At 02:00 on 1 April, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> division was extracted by sea. Two regimental colonels, after being ordered to evacuate, refused to leave, preferring suicide rather than retreat or surrender. The division's third regiment, the 47th, ran into an ambush at Phu Cat and suffered heavy casualties, losing about half of its troops. When it later regrouped at Vũng Tàu, the 22nd numbered only slightly over 2,000 men, its commander also having chosen suicide over surrender.|$|E

Photographers Arta Ngucaj and Arben Beqiraj published photographs of the ship on the Albanian-Italian newspaper Shqiptari i Italisë.

5|$|Plans were {{formulated}} on 6 September {{to transport}} the British 1st Airborne Division to Taranto from their base in North Africa. They would {{take advantage of the}} Italian surrender to capture the port and establish anti-aircraft defences. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian fleet still using the harbour was expected to have left beforehand. The Allies believed that the division would face only minimal opposition and would be able to overcome any resistance with the limited naval support available, as Taranto was outside the range of Allied fighter aircraft based in Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{protests from}} Barrowclough, the disbandment began in April 1944, with a {{contingent}} of nearly 1,900 men returning to New Zealand with more following {{over the next few}} months. By June 1944, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> division was in New Caledonia, having been withdrawn there after the Battle of the Green Islands. In September, the disbandment was made official and was officially completed the following month. This left a demoralised Barrowclough without a command. He hoped for a suitable position with the 2nd New Zealand Division, possibly taking over from Freyberg. This did not eventuate and instead he was sent to the British Army's 21st Army Group as an observer. In late 1945, he was discharged from the military. His service in the Pacific theatre of operations was rewarded with several decorations, which included the United States Legion of Merit and appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
5|$|On 4 May, the 25th Battalion {{moved to}} the village of Sgonico, just to the north of Trieste. Along with other {{elements}} of the 2nd New Zealand Division, the battalion remained in and around Trieste for several weeks to counter the presence of Yugoslav partisans, who had laid claim to the city. In mid-June the partisans withdrew from the city and several weeks later the New Zealand government decided that the division would not be required for service in the Pacific Theatre of Operations. In early August, the battalion began demobilisation with long serving men leaving for New Zealand via Bari while the remaining personnel withdrew to wintering positions near Florence. In October, Barnett took over command of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 6th Brigade. This left command of the battalion in its final days to Major D. Muir, who oversaw its disbandment on 2 December 1945.|$|E

5|$|Rome's {{control over}} the city ended {{following}} {{the chaos of the}} Crisis of the Third Century, when the empire nearly disintegrated as a series of generals seized and lost power through civil wars, palace coups and assassinations. Around 280, Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re-established.In 285, the emperor Diocletian reorganised <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province to retain only the coastal strip between Lixus, Tingis and Septa (modern Ceuta). Although a Roman army was based in Tingis, it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region. Occupation of the city continued, however, as fine mosaics such as that of a chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus can not have been created earlier than the fourth century. The end of the Roman city probably {{came in the form of}} an earthquake towards the end of the century, which buried numerous bronze statues in the wreckage of the houses.|$|E
5|$|At 03:30 {{local time}} on 8 December 1941 (about 09:00 on 7 December in Hawaii), Sutherland {{learned of the}} attack on Pearl Harbor and {{informed}} MacArthur. At 05:30, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, General George Marshall, ordered MacArthur to execute the existing war plan, Rainbow Five. MacArthur did nothing. On three occasions, the commander of the Far East Air Force, Major General Lewis H. Brereton, requested permission to attack Japanese bases in Formosa, in accordance with prewar intentions, but was denied by Sutherland. Not until 11:00 did Brereton speak with MacArthur about it, and obtained permission. MacArthur later denied having the conversation. At 12:30, nine hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, aircraft of Japan's 11th Air Fleet achieved complete tactical surprise when they attacked Clark Field and the nearby fighter base at Iba Field, and destroyed or disabled 18 of Far East Air Force's 35 B-17s, 53 of its 107 P-40s, three P-35s, and more than 25 other aircraft. Most were destroyed on the ground. Substantial damage was done to the bases, and casualties totaled 80 killed and 150 wounded. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Far East Air Force was all but destroyed over the next few days.|$|E
5|$|By day four, 20September, {{the brigade}} still holding {{out at the}} bridge had been split into two groups during the night by the Germans who had managed to {{infiltrate}} close enough to separate them into positions east and west of the bridge road. Any movement was subjected to machine-gun and sniper fire and they were under almost constant mortar and artillery attack. Added to this were probes by tanks and self propelled guns, which approached the defenders' buildings and opened fire at point blank range. The brigade, out of anti-tank ammunition, could do nothing to stop them in the east, but the 6pounders in the west still proved an effective deterrent. During the day, Lieutenant John Grayburn of the 2nd Battalion was killed and later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery during the fighting at the bridge. That morning, communications with 1st Airborne Division were established and Frost, on asking for reinforcements and supplies, was informed that the division was surrounded at Oosterbeek and the brigade was on their own. Frost was later wounded and command of the brigade assumed by Major Frederick Gough of the reconnaissance squadron. By midday the brigade position was untenable and the last defenders were withdrawn into {{what had been the}} Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion's position. By nightfall they were still holding out, and in the darkness some men tried unsuccessfully to break out. At dawn on day five, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brigade was forced to surrender.|$|E

5|$|With {{no other}} way to readily obtain cash, DuMont sold WDTV to Westinghouse Electric Corporation for $9.75 million in late 1954. While this gave DuMont a {{short-term}} cash infusion, it eliminated the leverage the network had to get program clearances in other markets. Without its de facto monopoly in Pittsburgh, the company's advertising revenue shrank to less than half that of 1953. By February 1955, DuMont executives realized the company could not continue as a television network. The decision was made to shut down network operations and operate WABD and WTTG as independent stations. On April 1, 1955, most of DuMont's entertainment programs were dropped. Bishop Sheen aired his last program on DuMont on April 26 and later moved to ABC. By May, just eight programs were left on the network, with only inexpensive shows and sporting events keeping <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network going through the summer. The network also largely abandoned the use of the intercity network coaxial cable, on which it had spent $3 million in 1954 to transmit shows that mostly lacked station clearance. The company only retained network links for live sports programming and utilizing the company's Electronicam process to produce studio-based programming. Ironically, Electronicam is best remembered for being used by Jackie Gleason's producers for the 39-half-hour episodes of The Honeymooners that aired on CBS during the 1955-56 television season.|$|E
