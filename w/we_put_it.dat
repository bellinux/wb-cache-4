"We {{were doing}} the album and Billy Joe was around, and we began 'Honky Tonk Heroes,' so we cut {{the first part of}} the song and we stopped, and Waylon said, 'This is the way we're going to do it.' [...] And Billy Joe had been sitting in the back and he come walking up, saying, 'What are you doing? [...] You're fucking up my song. [...] That ain't the way it goes.' [...] Pretty soon Waylon and Billy Joe are just hollering at one another. [...] Billy Joe didn't {{understand}} the way we were putting it together...then <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> together and he said, 'Yeah. [...] That's good. [...] That's the way it goes.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{have been}} {{critical}} of Hail to the Thief. In a 2006 interview with Spin, Yorke said: [...] "I'd maybe change the playlist. I think we had a meltdown when <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> together ... We wanted to do things quickly, and I think the songs suffered." [...] In 2008, O'Brien told Mojo he felt Radiohead should have cut the album to ten tracks and that its length had alienated some listeners. In the same interview, Colin Greenwood said he felt several songs were unfinished and that the album was [...] "more of a holding process". In 2013, Godrich told the NME: [...] "I think there's some great moments on there - but too many songs... As a whole I think it's charming {{because of the lack of}} editing. But personally it's probably my least favourite of all the albums ... It didn't really have its own direction. It was almost like a homogeny of previous work. Maybe that's its strength." ...|$|E
500|$|Docter made Venezuela the film's setting after Ralph Eggleston {{gave him}} a video of the tepui {{mountains}} of Canaima National Park; and tepuis were already featured in a previous Disney film, Dinosaur. In 2004, Docter and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days reaching Monte Roraima by airplane, jeep, and helicopter. They spent three nights there painting and sketching, and encountering ants, mosquitoes, scorpions, frogs, and snakes. They also flew to Matawi Tepui and climbed to Angel Falls. Docter felt [...] "we couldn't use [...] Reality is so far out, if <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the movie you wouldn't believe it." [...] The film's creatures were also challenging to design {{because they had to}} fit in the surreal environment of the tepuis, but also be realistic because those mountains exist in real life. The filmmakers visited Sacramento Zoo to observe a Himalayan monal for Kevin's animation. The animators designed Russell as an Asian-American, and modeled Russell after similar looking Peter Sohn, a Pixar storyboarder who voiced Emile in Ratatouille and directed the short Partly Cloudy, because of his energetic nature.|$|E

500|$|Both Grand Forks and East Grand Forks had {{to decide}} whether to develop the land along the river. The {{president}} of the East Grand Forks planning-and-zoning commission commented on the idea of development, [...] "The river had been our friend for all these years. It had been like an old dog, sleeping comfortably at our feet, and then one day it jumped up and bit us. We {{had to decide}}: Do <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> to sleep or try to make amends?" [...] What were once entire neighborhoods are now covered by grass and trees, part of an extensive area of parkland called the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. In East Grand Forks, this transformation is especially visible. One former neighborhood is now a large campground, the center of what is now known as the Red River State Recreation Area. The cities of today are significantly different from their pre-flood state, but many residents are pleased with this, seeing it as fulfillment of President Bill Clinton's promise that the cities would [...] "rebuild stronger and better than ever." [...] Population estimates by the Census Bureau and by the city of Grand Forks itself now show a growing community.|$|E
500|$|... "Footprints in the Sand" [...] {{was written}} by Simon Cowell, David Kreuger, Per Magnusson and Richard Page, whilst the {{production}} was helmed by Steve Mac. It was recorded in 2007 at Rokstone Studios in London, England. Cowell originally {{came up with the}} idea to base a song around the Christian poem [...] "Footprints", and suggested it to Kreuger and Magnusson. They had a scheduled session in Page's home in Malibu, California and finished the song the next day. Cowell secured a songwriting credit for coming up with the idea. In an interview with HitQuarters, Magnusson said they had thought the song would be a good idea for Irish boy band Westlife, but it was offered to British singer Leona Lewis instead. When Cowell mentioned the song concept to Lewis, she agreed that it could be [...] "really quite interesting". Regarding the song, Lewis commented: [...] "Originally it was a poem; it's very inspirational so <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into a song. I think it is very moving, with a very emotional lyric and I really love to sing this song"; and added that the poem [...] " [...] about standing by someone and being there for people who need your help." ...|$|E
500|$|Development of Baldur's Gate II {{began in}} January 1999. From the {{suggestions}} of fans on message boards and newsgroups, reviews of Baldur's Gate, and internal suggestions, {{a list of}} constructive criticism was compiled; from this list, a slightly shorter one of features {{to be added to}} the game was made. Some of the items on this list were: support for higher resolutions, such as 800 by 600 pixels and above; 3D support; non-pausing dialogue in multiplayer; drop off panels in the interface; character kits; dual-wielding of weapons; a streamlined journal and annotable map; deathmatch; and inclusion of famous AD monsters such as the dragon. Not many features had to be cut, and they kept as many as they could. Because of the engine's mature state of development, most features were fairly easy to add. Ben Smedstad, the producer of the game, said, [...] "The engine was up and running since day one, which is a huge morale booster. When a monster is complete, <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into the 'override' directory and it appears in the game! This is a huge change from working on the original." [...] Late in the project, deathmatch was removed, while non-pausing dialogue, which proved [...] "the most problematic feature", was removed early on before being reintroduced in early 2000.|$|E

500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} captured the sounds of crashing, screaming, and the shattering of glass and plates. Three times {{in a period of}} five seconds there were shouts of pain or distress from a hijacker outside the cockpit, suggesting a hijacker that was standing guard outside the cockpit was being attacked by the passengers. Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10:00:03. Five seconds later, he asked, [...] "Is that it? Shall we finish it off?" [...] Another hijacker responded, [...] "No. Not yet. When they all come, we finish it off." [...] Jarrah once again pitched the airplane up and down. A passenger in the background cried, [...] "In the cockpit. If we don't, we'll die" [...] at 10:00:25. Sixteen seconds later, another passenger, identified as Tom Burnett, yelled, [...] "Roll it!", possibly referring to using the food cart. The {{voice recorder}} did record the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door. Jarrah ceased the violent maneuvers at 10:01:00 and recited the takbir several times. He then asked another hijacker, [...] "Is that it? I mean, shall <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> down?" [...] The other hijacker responded, [...] "Yes, put it in it, and pull it down." [...] The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey!", and then [...] "Give it to me!" [...] repeated eight times in succession, possibly referring to the plane's yoke.|$|E

2500|$|In another {{scene in}} which a {{character}} dies from solar exposure among the ashes from cremated bodies, massive wind turbines propelled biodegradable dust at the actor in the director's attempt to have the computer-generated effects follow the actor instead of vice versa. Boyle commented on his approach to using effects, [...] "There {{is part of our}} brain where we admire the effect, but <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in a side compartment of our experience because you know there's no way an actor can live through that, or be there in that moment." [...] During the post-production process, Boyle hired one visual effects company, London's Moving Picture Company, to work on the film's 750 visual effects. The assignment of a single company was contrary to the industry trend of hiring multiple vendors to work on a film's effects. Boyle chose one company for ease of quality control, though the decision resulted in a prolonged post-production process.|$|E

2500|$|Sigsworth {{created a}} demo backing track that was [...] "{{finished}} enough to impress, {{but not so}} finished as to restrict Madonna's freedom to write {{over the top of}} it." [...] According to him, [...] "'What It Feels Like For a Girl' was done very quickly. 'I sent her a backing track, and she wrote a top line to it, <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> together and four days later we had a record. And what was kind of good for me was that we decided on day one that we liked all the noises I'd already used on the demo, and it was more a matter of repositioning them in the arrangement around M's top line. So the whole job, apart from recording the voice, was moving things around in Pro Tools", he claimed. He remarked that he sent her two sketches and that she chose the more unusual one. [...] "And at the start of it, I put this sample from a movie of the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg. I just knew that M would fall in love with that, and she did", he declared.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{recorded}} the album in several locations the first being London, England, {{where she worked}} with Steve Mac, who produced the songs [...] "Homeless" [...] and [...] "Footprints in the Sand". [...] "Homeless" [...] was written by Jörgen Elofsson, and was previously recorded by Swedish singer Darin. [...] "Footprints in the Sand" [...] was written by Per Magnusson, David Kreuger, Richard Page and Simon Cowell. The song is an adaptation of the Christian poem [...] "Footprints", and Lewis commented [...] "Originally it was a poem; it's very inspirational so <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into a song. I {{think it is very}} moving, with a very emotional lyric and I really love to sing this song". Cowell {{came up with the idea}} to base a song around the poem, and asked Kreuger and Magnusson whether they could write something dealing with this subject. They took the idea to a songwriting session the pair already had scheduled with Page at his home in Malibu, California and they finished the song the following day. When Cowell mentioned the song concept to Lewis, she agreed that it could be [...] "really quite interesting".|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012, {{production}} {{returned to}} Budapest for seven weeks of additional shooting. The following month, screenwriter Damon Lindelof {{was hired to}} rewrite the film's third act with reshoots scheduled to begin in September or October 2012. However, Lindelof, who also reworked Prometheus and co-wrote Star Trek Into Darkness, {{did not have time}} to script the new ending and in July 2012, Paramount hired Lindelof's Lost partner, Drew Goddard. Lindelof explained there were inefficiencies in the script in relation to the shooting, which started before the script was finalized thus making the ending [...] "abrupt and incoherent" [...] and was missing a large chunk of footage. Lindelof presented two options to executives, who ultimately chose to shoot 30 to 40 minutes of additional footage to make a coherent ending. Goddard later told Creative Screenwriting, [...] "To me the big lesson of World War Z was that Paramount, Plan B and Brad Pitt simply said, 'Let's take the time to make this movie the best version of the movie before <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on the screen for audience.' That doesn't happen a lot. A lot of times they just throw the movie out there and say, 'We'll make all our money opening weekend and then the movie will go away.' I came away from it thinking, 'Why don't we do this on more movies?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I imagine they are all still {{trying to make a living}} somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.|$|E
