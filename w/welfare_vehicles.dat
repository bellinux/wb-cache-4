40|$|These {{days the}} number of aged and {{disabled}} people is increasing rapidly. But most of the disabled or the aged who {{have the ability to}} work, want to engage in economic activities and solve social restrictions as well as their bad financial conditions. This paper concerns about the tracking control of an electric wheelchair robot for <b>welfare</b> <b>vehicle</b> where the seat and electric wheelchair are separated and electric wheelchair robot must be autonomously controlled without the help of assistant. So the aged or the disabled people can drive <b>welfare</b> <b>vehicle</b> by himself by adopting this system. Therefore the concept of both an autonomous driving of electric wheelchair and path tracking robots is required in this system. Finally we suggested fuzzy controller in order to control the path tracking of electric wheelchair robot and compared the capability of th...|$|R
50|$|At around 8:00 am {{a worker}} was {{changing}} over an acetylene cylinder when the tank began to vent and ignited; {{this in turn}} ignited other venting tanks. On arrival of the brigade a 300 m cordon {{was put in place}} which required surrounding houses and the docks to be evacuated. The brigade extinguished the initial fire but then had to cool the cylinders constantly for 24 hours to prevent the cylinders from exploding due to the heat and pressure buildup. In total Cornwall FRS sent 6 pumping appliances, 1 command support unit, 1 operational support unit, 1 <b>welfare</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The incident lasted for 24 hours and required numerous relief crews to attend overnight.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{investigation}} {{studies the}} speed design of lift-up mechanism in a <b>welfare</b> <b>vehicle</b> that lowers and raises a seat {{from the side}} door of the vehicle. The seat functions like a wheelchair as it is landed to the ground. A parallelogram configuration is adopted in the mechanism design. A parallelogram linkage, in which a link rod is shaped as a cam, governs {{the motion of the}} mechanism. The cam pair mechanism, like a motion-generator cam, determines the motion to expand the lift-up mechanism. The system is kinematically analyzed. The constraint relations, velocity equations, and acceleration equations of the mechanism are obtained. The kinematic characteristics of the lift-up mechanism are investigated, which gives the guidance to design the speed of the system. The speed of the lift-up mechanism is investigated, in which the method of linear function with parabolic blends for a path with via-points is adopted in the trajectory planning...|$|R

40|$|Off-highway vehicle (OHV) use is {{a rapidly}} growing outdoor {{activity}} that results {{in a host of}} environmental and management problems. Federal agencies have been directed to develop travel management plans to improve recreation experiences, reduce social conflicts, and diminish environmental impacts of OHVs. We examine the effect of land access restrictions on the welfare of OHV enthusiasts in Utah using Murdock’s unobserved heterogeneity random utility model (Murdock 2006). Our models indicate that changing access to public lands from fully â€œopenâ€ to â€œlimitedâ€ results in relatively small welfare losses, but that prohibiting access results in much larger <b>welfare</b> losses. off-highway <b>vehicles,</b> recreational access, unobserved heterogeneity, random utility model, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Before 1996, {{households}} {{were typically}} ineligible for welfare {{if they had}} assets worth more than $ 1, 000, where $ 1, 500 from each vehicle’s value was excluded from this determination. However, the 1996 welfare reform act began allowing states to increase their asset limits and vehicle exclusions. This may prompt low-income households to reallocate resources to or from vehicles. We {{examine the effects of}} state vehicle asset rules on vehicle assets. Results show liberalizing asset rules increases vehicle assets and that this increase is driven largely by eligible individuals increasing vehicle assets, with no evidence indicating ineligible individuals reduce vehicle assets to become eligible. <b>Welfare,</b> asset rules, <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R

40|$|Vehicle {{ownership}} may promote work if {{employment opportunities}} and job searches are enhanced by reliable transportation. For example, vehicles {{may serve to}} reduce potential physical isolation from employment opportunities. I {{examine the effects of}} vehicle ownership and vehicle quality on employment for single mothers with no more than a high school education using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data. I control for potential bias by jointly estimating employment and vehicle ownership in a maximum likelihood framework using state welfare eligibility asset rules as instruments. Results show that vehicle ownership increases employment. Positive effects of vehicles do not differ for urban and rural residents, but they do change with economic conditions. Further, welfare recipients are significantly more likely to exit the program and become employed if they own a <b>vehicle.</b> Employment <b>Vehicles</b> <b>Welfare</b> Spatial mismatch hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Gasoline {{taxes are}} widely {{perceived}} as the most efficient instrument for reducing gasoline consumption because they exploit all behavioral responses for reducing fuel use, including reduced driving and improved fuel economy. At present, however, higher fuel taxes are viewed as a political nonstarter. Pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) auto insurance, which involves replacing existing lump-sum premiums with premiums that vary in proportion to miles driven, should be more practical, since they do not raise driving costs for the average motorist. We show that when impacts on {{a broad range of}} motor vehicle externalities are considered, PAYD also induces significantly higher welfare gains than comparable gasoline tax increases, for fuel reductions below 9 %. The reason is that under PAYD, all of the reduction in fuel use, rather than just a fraction, comes from reduced driving; this produces a substantial additional efficiency gain because mileage-related external costs (especially congestion and accidents) are relatively large in magnitude. gasoline tax; pay-as-you-drive insurance; mileage tax; <b>welfare</b> effects; motor <b>vehicle</b> externality...|$|R
40|$|When {{farm animals}} are transported {{there are several}} factors that can affect their <b>welfare.</b> If the <b>vehicle</b> has an {{accident}} {{the welfare of the}} animals transported will probably be compromised. The aim {{of this study was to}} make a survey of accidents with animal transportation vehicles in Sweden. The survey included the number of accidents from January 2000 to May 2014, the cause of the accidents and how the animal welfare was affected by the accident. The authorities which were likely to have reports about accidents involving animal transports were contacted. There were no collected records about transportation accidents and the authorities referred to eachother for information. Search engines on the internet had to be used to find any accidents concerning animal transports in reports. Four interviews were carried out to determine how the animal welfare was affected and for determining how the accidents were affected by the live load of animals. In total, 39 accidents were reported by media during the chosen timespan and 31 of the vehicles made a rollover at the accident. The welfare of the animals was severely affected in many of these accidents and some of the suffering of the animals could have been avoided if the advices in the regulations of transport had been followed. At transport the animals are live load, which means they can change the center of gravity. This phenomena may cause the accidents that were reported, since several of the transports were reported to be caused by the vehicle having one wheel outside of the tarmac by accident, and then the rollover happened when the driver tried turning the vehicle back up on the road. The live load of animals can be presumed to impair the drivers abillty to parry the movements of the vehicle, and by this urging on the momentum...|$|R
40|$|As {{the battle}} over welfare reform {{continues}} to invade the nation, the role of welfare in helping people to meet their own educational objectives {{for the purpose of}} ensuring long-term self-sufficiency is likely to be challenged. It was the intent of this unique qualitative case study to explore the different pathways that led three welfare recipients to seek welfare and their life experiences as they journeyed from dependency to self-sufficiency. The study focused on recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, which is a federally funded welfare program that provides cash payments for families with needy children who lack parental support (Friedlander 2 ̆ 6 Burtless, 1995). ^ The participants [...] a divorced mother of two, a single mother, and a young couple granted two thorough face-to-face interviews in their homes and provided information related to eight major categories: background history, turning point, welfare encounter, higher education, self-sufficiency, barriers encountered, aids to self-sufficiency, and policy recommendations. The study painted a descriptive portrait of each recipient and the difficult circumstances that led to their encounter with welfare. Their challenging journey from welfare dependency to self-sufficiency glorifies the empowering role of higher education and illustrates the fortitude of the human spirit. Of significance was the interesting generational and ideological shift between the recipients 2 ̆ 7 view of public assistance and that of their parents. The recipients sought dependency on <b>welfare</b> as a <b>vehicle</b> to self-sufficiency, viewed welfare as an entitlement, and were able to justify their dependency on public assistance in the face of personal sacrifice. The comprehensive cross-case theme analysis revealed the different pathways that lead people to welfare dependency, similar experiences, significant themes, and straight-forward policy convictions as asserted by the three participants in this study. ^ This empowerment-based research study echoed the voices of recipients and utilized the strength perspective to emphasize their efforts to rise above poverty by utilizing welfare dependency to achieve self-sufficiency. Research convictions reflect the participants 2 ̆ 7 commitment to self improvement through higher education and their recommendations for designing responsive strengths-based social policies and programs to empower welfare recipients to triumph over dependency and attain lasting self-sufficiency. ...|$|R
