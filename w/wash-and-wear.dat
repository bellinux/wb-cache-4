5000|$|Ruth Rogan Benerito (January 12, 1916 - October 5, 2013) [...] was an American chemist and {{inventor}} {{known for}} her work related to the textile industry, notably including the development of <b>wash-and-wear</b> cotton fabrics. She held 55 patents.|$|E
5000|$|Advances in {{producing}} permanent press fabrics involved {{a series of}} agents that crosslink the cellulose-based fibers that comprise most clothing. Initial agents included formaldehyde. Starting in the 1940s, a series of urea-formaldehyde derivatives were introduced. Technical issues overcome included yellowing, odor, and the tendency of some agents to accelerate the degradation of fabrics by bleaches. [...] In 1953, Brooks Brothers manufactured <b>wash-and-wear</b> shirts using a blend of Dacron, polyester, and a wrinkle free cotton that was invented by Ruth R. Benerito, which they called [...] "Brooksweave".|$|E

Although rare outside of Europe, {{a small number of}} Magyar ag치rs do reside in the United States. North American Magyar ag치r owners do have opportunities to show their dogs in United Kennel Club, North American Kennel Club/Rarities, American Rare Breed Association, and International All Breed Canine Association conformation events. In addition, the Magyar ag치r is eligible to compete in LGRA and NOTRA amateur racing events and ASFA lure coursing events.|$|E
50|$|Class A uniforms, {{which are}} wool-blend and worn with metal badges and name tags, are the {{standard}} every day uniforms. Class B uniforms, which are <b>wash-and-wear</b> polyester-cotton with cloth badge patches, are worn in custody environments, certain specialized units, {{and can also}} be authorized for wear in inclement weather or extreme heat. There are also specialist uniforms such as bicycle patrol gear, nomex flight suits, tactical uniforms, and others for special circumstances. Authorized headgear includes the combination cap and campaign hat in green for the Class A uniform, worn with the county hat piece, as well as baseball caps with the Class B uniform.|$|E
50|$|Collars {{may also}} be stiffened, {{traditionally}} with starch; modern <b>wash-and-wear</b> shirt collars may be stiffened with interfacing or may include metal or plastic collar stays. Shirt collars which are not starched are described as soft collars. The shape of collars is also controlled by {{the shape of the}} neckline to which they are attached. Most collars are fitted to a jewel neck, a neckline sitting {{at the base of the}} neck all around; if the garment opens down the front, the top edges may be folded back to form lapels and a V-shaped opening, and the cut of the collar will be adjusted accordingly.|$|E
5000|$|Ruth Benerito is {{most famous}} {{for her work}} {{relating}} {{to the use of}} mono-basic acid chlorides in the production of cotton, with which she has 55 patents, which allows for more wrinkle-free and durable clothing. She invented these <b>wash-and-wear</b> cotton fabrics while working at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) laboratories in New Orleans in the 1950s. Before this innovation, a family needed considerable time to iron clothes. Benerito found a way to chemically treat the surface of cotton that led not only to wrinkle-resistant fabric but also to stain- and flame-resistant fabrics. The invention was said to have [...] "saved the cotton industry." ...|$|E
50|$|Officers {{wore black}} and khaki neckties until after February 1942 when neckties of wool cotton blend khaki shade 5 were authorized. Male officer's summer service uniforms usually {{consisted}} of the <b>wash-and-wear</b> cotton khaki shade 1 uniforms {{like those of the}} enlisted men, the main difference being that the shirts had shoulder straps. An OD wool shirt and cotton khaki trouser combination was also authorized. However, for dress purposes they also had the option of purchasing a khaki shade 1 summer service uniform of tropical weight suiting fabric. This uniform was identical in cut to the winter officers' uniform except for the color and cloth. However, the cloth belt of the winter coat was omitted.|$|E

40|$|The {{persistence}} of Staphylococcus aureus (Smith) on wool blanket, wool gabardine, cotton sheeting, cotton knit jersey, cotton terry cloth, and cotton <b>wash-and-wear</b> fabrics was studied. The fabrics {{were exposed to}} bacterial populations by three methods: direct contact, aerosol, and a lyophilized mixture of bacteria and dust having a high content of textile fibers. The contaminated fabrics were held in 35 or 78 % relative humidities at 25 C. In general, the persistence time of S. aureus populations on fabrics held in 35 % relative humidity was substantially longer when the fabrics were contaminated by exposure to aerosolized cultures or to dust containing bacteria than when contaminated by direct contact. In a 78 % relative humidity, bacterial populations on the fabrics persisted for substantially shorter periods of time regardless of the mode of contamination or fabric type. Cotton <b>wash-and-wear</b> fabric (treated with a modified triazone resin) was the material on which populations of S. aureus persisted for the shortest time. This organism retained its virulence for Swiss mice after being recovered from wool gabardine swatches held 4 weeks in 35 % relative humidity and 6 weeks in 78 % relative humidity...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{compounds}} {{were tested}} in vitro for virucidal and antiviral activity against poliovirus and vaccinia virus. These compounds included five quaternary ammonium salts, two bromosalicylanilides, and neomycin sulfate, an antibiotic. None of the compounds was active against poliovirus, but virucidal activity was demonstrated against vaccinia virus with three of the quarternary ammonium compounds: n-alkyl (C 14, C 12, C 16) dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, di-isobutyl cresoxy ethoxy ethyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride monohydrate, and n-alkyl (60 % C 14, 30 % C 16, 5 % C 12, 5 % C 18) dimethyl benzyl ammonium chlorides plus n-alkyl (50 % C 12, 30 % C 14, 17 % C 16, 3 % C 18) dimethyl ethylbenzyl ammonium chlorides. Wool blanketing, wool gabardine, and cotton sheeting materials were impregnated with {{the first of the}} above virucidal compounds, and the persistence of vaccinia virus on these fabrics was compared with the persistence of the agent on nonimpregnated fabrics of the same type held at 25 C in 35 and 78 % relative humidity. No virus could be recovered from the chemically treated fabrics at any time after virus exposure, whereas the virus persisted as long as 4 weeks on nonimpregnated materials. Viable vaccinia virus was also found to persist less than 1 day on a cotton fabric finished with a <b>wash-and-wear</b> modified triazone resin. Poliovirus persisted less than 5 days on this <b>wash-and-wear</b> fabric...|$|E
40|$|<b>Wash-and-wear</b> {{multilayer}} {{electronic circuitry}} {{can be constructed}} on fabric substrates, using conductive textiles and suitably packaged components. Fabrics are perhaps the first composite materials engineered by humanity; their evolution {{led to the development}} of the Jacquard loom, which itself {{led to the development of}} the modern computer. The development of fabric circuitry is a compelling closure of the cycle that points to a new class of textiles which interact with their users and their environments, while retaining the properties that made them the first ubiquitous "smart material". Fabrics are in several respects superior to existing flexible substrates in terms of their durability, conformability, and breathability. The present work adopts a modular approach to circuit fabrication, from which follow circuit design techniques and component packages optimized for use in fabric-based circuitry, flexible all-fabric interconnects, and multilayer circuits. While maintaining close compatibility with existing components, tools, and techniques, the present work demonstrates all steps of a process to create multilayer printed circuits on fabric substrates using conductive textiles. by E.

40|$|The {{persistence}} of Salmonella typhimurium (V- 31) on wool blanket, wool gabardine, cotton sheeting, cotton knit jersey, cotton terry cloth, and cotton <b>wash-and-wear</b> fabrics was studied. Three methods of exposure {{were employed to}} contaminate the fabrics: direct contact, aerosol, and a lyophilized mixture of bacteria and dust having a high content of textile fibers. After contamination, the fabrics were held in 35 or 78 % relative humidity at 25 C. The persistence time of S. typhimurium on fabrics held in 35 % relative humidity was substantially longer when the fabrics were contaminated by direct contact or by exposure to dust containing bacteria than when contaminated by exposure to aerosolized cultures. Viable bacterial populations persisted for 24 weeks at relatively high population densities on swatches of wool gabardine, cotton sheeting, cotton knit jersey, and cotton terry cloth exposed by direct contact and held in a humidity of 35 %. In 78 % humidity, bacterial populations persisted on the fabrics for relatively shorter periods of time regardless of the mode of contamination or fabric type. This organism retained its virulence for Swiss mice after being recovered from wool gabardine swatches held 8 weeks in humidities of 35 or 78 % and from cotton terry cloth swatches held 6 weeks in the same humidities...|$|E
