In a graphic passage, Douglass asked Auld how he <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> Douglass had come to take away his daughter Amanda as a slave, treating her the way he and members of his family had been treated by Auld.|$|E

Herb suggests SCDP’s competitive standing might be improved if they arrange an evening for him with Joan. Pete tells Joan about Herb's proposal. Shocked, she asks how Pete <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> someone asked that of his wife Trudy. He asks Joan how much it would take to convince her. She replies that he [...] "couldn't afford it".|$|E
500|$|By May 1846, {{troubled by}} the {{financial}} difficulties at Brook Farm, Ripley had made an informal split from the community. [...] By its closure a year later, Brook Farm had amassed a total debt of $17,445. Ripley was devastated at the failure of his experiment and told a friend, [...] "I can now understand how a man <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> he could attend his own funeral". His personal life was also taxed. His wife had converted to Catholicism in 1846, encouraged by Orestes Brownson, and had become doubtful of his Associationist politics; the Ripleys' relationship became strained by the 1850s.|$|E

500|$|The sisters meet in {{the living}} room and discuss how they <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> each of their {{partners}} were– hypothetically– to leave for PETA training. Sri insults Supono's bravery, saying that he would never do it; Aminah feels the same about Mahmud. Ultimately the sisters decide to answer together, both expressing approval. Hearing this, Mahmud and Supono leave their hiding places and shout [...] "Live, Srikandi of Indonesia!" [...] The four are excited, and Sri and Supono prepare for a quick wedding. Aminah and Sri's parents, however, are frightened upon hearing that the men will join PETA.|$|E
500|$|Lasseter's {{intention}} with {{a sequel}} was {{to respect the}} original film and create that world again. The story originated with him wondering what a toy would find upsetting, how a toy <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> it were not played with by a child or, worse, a child growing out of a toy. Brannon suggested {{the idea of a}} yard sale where the collector recognizes Woody as a rare artifact. The concept of Woody as a collectible set came from the draft story of A Tin Toy Christmas, an original half-hour special pitched by Pixar to Disney in 1990. [...] The obsessive toy collector named Al McWhiggin, who had appeared in a draft of Toy Story but was later expunged, was inserted into the film. Lasseter claimed that Al was inspired by himself.|$|E
500|$|George Ripley, who {{had begun}} the experiment, made an {{unofficial}} break with Brook Farm in May 1846. Many others began to leave as well, though {{the dissolution of the}} farm was slow. As one Brook Farmer said, the slow decline of the community was like apple petals drifting slowly to the ground, making it seem [...] "dreamy and unreal". On November 5, 1846, Ripley's book collection, which had served as Brook Farm's library, was auctioned to help cover the association's debts. By the end, Brook Farm had a total debt of $17,445. Ripley told a friend, [...] "I can now understand how a man <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> he could attend his own funeral". He took a job with the New York Tribune and it took him 13 years to pay off the Brook Farm debt, which he did in 1862.|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} {{portion of the}} segment, Oliver urges viewers to refer to Donald Trump by the Trump family's ancestral name of [...] "Drumpf". Oliver pointed out earlier in the piece that Trump had {{repeatedly}} mocked Jewish-American comedian Jon Stewart by referring to him as [...] "Jonathan Leibowitz", the comedian's birth name. Oliver, an alumnus of Stewart's Daily Show, justified the [...] "Drumpf" [...] epithet by insisting that [...] " [...] {{should be proud of}} his heritage!", parodying Trump's mockery of Stewart in a May 2013 Twitter post that Trump later denied having written. Oliver opines that this name is much more reflective of Trump's true nature, and says that if viewers wanted to vote for [...] "the charismatic guy promising to make America great again", they should [...] "stop and take a moment to imagine how [...] <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> [...] just met a guy named Donald Drumpf".|$|E
500|$|The first verse of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] implores {{the object}} of the singer's desire to walk away, because her {{emotions}} are too overpowering and she feels love of unprecedented intensity. She fears that by allowing him to stay attached, she may [...] "lose control". Selena believes that her infatuation can lead to romantic love. She then sings [...] "I could fall in love (in love) with you" [...] before wondering how she <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> she were to touch him for the first time. The fear of being rejected and unloved leads her to keep her feelings to herself, and she begins to believe that her love is [...] "not right". She continues, [...] "and I guess I should try/ to do what I should do/ but I could fall in love/ fall in love with you". During the midpoint break, Selena sings in Spanish that she is always dreaming about him, imagining that he loves her. She sings the chorus twice before the song comes to an end without her ever having come to terms with her loved one.|$|E
500|$|Props {{specialist}} Ken Hawryliw {{claimed the}} biggest challenge in producing the episode was finding Christmas paper from the 1980s for the flashback sequences. Casting director Corrine Mays had difficulty finding an actress to play Dana Scully's 1976 self before executive producer Robert Goodwin {{came up with the}} idea of using Gillian Anderson's fourteen-year-old sister Zoë for the role. Gillian Anderson, while liking the finalized episode, believed that she never was able to capture the complex relationship between herself and Emily, stating: [...] "I felt in the end that I was a little low energy, a little too melancholy. It was hard to find the right attitude for Scully in dealing with a child that's apparently hers; to find the right flavor of relationship to her and this disease she's going through, all mixed up with the aspect of the paranormal." [...] Anderson also admitted that another issue she had was that [...] "she had no history with this child" [...] so she was unable to [...] "play the kind of attachment I <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> my own daughter, Piper, were going through the same thing.|$|E

The Chairman of Oracle Corporation, Larry Ellison, staunchly defended his company's hiring of an East Coast detective agency to investigate groups that supported rival Microsoft Corporation during its antitrust trial, calling the snooping a [...] "public service". The investigation reportedly included a $1,200 offer to janitors at the Association for Competitive Technology to look through Microsoft's trash. When asked how he <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> others were looking into Oracle's business activities, Ellison said: [...] "We will ship our garbage to Redmond, and they can go through it.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, author Meyer Levin, a University of Chicago classmate, {{requested}} Leopold's cooperation in {{writing a novel}} based on the Franks murder. Leopold responded {{that he did not}} wish his story told in fictionalized form, but offered Levin a chance to contribute to his own memoir, which was in progress. [...] Levin, unhappy with that suggestion, went ahead with his book alone, despite Leopold's express objections. [...] The novel, entitled Compulsion, was published in 1956. [...] Levin portrayed Leopold (under the pseudonym Judd Steiner) as a brilliant but deeply disturbed teenager, psychologically driven to kill because of his troubled childhood and an obsession with Loeb. Leopold later wrote that reading Levin's book made him [...] "... physically sick ... More than once I had to lay the book down and wait for the nausea to subside.

2500|$|The dissension between Franck's {{family and}} his circle of {{students}} reached a new height when Franck published Psyché (written 1886–88), a symphonic poem based on the Greek myth. [...] The controversy (not confined to Franck's immediate acquaintances) was not over the music, but over the philosophical and religious implications of the text (based on a poetic sketch by a certain Sicard and Louis de Fourcaud). Franck's wife and son found the work too sensual, and wanted Franck to concentrate on music wider and more popular in appeal [...] "and altogether more commercial". [...] D'Indy, on the other hand, speaks of its mystical significance, saying that it has [...] "nothing of the pagan spirit about it, [...] [...] [...] but, on the contrary, is imbued with Christian grace and feeling [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] D'Indy's interpretation was subsequently described as revealing [...] "some embarrassment, such as a newly timid Sunday-school teacher <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> abruptly called on to acquaint riotous adolescents with The Song of Solomon." ...|$|E
2500|$|In reality, Smith was {{discontent with}} only a few colonists who acted this way; he [...] "claimed the early colonists were heroes. His primary purpose in writing The Generall Historie...was to eternalise 'the memory of those that effected' the {{settlement}} of Virginia". Smith {{goes so far as to}} compare the colonists to Adam and Eve in A Description of New England (1616). Just as Adam and Eve spread productivity throughout the world, so the colonists created life in the Virginia colony. Smith essentially sympathized with gentlemen; he knew that it was not their fault that they were useless and that this trait was merely a product of the imposed standards of English society. He recognized that [...] "they were imprisoned by their own self-imposed limitations. What they could and could not do was decided by their awareness of traditional roles and by the shame that they <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> others saw them engaged in physical work". Lemay suggests that, as a result of Smith's strict rules and the emigration to America, these men could shed these roles and create new lives for themselves in which they could celebrate the products of their labours and not feel humiliated.|$|E
