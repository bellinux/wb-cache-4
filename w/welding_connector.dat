40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to assess if {{traditionally}} used <b>welded</b> <b>connectors</b> for joining the two skins of reinforced concrete (RC) sandwich panels, used as structural walls and horizontal structural elements, can be substituted with bent ones. In this way, {{the scope of the}} effort is to reduce drastically the energy required during manufacturing, thus having a much more sustainable building product. Wire mesh on site production, in fact, requires a large amount of energy for the welding process, as stated by several Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). In addition, the production of sandwich panels with bent connectors requires a low level of automation and no qualified labor allowing the diffusion in developing countries. The procedures used to execute the work were both experimental and numerical. Structural performances were examined by testing full-scale sandwich panels under (axial and eccentric) compression and flexural loads. Additionally, a Finite Element (FE) study was developed to investigate and to optimize the dimension of welded mesh and the number of connectors. The major findings show {{that it is possible to}} substitute <b>welded</b> <b>connectors</b> with bent ones without compromising the structural performance of the tested RC sandwich panels, thus having a more sustainable way for producing these last ones...|$|R
40|$|Resistance Spot Welding (RSW) of {{multiple}} sheets with multiple materials are increasingly {{realized in the}} automotive industry. The mechanical strength of such new generation of spot welded assemblies is not that much dealt with. This is true in particular for experiments dedicated to investigate the mechanical strength of spot weld made by multi sheets of different grades, and their macro modeling in structural computations. Indeed, the most published studies are limited to two sheet assemblies. Therefore, {{in the first part}} of this work an advanced experimental set-up with a reduced mass is proposed to characterize the quasi-static and dynamic mechanical behavior and rupture of spot weld made by several sheets of different grades. The proposed device is based on Arcan test, the plates contribution in the global response is, thus, reduced. Loading modes I/II are, therefore, combined and well controlled. In the second part a simplified spot <b>weld</b> <b>connector</b> element (macroscopic modeling) is proposed to describe the nonlinear response and rupture of this new generation of spot welded assemblies. The <b>weld</b> <b>connector</b> model involves several parameters to be set.

40|$|Tests were {{performed}} on precast wall panels with typical loose-plate connectors located in the vertical joint between panels. The tests {{were performed}} to investigate {{the performance of the}} connectors under simulated seismic loads. In-plane lateral cyclic loads were applied to the wall panels, which applied tension-shear and compression-shear forces to the loose-plate connectors. The paper describes the experimental program and results for the welded plate connections in ten precast concrete wall panel assemblies. Design assumptions and simplified design models are also examined. The research shows that the connection possesses little ductile capacity and, therefore, is not suitable for use in high seismic regions (Zones 3 and 4). However, based on the observed failure modes, minor modifications to the connection are suggested that will increase the ductility of the connection. This paper addresses the behavior of a specific loose-plate <b>welded</b> <b>connector</b> under applied cyclic loading. This type of connection is widely used in the United States. Due to the limited number of tests performed, no specific design parameters were considered in this study. The objectives of this investigation were to: (a) Quantify the performance of the connection in terms of force-deflection and ductility.

40|$|Producing steel causes 6 % {{of global}} {{anthropogenic}} carbon dioxide emissions. Experts recommend that these emissions are {{reduced by half}} by the year 2050 in order to avert the worst consequences of climate change. Demand for steel is predicted to double in the next 36 years, meaning that a 75 % reduction in emissions per unit of steel produced is necessary to reach the recommended limit. Process efficiency improvements cannot deliver this magnitude of reduction; however if steel is used more efficiently so that less new material is required to deliver the same service - a concept termed 'material efficiency' - then this could allow demand to be satisfied whilst emissions targets are achieved. Construction is the single largest use of steel globally, therefore using steel more efficiently in construction will reduce emissions. Three material efficiency strategies are identified as having most potential for this industry: using less material, using products for longer, and reusing components. In order to prioritise areas for research, steel flows into construction are mapped, finding that industrial buildings and utility infrastructure are the largest users of steel, while superstructure is confirmed as the main use of steel in a typical building. To estimate the potential to use less steel in buildings, 23 steel-frame designs are studied, sourced from three leading design consultancies. The utilisation of each element is found and the building datasets are analysed to infer the amount of steel over-provided. The results suggest that such buildings contain almost twice as much steel as necessary for structural performance, and indicate that this amount of over-provision occurs to minimise labour costs, which are {{a larger proportion of}} total costs than materials. To investigate how buildings and infrastructure could be used for longer, reasons for their failure are reviewed. Based on interviews with industry professionals a set of strategies is proposed, tailored to each failure cause and distinguishing between cases where failure can and cannot be reasonably foreseen. Steel sections could be reclaimed from old buildings and reused in new buildings but this does not occur because they are damaged during demolition. Designing for deconstruction would facilitate reuse but is not practised due to its cost. Data from interviews and a commercial working group are analysed to identify three aspects of designing for deconstruction that provide financial and operational benefits to clients, thus encouraging their use. One remaining technical barrier to deconstruction is composite steel-concrete systems, where <b>welded</b> <b>connectors</b> make it impractical to separate the steel beam from the concrete slab without damage. A novel bolted composite connector is proposed and tested in three beam experiments. The bolted connector allows successful separation of the components, facilitating reuse. Its structural performance {{is similar to that of}} <b>welded</b> <b>connectors</b> and can be predicted using current design standards. Each of the investigations reveals significant opportunities to reduce steel use in construction by using material more efficiently. Achieving these savings would reduce demand for new steel production and thereby decrease carbon dioxide emissions.

In the presence of profiled sheeting in a composite beam, the resistance of stud connectors to static shear is influenced by the geometry of the ribs and the position of the studs within them.

The reason, revealed by 16 new push-out tests with transverse sheeting and 18 with parallel sheeting, is that the existing methods do not distinguish between the various failure modes. New conceptual and mathematical models are developed with respect to the different failure modes. For transverse sheeting, up to nine parameters are involved, among which five are shown by statistic analyses to have negligible influence.

Composite action between the conventional concrete slab and steel beam is provided typically by stud shear <b>connectors</b> <b>welded</b> to the top flange of the steel beam, and the demolition of such members requires {{a considerable amount of}} time and energy, as well as being environmentally intrusive and creating much waste. In addition, existing composite systems mostly utilise conventional concrete made from ordinary Portland cement whose production is attributed to a large portion of carbon emissions worldwide. As an alternative, it is proposed that precast concrete slabs be attached to a steel frame with semi-rigid bolted connections using high-strength friction grip bolts as the elements to provide the shear connection. Moreover, the use of geopolymer concrete in the casting of the slabs eliminates the use of ordinary Portland cement entirely.

40|$|International audienceSteel-concrete {{composite}} beam {{is an alternative}} to reduce the construction time and material costs compared to a conventional reinforced or prestressed concrete one when aiming to reach a large span and limiting {{the height of the}} cross-section. Composite beam consisting of a concrete beam cased in a U-shaped steel beam has been recently reported in the literature. Such {{composite beam}} is cost effective if a thin-walled steel section is used, leading to some difficulties in <b>welding</b> shear stud <b>connectors.</b> Another shear connector devices have to be used. It is worth mentioning that during concrete encasement, the upper flanges of the U-section have to be linked in order to preserve the shape of the steel cross-section. It is then proposed here to use the linking element as a shear connector. This new type of shear connection is not covered in present norms of composite structures and it requires an investigation on its behavior and on force transfer mechanisms. The experimental investigation of the behavior of these shear connectors through asymmetrical push-out tests is presented in this paper. Two different cross-sections of shear connectors were considered. A finite element model has been developed in order to identify the stress behavior of shear connectors and the surrounding concrete. A good agreement of FEA results and experimental data is obtained. Based on the FEA results, an analytical design formula for shear connectors is proposed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} self-manufacturing cost estimation, cost optimization {{and competitiveness}} of different composite floor systems: composite I beams, composite trusses produced from rolled channel sections and composite trusses made from cold formed hollow sections. Part 1 of this two-part series of papers presents {{the estimation of}} the self-manufacturing (direct production) costs for composite and steel structures. The self-manufacturing costs are proposed to {{be defined as the}} sum of the material, the power consumption and the labour costs. The material costs of the structural steel, concrete, reinforcement, the shear connectors, electrodes, the anti-corrosion, fire protection and top coat painting, the formwork floor-slab panels and gas consumption are presented in detail. The power consumption costs comprise costs of sawing the steel sections, edge grinding, drilling, welding, stud welding and vibrating the concrete. The labour costs (times) presented define the costs of metal cutting, edge grinding, preparation, assembling and tacking, welding, <b>welding</b> of shear <b>connectors,</b> steel surface preparation and protection, drilling, cutting, placing and connecting the reinforcement, concreting, consolidating and curing the concrete. New approximation functions are proposed for the calculation of some manufacturing times and material consumptions. As the discussed costs vary significantly around the world, the proposed cost expressions are given in the open form to be used for cost estimation in different economic conditions. A numerical example of the estimation of the self-manufacturing costs for a composite I beam floor system shows the suitability of the proposed approach. On the basis of the defined self-manufacturing costs, introduced in Part 1, the cost optimization and the competitiveness of different composite floor systems are discussed in Part 2...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{composite}} beam in buildings has {{known to be}} more economical compared to bare steel beams with hot-rolled steel section, as the composite action between steel and concrete results in significant savings in steel weight and reduce the beam depth. However, the use of {{composite beam}} with cold-formed steel of lipped C-channel {{is yet to be}} established as the structural behavior of such beam is not well understood. This study presents and discusses the behavior of composite beam with cold formed steel section and innovative shear connectors. The composite beam comprises two cold formed steel of lipped C-sections oriented back to back to form I-steel beam and perpendicular metal decking concrete slab. Three types of bracket shear connectors namely single bracket (SBSC), double bracket (DBSC) and hot rolled plate (HPSC) shear connectors were developed and used; the proposed shear connectors were fixed to the web of steel beam by bolts. In addition, headed stud (HSSC) shear <b>connector</b> <b>welded</b> to the top flange of cold formed steel beam was also investigated. Push tests in accordance with Eurocode 4 were carried out to determine the strength capacity and ductility of the proposed shear connectors. Sequentially, full-scale beam tests were conducted to investigate the actual behavior of the composite beam with the proposed shear connectors. The length of full-scale specimen between supports is 4000 mm. Theoretical validation for the experimental results was performed based on the plastic analysis of composite beam. The experimental results of push tests showed very good strength with extreme deformation capacity for all bracket shear connectors suggesting that they are strong and ductile enough to provide composite action between steel beam and concrete slab. Also, it was observed that strength capacity of shear connector increases as the thickness of steel beam increases. For headed stud shear connectors, the stud possess strength capacity as high as its predicted strength. The results of full-scale beam tests showed very good agreement as compared to theoretical values that predicted based on push test results. The bending resistance and stiffness of the composite beams were improved up to 170 % and 270 % respectively as compared to non-composite cold formed steel beam. Composite beam with HSSC shear connectors showed the best performance as compared to composite beams with SBSC, DBSC and HPSC shear connectors. Also, the results showed that the bending resistance of the composite beam increases as the thickness of steel beam increases. It is concluded that the proposed composite beams with cold formed steel section are strong enough to be used in small and medium size buildings...|$|R
