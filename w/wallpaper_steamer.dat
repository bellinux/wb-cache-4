50|$|The <b>wallpaper</b> <b>steamer</b> {{was invented}} by Peter Ravenscroft Wilkins from Blackwell, Worcestershire, England. Its European patent was filed 19 November 1987.|$|E
50|$|A {{commercial}} <b>wallpaper</b> <b>steamer</b> is a conveniently packaged {{source of}} steam. This {{can be used}} for other purposes too, such as steam-bending wood.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wallpaper</b> <b>steamer</b> is an {{electrical}} device which boils water continuously {{in order to}} produce steam. This steam is then allowed to pass through a narrow bore tube to a face plate. This face plate is then held against a wallpapered wall. The steam passes through the paper, saturates the backing paper and partially dissolves the desiccated wallpaper paste. This then allows the wallpaper to be pulled from, or scraped off the wall.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wallpaper</b> <b>steamers</b> {{have been}} more popular in countries, such as the UK or Europe, using 230V {{domestic}} electricity. This provides around 3kW of steam generating capacity from all sockets around the house.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method of}} removal {{is to apply}} steam to {{wallpaper}} in order to dissolve the wallpaper paste.A <b>wallpaper</b> <b>steamer</b> consists of a reservoir of water, an electric heating element, and a hose to direct the steam at the wallpaper. The steam dissolves the wallpaper paste, allowing the wallpaper to be peeled off. However, {{care must be taken}} to prevent damage to the drywall underneath. Sometimes steaming can lead to the crumbling of underlying drywall or plaster, leaving an uneven surface to be repaired.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic form}} of a <b>wallpaper</b> <b>steamer</b> is a {{semi-sealed}} container, usually made of plastic, that contains a heating element. A quantity of water {{is added to the}} container and the water comes into contact with the heating element. Once electrical power is connected to the element, it heats up which then in turn heats the water. The water reaches its boiling point, evaporates and produces steam. As the container is sealed, the steam pressure builds up but is released via a small opening in the container to which is connected a length of pressure pipe. At the end of the pressure pipe is a flat plate about 30 cm square and 1 cm deep. The plate has a handle on its reverse side. This plate is then held up to the papered wall. The steam being released under pressure from the container travels along the pressure pipe and is released into the forward face of the steam plate. As the plate is held against the wall, a slight seal is maintained which holds steam long enough to force the moisture into the wallpaper, saturating it and rehydrating the wallpaper paste. Once the paste is rehydrated, it starts to lose its adhesive properties, allowing the wallpaper to be either pulled or scraped from the wall.|$|E
