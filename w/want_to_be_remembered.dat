500|$|Chaplin felt The Gold Rush was {{the best}} film he had made to that point. It opened in August 1925 {{and became one of}} the highest-grossing films of the silent era with a profit of $5 million. The comedy {{contains}} some of Chaplin's most famous sequences, such as the Tramp eating his shoe and the [...] "Dance of the Rolls". Macnab has called it [...] "the quintessential Chaplin film".

500|$|However, Milk's {{assassination}} {{has become}} entwined with his political efficacy, {{partly because he}} was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, [...] "No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death." [...] His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk's success, murder, and the inevitable injustice of White's verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk's life was [...] "a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America". According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend {{has been unable to}} be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: [...] "The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him {{a great deal of the}} Castro's optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one." [...] On the 20th anniversary of Milk's death, historian John D'Emilio said, [...] "The legacy that I think he would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> for is the imperative to live one's life at all times with integrity." [...] For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: [...] "His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process." ...|$|E

The ingredients are all the same: stature, presence, personality, style and an immense belief in the God-given talents." ...|$|E

6000|$|It was not {{surprising}} Gilbert Osmond should not have taken comfort in Miss Stackpole; his instinct had naturally set him in opposition to a young lady capable of advising his wife {{to withdraw from the}} conjugal roof. When she arrived in Rome he had said to Isabel that he hoped she would leave her friend the interviewer alone; and Isabel had answered that he at least had nothing to fear from her. She said to Henrietta that as Osmond didn't like her she couldn't invite her to dine, but they could easily see each other in other ways. Isabel received Miss Stackpole freely in her own sitting-room, and took her repeatedly to drive, face to face with Pansy, who, bending a little forward, on the opposite seat of the carriage, gazed at the celebrated authoress with a respectful attention which Henrietta occasionally found irritating. She complained to Isabel that Miss Osmond had a little look as if she should remember everything one said. [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that way," [...] Miss Stackpole declared; [...] "I consider that my conversation refers only to the moment, like the morning papers. Your stepdaughter, as she sits there, looks as if she kept all the back numbers and would bring them out some day against me." [...] She could not teach herself to think favourably of Pansy, whose absence of initiative, of conversation, of personal claims, seemed to her, in a girl of twenty, unnatural and even uncanny. Isabel presently saw that Osmond would have liked her to urge a little the cause of her friend, insist a little upon his receiving her, so that he might appear to suffer for good manners' sake. Her immediate acceptance of his objections put him too much in the wrong--it being in effect one of the disadvantages of expressing contempt that you cannot enjoy {{at the same time the}} credit of expressing sympathy. Osmond held to his credit, and yet he held to his objections--all of which were elements difficult to reconcile. The right thing would have been that Miss Stackpole should come to dine at Palazzo Roccanera once or twice, so that (in spite of his superficial civility, always so great) she might judge for herself how little pleasure it gave him. From the moment, however, that both the ladies were so unaccommodating, there was nothing for Osmond but to wish the lady from New York would take herself off. It was surprising how little satisfaction he got from his wife's friends; he took occasion to call Isabel's attention to it.|$|E
