5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process remained more encouraging, although it too had technical obstacles to overcome. By the end of 1943, Urey had over 700 people <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> on {{gaseous diffusion}}. The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive uranium hexafluoride diffused through gaseous barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage. A major problem was finding proper seals for the pumps, but by far the greatest difficulty lay in constructing an appropriate diffusion barrier. Construction of the huge K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was well under way before a suitable barrier became available in quantity in 1944. As a backup, Urey championed thermal diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Sun is at a party, and {{is served}} {{champagne}} by a waiter, Jin. They soon develop a relationship, with Sun wanting {{to run away}} with Jin to America, but Jin insisting they honorably tell her father that they are seeing each other.

Sun is angry that he refuses to explain the blood to her and slaps him. He tells Sun that he does whatever her father tells him to do. A few years later, Sun secretly plots to leave Jin and her father, so she will be free to go wherever she wants. However, she does not go through with her plans after he expresses a loving gesture to her, and boards Flight 815 with her husband.|$|E
5|$|As {{director}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Oppenheimer was no longer answerable to Compton, but reported directly to Groves. He {{was responsible for the}} technical and scientific aspects of Project Y. He assembled the nucleus of his staff from the groups that had been <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> on neutron calculations. These included his secretary, Priscilla Greene, Serber and McMillan from his own group, and Emilio Segrè and Joseph W. Kennedy's groups from the University of California, J. H. Williams' group from the University of Minnesota, Joe McKibben's group from the University of Wisconsin, Felix Bloch's group from Stanford University and Marshall Holloway's from Purdue University. He also secured the services of Hans Bethe and Robert Bacher from the Radiation Laboratory at MIT, Edward Teller, Robert F. Christy, Darol K. Froman, Alvin C. Graves and John H. Manley and his group from the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, and Robert R. Wilson and his group, which included Richard Feynman, that had been performing Manhattan Project research at Princeton University. They brought with them a great deal of valuable scientific equipment. Wilson's group dismantled the cyclotron at Harvard University and had it shipped to Los Alamos; McKibben's brought two Van de Graaff generators from Wisconsin; and Manley's brought the Cockcroft–Walton accelerator from the University of Illinois.|$|E

25|$|Judge Cal {{was head}} of the Special Judicial Squad (SJS), the feared Internal Affairs unit of judges {{responsible}} for weeding out corruption in the Mega-City One Justice Department.

25|$|In 1932, Ole Kirk's shop {{started making}} wooden toys such as piggy banks, pull toys, {{cars and trucks}} and houses. The {{business}} was not profitable because of the Great Depression. Farmers in the area sometimes traded food {{in exchange for his}} toys; Ole Kirk continued producing practical furniture in addition to toys to stay in business. In the mid-1930s, the yo-yo toy fad gave him a brief period of increased activity until it suddenly collapsed. To reduce waste, Ole Kirk used the leftover yo-yo parts as wheels for toy trucks. His son Godtfred began <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> taking {{an active role in the}} company.|$|E

Johnson had some 60 slaves <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> making him the largest slaveholder in the county and likely in the province, comparable to major planters of the South. In 1766, Johnson organised St. Patrick's Lodge, No. 4, a Freemason lodge, at Johnson Hall, and was installed as its master. His nephew Guy Johnson succeeded him as master of this lodge in 1770.|$|E
25|$|Eduard Pernkopf (November 24, 1888 – April 17, 1955) was an Austrian {{professor}} of anatomy who later served as rector of the University of Vienna, his alma mater. He {{is best known}} for his seven-volume anatomical atlas, Topographische Anatomie des Menschen (translated as Atlas of Topographical and Applied Human Anatomy; often colloquially known as the Pernkopf atlas or just Pernkopf), prepared by Pernkopf and four artists over a 20-year period. While it is considered a scientific and artistic masterpiece, with many of its color plates reprinted in other publications and textbooks, it has been in recent years dogged by questions about whether Pernkopf and the artists <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> all of them ardent Nazis, used concentration camp inmates or condemned political prisoners as their subjects.|$|E

5000|$|Barnette {{opened a}} trading {{post on the}} Chena River after Pedro had {{told him he had}} made some good [...] "prospects." [...] On July 22, 1902, Pedro {{discovered}} gold north of Fairbanks in Interior Alaska which triggered the beginning of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, which set off a stampede that transformed the town. Barnette dispatched Jujiro Wada, a Japanese immigrant from Ehime on Shikoku Island, to Dawson City to spread the word that gold had been found in order for Barnette to create a market for his goods. After Wada spread the word about the gold being discovered, many miners who had not already left for the Nome Gold Rush traveled to Fairbanks. The prospectors soon found jobs <b>working</b> <b>for</b> Barnette—prospecting <b>for</b> <b>him</b> by panning and sluicing for gold in Fairbanks.|$|R
