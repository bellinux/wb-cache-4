For example, there are no wolves in Iceland, but <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that Icelandic poets {{were familiar with the}} species. Similarly, the apocalyptic descriptions of Völuspá have been taken as evidence that the poet who composed it had seen a volcanic eruption in Iceland - but this is hardly certain.|$|E

In this article, we subject this perception to a rigorous empirical test using data on 55 major cities in 49 Asian and African countries for the period 1961 - 2010. It is found that only exceptionally high spikes in food prices trigger of protests, in particular the food price increases taking place in 1973 and 2008. In other years there is no evidence in support for the link between food prices and social unrest. status: publishe...|$|R
