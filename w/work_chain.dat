In this context risk mitigation on the basis of wellimplemented early warning systems is inevitable to reduce human losses and {{to pave the way for}} specific measures on disaster recovery. A possible <b>work</b> <b>chain</b> to assess this complex objective is exemplified by the interdisciplinary “Last-Mile Evacuation project” which focused on the city of Padang, Indonesia. This city is one of the cities worldwide most imperiled by tsunamis since it is located in the direct neighborhood to the Sunda arc with an average warning time below 30 minutes. The <b>work</b> <b>chain</b> presented in the present paper comprises the generation and compilation of the underlying geo data basis, the simulation of hydrodynamics, the assessment of physical vulnerability using remote sensing data and techniques, the assessment of social vulnerability related with people´s exposure, risk perception, and evacuation behavior, and the modeling of potential evacuation routes. While the main focus of the original project was on city-wide risk assessment, the focal point of this study is a close-up view of the micro-scale dynamics of inundation and evacuation on urban district level. The existing situation and urban setting is subsequently compared with alternative shelter options. Additionally, qualitative information on social aspects to be considered in developing appropriate mitigation options is outlined. It is anticipated to communicate best-practice knowledge on how to approach the assessment of tsunami hazard with potential overlapping areas to other natural disasters...|$|E

In line with the objectives of the research, so this research use approach or the form of research is qualitative research with descriptive method, Strategy used is single driven strategy. Sampling technique used is snow ball sampling. The sources of data are informer, place and event and document. Data collecting technique used is interview, observation, and documentation analysis. Triangulation data or triangulation is used for legalizing data. While data analysis used is interactive analysis. Based on the result of the research, it can be concluded that: (1) Administration office room of dean of FKIP UNS has not yet shortest distance principle in room arrangement. This is showed by archive cabinet placement and filling cabinet which is far from the seat of staff so that they have to walk when they will take a file, document or archive which is needed at the moment of work. By placing archive cabinet and filling cabinet which is far from make the wasting time and energy, so that the work efficiency can not be room arrangement of dean of FKIP UNS has applied principle of <b>work</b> <b>chain,</b> because all of rooms have been arranged according to the flow of work procedure of each departments.

40|$|Abstract. Data mining {{consists}} of transformation of information {{with a variety}} of algorithms to discover the underlying dependencies. The information is passed through a chain of algorithms and usually not stored until it has {{reached the end of the}} chain, which may result in a number of difficulties. This paper presents a method for better management and implementation of the data mining process and reports a case study of the method applied to the pre-processing of spot welding data. The developed approach, called ‘truly stepwise data mining’, enables more systematic processing of data. It verifies the correctness of the data, allows easier application of a variety of algorithms to the data, manages the <b>work</b> <b>chain,</b> and differentiates between the data mining tasks. The method is based on storage of the data between the main phases of the data mining process. The different layers of the storage medium are defined on the basis of the type of algorithms applied to the data. The layers defined in this research consist of raw data, pre-processed data, features, and models. In conclusion, we present a systematic, easy-to-apply method for implementing and managing the work flow of the data mining process. A case study of applying the method to a resistance spot welding quality estimation project is presented to illustrate the superior performance of the method compared to the currently used approach. Key words: hierarchical data storage, work flow management, data mining work flow implementation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Atom probe {{tomography}} (APT) is {{a valuable}} near-atomic scale imaging technique, which yields mass spectrographic data. Experimental correctness can often pivot on the identification of peaks within a dataset, this is a manual process where subjectivity and errors can arise. The limitations of manual procedures complicate APT experiments for the operator and furthermore are a barrier to technique standardisation. In this work we explore the capabilities of computer-guided ranging to aid identification and analysis of mass spectra. We propose a fully robust algorithm for enumeration of the possible identities of detected peak positions, which assists labelling. Furthermore, a simple ranking scheme is developed to allow for evaluation of the likelihood of each possible identity being the likely assignment from the enumerated set. We demonstrate a simple, yet complete work-chain that allows for the conversion of mass-spectra to fully identified APT spectra, {{with the goal of}} minimising identification errors, and the inter-operator variance within APT experiments. This <b>work</b> <b>chain</b> is compared to current procedures via experimental trials with different APT operators, to determine the relative effectiveness and precision of the two approaches. It is found that there is little loss of precision (and occasionally gain) when participants are given computer assistance. We find that in either case, inter-operator precision for ranging varies between 0 and 2 "significant figures" (2 σ confidence in the first n digits of the reported value) when reporting compositions. Intra-operator precision is weakly tested and found to vary between 1 and 3 significant figures, depending upon species composition levels. Finally it is suggested that inconsistencies in inter-operator peak labelling may be the largest source of scatter when reporting composition data in APT...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{information}} age {{is characterized by}} ever-growing amounts of data surrounding us. By reproducing this data into usable knowledge we can start moving toward the knowledge age. Data mining is the science of transforming measurable information into usable knowledge. During the data mining process, the measurements pass through a chain of sophisticated transformations in order to acquire knowledge. Furthermore, in some applications the results are implemented as software solutions {{so that they can}} be continuously utilized. It is evident that the quality and amount of the knowledge formed is highly dependent on the transformations and the process applied. This thesis presents an application independent concept that can be used for managing the data mining process and implementing the acquired results as software applications. The developed concept is divided into two parts – solution formation and solution implementation. The first part presents a systematic way for finding a data mining solution from a set of measurement data. The developed approach allows for easier application of a variety of algorithms to the data, manages the <b>work</b> <b>chain,</b> and differentiates between the data mining tasks. The method is based on storage of the data between the main stages of the data mining process, where the different stages of the process are defined on the basis of the type of algorithms applied to the data. The efficiency of the process is demonstrated with a case study presenting new solutions for resistance spot welding quality control. The second part of the concept presents a component-based data mining application framework, called Smart Archive, designed for implementing the solution. The framework provides functionality that is common to most data mining applications and is especially suitable for implementing applications that process continuously acquired measurements. The work also proposes an efficient algorithm for utilizing cumulative measurement data in the history component of the framework. Using the framework, it is possible to build high-quality data mining applications with shorter development times by configuring the framework to process application-specific data. The efficiency of the framework is illustrated using a case study presenting the results and implementation principles of an application developed for predicting steel slab temperatures in a hot strip mill. In conclusion, this thesis presents a concept that proposes solutions for two fundamental issues of data mining, the creation of a working data mining solution from a set of measurement data and the implementation of it as a stand-alone application...|$|E
