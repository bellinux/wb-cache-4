500|$|Early in the 2007 playoffs, Selänne became Anaheim's all-time leading playoff scorer when he {{recorded}} his 30th point as a Duck with an assist on April 13 against the Minnesota Wild. The Ducks defeated the Wild, Vancouver Canucks and Detroit Red Wings {{to reach the}} Final; {{it was the first}} time in Selänne's career that he played in the NHL's championship series. As the sentimental favourite to win the Stanley Cup, his teammates motivated themselves to win the title for his benefit; Ducks goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère noted, [...] "We don't have any better teammate. He's a guy who always has fun. He deserves this and if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> him along the way, that would be great. I'd just love to see Teemu win this thing." [...] Selänne finished the playoffs with 15 points in 21 games, and after 14 NHL seasons, the 36-year-old Selänne raised the Stanley Cup with his teammates after defeating the Ottawa Senators in five games.|$|E
500|$|In 1918, while {{teaching}} in Geneva, Szigeti met {{and fell in}} love with Wanda Ostrowska. She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married, but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe, many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path. The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska's family, and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental consent, with the permission only of Ostrowska's sister and the headmistress of the finishing school. Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple's hopes, but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry. Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the critical moment: Let us not, if we can avoid it, fall victim to the dead letter of the law. I don't want to postpone the happiness of these two youngsters if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it. All laws have been twisted and tortured out of semblance of law, what with war and revolutions. For once let's twist and turn one for a good cause, yes? ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was during}} this time, {{the heyday of the}} French Revolution, that Barbauld {{published}} her most radical political pieces. From 1787 to 1790, Charles James Fox attempted to convince the House of Commons to pass a law granting Dissenters full citizenship rights. When this bill was defeated for the third time, Barbauld wrote one of her most passionate pamphlets, An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts. Readers were shocked to discover that such a well-reasoned argument should come from a woman. In 1791, after William Wilberforce's attempt to outlaw the slave trade failed, Barbauld published her Epistle to William Wilberforce Esq. On the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade, which not only lamented the fate of the slaves, but also warned of the cultural and social degeneration the British could expect if they did not abandon slavery. In 1792, she continued this theme of national responsibility in an anti-war sermon entitled Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation which argued that each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation: [...] "We are called upon to repent of national sins, because <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> them, and because we ought to help them." ...|$|E

Their horoscopes did not match at first, but later {{it was found that the}} astrologer erred. Pranav has acted in a few films, debuting in Mohanlal's Onnaman (2001).

Following Cornell's death, his brother Peter started a campaign to raise awareness on depression and suicide prevention.

A few days later, Peter revealed {{that he was being}} bullied and threatened to change the narrative of this awareness message; [...] "Change the message or just drop it entirely. It has reached a point where my own mental health, my sobriety and the safety of my family are at risk. And this bullying is coming from a place I never could have imagined", he shared before telling that he would remove himself from social media and asking his followers to keep the conversation and break through this stigma.|$|E
