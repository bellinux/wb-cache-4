5|$|Clinton and Obama {{forged a}} good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president. Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>or</b> Pentagon. Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.|$|E

These included the funerals for Presidents Harrison, J. Q. Adams, and Taylor; Senator Calhoun; First Ladies Dolley Madison and Louisa Adams; the victims of the USS Princeton disaster; and several other congressmen. Some of these processions were two miles long, led by military bands and troops for the funerals of military men, members of both houses of congress and the administration, and pall bearers carefully chosen for political balance to symbolize unity and stability in government.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, {{nineteen}} men hijacked four airliners all bound for California. Once the hijackers assumed control of the airliners, they told the passengers {{that they had a}} bomb on board and would spare the lives of passengers and crew once their demands were met – no passenger and crew actually suspected that they would use the airliners as suicide weapons since it had never happened before in history, and many previous hijacking attempts had been resolved with the passengers and crew escaping unharmed after obeying the hijackers. The hijackers – members of al-Qaeda's Hamburg cell – intentionally crashed two airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Both buildings collapsed within two hours from fire damage related to the crashes, destroying nearby buildings and damaging others. The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, just outside Washington D.C. The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington D.C., to target the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>or</b> the U.S. Capitol. None of the flights had any survivors. A total of 2,977 victims and the 19 hijackers perished in the attacks. Fifteen of the nineteen were citizens of Saudi Arabia, and the others were from the United Arab Emirates (2), Egypt, and Lebanon.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} attacks, there was {{speculation}} that Camp David was the intended target. According to testimony by captured al-Qaeda member Abu Zubaydah, U.S. officials believed the White House was the intended target. A post-9/11 interview with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and bin al-Shibh by Al Jazeera reporter Yosri Fouda revealed that Flight93 {{was heading for}} the Capitol. The 9/11 Commission Report cited {{the actions of the}} crew and passengers in preventing the destruction of either the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>or</b> the Capitol.

500|$|Soon {{after her}} success in Promises! Promises! Mansfield was chosen from many other actresses {{to replace the}} {{recently}} deceased Marilyn Monroe in Kiss Me, Stupid, a 1964 romantic comedy that would co-star Dean Martin. She turned down the role because of her pregnancy with daughter Mariska Hargitay, {{and was replaced by}} Kim Novak. That same year, Mansfield appeared in a salacious-for-its-time pinup book called [...] "Jayne Mansfield for President: the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>or</b> Bust," [...] which was promoted on billboards; the photographs were taken by commercial and fine art photographer David Attie. In 1966 Mansfield was cast in Single Room Furnished, directed by then-husband Matt Cimber. The film required Mansfield to portray three different characters, and was her first starring dramatic role in several years. It was briefly released in 1966, but did not enjoy a full release until 1968, almost a year after her death.|$|E
500|$|In February 1919, {{while still}} based in New York, Bryant went to Washington, D.C., to speak, along with Albert Rhys Williams, about the {{situation}} in Russia. She stayed in Washington long enough to participate in a National Woman's Party suffrage rally, during which she was arrested, arraigned, and sentenced to five days in jail. The specific charges against her and others, who had burned President Woodrow Wilson in effigy on the White House lawn, were [...] "building fires on government property, standing on the coping around the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>or</b> attempting to make disorderly speeches." [...] Among a group of women who refused bail, she spent at least three days in jail, during which she took part in a hunger strike. Upon her release, she insisted on testifying as an unfriendly witness before the Overman Committee, which had been set up to investigate Bolshevik activity in the United States. Deflecting questions about her religious beliefs, marriages, and other personal matters during her two days of testimony, she tried to convince the subcommittee, led by Senator Lee S. Overman, that Russia had a right to self-determination. Soon thereafter, she began a cross-country speaking tour, [...] "The Truth About Russia", arranged by Anna Louise Strong, during which she addressed large audiences in Detroit, Chicago, Spokane, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and other American cities. According to Gardner, Bryant was the first woman to defend Lenin and Trotsky at political gatherings across the United States. Gardner writes, [...] "Her message was simple, 'Hands off Russia!' 'Bring the boys home!'" ...|$|E
500|$|The White House is {{also said}} to be visited by three specters who did not live there. The first is that of David Burns, who owned the ground on which the White House stands before selling it to the federal {{government}} in May 1791, and whose spirit has been seen in Oval Office. A reporter told a security guard during the Truman administration that, while standing in the Yellow Oval Room, he heard a faint ghostly voice which said, [...] "I'm Mr. Burns." [...] The second spirit is allegedly that of a British soldier dressed in a uniform from the War of 1812 and carrying a torch. In August 1814, a combined British land and sea force captured Washington, D.C., and set fire to the White House, Treasury Building, Capitol, and other buildings in retaliation for the American looting of York, Upper Canada (now the city of Toronto) and the burning of the Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada after the Battle of York in 1813. The fires were put out only when a hurricane and tornado passed through Washington the following day, extinguishing the blazes. The soldier is claimed {{to be one of those}} who burned the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>or</b> who lost his life the following day in the storm. Another shade alleged to visit the White House is the ghost of Anna Surratt, daughter of convicted Lincoln assassination co-conspirator Mary Surratt, who forced her way into the White House the night before her mother's execution and unsuccessfully begged for her mother's life. It is claimed by some White House staff that Anna's ghost returns to the White House every July 6, silently banging on the front door to seek entrance and continue her futile pleas for her mother's life.|$|E

2500|$|The United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (NSWDG), {{commonly}} known as DEVGRU or SEAL Team Six, is the U.S. Navy component of the Joint Special Operations Command.

Most information concerning DEVGRU is classified, and details of its activities are not usually commented on by either the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>or</b> the Department of Defense. Despite the official name changes, [...] "SEAL Team Six" [...] remains the unit's widely recognized moniker. It is sometimes referred to in the U.S. media as a Special Mission Unit.|$|E

Adams moved into the White House in November 1800, living there for only the last four months of her husband's term. The city was wilderness, the President's House far from completion. She found the unfinished mansion in Washington [...] "habitable" [...] and the location [...] "beautiful"; but she complained that, despite the thick woods nearby, she could find no one willing to chop and haul firewood for the First Family.

2500|$|Democratic {{consultants}} and strategists also evaluated {{the importance and}} effectiveness of the speech. Stephanie Cutter—John Kerry's spokeswoman in the 2004 presidential campaign—suggested that [...] "no other person in this country, black or white, could have given a speech like that." [...] She called the speech [...] "incredibly honest and personal" [...] and argued that Obama [...] "changed {{the terms of the}} debate." [...] Donna Brazile—former manager of Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign—said that Obama {{was one of the few}} politicians who [...] "could weave not just their own personal history with American history but [...] themselves up as an example of the contradictions in this country." [...] According to Brazile, Obama had reclaimed the [...] "high road", but the question remained as to whether that road would [...] "lead to the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>or</b> back to the United States Senate." [...] Unaffiliated Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons called it [...] "an incredibly honest speech" [...] and [...] "a brave thing to do politically."

2500|$|Wilson {{ignored the}} protests for six months, but on June20,1917, as a Russian {{delegation}} {{drove up to}} the White House, suffragists unfurled a banner which stated: [...] "We women of America tell you that America is not a democracy. Twentymillion women are denied the right to vote. President Wilson is the chief opponent of their national enfranchisement". Another banner on August14,1917, referred to [...] "Kaiser Wilson" [...] and compared the plight of the German people with that of American women. With this manner of protest, the women were subject to arrests and many were jailed. Another ongoing tactic of the National Woman's Party was watchfires, which involved burning copies of President Wilson's speeches, often outside the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>or</b> in the nearby Lafayette Park. The Party continued to hold watchfires even as the war began, drawing criticism from the public and even other suffrage groups for being unpatriotic. On October17, Alice Paul was sentenced to seven months and on October30 began a hunger strike, but after a few days prison authorities began to force feed her. After years of opposition, Wilson changed his position in 1918 to advocate women's suffrage as a war measure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{divisions}} between Obama and Clinton that many observers had originally predicted, never happened. Indeed, {{a writer for}} The New York Times Magazine declared that [...] "Obama and Clinton have instead led the least discordant national-security team in decades, despite enormous challenges on almost every front." [...] In part, this was because Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. Nevertheless, there were limitations to her influence: Much of {{the handling of the}} Middle East, Iraq, and Iran was done by the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>or</b> Pentagon during her tenure, and on some other issues as well, policy-making was kept inside the White House among Obama's inner circle of advisors. There were also differences of opinion. Clinton failed to persuade Obama to arm and train Syrian rebels in 2012, but overcame initial opposition to gain approval of her visit to Burma in 2011. Clinton's initial idea of having special envoys under her handling key trouble spots fell apart due to various circumstances. Clinton did find bureaucratic success in edging out the U.S. Commerce Department, by having the State Department take a lead role in sales pitches in favor of U.S. companies. In doing so, she helped negotiate international deals for the likes of Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Westinghouse Electric Company. Clinton believed, more than most prior secretaries, that the commercial aspects of diplomacy and the promotion of international trade were vital to American foreign policy goals.|$|E
50|$|By September 1973, {{there was}} a sense that Nixon had regained some {{political}} strength, the American public had become burned out by the Watergate hearings, and that Congress was not willing to undertake impeachment absent some major revelation from the Nixon <b>White</b> <b>House</b> tapes <b>or</b> some major new action by the president against the investigation.|$|R
