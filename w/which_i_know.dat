25|$|I’m {{well aware}} that I {{sometimes}} “shoot from the hip” and speak on things about <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> very little. In this present situation, I published my personal opinions about drug addiction without knowing very much about the neuroscience behind addiction, or the addiction recovery field. Not only did I say some deeply regrettable and insensitive things, but as I’ve learned more about the questions and issues at hand, I accept that I have been wrongheaded {{on a number of}} topics related to these issues. Even at 84, I’m still learning. Please bear with me, folks.|$|E
500|$|Speaking at an April 2008 {{event in}} New York, Byrne {{confirmed}} {{the release of}} a new album, calling it a [...] "record of sung songs" [...] in contrast to the experimental music from MyLifeintheBushofGhosts and later told the NewYorkDailyNews that [...] "Brian had written a lot of music, but needed some words, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how to do. What's it sound like? Electronicgospel. That's all I'm saying." [...] Eno also explained the differences between this album and their previous one saying, [...] "his is quite different from MyLife in that the intention of that album was to not use our voices at all, but instead to find voices and stick them on to the music. This new one is different—these are songs written and sung by David... They go from electronic folkgospel to quite indefinable areas of music." ...|$|E
500|$|Wadia {{admitted}} to feeling [...] "emotionally drained" [...] after her scenes with Ace Bhatti. She explained to The People: [...] "It's very draining. I'm putting myself into this very dark place <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> sadly {{is a reality}} for so many women. Zainab's confidence has been steadily eroded. She's feeling isolated and has fallen under Yusef's control. He wants revenge. She is totally in his power. I had to show this can happen to any woman, no matter how strong she seems. Zainab was strong and not naive, but a woman is vulnerable if the man hits the right psychological weak spots. But both Ace and I have {{found it hard to}} do. I've known Ace {{for a long time and}} we're good friends. He has been wonderful to work with on this and very concerned about me all the way through." [...] Wadia has been given advice on the storyline from the Roshni refuge in Birmingham, which specializes in abuse within Asian families.|$|E

2500|$|When Lillian M. N. Stevens died {{of kidney}} failure on April 6, 1914, Gov. William Thomas Haines of Maine {{promptly}} reflected the public's response. [...] "I have ordered the flag at half staff {{in recognition of}} the respect in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> this great woman was held by all the people of Maine." [...] It is believed {{this was the first time}} the flag was so lowered for any woman in Maine.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, the Swedish media {{claimed that}} a secret stay-behind army had existed in neutral Finland with an exile base in Stockholm. Finnish Defence Minister Elisabeth Rehn called the revelations [...] "a fairy tale", adding {{cautiously}} [...] "or {{at least an}} incredible story, of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> nothing." [...] However, in his memoirs, former CIA director William Colby described the setting-up of stay-behind armies in Scandinavian countries, including Finland, {{with or without the}} assistance of local governments, to prepare for a Soviet invasion.|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2016 {{interview}} with The Ex-Man, despite an ongoing [...] "huge legal battle" [...] with Bell and Cazares, former bassist-guitarist Christian Olde Wolbers {{stated that he}} has been [...] "trying to reach out and try to get this reunion thing happening." [...] He added, [...] "There would be nothing better for this band [...] to reconcile our differences, fucking write a killer record, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> we can, and fucking we would be doing really big tours. My passion for playing and what we have invested in this band is very big, and I know it's really big for Dino as well, 'cause he started it with Raymond back in the day." [...] More fuel to the possibility of a reunion with the [...] "classic" [...] lineup of Bell, Cazares, Wolbers and Herrera was added later that month, when Wolbers posted an image on his Instagram account, suggesting Fear Factory's official website was [...] "under construction." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mitchell {{started singing}} {{with her friends}} at bonfires around Waskesiu Lake. Her first paid {{performance}} was on October 31, 1962, at a Saskatoon club that featured folk and jazz performers. At 18, she widened her repertoire to include her own personal favorites like Édith Piaf and Miles Davis. Though she never performed jazz herself in those days, {{she and her friends}} sought out gigs by jazz musicians. Mitchell said, [...] "My jazz background began with one of the early Lambert, Hendricks and Ross albums." [...] That album, The Hottest New Group in Jazz, was hard to find in Canada, she says. [...] "So I saved up and bought it at a bootleg price. I considered that album to be my Beatles. I learned every song off of it, and I don't think there is another album anywhere – including my own – on <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> every note and word of every song." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{comprehensive}} {{examination of the}} KLF's announcement and its context, Select called it [...] "the last grand gesture, the most heroic act of public self destruction {{in the history of}} pop. And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt." [...] Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that [...] "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that [...] "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it [...] "Conceptually and philosophically... absolutely brilliant". Mark Stent reported the doubts of many when he said that [...] "I [...] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over". [...] "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, [...] "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".|$|E
