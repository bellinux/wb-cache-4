5|$|The child <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> healthy, {{but with}} some of the {{behaviours}} of a pig. She would eat from a silver trough, and speak only in grunts or with a grunting sound to her speech. The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned about what would become of her after their death.

5|$|Later that evening, Jiminy and {{his parents}} {{convince}} a couple {{to give up some}} goods in exchange for a tonic that will supposedly make them immune to a plague. He soon discovers that his father switched Rumpelstiltskin's tonic with the one they sold, and finds that the couple have been turned into dolls. Even worse, he then discovers that the couple were the parents of the young boy he spoke to earlier. Having realized what he has done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer from The Blue Fairy, who shows up to give him his one true wish: becoming a cricket.

5|$|Riefenstahl fell in {{love with}} the arts in her childhood. She began to paint and write poetry at the age of four. She was also athletic, and at the age of twelve joined a {{gymnastics}} and swimming club. Her mother was confident her daughter <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> to be successful in the field of art and therefore gave her full support, unlike Riefenstahl's father, who was not interested in his daughter's artistic inclinations. In 1918, when she was 16, Riefenstahl attended a presentation of Snow White which interested her deeply; it led her to want to be a dancer. Her father instead wanted to provide his daughter with an education that could lead to a more dignified occupation. His wife, however, continued to support her daughter's passion. Without her father's knowledge, she enrolled Riefenstahl in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.|$|E

25|$|Related, yet {{different}} was {{the notion}} of male beauty. When a boy at young age {{turned out to be}} very handsome, he would be barred from heavy work, instead he would be pampered, his skin rubbed with oils, his hair meticulously taken care of, and so on. The idea was that in this way he <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> to such a beauty that he would be irresistible to chief's daughters. Then a child of high rank would be born into the family, elevating the status of all.|$|E
25|$|Xun Xu's father, Xun Xi (荀肸), died early, so Xun Xu {{was raised}} by Zhong Yao and his family, who were distantly related to him through his {{maternal}} uncle.

25|$|Druids {{also play}} a {{prominent}} role in Irish Folklore, generally serving lords and kings as high ranking priest-counselors with the gift of prophecy and other assorted mystical abilities - the best example of these possibly being Cathbad. The chief druid in the court of King Conchobar mac Nessa of Ulster, Cathbad features in several tales, most of which detail his ability to foretell the future. In the tale of Deirdre of the Sorrows – the foremost tragic heroine of the Ulster Cycle – the druid prophesied before the court of Conchobar that Deirdre <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> to be very beautiful, but that kings and lords would go to war over her, much blood would be shed because of her, and Ulster's three greatest warriors would be forced into exile for her sake. This prophecy, ignored by the king, came true.|$|E
25|$|Despite this inauspicious start, {{the married}} couple soon prospered, thanks mainly to Jacquetta's {{continuing}} prominence within the royal family. She retained her rank and dower as Duchess of Bedford, the latter initially providing {{an income of}} between £7000 and £8000 per year. Over the years, this income would diminish due to territorial losses in France and collapsing royal finances in England. Sir Richard was honoured with military ranks, in which he proved himself a capable soldier. Further honours for both came when Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou, whose uncle was Jacquetta's brother-in-law (Jacquetta's sister Isabelle married Margaret of Anjou's paternal uncle Charles du Maine). The Woodvilles were among those chosen to escort the bride to England, and the family benefited further through this double connection to the royal family. Sir Richard was raised {{to the rank of}} Baron Rivers in 1448. Their children therefore <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> enjoying considerable privilege and material comfort.|$|E
25|$|The young {{crown prince}} grew {{up having to}} live up to a prophecy at his birth, which claimed that he <b>would</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> to be a great warrior just like Minye Kyawswa. (According to the prophecy, Tabinshwehti was the reincarnation of a prince named Minye Kyawswa who was put to death by his father King Dhammazedi of Hanthawaddy. The prince {{supposedly}} prayed the same prayer as Prince Bawlawkyantaw of Hanthawaddy before the latter was put to death by his father King Razadarit in 1390. As Minye Kyawswa of Ava, who was believed to be the reincarnate of Bawlawkyantaw, grew up to be the nemesis of Hanthawaddy, Tabinshwehti, believed to be the reincarnate of Minye Kyawswa of Hanthawaddy, the prophecy claimed, would be the nemesis of Hanthawaddy.) The prophecy of a Minye Kyawswa reincarnate may have been popular in the superstitious world of Burmese politics since Upper Burma was going through immense political turmoil and decades-long internecine warfare. Since the 1480s, the once dominant power of Upper Burma, Ava, had been unable to prevent its key vassal states from breaking away. His father, who himself had broken away from Ava since 1510, required his son to receive an education in military arts. Tabinshwehiti along with Ye Htut and other young men at the palace received training in martial arts, horseback riding, elephant riding, and military strategy.|$|E

500|$|During {{the reign}} of King James IV Inchkeith {{was the site of}} an {{extraordinary}} experiment.
