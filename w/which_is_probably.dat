5|$|Agathaeromys is an extinct genus of oryzomyine rodents {{from the}} Pleistocene of Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. Two species are known, which differ {{in size and}} some details of tooth morphology. The larger A.donovani, the type species, is known from {{hundreds}} of teeth, found in four localities that are probably 900,000 to 540,000 years old. A.praeuniversitatis, the smaller species, is known from 35teeth found in a single fossil site, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> 540,000 to 230,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} period of Makemake {{is estimated at}} 7.77 hours. Its lightcurve amplitude is small, only 0.03 mag. This {{was thought to be}} due to Makemake currently being viewed pole on from Earth; however, S/2015 (136472) 1's orbital plane (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> orbiting with little inclination relative to Makemake's equator due to tides resulting from its rapid rotation) is edge-on from Earth, implying that Makemake is really being viewed equator-on.|$|E
5|$|Ursúa {{referred}} to the western port town of Ch'ich' as Nich. The modern name for a point {{on the south side}} of the bay is Punta Nijtún, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> derived from the colonial Yucatec nix tun, meaning stone ramp. Archaeologists carried out excavations at the lake shore at Punta Nijtún and discovered a stone ramp there, which was probably built by Ursúa's troops to launch his galeota.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> due to the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
5|$|Skulls of P. mongoliensis {{are flat}} on top, {{especially}} {{over the back}} of the skull, with a triangular depression, the antorbital fossa, on the outside surface of the maxilla (an upper jaw bone). A flange is present on the lower edge of the dentary (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw), although it is not as prominent as in P. meileyingensis or P. major (=P. lujiatunensis). P. mongoliensis is among the largest known species. The skull of the type specimen, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a juvenile, is 15.2centimetres (6in) long, and the associated femur is 16.2centimetres (6.4in) in length. Other specimens are larger, with the largest documented femur measuring about 21centimetres (8.25in) long.|$|E
5|$|The peak {{brightness}} of the μ ring lies almost exactly on the orbit of the small Uranian moon Mab, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{the source of the}} ring’s particles. The ν ring is positioned between Portia and Rosalind and does not contain any moons inside it. A reanalysis of the Voyager 2 images of forward-scattered light clearly reveals the μ and ν rings. In this geometry the rings are much brighter, which indicates that they contain much micrometer-sized dust. The outer rings of Uranus may be similar to the G and E rings of Saturn as E ring is extremely broad and receives dust from Enceladus.|$|E

5|$|The type {{specimen}} preserves the right canine. Like other therocephalians, the canine of Euchambersia was very large, {{resulting in a}} specialized predatory lifestyle that incorporates a sabertooth bite into prey killing. It is round in cross-section, and bears a prominent ridge {{on the side of}} its front surface. Immediately beside this ridge is a shallow depression that becomes wider {{near the top of the}} tooth, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> the same structure as the groove interpreted by some authors. Theriodonts usually replace their teeth in an alternating (or distichial) pattern, such that the canine tooth is always functional; both skulls of Euchambersia show no sign of any replacement teeth developing, suggesting that Euchambersia was reliant on having both canines present and functional simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|These were cohortes with a cavalry {{contingent}} attached. There {{is evidence}} that their numbers expanded {{with the passage of}} time. Only about 40% of attested cohortes are specifically attested as equitatae in inscriptions, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> the original Augustan proportion. A study of units stationed in Syria in the mid-2nd century found that many units which did not carry the equitata title did in fact contain cavalrymen e.g. by discovery of a tombstone of a cavalryman attached to the cohort. This implies that by that time, at least 70% of cohortes were probably equitatae. The addition of cavalry to a cohort obviously enabled it to carry out a wider range of independent operations. A cohors equitata was in effect a self-contained mini-army.|$|E
5|$|Trapalcotherium is {{a fossil}} mammal from the Cretaceous of Argentina {{in the family}} Ferugliotheriidae. The single species, T. matuastensis, is known from one tooth, a first lower molar. It is from the Allen Formation, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> Maastrichtian in age, and was first {{described}} in 2009. The tooth bears two rows of cusps, one at the inner (lingual) side and the other at the outer (labial) side, which are connected by transverse ridges separated by deep valleys. This pattern is reminiscent of Ferugliotherium, a gondwanathere mammal from similarly aged deposits in Argentina, and Trapalcotherium is therefore recognized {{as a member of}} the same family Ferugliotheriidae. Ferugliotheriidae is one of two families of gondwanatheres, an enigmatic group without close relationships to any living mammals.|$|E

5|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{dogs are}} the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The {{majority of cases}} occur {{as a result of}} primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, {{as well as a number}} of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.|$|E
5|$|The most manifestly {{cyclical}} work of {{the three}} sonatas is the Sonata in A major. In the sonata's scherzo, a joyous passage in C major is suddenly interrupted by a fierce downward rushing scale in C-sharp minor, which closely recalls a parallel passage at {{the climax of the}} preceding movement; this is followed in the scherzo by a dance theme whose melody is derived from the Andantino's opening melody. This unique moment {{is one of the most}} explicit, audible cyclic references in the sonata trilogy. Another important cyclic element in the A major Sonata is the subtle similarities and connections that exist between each movement's ending and the following movement's opening; the connection between the opening and ending of the sonata as a whole, is even bolder: the sonata ends in a cancrizans of its opening, a framing device <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> unprecedented in the sonata literature.|$|E
