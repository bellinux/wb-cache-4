A year later, another Act of Legislature gave the school the name, Jamaica Free School.

25|$|In the end, {{options for}} the {{financing}} of the purchase came down to two companies, Westpac and Allco Leasing. One {{of the more interesting}} notes to the Allco proposal <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the financing arrangements it was proposing. At the time of the proposed financing deal, interest rates in Australia were around 16-17%, placing a significant burden on companies in their business dealings. To work around this, Allco proposed a financing structure that involved a cross-border financing arrangement in Japan. It also required the establishment of a special purposes lessor company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, to minimise withholding tax liabilities from the Japanese and Australian taxation agencies. Allco refused to release specific information on the proposed structure, due to its policy prohibiting the release of specific details of this financing arrangement until it had secured a mandate for their services.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Paavolainen wrote essays that praised urban life, technology, and roaring cars in his works {{centering}} on modernism. He {{was inspired by}} authors like the Italian Futurist poet F.T. Marinetti (1876-1944) and the French intellectual André Gide (1869-1951). His first book Nykyaikaa etsimässä (1929, 'In search of Modern Times'), contained a collection of his essays from the 1920s. In the 1930s, he became focused on the rise of authoritarian regimes in Europe and their promises {{to create a new}} man and new society. As a result of his visits to Nazi Germany (1936) and South America (1937), he wrote three essayistic books titled Kolmannen Valtakunnan vieraana (1936, ‘As a Guest of the Third Reich’), Lähtö ja loitsu (1937, ‘Departure and Spell’) and Risti ja hakaristi (1938, 'Cross and Swastika’), known together as the Pako pimeyteen (‘Escape into Darkness’) trilogy. The overall theme of the books <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the political and cultural changes that had engulfed his contemporary society. A planned book about his visit to the Soviet Union (1939) was halted by the outbreak of the Second World War. His last book, Synkkä yksinpuhelu (1946, 'A Solemn Monologue') was largely based on his diary notes from 1941-1944 when he served in the Finnish Army.|$|E

The reason for the collapse was never established, but a possible cause <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the lime used to make the mortar. The contract stipulated that this had to be obtained locally, and the collapse occurred after a few days of heavy rain. Brassey rebuilt the viaduct at his own expense, this time using lime of his own choice. The rebuilt viaduct still stands and is in use today.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the various}} songs on Bleach, Christopher Sandford wrote: [...] "'Paper Cuts' {{includes}} a folk-influence melody and ponderous rhythm {{of an early}} Led Zeppelin number; 'Mr. Moustache' addressed itself to Nirvana's male fans; 'Downer' showed the same exceptional contempt for the group's audience". Sandford felt [...] "School" [...] – which features only four lines of lyrics – was memorable for its chorus that [...] "served as the rip". While [...] "Scoff" [...] is [...] "a parting salvo at [...] ", [...] "Negative Creep" [...] was written by Cobain about himself. According to Sandford, [...] "About a Girl" [...] has a [...] "chiming melody and ironic chorus". In Sounds magazine, Keith Cameron said the song [...] "was exhilarating and it was exciting because that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the music, {{but there was also}} an almost palpable sense of danger, that this whole thing could fall apart any second. There was never any relaxation from the first note to the last". In his book Nirvana: The Stories Behind Every Song, Chuck Crisafulli writes that the song [...] "stands out in the Cobain canon as a song with a very specific genesis and a very real subject".|$|E

He is credited on the lyric sheet as [...] "Jimmy". Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for Vitalogy, Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with the band members. Gossard said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled." [...] Jack Irons, the original drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on [...] "Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me". Gossard said, [...] "Jack entered the band right at the end of making Vitalogy. Jack's a breath of fresh air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately.

500|$|The {{story was}} {{influenced}} by popular conspiracy theories, spy stories, and science fiction. The original writer for Deus Ex, Sheldon Pacotti, returned to write the game's script with newcomer Sarah Paetsch. A major difference from the first game was the player's freedom to change factions throughout the game, something not available in the first game. A core part of the experience was the branching narrative, giving the player multiple options of progress despite missions having a linear progression. Paetsch estimated that the game contained over 30,000 lines of voiced dialogue. The game's subtitle referred to the unseen battle that took place both around people and within them. The suggestion that all endings of Deus Ex {{should be part of}} the canon series of events was suggested by a staff member who worked on the original game's Hong Kong storyline. The locations were chosen for their distinct feel and—in some cases—iconic landmarks. They also chose locations associated at the time with the organizations featured in-game, such as Seattle and the WTO. The Antarctica setting {{was influenced by}} the John Carpenter's film The Thing. Rather than use JC as the main protagonist due to his actions in Deus Ex making him a grand figure in world history, the team created newcomer Alex, someone who would share JC's roots and begin [...] "at the bottom of the pyramid". One of the themes included in the game <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> terrorism, and how people could be classified as terrorists or freedom fighters depending on circumstance.|$|E
500|$|One of Blow's {{goals for}} The Witness {{was to explore}} the types of non-verbal {{communication}} {{that can be achieved}} by the medium of video games, an exploration he felt to be important to understanding them as an art form. The name The Witness is derived from core gameplay aspect of making the player perceptive of the surroundings to discover meaning and solutions to the puzzles without verbal communication, a similar approach taken by Myst (1993). Blow attributes much of The Witnesss design to Myst, a game that got him into video game development. One aspect of Myst that Blow desired to correct <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> [...] "pixel hunting" [...] in some of its puzzles; the player would have to click on various parts of the virtual machinery without knowing what the end result was until sometime later in the puzzle. Within The Witness, Blow created a unifying mechanic for all the puzzles to avoid this confusion, using the maze panels as this mechanic. While the interaction mechanics are the same for all these mazes, the rules and behavior described by the game's symbolic language that limit or result from the interactions form the core of the puzzles in the game. The island was divided into sections so that all the information the player needed to understand the specific behavior of puzzles in that section would be in one general location, a means to [...] " [...] down a lot of ambiguity that used to exist in adventure games". Puzzles within the game were designed to be meaningful {{within the context of the}} game, rather than to be simply a puzzle to be solved, and further aimed to be different from any other puzzle within the game.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{held that}} the {{critical}} distinction <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the Communist Party: [...] "If the statute before us required labor union officers to forswear membership in the Republican Party, the Democratic Party or the Socialist Party, I suppose all agree {{that it would be}} unconstitutional. But why, if it is valid as to the Communist Party?" [...] But [...] "the Communist Party is something different, in fact, from any other substantial party we have known, and hence may constitutionally be treated as something different in law." [...] Jackson reviewed at length the reasons why the Communist Party was unique: [...] It constituted a minority which advocated the seizing of power through non-majoritarian means, it was a political party controlled by a foreign government, it was dedicated to violence as the means of seizing power (including [...] "occasional terroristic and threatening methods, such as picketing courts and juries, political strikes and sabotage"), it sought to achieve its violent ends by controlling the labor movement (control it must conceal in order to be effective), and it considers all its members [...] "agents" [...] of the party (unlike loosely-knit [...] "native" [...] parties).|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to general support tasks, women possessed gender-specific abilities {{that allowed them}} to carry out clandestine tasks that would have proved difficult for men. [...] Though women used these capabilities in both the urban and rural arenas of the war, it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the urban dimension of the war that contained the highest concentration, both in number and frequency, of covert activities by females. [...] The best documented example of this is in the Battle of Algiers. [...] In this battle male FLN operatives, driven underground by the French, stayed out of the public realm, avoiding detention and interrogation, while the women who helped to keep them hidden were able to move about freely and smuggle weapons and other sensitive materials {{as a result of their}} manipulation of personal appearance. [...] The manner in which women did this was twofold; first by the religious practice of wearing the veil, which the French saw as above suspicion, or, adopting a European appearance seeming to demonstrate their adherence to French values and way of life. Women like Djamila Bouhired, due to the incapacitation of men, were also charged with carrying out terrorist attacks ordered by FLN leadership and did so by again using changes in dress to their advantage.|$|E
2500|$|Insular Christianity {{developed}} distinct {{traditions and}} practices, most pointedly concerning the computus of Easter, as it produced {{the most obvious}} signs of disunity: {{the old and new}} methods did not usually agree, causing Christians following one system to begin celebrating the feast of the Resurrection while others continued to solemnly observe Lent. Monasticism spread widely; the Llandaff Charters record over fifty religious foundations in southeast Wales alone. Although the clasau were rather modest affairs, great monasteries and monastic schools also developed at Llantwit Major (...) , Bangor, and Iona. The tonsure differed from that elsewhere and also became a point of contention. A distinction that became increasingly important <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> church organisation: some monasteries were led by married clergy, inheritance of religious offices was common (in Wales, as late as the 12th century), and illegitimacy was treated much more leniently with fathers simply needing to acknowledge the child for him to inherit an equal share with his brothers. Prior to their conquest by England, most churches have records of bishops and priest but not an established parish system. Pre-conquest, most Christians would not attend regular services but relied on members of the monastic communities who would occasionally make preaching tours through the area.|$|E

2500|$|Their live {{performances}} were notoriously hit-or-miss, and were usually far more rough-edged than their recordings; the Horrible Truth of their live album (The Horrible Truth About Burma) being an in-joke about their inconsistency. Boston critic Tristam Lozaw described Mission of Burma live: [...] "When they were good, {{they were very}} very good, but when they were bad they were horrid ... But that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the beast ... Because they took chances, you never knew whether {{you were going to}} get one of the most spectacular experiences of your life or if it was going to be a ball of incomprehensible noise." [...] While the band's improvisational side and the unpredictable chaos of Swope's tape work contributed a little to this inconsistency, the two main factors were (as Lozaw implies) the live sound and the pacing and timing of their sets. When faced with a venue where the sound system or room acoustics weren't up to the task of conveying clarity along with the band's trademark volume, Swope always refused to compromise, and opted for volume. The band's set lists (composed by committee a few minutes before going on stage) could range from well-constructed to seemingly picked at random, and (aside from [...] "Secrets" [...] as a frequent opener and [...] "All World Cowboy Romance" [...] or a cover as an encore) there was a general reluctance to repeat any song placement or sequence that had worked in the past.|$|E
