On 15 December 2009 the British government announced its Future Helicopter Strategy including the purchase of 24 new build Chinooks, 22 to expand the force and two to replace losses in Afghanistan, to be delivered to the Royal Air Force from 2012. The number of additional Chinooks was cut by 12 with the October 2010 defence review, however. This <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> total fleet size to 60 aircraft; as of 2009, the RAF had 48 Chinooks in inventory.|$|E
5|$|Jeremy travels back to {{the ruins}} from the {{beginning}} of the game, only to find that the army of Rome has beaten him there. Jeremy and Alysa meet the First Paladin in the Blood Seal's resting chamber. The Paladin explains that he wishes to destroy the seal, causing a great deluge that <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> people, who had stopped believing the Church's teachings, back under the Church's influence. Jeremy refuses to allow the Paladin to do this, and the Paladin attacks. After being injured, the Paladin pulls back and Castello appears and attacks. Jeremy and Alysa kill Castello, and the Paladin re-enters the fight. Jeremy and Alysa appear to severely wound the First Paladin, but he boasts that vampires cannot kill him, as he is under the protection of Rome. Bartholomew emerges from behind the Blood Seal's resting place and slits the First Paladin's throat from behind, killing him. Bartholomew claims that although the Blood Seal was destroyed in battle, the moon will heal itself. He reveals that while he has heard that it can be done, he does not personally know how to turn Jeremy back into a human, and unless he is human, the bond between him and Alysa cannot be undone. The game ends with Jeremy and Alysa agreeing to work together to find a way to reverse Jeremy's transformation into a vampire.|$|E

25|$|Fluorescence {{resonance}} energy transfer (FRET), {{also known as}} förster {{resonance energy}} transfer, resonance energy transfer (RET) or electronic energy transfer (EET), {{is based on the}} transfer of energy from an excited (donor) chromophore or fluorophore (if the chromophores are fluorescent) to a nearby acceptor. In this method, fluorophores are chemically linked or genetically fused to two proteins hypothesised to interact. If the proteins interact, this <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> fluorophores into close spatial proximity. If the fluorophores are oriented in a manner that exposes the fluorophores to one another, usually ensured when designing and constructing the fluorophore-protein linkage/fusion, then the energy transfer from the excited donor fluorophore will result in a change in the fluorescent intensities or lifetimes of the fluorophores.|$|E

25|$|LA Metro Rail {{adopted an}} {{aggressive}} expansion policy {{early in the}} 21st century. This was fueled by increased funding availability and increasing traffic. The Gold Line opened in 2003 and has been extended several times via East Side Expansion and the Gold Line Foothill Extension. The Expo Line opened in 2012, was extended to Santa Monica in 2016, and hit ridership projections 13 years earlier than forecast. The Regional Connector <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> disconnected line {{into the rest of}} the LACMTA light rail system and provide more flexible service patterns. A more direct airport connection will be provided upon completion of the Crenshaw/LAX Line. A Purple Line Extension is planned to bring subway service along the Wilshire / Westwood corridor and will likely connect to the Crenshaw/LAX Line.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{phase of}} {{construction}} <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> Second Avenue line through Chinatown at an undetermined date. However, the tunnel under the Confucius Apartments is not {{planned to be}} used; while original plans involved the Second Avenue line running at the same depth of the Sixth Avenue Line at the Grand Street station, that option would {{require the use of}} cut-and-cover construction methods, which would disrupt the community and require the demolition of several nearby structures. Instead the MTA has proposed a deeper tunnel alignment in this area, including a new lower level at Grand Street, to reduce construction impacts on the Chinatown community. As a result, trains will be unable to use this tunnel segment; however, the MTA suggests that the tunnel segment could be used to store ancillary facilities for the subway line, such as a power substation or a ventilation facility.|$|E
25|$|Chicks hatch {{synchronously}} with a dense downy coat. The coloring is white, grey or yellow, {{with dark}} spots {{to aid in}} camouflage. The young are precocial, and can run {{almost as soon as}} they hatch. Soon after hatching the eggs, the male will leave the nest and call the chicks to him with a soft contact call. If threatened, he will freeze and attempt to hide the chicks under his wings or belly. There have been documented cases of females caring for the young; it is thought that this occurs when the male has been killed. Young chicks can feed themselves within the first few days, but the male <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> food and drop it on {{the ground in front of}} them. The chicks have a high initial mortality rate. However, within a few days they are chasing insects on their own and, at 1–3 weeks, they can fly to branches a metre from the ground. They are self-sufficient within 20 days.|$|E

25|$|On 6 March 2015, {{the office}} of the D/CIA issued an {{unclassified}} edition a statement by the Director, titled 'Our Agency's Blueprint for the Future', as a press release for public consumption. The press release announced sweeping plans for the reorganization and reform of the CIA, which the Director believes <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> CIA more in line with the Agency doctrine called the 'Strategic Direction'. Among the principal changes disclosed include the establishment of a new directorate, the Directorate of Digital Innovation, which is responsible for designing and crafting the digital technology to be used by the Agency, to keep the CIA always ahead of its enemies. The Directorate of Digital Innovation will also train CIA staff in the use of this technology, to prepare the CIA for the future, and it will also use the technological revolution to deal with cyber-terrorism and other perceived threats. The new directorate will be the chief cyber-espionage arm of the Agency going forward.|$|E
25|$|Other changes {{which were}} {{announced}} include {{the formation of}} a Talent Development Center of Excellence, the enhancement and expansion of the CIA University and the creation of the office of the Chancellor to head the CIA University in order to consolidate and unify recruitment and training efforts. The office of the Executive Director will be empowered and expanded and the secretarial offices serving the Executive Director will be streamlined. The restructuring of the entire Agency is to be revamped according to a new model whereby governance is modelled after the structure and hierarchy of corporations, said to increase the efficiency of workflow and to greatly enable the Executive Director to manage day-to-day activity. As well, another stated intention was to establish 'Mission Centers', each one to deal with a specific geographic region of the world, which <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> full collaboration and joint efforts of the five Directorates together under one roof. While the Directorate heads will still retain ultimate authority over their respective Directorate, the Mission Centers will be led by an Assistant Director who will work with the capabilities and talents of all five Directorates on mission specific goals for the parts of the world which they are given responsibility for.|$|E
25|$|The Bombardier ART {{model has}} {{undergone}} several redesigns {{from the original}} UTDC ICTS model, and the Mark II design has been updated by Bombardier, with this newest offering being the Innovia Metro 300. Dimensions {{are similar to the}} Mark II, with capacity improvements offered over the outgoing model through redesigned car layout. TransLink ordered 28 Mark III cars, which began delivery in 2015, and went into service beginning in August 2016. The vehicles appear sleeker, with larger windows {{on the sides of the}} train, and redesigned windows and headlights on the ends of the cars. The interior is largely similar to the second generation of Mark II cars, with the some seats removed to better accommodate bicycles and strollers. TransLink has claimed that the interior of the Mark III offers better sound and heat insulation. TransLink ordered the cars for the Evergreen Extension in a 4-car articulated configuration, with two centre cars, to allow full length train movements by passengers. However, due to a shortage of trains, the Mark IIIs are being used on the Expo Line, while 2-car Innovia 200 (Mk2) serve the Millennium Line. On December 16, 2016, TransLink ordered 28 more Mark III cars, which <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> total number of Mark III cars to 56 once they go into service in early 2019.|$|E
