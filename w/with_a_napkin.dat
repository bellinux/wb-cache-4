5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a number of items may be placed in the lying-in chamber in {{deference}} to Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin,</b> offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and pieces of gold and silver. A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E
25|$|In some establishments, lattes {{are served}} in a glass on a saucer <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin</b> to hold the (sometimes hot) glass.|$|E
60|$|And {{the waiter}} hurried away <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin</b> over his arm, much {{pleased with the}} {{singular}} frivolity of the gentlemen upstairs.|$|E

6000|$|... "And if {{they think}} you try to stand on your legs and walk with the feet of manhood, why, there isn't a {{blooming}} father and lover among them but will do his best to get you down and suffocate you--either <b>with</b> <b>a</b> baby's <b>napkin</b> or <b>a</b> woman's petticoat." ...|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{laughed and}} took off his apron as he {{walked back to the}} servants' coat-room. As he emerged again and crossed through the dining-room he saw that Murray had regained {{consciousness}} and was sitting at a table wiping the blood from his face <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wet <b>napkin.</b> <b>As</b> Murray's eyes fell upon his late antagonist he half rose from his chair and shook his fist at Jimmy.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Will had {{gathered}} himself up by this time, had wiped his bleeding face <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin,</b> and was skulking off to bed.|$|E
60|$|When he {{returned}} to the fisherman's hut the princess was waiting for him. She had prepared a tray spread <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin,</b> a cup of milk, and some sweet cakes.|$|E
60|$|The porter shuts his wicket {{and goes}} up to say it to the King, who was just sitting down to dinner <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin</b> round his neck, and all his ministers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, this is {{perfectly}} lovely," [...] lisped William Philander Tubbs, {{as he sat}} {{on the end of the}} board-seat, his lap covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> paper <b>napkin</b> on which rested a large plate of chicken salad and some sandwiches. In one hand he held an extra large glass of grape juice.|$|R
6000|$|While {{the party}} were at breakfast, a very nicely-dressed waiter, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> white <b>napkin</b> over his arm, stood behind Mrs. Parkman's chair, and evinced {{a great deal}} of {{alertness}} and alacrity in offering her every thing that she required. When the breakfast was nearly finished, Mr. George turned to him and said,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Albert and Edgar {{had learned}} the use of them in Flanders. Lady Agatha and Aline {{said that they were}} charming, but Sir Ralph {{declared}} that he greatly preferred using his fingers. After the meal was concluded, water was brought round in <b>a</b> silver bowl, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> damask <b>napkin</b> for them to wipe their fingers on.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{released}} her. She adjusted the hood and, taking {{up a little}} tray which held food covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin,</b> {{she turned to the}} door. He opened it and they went out.|$|E
60|$|But the wassail went on; and Brady himself couldn't have {{hammered}} the thirst mob into {{a better}} {{imitation of the}} real penchant for the stuff that you screw out of a bottle <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{stewardess}} did {{not lose}} temper. She was used to such things. If Miss Pritty had capsized her intellect over the bed-clothes, the stewardess would only have smiled, and wiped it up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin.</b>|$|E
6000|$|<b>A</b> corpulent man, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fortnight's <b>napkin</b> {{under his}} arm, and coeval {{stockings}} on his legs, slowly desisted from his occupation of staring down the street, {{on this question}} being put to him by Mr. Pickwick; and, after minutely inspecting that gentleman's appearance, from the crown of his hat to the lowest button of his gaiters, replied emphatically-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Rollo. [...] "And I saw {{the priest}} wiping out the cup very carefully, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large white <b>napkin,</b> before {{he held it}} out for the wine." ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{gave them}} a few coppers each, for himself and for Mr. George, and {{just as he had}} done so, a young man without any hat upon his head, but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> white <b>napkin</b> under his arm, came out of the hotel, and {{advancing}} to the window of the coupé asked Mr. George and Rollo, in French, if they wished to take any thing.|$|R
60|$|Epic {{events have}} a {{stunning}} quality. They paralyse the faculties. For {{a moment there}} was a pause. The world stood still. Mr. Brewster bubbled inarticulately. Mr. Gossett dried himself sketchily <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin.</b> The Sausage Chappie snorted.|$|E
60|$|The stem of {{the wine}}-glass in John's fingers snapped suddenly, {{and the wine}} trickled down to the floor. A passing waiter hurried up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin,</b> and a fresh glass was brought. The affair was {{scarcely}} noticed, but John remained disturbed and a little pale.|$|E
60|$|Then {{when all}} this was done {{the chief of the}} blacks {{conducted}} Beppo back to Sebastian the Goldsmith. There was a fine feast spread, with fruit and wine. Beppo sat down to it, and Sebastian the Goldsmith stood and served him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin</b> over his arm.|$|E
6000|$|... 'As {{soon as he}} {{was dead}} the Emperor turned to me, and when he had wiped away the bright sweat from his brow <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>napkin</b> of purfled and purple silk, he said to me, [...] "Art thou a prophet, that I may not harm thee, or the son of a prophet, that I can do thee no hurt? I pray thee leave my city to-night, for while thou art in it I am no longer its lord." ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Black Horse" [...] study began <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bar <b>napkin</b> at the White Sands Missile Range Officers’ Club on May 12, 1993. The {{original}} {{concept was}} developed by then Air Force Captain Mitchell Burnside Clapp, who envisioned an aerial refueled, rocket-powered single-stage to orbit (SSTO) vehicle using jet fuel and hydrogen peroxide. This concept seemed a natural match for the Air Force’s TransAtmospheric Vehicle (TAV) mission and studies began at the USAF Phillips Laboratory. Aerospace engineering legend Burt Rutan and noted aircraft designer Dan Raymer contributed input {{to the development of}} the design.|$|R
60|$|But Mrs Clennam, {{resolved}} to treat {{herself with the}} greater rigour for having been supposed to be unacquainted with reparation, refused to eat her oysters when they were brought. They looked tempting; eight in number, circularly {{set out on a}} white plate on <b>a</b> tray covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> white <b>napkin,</b> flanked by <b>a</b> slice of buttered French roll, and a little compact glass of cool wine and water; but she resisted all persuasions, and sent them down again--placing the act to her credit, no doubt, in her Eternal Day-Book.|$|R
60|$|After he {{had drunk}} his cup of black coffee, {{he wiped his}} lips slowly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin,</b> motioned to his servant to wait, and going {{over to the table}} sat down and wrote two letters. One he put in his pocket, the other he handed to the valet.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush, hush, Lizzie, little gells must be {{seen and}} not heard,' said Mrs. Jerome; while grandpapa, winking significantly, and looking radiant with delight at Lizzie's {{extraordinary}} promise of cleverness, set her up on her high cane-chair {{by the side of}} grandma, who lost no time in shielding the beauties of the new frock <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then enter Honoria {{with glasses}} on a tray; Ernest with champagne; Jane with eatables; Bennet <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin.</b> It is a grim procession. The girls are scattered, laughing, talking: Africa to the Misses Wetherell; a couple to Dr. Freemantle. England, Scotland, Wales, and Canada are with Fanny. The hubbub, {{with the advent}} of the refreshments, increases. There is a general {{movement}} towards the refreshments.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{conducted}} Louis to the cool, shaded, arched doorway, opening {{under the}} rich marble cloister of the court-yard, where a fountain made a delicious bubbling in the centre. She clapped her hands--a little negro girl appeared, {{to whom she}} gave an order, and presently two more negroes came in, bringing magnificent oranges and pomegranates, and iced wine and water, on a silver tray, covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> richly-embroidered <b>napkin.</b> He would have felt himself in the Alhambra, {{if he could have}} felt anything but that he was beside Mary.|$|R
60|$|In {{the very}} {{centre of the}} chamber there stood a large four-post bed, with {{curtains}} of Gobelin tapestry looped back from the pillow. A square of polished rails surrounded it, leaving a space some five feet in width all round between the enclosure and the bedside. Within this enclosure, or ruelle, stood a small round table, covered over <b>with</b> <b>a</b> white <b>napkin,</b> upon which lay a silver platter and an enamelled cup, the one containing a little Frontiniac wine and water, the other bearing three slices of the breast of a chicken, in case the king should hunger during the night.|$|R
50|$|Donald was {{the second}} born of five brothers, {{including}} Kenneth, Edward, and George. His brother George was the first brother to be murdered, found {{shot to death in}} the North End neighborhood in 1950. His murderers were never discovered. In 1971 when Kenneth chewed off the nose of Michael (Mickey) Dwyer, rival Boston gang member and former brother-in-law of Boston Police Department Commissioner Francis (Mickey) Roche, he wrapped it up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cocktail <b>napkin</b> and sent it to Boston City Hospital in a cab to Dwyer to be reattached. Donald's other brother, Edward, was found shot to death in 1968; it was listed by the county coroner as an apparent suicide. In 1968 he became a father to a son.|$|R
60|$|Within was {{a narrow}} room {{as red as}} blood. A flaming lamp {{hung from the ceiling}} above. The young man stood as though turned to stone, for there stood a {{gigantic}} Black Demon <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin</b> wrapped around his loins and a scimitar in his right hand, the blade of which gleamed like lightning in the flame of the lamp. Before him lay a basket filled with sawdust.|$|E
60|$|Just then, indeed, {{there was}} a general {{movement}} up the pass, in the wide mouth of which all this scene took place, for suddenly three Fung chieftains appeared galloping toward us, one of whom was veiled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin</b> in which were cut eyeholes. So universal was this retreat, in fact, that we three on our camels, and the Child of Kings on her beautiful mare, found ourselves left alone.|$|E
6000|$|His meal being ended, a lord {{came and}} held before him a broad, shallow, golden dish with {{fragrant}} rosewater in it, to cleanse {{his mouth and}} fingers with; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood by <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>napkin</b> for his use. Tom gazed at the dish a puzzled moment or two, then raised it to his lips, and gravely took a draught. Then he returned it to the waiting lord, and said-- ...|$|E
5000|$|For centuries, a rite {{of passage}} for French gourmets was the eating of the Ortolan. These tiny birds—captured alive, force-fed, then drowned in Armagnac—were roasted whole and eaten that way, bones and all, while the diner draped his head <b>with</b> <b>a</b> linen <b>napkin</b> to {{preserve}} the precious aromas and, some believe, to hide from God. The Wine Spectator The birds are caught with nets set during their autumn migratory flight to Africa. They are then kept in covered cages or boxes. This [...] "artificial night" [...] causes the birds to gorge themselves on grain (usually millet seed) until they double their bulk. [...] "Roman Emperors stabbed out ortolans’ eyes {{in order to make the}} birds think it was night, making them eat even more". The birds are then thrown into a container of Armagnac which both drowns and marinates the birds.|$|R
25|$|In the {{classical}} preparation of French côtelettes de volaille, the humerus bone {{of the wing}} is left attached. This also holds for their Russian versions and in particular for chicken Kiev. For serving, the bone is usually covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> frilled paper <b>napkin.</b> However, industrially produced pure fillets are often used nowadays, and the cutlets are served without the bone. This is the usual way of serving chicken Kiev in the US. A spherically shaped version was developed by English chef Jesse Dunford Wood.|$|R
5000|$|The bird is roasted {{for eight}} {{minutes and then}} plucked. The {{consumer}} then places the bird feet first into their mouth while holding onto the bird's head. The ortolan is then eaten whole, or without the head and the consumer spits out the larger bones. The traditional way French gourmands eat ortolans is to cover their heads and face <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large <b>napkin</b> or towel while consuming the bird. The purpose of the towel is debated. Some claim it is to retain the maximum aroma with the flavour as they consume the entire bird at once, others have stated [...] "Tradition dictates that this is to shield - from God’s eyes - the shame of such a decadent and disgraceful act", and others have suggested the towel hides the consumers spitting out bones. [...] This use of the towel was begun by a priest, a friend of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin.|$|R
