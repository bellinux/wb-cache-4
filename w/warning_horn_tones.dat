50|$|On 9 March 1986, a Vickers Viscount (registration: G-BLNB) made a wheels up landing, {{the landing}} gear <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> not having functioned correctly. There were no {{injuries}} to the 3 occupants; after repair the aircraft was returned to service.|$|R
50|$|Yoko is Beulah's final album, {{released}} on Velocette Records in 2003. For the album, the band toned down the happy melodic <b>horn</b> <b>tones</b> {{of their last}} album, The Coast Is Never Clear, {{in favor of a}} darker approach.|$|R
50|$|All {{aircraft}} with retractable {{landing gear}} are required to {{have a way to}} indicate the status of the landing gear, which is normally a set of lights that change colors from red to amber to green depending on whether the gear are up, in transit, or down. However, a distracted pilot may forget to look at these lights. This has led to aircraft designers building extra safety systems in the aircraft to reduce the possibility of human error. In small aircraft this most commonly {{takes the form of a}} <b>warning</b> light and <b>horn</b> which operate when any of the landing gear is not locked down and any of the engine throttles are retarded below a cruise power setting. However, the horn has been useless in situations when the pilot was unfamiliar with the aircraft and did not know what the horn sounding was meant to indicate. Pilots have sometimes confused the landing gear <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> with the stall <b>warning</b> <b>horn.</b> In other cases, pilots cannot hear the horn on older aircraft due to wearing a modern noise-canceling headset.|$|R
50|$|The {{emergency}} caught both pilots by surprise. There was {{confusion and}} shock {{on the flight}} deck, a situation compounded by the extremely loud noise from the overspeeding propellers. About four seconds after the double propeller overspeed began, the beta <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> started to sound intermittently, although the pilots stated afterwards they did not hear it.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 January 1970, an Aspen Airways Convair CV-240-12 (registration N270L) {{landed on}} the runway with its landing gear raised. The pilot in command {{wanted to keep the}} {{airspeed}} above 130 knots in case a go-around was required, and failed to extend the landing gear on short final. The gear <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> did not sound. There were no injuries.|$|R
500|$|Manchester Metrolink {{has many}} tramway sections, along which trams share the highway with other road traffic and pedestrians. Trams are {{equipped}} with a two-tone standard horn and a louder <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> which is primarily intended for use on former railway routes but can be used anywhere. A number of fatal incidents have occurred on the network since opening in 1992: ...|$|R
50|$|The 1967 model 172H was {{the last}} Continental O-300 powered model. It also {{introduced}} a shorter-stroke nose gear oleo to reduce drag and improve {{the appearance of the}} aircraft in flight. A new cowling was used, introducing shock-mounts that transmitted lower noise levels to the cockpit and reduced cowl cracking. The electric stall <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> was replaced by a pneumatic one.|$|R
50|$|TOWS is {{designed}} to sound a warning for numerous other dangerous errors in the take-off configuration, such as the flaps and slats not being extended when the throttles are opened while the aircraft is on the ground. The alert is typically {{in the form of}} an audible <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> accompanied by a voice message that indicates the nature of the configuration error.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike some Metro {{systems in}} the United Kingdom, the Manchester Metrolink has {{a high degree of}} street {{interaction}} between pedestrians and motorists with on-street running trams - this is most notable in Manchester city centre. All trams are equipped with a standard <b>horn</b> and a <b>warning</b> <b>horn.</b> A number of fatal incidents have occurred on the network since opening in 1992: ...|$|R
50|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, the pressure inside the cabin gradually decreased. As it passed through {{an altitude of}} 12040 ft, the cabin altitude <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> sounded. The <b>warning</b> should have prompted the crew to stop climbing, but it was misidentified by the crew as a take-off configuration warning, which signals that {{the aircraft}} is not ready for take-off, and can only sound on the ground.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 {{a similar}} {{incident}} {{occurred on the}} Settle and Carlisle line at Crosby Garrett, north of Kirkby Stephen, where a landslide caused a Carlisle-bound Sprinter to derail. The driver set off a <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> mounted on the track, and although a southbound goods train hit the Sprinter, nobody was seriously hurt. This took place during bad weather conditions similar to the 1995 incident.|$|R
5000|$|A {{stall warning}} is an {{electronic}} or mechanical device that sounds an audible warning as the stall speed is approached. The majority of aircraft contain {{some form of}} this device that warns the pilot of an impending stall. The simplest such device is a stall <b>warning</b> <b>horn,</b> which consists of either a pressure sensor or a movable metal tab that actuates a switch, and produces an audible warning in response.|$|R
5000|$|January 11, 1995: A Cessna 208 Caravan leased by FedEx Express {{and flying}} a cargo flight from Flagstaff to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport crashed about 1.3 miles SSE of Flagstaff Pulliam Airport. While {{returning}} to the airport, the [...] "fuel selector off" [...] <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> was heard. The pilot was killed. The cause of the crash {{was determined to be}} the pilot's failure to properly configure the fuel system prior to takeoff.|$|R
2500|$|The Boeing 727-251, {{registration}} N274US, departed New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 19:14 for a {{ferry flight}} to Buffalo. As the craft climbed past , the overspeed <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> sounded, followed 10 seconds later by a stick shaker stall warning. The aircraft leveled at [...] until {{it started to}} descend {{out of control in}} a spin, reaching a vertical acceleration of +5g until it struck the ground in a slightly nose down and right wing-down attitude twelve minutes after take-off, at 19:26.|$|R
50|$|A Pan Am Boeing Stratocruiser 10-29 (N90941, named Clipper Australia) was {{on final}} for Haneda Airport when the gear was extended, showing three greens. When power was reduced prior to touchdown, the gear unsafe <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> sounded {{and a red}} gear unsafe warning light illuminated. The captain first called for a go-around, but noticed that the {{airspeed}} was too low. The gear was retracted quickly and a belly landing was carried out. All 59 passengers and crew on board survived, but the aircraft was written off.|$|R
50|$|The Boeing 727-251, {{registration}} N274US, departed New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 19:14 for a {{ferry flight}} to Buffalo. As the craft climbed past 16000 ft, the overspeed <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> sounded, followed 10 seconds later by a stick shaker stall warning. The aircraft leveled at 24800 ft until {{it started to}} descend {{out of control in}} a spin, reaching a vertical acceleration of +5g until it struck the ground in a slightly nose down and right wing-down attitude twelve minutes after take-off, at 19:26.|$|R
50|$|The aircraft's Take-off <b>warning</b> system <b>horn</b> was {{not heard}} on the CAM channel of the CVR. It is {{possible}} that the take-off configuration warning was not sounding.|$|R
50|$|From the CVR data, 16 {{seconds before}} the crash, the Captain called for a go-around, gear up and flaps before the crash. A <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> then sounded {{followed}} by a 'too low gear' aural sound. Apparently, the pilots had difficulty in sighting the runway and should have carried a missed approach on the Decision Altitude of 307 ft instead of continuing descent below 204 ft. The flaps were retracted and the gear was extended. But the gear was locked. The 'too low gear' warning then appeared again, and a Ground Proximity Warning System followed.|$|R
50|$|Modern gemshorns {{are often}} {{made of the}} horns of domesticated cattle, because they are readily available, and their use {{prevents}} endangering wild species. The hollow <b>horn</b> has <b>tone</b> holes down the front, like a recorder or clarinet. The pointed end of the horn is left intact, and serves as {{the bottom of the}} instrument. A fipple plug, usually of wood, is fitted into the wide end of the instrument, with a recorder type voicing window {{on the front of the}} <b>horn,</b> for <b>tone</b> production.|$|R
50|$|The FDR and the CVR {{were found}} {{and sent to}} Washington to be read out by the NTSB in United States. They were found in good condition; however, the team {{experienced}} difficulty reading the Cockpit Area Microphone (CAM). The team {{also found that the}} channel from the CAM was masked by hum and noise dominating the signal. There were some voices heard on the CAM track; {{there were a number of}} step changes in background noise level and character that may have been consistent with an intermittent electrical connection in the CAM wiring circuit. As a result, the team was not able to conclude that the CAM was providing input to the CVR throughout the entire 30 minutes. Such a poor quality in CVR record failure makes it impossible to find out whether the flight crews made proper take-off configuration procedures including checklist execution. However several crew words, cockpit switch activations, engine noise, and cabin chime sounds heard on the CAM channel of the CVR were typically at a volume level much lower than the standard take off <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> of the Boeing 737-200. The typical sound of the take-off configuration warning was not heard in the CVR CAM channel. The stick-shaker warning (typically as loud as or louder than the takeoff <b>warning</b> <b>horn)</b> was also not heard on the CVR CAM channel.|$|R
40|$|Pulse-resonance {{sounds like}} vowels or {{instrumental}} tones contain acoustic {{information about the}} physical size of the sound source (pulse rate) and body resonators (resonance scale). Previous research has revealed correlates of these variables in humans using functional neuroimaging. Here, we report two experiments that use magnetoencephalography to study the neuromagnetic representations of pulse rate and resonance scale in human auditory cortex. In experiment 1, auditory evoked fields were recorded from nineteen subjects presented with French <b>horn</b> <b>tones,</b> the pulse rate and resonance scale {{of which had been}} manipulated independently using a mucoder. In experiment 2, fifteen subjects listened to French <b>horn</b> <b>tones</b> which differed in resonance scale but which lacked pulse rate cues. The resulting cortical activity was evaluated by spatio-temporal source analysis. Changes in pulse rate elicited a well-defined N 1 m component with cortical generators located at the border between Heschl's gyrus and planum temporale. Changes in resonance scale elicited a second, independent, N 1 m component located in planum temporale. Our results demonstrate that resonance scale can be distinguished in its neuromagnetic representation from cortical activity related to the sound's pulse rate. Moreover, the existence of two separate components in the N 1 m sensitive to register information highlights the importance of this time window for the processing of frequency information in human auditory cortex.

50|$|Devices to {{warn the}} pilot when the aircraft's speed is {{decreasing}} close to the stall speed include stall <b>warning</b> <b>horns</b> (now standard on virtually all powered aircraft), stick shakers, and voice warnings.

Stall speed is higher when ice or frost has attached to the wings and/or tail stabilizer. The more severe the icing, the higher the stall speed, not only because smooth airflow over the wings becomes increasingly more difficult, but also because of the added weight of the accumulated ice.|$|R

40|$|In tonal {{languages}}, such as Mandarin Chinese, {{the pitch}} contour of vowels discriminates lexical meaning, {{which is not}} the case in non-tonal languages such as German. Recent data provide evidence that pitch processing is influenced by language experience. However, there are still many open questions concerning the representation of such phonological and language-related differences {{at the level of the}} auditory cortex (AC). Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we recorded transient and sustained auditory evoked fields (AEF) in native Chinese and German speakers to investigate language related phonological and semantic aspects in the processing of acoustic stimuli. AEF were elicited by spoken meaningful and meaningless syllables, by vowels, and by a French <b>horn</b> <b>tone.</b> Speech sounds were recorded from a native speaker and showed frequency-modulations according to the pitch-contours of Mandarin. The sustained field (SF) evoked by natural speech signals was significantly larger for Chinese than for German listeners. In contrast, the SF elicited by a <b>horn</b> <b>tone</b> was not significantly different between groups. Furthermore, the SF of Chinese subjects was larger when evoked by meaningful syllables compared to meaningless ones, but there was no significant difference regarding whether vowels were part of the Chinese phonological system or not. Moreover, the N 100 m gave subtle but clear evidence that for Chinese listeners other factors than purely physical properties play a role in processing meaningful signals. These findings show that the N 100 and the SF generated in Heschl's gyrus are influenced by language experience, which suggests that AC activity related to specific pitch contours of vowels is influenced in a top-down fashion by higher, language related areas. Such interactions are in line with anatomical findings and neuroimaging data, as well as with the dual-stream model of language of Hickok and Poeppel that highlights the close and reciprocal interaction between superior temporal gyrus and sulcus...|$|R
