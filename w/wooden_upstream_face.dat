50|$|Work {{began in}} 2010, when the {{downstream}} {{face of the}} main dam was cleaned and loose concrete, efflorescence and other surface deposits were removed. The concrete face was then protected from further deterioration by using a cementitious repair mortar and siloxane waterproofer. The remedial works on the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> included the installation of a PVC geocomposite membrane, geonet drainage layer and associated drainage system to the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of the main dam and the auxiliary overflow. The geomembrane is sealed on the concrete face along the foundation line and on the parapet wall 300 mm above the crest level to cover the joint between the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> and the parapet wall.

50|$|The piers {{supporting}} the arches have become quite worn over time. They show several interesting architectural techniques. The bossage technique is {{visible on the}} downstream side of the eastern piers. The <b>upstream</b> <b>faces</b> of the piers show stepped cutwaters and footings. These stepped piers are a feature typical of Roman construction. Two of the relieving arches (the fifth and seventh arches from the western end) have their upstream side open but have been filled on the downstream side. The dimensions of the arches all differ due to the complex histpry of its construction. The <b>upstream</b> <b>faces</b> of the piers now have triangular cutwaters.

40|$|We {{obtained}} an 11 subunit {{model of}} RNA polymerase (Pol) III by combining a homology {{model of the}} nine subunit core enzyme with a new X-ray structure of the subcomplex C 17 / 25. Compared to Pol II, Pol III shows a conserved active center for RNA synthesis but a structurally different <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> for specific initiation complex assembly during promoter selection. The Pol III <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> includes a HRDC domain in subunit C 17 that is translated by 35 Å and rotated by 150 ° compared to its Pol II counterpart. The HRDC domain is essential in vivo, folds independently in vitro, and, unlike other HRDC domains, shows no indication of nucleic acid binding. Thus, the HRDC domain is a functional module that {{could account for the}} role of C 17 in Pol III promoter-specific initiation. During elongation, C 17 / 25 may bind Pol III transcripts emerging from the adjacent exit pore, because the subcomplex binds to tRNA in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} effect of a strong {{underwater}} shock wave on a concrete dam, in this research the hammers impact were applied to simulate the underwater shock in a model test. The model scale Lλ was 200 according to the gravity-elasticity similitude law. Five acceleration sensors were imbedded along the downstream surface of the dam. The maximum input pressure was evaluated based on the recorded accelerations. The explosive charge and the distance between the explosion center and the dam were determined corresponding to the maximum impact pressure. After the hammers impacted, the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of the dam was fractured and downstream was scabbed; some cracks extended from the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> to the downstream face; the head of dam was projected; and the dam appeared entirely displacement. Although the damage similarity of the model and prototype is not verified, this method may be used to verify the quality of a protection project and offered evidence to define a protection project...|$|R

50|$|Cedar Bluff Dam is a rolled earth-fill {{embankment}} dam with rock riprap on its <b>upstream</b> <b>face.</b> It has a structural height of 202 ft and {{a length of}} 12560 ft. At its crest, the dam has an elevation of 2198 ft. An uncontrolled spillway {{is located at the}} south end of the dam. Gated outlet works through the base of the dam release water for downstream requirements.|$|R
50|$|The dam was {{constructed}} with a high-quality concrete designed to withstand constant thawing and freezing associated with its environment. To further help the structure {{cope with the}} climate, engineers placed one-inch steel reinforcing bars within the <b>upstream</b> and downstream <b>faces</b> of the dam. The concrete's strength in compression was initially 4,500 lbs. per square inch to meet an estimated 1,500 PSI within the structure. The <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of the dam was also coated in asphalt for protection against water. Despite {{the strength of the}} dam's concrete, two parallel inclined cracks were discovered on one of the arches shortly after construction.|$|R
50|$|Vilar Dam is a 58 m tall (height above foundation) and 240 m long {{rockfill}} {{embankment dam}} with a crest altitude of 555 m. The <b>upstream</b> <b>facing</b> {{of the dam}} is made of concrete. The volume of the dam is 300,000 m³. The chute spillway with 2 radial gates {{is located at the}} right side of the dam. The maximum discharge is 500 m³/s. There is also a bottom outlet.|$|R

25|$|In {{the arch}} dam, {{stability}} is obtained {{by a combination}} of arch and gravity action. If the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> is vertical the entire weight of the dam must be carried to the foundation by gravity, while the distribution of the normal hydrostatic pressure between vertical cantilever and arch action will depend upon the stiffness of the dam in a vertical and horizontal direction. When the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> is sloped the distribution is more complicated. The normal component of the weight of the arch ring may be taken by the arch action, while the normal hydrostatic pressure will be distributed as described above. For this type of dam, firm reliable supports at the abutments (either buttress or canyon side wall) are more important. The most desirable place for an arch dam is a narrow canyon with steep side walls composed of sound rock. The safety of an arch dam is dependent on the strength of the side wall abutments, hence not only should the arch be well seated on the side walls but also the character of the rock should be carefully inspected.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{reduction}} of scour around group {{of two and}} three piers using geotextile layer {{has been carried out}} for the case of clear-water flow over uniform sediment. The results reveal that geotextile layer has a considerable effect in both delaying and reducing scour. The effect of geotextile in delaying souring is more evident in third pier than first and second pier. Also when the width of the geotextile layer is decreased the effect of geotextile layer in {{reduction of}} scour depth is decreased as well. When the size of geotextile increased the delay time is increased. Moreover, geotextile layer reduces down-flow and horseshoe vortex in each three piers as the same performance of collar. Results show that the efficiency of geotextile in reduction of scour depth in rear pier is larger than the other piers due to a weaker down flow at <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of the rear pier. The maximum scour depth was observed at <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of the front pier for both two and three piers...|$|R

5|$|Riprap {{was laid}} on the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of the dam {{beginning}} November 9 of that year. In 1962, a series of labor strikes impacted communities in the Central Valley, also affecting construction of the dam, which was temporarily halted on May 3 of that year. After work restarted on June 26, pervious core material for the dam was soon out of supply, so impervious material was used to complete the dam core.|$|R
25|$|The unusual <b>upstream</b> <b>facing</b> outfall of the Derwent is man made. It is {{believed}} to have been cut during the Roman occupation of Britain to reduce the distance between the Derwent mouth and the Roman legionary headquarters at York by 9 miles.

2500|$|The facing of the piers and the {{foundation}} consists of cut sandstone blocks bond by mortar and joined by iron clamps; {{the interior was}} filled with Roman concrete, a building technique also observed in the Pa-i-pol bridge.
