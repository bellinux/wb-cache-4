The game's only directions are given through a poem included with the game's cassette tape.|$|E

5000|$|Werewolves - The <b>werewolves</b> are bipedal wolves {{that used}} to be human yet still think like humans. Contrary to most <b>werewolves</b> in folk tales and modern media, the <b>werewolves</b> of this show {{permanently}} stay in their form.|$|R
50|$|Diseased (+3): If you are {{attacked}} by <b>werewolves,</b> the <b>werewolves</b> {{do not get}} fed the following night.|$|R
50|$|The <b>werewolves</b> in {{the first}} two novels were {{described}} as completely wolf-like, but the <b>werewolves</b> featured in The Howling III are more anthropomorphic (like the <b>werewolves</b> from the 1981 film). They can walk on their hind legs and are over seven feet tall.|$|R
5|$|Lena Headey as Angelika: Her {{father is}} a woodsman {{transformed}} into a <b>werewolf</b> by the Mirror Queen's spell. Gilliam's first choice for the role was Samantha Morton.|$|E

5|$|<b>Werewolf</b> Canyon {{debuted in}} 2003 in Thunder Canyon. 2004 saw the {{addition}} of CarnEvil and Lair of the Vampire. <b>Werewolf</b> Canyon was also expanded that year. Fear Faire, with a medieval theme, was added in 2006. In 2007, the park added the Monster Midway Invasion Celebration Parade which goes from Gemini to the main midway. In 2008, HalloWeekends received a major expansion. CornStalkers replaced <b>Werewolf</b> Canyon, Club Blood replaced Lair of the Vampire, CarnEvil was relocated to Camp Snoopy and Terror Island was added under Millennium Force. The area near Blue Streak {{was turned into a}} children's area, Magical House on Boo Hill was relocated and a haybale maze was added.

50|$|Eranthe and Eros, {{the god of}} love or lust.

5000|$|In {{the early}} {{books of the}} series, <b>werewolves</b> and shapeshifters are {{described}} as separate groups or races of the Night World. For example, in Daughters of Darkness, Night World is described as comprising vampires, [...] "witches and <b>werewolves</b> and shapeshifters, too". [...] Though never explicitly stated, the later books tend to treat <b>werewolves</b> as a subset of shapeshifters. In Witchlight, when Keller tells the history of shapeshifters, she lists felines, bears, eagles, and wolves as groups or clans within the shapeshifter race. [...] The description of both <b>werewolves</b> and shapeshifters as second-class citizens also supports the notion that <b>werewolves</b> are a subset, or one family, of shapeshifters. However, in Witchlight {{there is no real}} mention of Keller feeding or abiding by the rules for <b>werewolves</b> described in Daughters of Darkness.|$|R
50|$|Minion (-6): Work {{with the}} <b>werewolves</b> or vampires {{to kill the}} villagers. The {{moderator}} decides whether you work with the <b>werewolves</b> or the vampires.|$|R
5|$|Another type of Romanian vampire is pricolici. These {{types are}} humans {{born with a}} tail, and they can shape shift like a <b>werewolf</b> but they have control over their transformation. Their entire power is kept in their tail. In undeath, the pricolici remain in their wolf form.|$|E
5|$|For Series 2 of 2006, an {{untitled}} episode 2 set at Buckingham Palace, concerned Queen Victoria {{getting an}} alien insect in her eye. The setting was eventually changed to the Torchwood Estate and the alien being {{changed to a}} <b>werewolf.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mike Ploog (co-creator of <b>Werewolf</b> by Night) {{was one of}} {{numerous}} staff taking a role in animation on this film. Ploog also was involved in other Ralph Bakshi animations, notably Wizards and Hey Good Lookin.|$|E
50|$|Like many {{examples}} of <b>werewolves</b> in modern fiction, D&Ds <b>werewolves</b> and other lycanthropes are vulnerable to silver and highly resistant to other kinds of harm.|$|R
50|$|Each night, the <b>werewolves</b> pick 1 (this {{can change}} with the Personnages {{expansion}} pack) player to kill. The victim can be anyone except the Moderator, including other <b>werewolves.</b> The next day, they {{pretend to be a}} villager and try to seem unsuspicious. The number of <b>werewolves</b> in a game varies depending on the number of players.|$|R
50|$|In the Past Doctor Adventures novel Wolfsbane by Jacqueline Rayner, it {{was stated}} that in 1933, Nazi Germany {{became aware of}} the {{existence}} of <b>werewolves</b> and forced them to register with the government. A group of them were imprisoned in camp surrounded by silver barbed wire and pressed into state service. In 1934, these <b>werewolves</b> were used to commit the purge that became known as the Night of the Long Knives. One of these <b>werewolves,</b> Emmeline Neuberger, managed to escape into the German woods. The transformation of these <b>werewolves</b> are also tied to moonlight.|$|R
5|$|Sadly, Snape lets slip that Lupin is a <b>werewolf,</b> {{leading to}} his resignation. Harry visits Lupin before he leaves, {{and as they}} say goodbye, Lupin is certain that they will meet again {{sometime}} soon (see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix).|$|E
5|$|The weretiger {{replaces the}} <b>werewolf</b> in shapeshifting {{folklore}} in Asia; in India they were evil sorcerers, while in Indonesia and Malaysia they were somewhat more benign. In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, tigers are fiercer and more ruthless than lions.|$|E
5|$|Tilda Swinton reprises {{her role}} as Jadis, the White Witch. Her ghost appears as the hag and <b>werewolf</b> attempt to resurrect her. Swinton and her two {{children}} also cameoed towards the film's end as centaurs.|$|E
50|$|Wolf Alpha: A Wolf Alpha is {{regarded}} as a rare and precious Alpha and are held in exceptionally high regard as they embody what {{is believed to be the}} very essence of the <b>werewolf's</b> lupine nature due to their power to shapeshift into true wolves. Wolf Alphas are created from <b>werewolves</b> who possess great willpower and sense of purpose as well as enough compassion and humanity to keep from becoming Beast Alphas. Wolf Alphas are regarded as evolved <b>werewolves</b> and retain their power to become wolves even after losing their Alpha status. Talia and Derek Hale are the only evolved <b>werewolves</b> seen.|$|R
25|$|The <b>werewolves</b> {{were known}} to exterminate all kind of farm animals, {{especially}} sheep. The transformation usually occurred in the Winter solstice, Easter and full moon. Later in the 17th and 18th century, the trials in Hungary not only were conducted against witches, but against <b>werewolves</b> too, and many records exist creating connections between both kinds. Also the vampires and <b>werewolves</b> are closely related in Hungary, being both feared in the antiquity.|$|R
50|$|In Occult Wars, players {{represent}} rival gangs, clans, or {{packs of}} humans, vampires, <b>werewolves,</b> angels, zombies, demons, {{and other similar}} creatures. Also included are rules for making mixed gangs consisting of, for example, humans and <b>werewolves.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2008 the BBC Three series Being Human {{became popular}} in Britain. It {{featured}} an unconventional trio of a vampire, a <b>werewolf</b> and a ghost who are sharing a flat in Bristol. Another popular vampire-related show is CW's The Vampire Diaries. The continuing {{popularity of the}} vampire theme has been ascribed {{to a combination of}} two factors: the representation of sexuality and the perennial dread of mortality.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{was born}} in England, {{and grew up in}} Manchester, England. He was later raised in Chicago, Illinois. He grew up around artistic influences; his parents worked as {{performers}} in the circus. From an early age he was motivated to pursue a career in science fiction due to his appreciation for Star Wars. Page was inspired by makeup artist Rick Baker and his film work, including An American <b>Werewolf</b> in London.|$|E
5|$|She {{needs to}} drink the blood of twelve young girls to regain her beauty; ten have already been {{reported}} missing.

The Grimms, with the help of Cavaldi and Angelika (Lena Headey), a knowing huntress from the village, intend to destroy the Mirror Queen.|$|E
5000|$|Centaurs : Former rapists. They seem to {{be natural}} enemies of harpies and <b>werewolves</b> (unless the <b>werewolves</b> that attack them {{may very well be}} simple pawns of lémures who use them to take revenge on centaurs).|$|R
50|$|Calling {{wolves and}} <b>werewolves.</b>|$|R
50|$|A 1591 broadside, Werewolves of Jurich, printed by Georg Kress, {{tells the}} story of the terrorising of the town of Jurich by {{hundreds}} of <b>werewolves</b> and depicts a number of male and female <b>werewolves</b> being executed, including some apparently wearing nun's veils.|$|R
5|$|When Brown started Ed, he {{was largely}} {{influenced}} by the comics {{he had grown up}} with, especially monster stories from Marvel Comics such as <b>Werewolf</b> by Night and Frankenstein's Monster by artists such as Mike Ploog, and from DC Comics such as Swamp Thing by artists such as Bernie Wrightson and Jim Aparo.|$|E
5|$|When Sasha's body {{comes up}} from a well, the <b>werewolf</b> takes her to a tomb. After rescuing Sasha and taking the werewolf's magic axe, the Grimms return to the village. Delatombe captures the {{brothers}} and believes them to be frauds. French soldiers begin burning down the forest, and Cavaldi represses his sympathy to the brothers, but they are eventually saved by Angelika.|$|E
5|$|Although not a {{commercial}} success, it included several short stories by authors such as Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury and Philip K. Dick. The publication {{has been described}} by critics as a successor to the tradition of Unknown, a fantasy magazine that ceased publication in 1943. It was noted for printing fantasy with a rational basis such as <b>werewolf</b> stories that included scientific explanations. A selection of stories from Beyond was published in paperback form in 1963, also under the title Beyond.|$|E
50|$|In the Buffyverse, {{created by}} Joss Whedon, <b>werewolves</b> {{are similar to}} the <b>werewolves</b> of folklore, but rather than being only brutish monsters, they appear as {{characters}} who suffer from lycanthropy, and whose animal side either complements or clashes with their human side.|$|R
50|$|The social {{habits of}} <b>werewolves</b> are {{probably}} the most fully described in the series, both because of Anita and Jean-Claude's association with the wolves and because <b>werewolves</b> appear to be the most prevalent type of shapeshifter, particularly in the St. Louis area.|$|R
50|$|Werewolves {{do not get}} on with vampires. This is {{less to do with}} {{deep-seated}} politico-racial rivalry {{and more}} because the effortless cool of vampires make <b>werewolves</b> feel like hairy animals, and the acceptance into human society of vampires makes <b>werewolves</b> feel even more like outcasts.|$|R
