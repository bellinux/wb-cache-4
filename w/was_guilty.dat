40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{sentences}} like Nixon <b>is</b> <b>guilty,</b> if Haldeman <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> too, first discussed by Soames (1982) and Karttunen and Peters (1979), which raise three problems. First, they are felicitous {{and do not}} appear to have presuppositions. However all major theories of presuppositions predict that they should presuppose what the antecedent presupposes (e. g., the sentence above should presuppose that Nixon <b>is</b> <b>guilty).</b> Second, there <b>is</b> a contrast between these sentences and the corresponding sentence-initial conditionals like if Haldeman <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> too, Nixon <b>is</b> <b>guilty.</b> Finally, a way to solve the problem would be to locally accommodate the presupposition in the antecedent. However, this wrongly predicts tautological truth-conditions. In the case above, the predicted meaning could be paraphrased as “Nixon <b>is</b> <b>guilty,</b> if both Haldeman and Nixon <b>are</b> <b>guilty.</b> ” As a solution to these three problems, I propose that the presupposition is nonetheless locally accommodated in the antecedent and furthermore that the sentence is also interpreted exhaustively, which gives rise to a non-presuppositional and non-tautological meaning analogous to Nixon <b>is</b> <b>guilty,</b> only if both Haldeman and Nixon <b>are</b> <b>guilty.</b> Furthermore, I argue that the degraded status of the sentence-initial case is an independent fact rooted in the topic-focus structure of sentence-final conditionals. Finally, the present proposal can also be extended to treat related non-presuppositional cases like I will go, if we go together. 32 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Bamber's {{case was}} taken up by MPs George Galloway and Andrew Hunter and journalists Bob Woffinden and Eric Allison of The Guardian. Allison {{became one of the}} campaign's patrons. Woffinden argued between 2007 and 2011 that Sheila had shot her family, then watched as police {{gathered}} outside the house before shooting herself. He changed his mind in 2011 and said he believed Bamber <b>was</b> <b>guilty.</b> In 2015 the human-rights campaigner Peter Tatchell appealed to the Chief Constable of Essex Police to disclose all evidence related to the case, in the interests of transparency.|$|E
5|$|Critics cite {{a number}} of {{problems}} with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial. Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved murders and made a premature decision that Frank <b>was</b> <b>guilty,</b> a decision that his personal ambition would not allow him to reconsider. Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{apparently}} expected Elizabeth to {{help her}} regain her throne. Elizabeth was cautious, ordering an inquiry into {{the conduct of the}} confederate lords and the question of whether Mary <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of Darnley's murder. In mid-July 1568, English authorities moved Mary to Bolton Castle, because it was further from the Scottish border but not too close to London. A commission of inquiry, or conference as it was known, was held in York and later Westminster between October 1568 and January 1569. In Scotland, her supporters fought a civil war against Regent Moray and his successors.|$|E

5|$|Stoke {{improved}} {{after the}} break, but Manchester City {{had a key}} opportunity in the 56th minute when a counter-attack led by Carlos Tevez, who drifted out to the right flank, allowed David Silva to find space outside the Stoke City penalty area as the Stoke defence vanished. Tevez managed to pass to Silva, but Silva <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of over-elaboration instead of shooting first-time, and the Stoke City defence managed to regroup, dispossessing Silva before he could adjust himself to shoot at goal.|$|E
5|$|Two {{hours after}} the race, the FIA {{stewards}} for the race issued a statement announcing that Hamilton <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of contravening Article30.3(a) of the 2008 FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and AppendixL, Chapter4, Article2(g) of the International Sporting Code, which both state that cutting a chicane and gaining an advantage is subject to a drive-through penalty. As the race had finished, a 25-second penalty was added to Hamilton's time instead. As {{a result of this}} penalty, Massa was promoted to winner of the Grand Prix, and Hamilton was dropped down to thirdposition.|$|E
5|$|Umar and {{his senate}} {{identified}} this act as misuse of state treasure, {{though not as}} punishing as to lose one's office, Khalid was already warned not act as alone, he should seek permission from his commander or Caliph for such actions. He immediately {{wrote a letter to}} Abu Ubaidah asking him to bring Khalid in front of the congregation, his turban, and take off his cap. Umar wanted Abu Ubaida to ask Khalid from what funds he gave to Ash'as: from his own pocket or from the state treasury? If he confessed to having used the spoils, he <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of misappropriation. If he claimed that he gave from his own pocket, he <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of extravagance. In either case he would be dismissed, and Abu Ubaida would take charge of his duties. Abu Ubaida was himself an admirer of Khalid and loved him as his younger brother, and so said that he was not capable of doing it. Instead, Bilal ibn Ribah was appointed for this task and called back Khalid from Chalcis to Emessa, where he was charged publicly. Khalid stated that he gave money from his own pocket and thus was declared innocent in that charge. However, when he went to Abu Ubaida, he told him that he had been dismissed on the order of Umar and is required to go back to Medina.|$|E

5|$|Winchester was {{the only}} {{defendant}} to face trial on the charges. Winchester's lawyer argued that Smith <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of verbal assault against the defendant, and Winchester was found not guilty. The verdict was reported in The Spectator on March 22, 1825. In 1828 Stephenson left Edwardsville, and moved to Galena in Jo Daviess County where he made his home {{for much of the}} rest of his life.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the police}} were sure murder had taken place, and {{that at least one}} of the four <b>was</b> <b>guilty,</b> they were {{uncertain}} whether they could secure a conviction. Police also suspected there had been other murders committed, but the lack of bodies hampered this line of enquiry. As news of the possibility of other murders came to the public's attention, newspapers began to publish lurid and inaccurate stories of the crimes; speculative reports led members of the public to assume that all missing people had been victims. Janet Brown went to the police and identified her friend Mary Paterson's clothing, while a local baker informed them that Jamie Wilson's trousers were being worn by Constantine Burke's son. On 19 November a warrant for the murder of Jamie Wilson was made against the four suspects.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale's legal {{representative}} was the fellow writer Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, who systematically disproved Caion's allegations, {{and noted that}} the absentee defendant <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of numerous forgeries. He also convinced the judge that the similarities between Năpasta and The Power of Darkness were superficial. The court found Ionescu-Caion guilty of slander. He was sentenced to a three-month jail term, a 500 lei fine and 10,000 lei in court costs. However, he appealed the tribunal's decision. The jury selection was a laborious process: Caion's lawyer Danielopol recused writers Nicolae Iorga and Ovid Densusianu, alleging that all Romanian literati had a vested interest to defend plagiarism. Iorga took offense, and reportedly challenged Danielopol to a duel. During the proceedings, Caion backed up on the original accusations, explaining that he had only invented a reason to bring Caragiale in for a trial. The court eventually acquitted Caion.|$|E

However, if the defendant by the same act fails to kill anyone, defendant <b>is</b> only <b>guilty</b> of a single count of attempted murder by the act.|$|R

5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> and that he hoped she would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he <b>was</b> <b>guilty,</b> that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E
5|$|Marjorie Bowen's 1929 novel Dickon set {{the trend}} for pro-Ricardian literature. Particularly {{influential}} was The Daughter of Time (1951) by Josephine Tey. {{in which a}} modern detective concludes that Richard III is innocent {{in the death of}} the Princes. Other novelists such as Valerie Anand in the novel Crown of Roses (1989) have also offered alternative versions to the theory that he murdered them. Sharon Kay Penman, in her historical novel The Sunne in Splendour, attributes the death of the Princes to the Duke of Buckingham. In the mystery novel The Murders of Richard III by Elizabeth Peters (1974) the central plot revolves around the debate as to whether Richard III <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of these and other crimes. A sympathetic portrayal of Richard III is given in The Founding, the first volume in The Morland Dynasty series by Cynthia Harrod-Eagles.|$|E

The game was delayed after a mistaken call against J. P. Parise, (he was called for interference, but Parise admitted later he <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of cross-checking) and emotions boiled over. Parise was called for a misconduct for banging his stick on the ice, {{and when he saw}} the misconduct called, he dashed across the ice with his stick raised.

5|$|Ferguson was a Jacobite. The {{records of}} the Spalding Club include a soldier's letter which {{indicates}} it is likely Ferguson was willing to offer refuge to Jacobites {{who participated in the}} Battle of Culloden. Jacobite rebels captured from throughout Scotland were taken to stand trial at Carlisle Castle in 1746. Ferguson and fellow advocate Alexander Lockhart argued in their defence. Prosecutors showed little mercy, calling for the rebels to be executed by hanging. Since the prosecution assumed anyone dressed in tartan <b>was</b> <b>guilty,</b> Ferguson and Lockhart had their servants dress in tartan and appear along with the other defendants. They called each other to the stand to testify as to the whereabouts of the servants and proved that, despite their tartan dress, the defendants could not have taken part in the rebellion. Many were found guilty, but the tactic succeeded, as some of the accused were acquitted, including the Laird of Dunfallandy, a kinsman of Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|He {{ended the}} 2005 season on a {{positive}} note by winning the gold medal in the 200m at the World Athletics Final, his first major championship title. His time of 19.96s was his second fastest that year and fourth fastest of any sprinter that season. Although he stated that the quality of the competition and memories of Helsinki had made him nervous beforehand, he went on to beat all three American sprinters he had lost to in the World Championships, becoming the first athlete to beat Gatlin over 200m that season. It was not only his rival sprinters that would cause future difficulties, however, as Gay's coach Brauman was indicted for various crimes relating to his time at Barton College and the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He had helped athletes gain funds and credits that they were not entitled to. Following Gay's testimony, the courts ruled that Brauman <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> and, as a result, Arkansas' two NCAA titles and all of Gay's college track times were annulled. None of the athletes were charged with any wrongdoing. Although he was imprisoned for 10 months, Brauman continued to train Gay, periodically updating him with coaching routines and techniques.|$|E
