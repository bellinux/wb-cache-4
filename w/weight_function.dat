40|$|A {{probability}} <b>weighting</b> <b>function</b> w(p) for {{an objective}} probability p in decision under risk plays {{a pivotal role}} in Kahneman-Tversky's prospect theory. Although recent studies in econophysics and neuroeconomics widely utilized probability <b>weighting</b> <b>functions,</b> psychophysical foundations of the probability <b>weighting</b> <b>functions</b> have been unknown. Notably, a behavioral economist Prelec (1998) axiomatically derived the probability weighting function: w(p) = exp(-(-In p) α) (0 < α < 1; w (0) = 1, w(1 /e) = 1 /e, w(1) = 1), which has extensively been studied in behavioral neuroeconomics. The present study utilizes psychophysical theory to derive Prelec's probability <b>weighting</b> <b>function</b> from psychophysical laws of perceived waiting time in probabilistic choices. Also, the relations between the parameters in the probability <b>weighting</b> <b>function</b> and the probability discounting function in behavioral psychology are derived.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper {{we worked with}} tiles for which there was a <b>weighting</b> <b>function</b> assigned {{to the shape of}} the tiles. The <b>weighting</b> <b>function</b> satisfied a normalization condition. We then associated a quantity we called the “pressure ” to the tilings of a lattice with such tiles. Loosely speaking, the result of the paper was that if we varied the <b>weighting</b> <b>function,</b> letting it get smoother and smoother (that is, more slowly varying), the corresponding pressures approached a limit. The limit was, of course, the pressure associated to the “infinitely smooth <b>weighting</b> <b>function</b> ” a constant function. Herein we continue the statistical mechanics approach one step further. We construct for any <b>weighting</b> <b>function</b> the cluster expansion that arises naturally from treating the difference between the actual <b>weighting</b> <b>function</b> and the infinitely smooth <b>weighting</b> <b>function</b> as a perturbation. We treat the cluster expansion formally and do not prove when the expansion might converge, or be asymptotic. We expect such to happen for <b>weighting</b> <b>functions</b> that 1 are “smooth enough”. We consider the multidimensional dimer problem. For us this is equivalent to computing the pressure when the <b>weighting</b> <b>function</b> is a constant on dimers and zero on other shape tiles, (the constant determined by the normalization condition). We conjecture in this case that the cluster expansion is asymptotic in 1 /d; that is, high dimension equals smoothness, {{for the purposes of the}} cluster expansion. One then would have λd ∼ 1 2 1 c 1 ln(2 d) − + 2 d c 2 d 2 where the ci can be computed from terms in the cluster expansion. The leading term...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we present new <b>weighting</b> <b>functions</b> for the {{anisotropic}} Kuwahara filter. The anisotropic Kuwahara filter is an edge-preserving filter that is especially useful for creating stylized abstractions from images or videos.

For the smoothing process, the anisotropic Kuwahara filter uses <b>weighting</b> <b>functions</b> that use convolution in their definition.
