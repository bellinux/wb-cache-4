5|$|Doggett soon attacks Mulder {{for looking}} into his son's case, but Reyes {{explains}} {{why they are}} investigating. She reveals that Bob Harvey, a suspect in Luke's murder, died in the car crash in New Orleans. Reyes stresses her vision's importance, but Doggett dismisses it. Reyes goes to visit Jeb's sister, Katha, and learns {{he did not know}} Bob Harvey. While Reyes is there, Katha receives a call from Jeb, but tells him to call later. As Jeb leaves the phone booth, he kills a female motorist. Meanwhile, Doggett learns from Scully that she has suffered a placental abruption. He asks her <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> start to believe in the paranormal. She says she realized she was “afraid to believe.” Scully later tells Mulder to keep trying to help Doggett.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} shot in one day in January 2009 in Nashville, Tennessee. Frolicking scenes between Swift and Colletti were filmed first; the lunch, outdoor, and indoor scenes followed. Coincidentally, {{on the day of}} filming, it rained heavily, {{something}} which Swift was enlightened by, since it corresponded to the video's gloomy and dark feel. Swift said it aided in making the video less colorful lighting-wise, and more fixated on muted tones. The last scenes were more difficult for Swift because they involved crying. She attributed the difficulty to the number of people surrounding her and watching, something she was not accustomed to. However, Fanjoy, who was once an actress, guided her into thinking about <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> most solemn, and completing the scene effectively. Fanjoy said the scenes demonstrated what an exceptional actress Swift was, adding she took direction very well. The scene took approximately three hours to film.|$|E
25|$|Albanese {{appeared}} {{in the very first}} live telecast from the Metropolitan Opera, Verdi's Otello, opposite Ramón Vinay and Leonard Warren, conducted by Fritz Busch. One of the first generation of opera singers to appear widely in recordings and on the radio, her performances, now reappearing on both compact disc and video, have provided a lasting testament to her ability. From these recordings, future generations will be able to form some impression of what she was like as a singer and to understand <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> unique as an artist.|$|E

500|$|Grande also {{opined that}} [...] "Baby I" [...] was more [...] "sophisticated" [...] and [...] "mature" [...] and showed off her musicality and vocals {{more than her}} {{previous}} hit single [...] "The Way", {{which was part of}} <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> excited to release the song. It was released as a bonus track for the Japanese version of Grande's sophomore album My Everything, featuring Japanese musician Taro Hakase. The song features new arrangements in the background instrumental, with Hakaro playing violin during the whole song. This version was the second credits theme for the 2014–2015 anime series GO-GO Tamagotchi!, making it the only song in that series not to be sung in Japanese.|$|E
500|$|... "Never Too Far" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Billboard's Chuck Taylor gave a positive review for the song, {{calling it a}} [...] "shimmering ballad" [...] that showcases the singer [...] excelling at <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a famous: [...] "singing {{the hell out of}} a straight ahead love song free of gimmicks, gymnastics and self-conscious attempts at targeting any particular demographic"; he also said that [...] "Never Too Far" [...] would relieve fans that think Carey had been [...] "relying more upon samples and guest vocalists lately than melody and artful performing". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song another [...] "syrupy-sweet" [...] ballad on the album and that it [...] "harbors over-the-top performances worthy of [...] "Star Search" [...] (more than fitting considering the film's '80s-era rags-to-riches storyline)". Harry Guerin from Raidió Teilifís Éireann wrote that [...] "Never Too Far" [...] showcased [...] "her four octave range but sound roughly like everything else she's committed to tape during her career".|$|E
500|$|Cher has {{employed}} various musical styles, including folk rock, pop rock, power ballads, disco, {{new wave}} music, rock music, punk rock, arena rock, and hip hop; {{she said she}} has done this to [...] "remain relevant and do work that strikes a chord". Her music has mainly dealt with themes of heartbreak, independence, and self-empowerment for women; by doing so, she became [...] "a brokenhearted symbol of a strong but decidedly single woman", according to Out magazine's Judy Wieder. Goldmine magazine's Phill Marder credited Cher's [...] "nearly flawless" [...] song selection as <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a notorious rock singer; while several of her early songs were penned by or sung with Sonny Bono, most of her solo successes, which outnumbered Sonny and Cher's successes, were composed by independent songwriters, selected by Cher. Not.com.mercial (2000), the singer's first album mostly written by herself, presents a [...] "1970s singer-songwriter feel" [...] that proves [...] "Cher adept {{in the role of}} storyteller", according to AllMusic's Jose F. Promis.|$|E

2500|$|During Clarkson's live web cast on August 30, 2011 {{she stated}} <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> title the album Stronger was [...] "mainly because the entire album {{is very much}} about {{empowerment}} and just strength overall and I love singing songs like that... That {{was kind of the}} theme -strength- so we named it Stronger." [...] She also named it Stronger because it comes from a lyric from one of her favorite tracks on the album, initially called [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)". [...] "It just kind of encompasses the whole theme for the album", Clarkson commented.|$|E
2500|$|When asked <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> singing style unique, {{she once}} said [...] "my feeling for a lyric, I'm a storyteller and I {{try to have}} {{excellent}} diction so you don't have to guess what I'm saying. Some people listen to a song for years and don't know what the lyric is." [...] In 1965 while listening to “Violets For Your Furs” by Billie Holiday, Alexandria said:"There’s not too much left to say about Billie Holiday, {{how is it possible}} for a woman to be this great? This comes from a period when she wasn’t supposed to be singing too well but I’ve never heard anything by her that I didn’t realize what she was feeling which is very important regardless of the shape of the pipes or what may be happening [...] She always got the message across. She never failed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first story}} arc of The Fearless Defenders {{came to a}} close with issue #6 in July 2013. Bunn said, [...] "The first arc has {{definitely}} been very Asgardian. That's just the nature of doing a story about Valkyrie. As we go into the next arc, I take the opportunity to show that there are stories for this team in any number of environments... Issues #7-#12, while they tell a complete story, we're going to do a series of done-in-one stories with those issues. Each of those issues will be pretty good jumping-on points for anybody." [...] Issue #6 also featured the death of Annabelle Riggs, who Newsarama called [...] "one of Marvel's few prominent lesbian characters", which drew a strong reaction from fans. In response Bunn wrote, [...] "the fact that she was a lesbian didn’t even enter the equation for me, except that it was part of <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> who she was — just one part of many" [...] with Pyle adding, [...] "I feel very strongly that her sacrifice was very true to everything we love about her. As to whether {{the fact that she is}} a lesbian should have kept us from telling a story in which she died… in this particular case, not having this specific character sacrifice herself would have made for a story in which we were less emotionally invested." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{while she}} sang, {{something}} fell {{on my hand}} that caused me to sit up and insist on examining her eyes. She laughed; rather a strange, broken little laugh, I thought, {{and said it was}} nothing, and told me to lie still and go to sleep. So I wriggled down again and shut my eyes tight, but I could not understand <b>what</b> had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> cry.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{there she}} comes;' and he hastened to join Cecily, while the deserted Bertha, {{coming up to}} her sister, muttered, 'Wretched girl! I hear she had written to him to fetch her home. That was <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> stay so quietly, was it?' ...|$|E

6000|$|By this time, Elina was {{thoroughly}} frightened.
