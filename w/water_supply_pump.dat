25|$|In 1859, the Pensioner Scheme was {{abandoned}} by the British government and ownership of Fort Malden {{was turned over to}} the province of Ontario. On June 8, 1859, an Order in Council within the Ontario government determined that Fort Malden would be recommissioned as a provincial insane asylum. Fort Malden was one of many examples where prior ordnance lands were repurposed by order of the province to become asylums, hospitals, or prisons, as these prior forts already possessed many fortified buildings and defences suited for institutional facilities.

However, many of Fort Malden’s buildings had been relatively neglected and so much of the first couple years of the Fort’s history as an asylum was allotted to necessary reconstruction. This remodeling was performed primarily under the architectural supervision of Kivas Tully who used several of the patients as labourers to help build and remodel the asylum's structures. Some of the early remodeling was concerned with repairing the barracks to serve as separate wings for the male and female patients, as well as converting the brick hospital into a kitchen, with the guard house becoming the porter’s apartment, used to house the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pump,</b> and the officer’s quarters becoming the home of the doctor’s family.|$|E
50|$|By January 1926 a large, level site off Johnston Road, {{about half}} a mile (0.8 km) {{south-west}} of the centre of Mossman, had been acquired for the new hospital. A plan of the proposed hospital layout for the site was prepared by Public Works in April 1926, positioning the main building close to the centre of the site, facing east, and accessed from Hospital Street. To the north of the main building, connected via a covered way, were the nurses' quarters, and to south, also connected via a covered way, the maternity ward. At the western side of the site, and not physically connected to the main building, were a number of ancillary buildings, structures and facilities: a doctor's residence (with private driveway off Johnston Road), tennis court, wardsman's quarters, <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pump</b> house, drying green, laundry and powerhouse, incinerator, and morgue. The buildings were spaced well apart, to allow for future expansion on the site.|$|E

Consequently, there is a constant need of energy efficiency improvements that could be achieved by decreasing of energy losses, smart and efficient energy utilization and conservation of energy resources. The water supply systems are large energy consumers. So, the investments in the increasing of their energy efficiency will not only have an economic dimension, but also they could have large positive effect on the environment protection.

In addition, a hydraulic model was employed to analyze the behavior of air pockets located at high points of the pipeline...|$|R
50|$|The town of Foxborough, initial an {{agricultural}} town, grew as an industrial {{center in the}} 19th century, specializing {{in the manufacture of}} straw hats. The town's industrial owners and the rise in population led to the need for a reliable public <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> for improved public health and the fire protection of important industrial assets. After a report on the matter was issued in 1879, it lay dormant until 1889, when proposals were made after the construction of the Foxborough State Hospital renewed calls for improved fire protection. A proposal for the present siting of the station was approved by the town in 1891. Ernest Boyden, then already known for his designs of other public <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pumping</b> stations, was retained to design the new facility. Twenty-four shallow wells were dug to draw groundwater, which the main pump then distributed. In 1948 these were replaced by three deep wells, which draw from the aquifer underlying the Neponset Reservoir. A fourth well was drilled in 1972, replacing the #2 well, whose casing had cracked.|$|R

40|$|Eighteen years ago, in Portugal, the {{expenses}} in a <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> system associated with energy consumption were quite low.

Also, new governmental policies, essentially in developed countries, are trying to implement renewable energies. For these reasons, a case-study in Portugal of a water pumping system was analysed to operate connected to solar and wind energy sources. A stand-alone and a grid-connected systems were tested. The stand alone was compared with the cost of extending the national electric grid. In the grid-connected system two solutions were analysed, one with a water turbine and another without. To be able to implement a water turbine, a larger water pump was needed to pump the necessary water as for consumption as for energy production. For the case analysed the system without a water turbine proved to be more cost-effective because the energy tariff is not yet so competitive as well as the cost of water turbines.
