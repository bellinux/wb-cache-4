5|$|Campbell died in 1971 {{at the age}} of 61 in Mountainside, New Jersey.

5|$|Culturally, Black Sabbath have exerted a huge {{influence}} in both television and literature and have {{in many cases}} become synonymous with heavy metal. In the film Almost Famous, Lester Bangs gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band (plot point one) with the immortal line: 'Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath'. Contemporary music and arts publication Trebuchet Magazine has put this to practice by asking all new <b>writers</b> <b>to</b> write a short piece (500 words) on Black Sabbath {{as a means of}} proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject.|$|E

5|$|In England, ain't is {{generally}} considered a non-standard or illiterate usage, as it is used by speakers of a lower socio-economic class, or by educated people in an informal manner. In the nineteenth century, ain't was often used by <b>writers</b> <b>to</b> denote regional dialects such as Cockney English. Ain't is a non-standard feature commonly found in mainstream Australian English, and in New Zealand, ain't is a feature of Maori-influenced English. In American English, usage of ain't corresponds to a middle level of education, although {{it is widely believed}} that its use establishes of lack of education or social standing in the speaker.|$|E

5|$|In time, Prus {{adopted the}} French Positivist critic Hippolyte Taine's {{concept of the}} arts, {{including}} literature, as a second means, alongside the sciences, of studying reality, and he devoted more attention to his sideline of short-story writer. Prus' stories, which met with great acclaim, owed much to the literary influence of Polish novelist Józef Ignacy Kraszewski and, among English-language <b>writers,</b> <b>to</b> Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. His fiction would also be influenced by French writers Victor Hugo, Gustave Flaubert, Alphonse Daudet and Émile Zola.|$|E
