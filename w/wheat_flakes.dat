50|$|In 1902 Force <b>wheat</b> <b>flakes</b> {{became the}} first ready-to-eat breakfast cereal {{introduced}} into the United Kingdom. The cereal, and the Sunny Jim character, achieved wide success in Britain, at its peak in 1930 selling 12.5 million packages in one year. In the 1930s, the first puffed cereal, Kix, went on the market. After World War II, the big breakfast cereal companies - now including General Mills, who entered the market in 1924 with Wheaties - increasingly started to target children. The flour was refined to remove fiber, {{which at the time}} was considered to undermine digestion and absorption of nutrients, and sugar was added to improve the flavor for children. The new breakfast cereals began to look starkly different from their ancestors. As one example, Kellogg's Sugar Smacks, created in 1953, had 56% sugar by weight. Different mascots were introduced, such as the Rice Krispies elves and later pop icons like Tony the Tiger and the Trix Rabbit.|$|E

By 1925, Wheaties had become the [...] "Breakfast of Champions". In 1928, four milling companies consolidated as the General Mills Company in Minneapolis. The new firm expanded packaged food sales with heavy advertising, including sponsorship of radio programs such as [...] "Skippy", [...] "Jack Armstrong, The All-American Boy", and baseball games. Jack Dempsey, Johnny Weissmuller, and others verified the [...] "Breakfast of Champions" [...] slogan. By 1941 Wheaties had won 12% percent of the cereal market. Experiments with the puffing process produced Kix, a puffed corn cereal, and Cheerios, a puffed oats cereal. Further product innovation and diversification brought total General Mills sales to over $500 million annually (18% in packaged foods) by the early 1950s.|$|E

40|$|The {{capability}} of lower filamentous fungi to utilize and to enrich cereals with -linolenic acid (GLA) by solid state fermentation was investigated. Thamnidium elegans {{was selected as}} a production strain {{and a variety of}} cereal materials were tested with the emphasis on achieving cereal-based bioproducts with high GLA content. It was found that dry substrate/water mass ratio of 1 : 1. 5 was optimal for GLA formation.

The study revealed that linoleic acid in substrates mixed with SMG was more efficiently transformed to GLA than without SMG. Similarly, an increase in the concentration of linoleic acid in fatty acids of substrates mixed with SMG was accompanied by direct GLA accumulation in bioproduct. Fungal growth on the mixture of wheat bran and SMG (3 : 1) and on the mixture of spelt <b>wheat</b> <b>flakes</b> and SMG (3 : 1) resulted in maximal level of GLA in fatty acids (13 – 14 %).

T- 2 toxin belongs to the closely related sesquiterpenoid family of thrichotecenes and is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis. Its main effects are usually observed in the immune system which has strong impact {{on the health of}} both humans and animals.

The area between the blood glucose response curve and baseline from 0 to 180 min was not significantly different between meals, 0 – 120 min areas were significantly reduced by KF and/or guar. Area from 120 to 180 min was positive for KF, guar, and KF+guar, while the area for the WB meal was negative. Hunger at 180 min was significantly reduced by KF and/or guar when compared with WB.
