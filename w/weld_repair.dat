DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The {{procedure for}} crack-free <b>welding,</b> <b>repair</b> <b>welding</b> or surface welding of metallic parts (1, 2) made of materials that are prone to forming hot cracks by laser welding process at high power density and with local temperature impact with welding speed in a constant distance for welding zone (4), comprises locally applying a temperature by two parallel or nearly parallel temperature fields (9, 10), which extend along the welding direction, are electromagnetically generated by a volume energy source inside the parts, both begin in front of the welding zone in the welding direction, and of which the maximum temperatures are reached outside the heat affected zone and behind the freezing zone in the welding direction. Plasma-, tungsten inert-gas- or wolfram-inert-gas process and/or non-vac-electron beam welding process serves as welding process. The temperature fields are produced through inductive heating. The depth of the both temperature fields, its interval and its expansion is adjusted through the induction frequency, the length and interval of both inductor detents (18, 19), the addition of magnetic field strengthening elements and inductive power. The weld seam is arranged in symmetrical warm discharge condition of the both component and in same materials of the both temperature field symmetrical to the position. The both temperature fields are differently formed in its expansion, depth and height of the temperature maxima of Tmax 1 and/or Tmax 2 in different material and/or unsymmetrical warm discharge condition of the both components.

40|$|A major dilemma {{facing the}} nuclear {{industry}} is repair or replacement of stainless steel reactor components that {{have been exposed to}} neutron irradiation. When conventional fusion welding is used for <b>weld</b> <b>repair,</b> the high temperatures and thermal stresses inherent in the process enhance the growth of helium bubbles, causing intergranular cracking in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). Friction stir processing (FSP) has potential as a <b>weld</b> <b>repair</b> technique for irradiated stainless steel, because it operates at much lower temperatures than fusion welding, and is therefore less likely to cause cracking in the HAZ. Numerical simulation of the FSP process in 304 L stainless steel was performed using an Eulerian finite element approach.

Temperature predictions in three locations adjacent to the stir zone were accurate to within 4 % of experimentally measure values.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate the efficacy of different <b>weld</b> <b>repair</b> techniques as applied to service-aged 2 -l/ 4 Cr-lMo steel weldments. A header which had been in service for 244, 000 h at 1050 °F (565 °C) was utilized for the study. Three girth welds were partially excavated and subjected to repairs using gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) with postweld heat treatment (PWHT), and without postweld heat treatment using a temperbead technique. Results show that all the weld repairs improved the creep rupture lives of the ex-service weldments and that remaining lives of several decades could be achieved in the repaired condition. The SMAW-temperbead repairs resulted in increase of rupture life, tensile strength, and impact toughness compared to the SMAW-PWHT repairs. The GTAW-PWHT repairs also produced a superior combination of mechanical properties. Remaining creep rupture lives were a function of the extrapolation procedure and specimen ' size.

The effect of homogenization on <b>weld</b> <b>repair</b> was also examined. The homogenization heat treatment temperatures ranged from 1050 °C to 1200 °C with 1 hr, 5 hrs and 10 hrs dwell times. The degree of homogenization was measured as the reduction of the amount of Laves phase by manual point counting in an optical microscope at high magnification. Longer range, interdendritic, patterns were established through line scan EDS analysis in SEM. It was found that short time (1 hr) does not significantly reduce the amount of Laves phase whereas 5 hrs and 10 hrs are much more efficient.
