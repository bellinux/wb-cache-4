40|$|ABSTRACT The present paper {{describes}} a new numerical procedure {{devoted to the}} calculation of aeronautic engines and to the fatigue life assessment evaluation. The original aspects consists (1) in a new method {{used to determine the}} mechanical steady state of a structure under thermomechanical loading, (2) in a short review of an advanced fatigue model which can reproduce the <b>Woehler</b> <b>curve,</b> including the influence of the mean stress...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} eight {{methods for}} presenting fatigue test results for variable amplitude loading and their comparison with constant amplitude loading. While the maximum amplitude method compares constant and variable amplitude loading results by the Woehler and Gassner curves, all other seven methods try {{to transform the}} variable amplitude results into the <b>Woehler</b> <b>curve</b> by applying different equations. The advantage of the maximum amplitude method is the direct comparison of the maximum amplitude of the spectrum with the yield strength and with the high-cycle fatigue strength, which {{is an important step}} in structural design. Among the other methods, the best results were obtained by following: most damaging, half damage and mean damage amplitudes. However, the presentation of constant and variable amplitude results by these methods in one scatter band is possible only when the real damage sum is close to D = 1. 0...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHigh {{temperature}} {{operational conditions}} of hot work tool steels induce several thermomechanical loads. Depending on the processes, (i. e: forging, die casting or extrusion), stress, strain, strain rate and temperature levels applied {{on the material}} are nevertheless very different. Thus, lifetime prediction models {{need to be able}} to take into account a broad range of working conditions. In this paper, a non-isothermal continuum damage model is identified for a widely used hot work tool steel AISI H 11 (X 38 CrMoV 5) with a nominal hardness of 47 HRc. This investigation is based on an extensive high temperature low cycle fatigue data base performed under strain rate controlled conditions with and without dwell times in the temperature range 300 • C- 600 • C. As analysis of experimental results does not reveal significant time dependent damage mechanisms, only a fatigue damage component was activated in the model formulation. After normalization, all fatigue results are defined on a master <b>Woehler</b> <b>curve</b> defined by a non-linear damage model, which allows the parameter identification. Last, a validation stage of the model is performed from thermomechanical fatigue tests.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general theory for the estimations {{of an entire}} fatigue curve in ductile materials based on the implicit gradient approach. In order to modify {{the slope of the}} <b>Woehler</b> <b>curves,</b> the material was considered non-linear. The average stress of the hysteresis loop was taken into account by means of Walker's model. Subsequently, the implicit gradient method was adopted for the numerical evaluation of the effective stress and strain at low- and medium-cycle fatigue life and was then related to the fatigue strength of the material. The characteristic length, relating to the fatigue behaviour of the material, was considered constant for the fatigue lifetime. In order to confirm the proposed method, new experimental data were obtained, relating to axisymmetric notched specimens loaded with nominal stress ratio R = - 1 and R = 0. In terms of the effective strain amplitude, evaluated by means of the implicit gradient approach, the different <b>Woehler</b> <b>curves</b> of notched specimens were summarised in a unique fatigue curve as a function of Walker's cycle parameter...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{contribute}} to the formulation of well-founded test methods and test criteria for laser welded thick steel plates, <b>Woehler</b> fatigue test <b>curves</b> have been determined. Finite element and border element calculations were applied to life expectancy prediction using the notch tension concept by Radaj/Seeger and the fracture mechnical calculation of stable crack propagation.

A characteristic feature of laser welded T-butt seams consists in the comparatively low a-parameter.

40|$|Glued-in rods are an {{effective}} method to form timber connections that are increasingly {{in the focus}} of research. Compared to steel rods, fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars provide higher resistance against corrosion, reduced weight and lower heat conductivity. Despite excellent mechanical performance, high fire resistance and improved aesthetics, they are, however, not yet widely used {{due to lack of}} design regulation. This is particularly true for cyclic loads, where determination of fatigue characteristics depends upon time intensive experimental procedures. In this research, 50 glued-in FRP rod specimens with different embedment lengths were manufactured and tested in uni-axial tension; a first set under quasi-static load, a second set under cyclic load. For the fatigue tests, a new approach based on a stepwise load increase was used to estimate fatigue strength, a method that aims at reducing the experimental effort usually associated with <b>Woehler</b> <b>curves.</b> Experimental results indicated that quasi-static and fatigue strength increased with the overlap length up to an apparent maximum. The estimated fatigue strength from the load increase tests was approx. 41 % of the quasi-static strength. Additionally, constant amplitude tests were performed and the obtained data points fit well into established <b>Woehler</b> <b>curves</b> for timber...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{evaluate}} the weldability of materials which are difficult to joint by conventional methods using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Because high strength aluminium alloys found increased interest for applications in the automobile and aircraft industry the research was focussed on the welding of the age hardenable alloys AlMgSi 1, AlCuMg 1 and AlZnMgCu 1, 5. Welding was conducted with and without filter. Only for the alloy AlZnMgCu 1, 5 {{the use of a}} filler was essential to achieve a good joint. The tensile strength of AlMgSi 1 joints reached 64 % of the value for the base material thus exceeding the tensile strength of TIG- and WIG-welded joints. With a subsequent heat treatment (solutionizing and age hardening) the tensile strength was increased up to 71 %. For the alloy AlCuMg 1 values of 61 and 86 % respectively were achieved. Welding with filler led to a further increase of the tensile strength (approximately 10 % compared to the values of joints welded without filler). For AlMgSi 1 an AlSi 12 filler was best whereas for AlCuMg 1 and AlZnMgCu 1, 5 the addition of AlMg 5 led to better results. The fatigue strength of AlMgSi 1 and AlCuMg 1 joints drops to values 40 to 60 % below those of the base material. Considering that the joints were tested in the as-welded condition this decrease is not dramatical. Moreover, the variance is low. However, the AlZnMgCu 1, 5 joints were notch-sensitive and due to an extreme variance no <b>Woehler</b> <b>curve</b> could be determined. Therefore Nd:YAG laser welded joints of this alloy cannot be recommended for applications were fatigue resistance is required. (orig.)

40|$|The {{increase}} in trains velocity and {{the improvement of}} comfort on railways belong to both the improvement of vehicles performances and {{to the use of}} the long welded rail (LWR). The analysis of the thermal set-up of the track is fundamental for the sake of the railway transport network performances: it basically deals with the changes in spans and strains occurring daily after temperature ranges. This phenomenon is described by the free dilatation law for tracks without bonds and by the stopped dilatation law for completely constrained tracks. The thermal analysis of the LWR shows a cyclic soliciting phenomenon belonging to both the daily temperature ranges and to the effects of moving vehicles: from this point of view a repetition of strains which involves an appropriate fatigue verification of the railways can be identified. For this reason the authors propose a procedure based on the synergic application of the Woehler construction theory for the fatigue curves and of the Miner law of linear accumulation. Once the Woehler curves are found as function of the different stress state due to the thermal variations and to the moving vehicles passing, the comprehensive damage for both kinds of strains can be quantified by means of the Miner theory. For this purpose the authors propose the implementation of a calculation software which can automate the thermal lay-out analysis phase, performing the <b>Woehler</b> <b>curve,</b> the internal stresses computation and the damage analysis following Miner’s law. In conclusion, this research is an useful tool for an effective maintenance of the LWR, as it allows the monitoring of the stress state of tracks, especially during the last part of their life cycle, when the temperature range and the moving vehicles passage consequences are more severe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Stress-controlled load {{increase}} and constant amplitude tests {{have been carried}} out in a temperature range of- 60 °C < T < 20 °C at the aluminium alloy AlMg 4. 5 Mn (EN AW- 5083). Therefore a recently developed climate chamber which operates with liquid nitrogen was mounted on a servo-hydraulic fatigue testing machine to realize the required low temperatures. Beside conventional mechanical hysteresis measurements, electrical resistance and temperature measurements are used to characterize the fatigue behavior. Furthermore, with these methods, the endurance limit was successfully estimated in a {{load increase}} test. <b>Woehler</b> <b>curves</b> were determined with constant amplitude tests at different temperatures. The conventionally determined endurance limit corresponds with the value from the load increase test...|$|R
40|$|For life {{tests on}} PVC-U pipes <b>Woehler</b> <b>curves</b> were {{determined}} {{at a constant}} R-value (R= 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6). Investigations include the effect of an intermediate tempering at 60 C. The hard- and software applied for the dynamical tests allow not only the record of strengths {{but at the same}} time also the record of sample deformation. From the measured hysteresis values the beginning of the damage, e. g. by crack formation, can be derived. Hysteresis values are more sensitive to starting damages than deformation values. Parameters effecting hysteresis and crack formation during test conditions are discussed. The obtained results can be used for the dimensioning of plastic pipes.

40|$|Timber as a {{structural}} material {{has experienced a}} revival for aspects related to sustainability, positive effect on interior building and increased architectural possibilities. To overcome a series of limitations related to partly obsolete traditional techniques, timber engineering sets high expectations on adhesive bonding as a joining method. Research on adhesively bonded timber joints has proven their superiority over mechanical fasteners {{in terms of strength}} and stiffness. Research on methods to design adhesively bonded timber joints under static loads is currently ongoing and significant progress has already been achieved. The topic of fatigue behaviour, however, has only been addressed very rarely, largely because “classical” methods for fatigue assessment based on <b>Woehler</b> <b>curves,</b> is extremely time-consuming. This paper aims to fill this gap by describing and validating an advanced time- and cost-efficient approach to quantify the behaviour of bonded timber joints under fatigue. Therefore the fatigue behaviour of beech wood as base material and adhesively bonded beech wood joints as structural elements were investigated by means of a short-time procedure. In this approach, cyclic tests with a stepwise increase of the stress amplitude were performed while the plastic strain amplitude was measured. The plastic strain amplitude gives reliable signals for an estimation of the fatigue strength. This is validated by traditional cyclic tests with constant stress amplitudes. It could be shown that the testing approach provides reliable results and has a high potential in time and cost savings for wood and adhesively bonded wood joints...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe current paper {{focuses on}} the cast irons EN-GJL- 250 (ASTM A 48 35 B), EN-GJS- 600 (ASTM 80 - 55 - 06) and EN-GJV- 400, which are often used as {{structural}} materials for internal combustion engines and components of the wheel suspension and in the wind energy industry, e. g. for rotor hubs. Light and scanning electron microscopic investigations were done to characterise the individual microstructure, e. g. different graphite precipitates, in particular lamellar graphite (EN-GJL- 250), nodular graphite (EN-GJS- 600) and compacted graphite (EN-GJV- 400). In stress-controlled load increase and constant amplitude tests at ambient temperature, mechanical stress-strain hysteresis, temperature and electrical resistance measurements were performed to characterise the fatigue behaviour of the investigated materials. All measured data depend on microstructural changes due to plastic deformation processes in {{the bulk of the}} specimens and the interfaces between matrix and graphite. This data represent the actual fatigue state. The cyclic deformation behaviour is dominated by cyclic hardening processes and graphite-matrix debonding. The physically based fatigue life calculation method “PHYBAL” was modified to the specific requirements of more inhomogeneous materials like cast irons. On the basis of fatigue data determined in only nine fatigue tests, the enhanced method “PHYBALSB” allows the calculation of <b>Woehler</b> (S-N) <b>curves</b> for different probabilities of failure (Scatter-Bands). This shorttime procedure results in a reduction in experimental time up to 90 % and leads to enormous scientific and economic advantages...|$|R
