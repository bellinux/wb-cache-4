40|$|With {{the recent}} change in social policy {{allowing}} women to enter combat roles:, {{the issue of}} <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the military has gained much attention. Although women have served the U. S. in every war since the Revolutionary War (although not always <b>in</b> <b>uniform),</b> the contemporary debate about <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the military is being addressed again {{in the press and}} on Capitol Hill. This project addresses the cost of having <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the U. S. military. Specifically, I will compare the relative cost of men and <b>women</b> serving <b>in</b> the armed forces. My hypothesis is that, today, the marginal cost of sustaining a <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> is less than the marginal cost of sustaining a man...|$|R
500|$|The National Anthem Act {{specifies}} {{the lyrics}} and melody of [...] "O Canada", placing {{both of them}} in the public domain, allowing the anthem to be freely reproduced or used as a base for derived works, including musical arrangements. There are no regulations governing the performance of [...] "O Canada", leaving citizens to exercise their best judgment. When it is performed at an event, traditional etiquette is to either start or end the ceremonies with the anthem, including situations when other anthems are played, and for the audience to stand during the performance. Civilian men usually remove their hats, while women and children are not required to do so. Military men and <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> traditionally keep their hats on and offer the military salute during the performance of the anthem, with the salute offered {{in the direction of the}} Maple Leaf Flag if one is present, and if not present it is offered standing at attention.|$|E
500|$|Hunter {{participated in}} the November 28, 2007 CNN/YouTube GOP Debate, and notably, {{received}} {{a question about the}} military's [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy. The questioner, former Brig. Gen. Keith Kerr introduced himself as a homosexual and asked [...] "...why you [...] think that American men and <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> are not professional enough to serve with gays and lesbians?" [...] Hunter thanked the general for his service and then argued that the sole issue was [...] "unit cohesion," [...] mirroring a statement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell. After the debate, Kerr was found {{to be a member of}} Hillary Clinton's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Americans For Hillary Steering Committee. Because of this, CNN removed footage of the question from future telecasts. The next day, Hunter sent a letter to Hillary Clinton that read: [...] "Dear Hillary Clinton, Regarding the [...] "plant", retired Brig. Gen. Keith H. Kerr, that you sent to ask me the question at the CNN-YouTube debate last night in Florida. Send more!!! Merry Christmas, Duncan Hunter." [...] The Hillary Clinton campaign did not respond to the letter.|$|E
500|$|In May 1941, Representative Edith Nourse Rogers of Massachusetts {{introduced}} {{a bill in the}} U.S. Congress to establish a Women's Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC). [...] "As the word auxiliary suggests, women would serve not in the Army, but with it." [...] As such, women were deprived of full military status and denied the benefits of their male counterparts. Opposition delayed the passage of the bill until May 1942. At the same time, the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics believed the Navy would eventually need <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform,</b> and had asked the Bureau of Naval Personnel, headed by Rear Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, to propose legislation, as it had done during World War I, authorizing women to serve in the Navy. [...] Nimitz was not considered an advocate for bringing women into the Navy, nor was he about to change course. [...] Soon, the Navy Department began receiving inquires whether WAAC legislation for the Navy might be imminent. In response, the head of the U.S. Naval Reserve expressed the view that the Civil Service would be able to supply any extra personnel that might be needed.|$|E

500|$|In 1882, the U.S. Navy {{consisted}} of many outdated ship designs. Over the next decade, Congress approved building multiple modern steel-hulled armored cruisers and battleships, and by around {{the start of}} the 20th century had moved from twelfth place in 1870 to fifth place in terms of numbers of ships. After winning two major battles during the 1898 Spanish–American War, the American Navy continued to build more ships, {{and by the end of}} World War I had more men and <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> than the British Royal Navy. The Washington Naval Conference of [...] 1921 recognized the Navy as equal in capital ship size to the Royal Navy, and during the 1920s and 1930s, the Navy built several aircraft carriers and battleships. The Navy was drawn into World War II after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, and over the next four years fought many historic battles including the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway, multiple naval battles during the Guadalcanal Campaign, and the largest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Much of the Navy's activity concerned the support of landings, not only with the [...] "island-hopping" [...] campaign in the Pacific, but also with the European landings. When the Japanese surrendered, a large flotilla entered Tokyo Bay to witness the formal ceremony conducted on the battleship , on which officials from the Japanese government signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. By the end of the war, the Navy had over 1,600 warships.|$|E

2500|$|On June 8, 2007, Gates {{announced}} that he would not recommend the renomination of Peter Pace, the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, due to anticipated difficulties with the confirmation process. Instead, Gates recommended Mike Mullen, the Chief of Naval Operations at the time, to fill the position. Gates stated: [...] "I am no stranger to contentious confirmations, and I do not shrink from them. However, I have decided that at this moment in our history, the nation, our men and <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform,</b> and General Pace himself would not be well-served by a divisive ordeal in selecting the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff." [...] Gates referred to Pace as a friend and praised his service as a Marine.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, most male African American {{soldiers}} still {{served only}} as truck drivers and as stevedores (except for some separate tank battalions and Army Air Forces escort fighters). African American <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> answered {{the call of}} duty by tending the wounded as nurses, or working as riveters, mail clerks, file clerks, typists, stenographers, supply clerks, or motor pool drivers. In the midst of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, General Eisenhower was severely short of replacement troops for existing all-white companies. Consequently, he made the decision to allow 2000 black servicemen volunteers to serve in segregated platoons under the command of white lieutenants to replenish these companies. These platoons would serve with distinction and, according to an Army survey in the summer of 1945, 84% were ranked [...] "very well" [...] and 16% were ranked [...] "fairly well". [...] No black platoon received a ranking of [...] "poor" [...] by those white officers or white soldiers that fought with them. [...] Unfortunately, these platoons were often subject to racist treatment by white military units in occupied Germany and were quickly sent back to their old segregated units after the end of hostilities in Germany. [...] Despite their protests, these brave African American soldiers ended the war in their old non-combat service units. [...] Though largely forgotten after the war, the temporary experiment with black combat troops proved a success - a small, but important step toward permanent integration during the Korean War. A total of 708 African Americans were killed in combat during World War II.|$|E

This isn't an Xbox game. There are real repercussions to Bush's folly. That said, I feel nothing over the death of merceneries [...] They aren't in Iraq because of orders, or because they are there trying to help the people make Iraq a better place. They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them." [...] In a blog post the next day, Moulitsas defended and clarified his remarks:"My language was harsh, and, in reality, not true. Fact is, I did feel something. That's why I was so angry. I was angry that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts. I was angry that 51 American soldiers paid the ultimate price for Bush's folly in Iraq in March alone. I was angry that these mercenaries make more in a day than our brave men and <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> make in an entire month. I was angry that the US is funding private armies, paying them $30,000 per soldier, per month, while the Bush administration tries to cut our soldiers' hazard pay. I was angry that these mercenaries would leave their wives and children behind to enter a war zone on their own violition [...] So I struck back." ...|$|E
