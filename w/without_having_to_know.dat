25|$|An often-used {{analogy to}} explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the phone book for the Internet by {{translating}} human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses. For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to the addresses 93.184.216.119 (IPv4) and 2606:2800:220:6d:26bf:1447:1097:aa7 (IPv6). Unlike a phone book, DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue {{to use the same}} host name.

It was held by the House of Lords in AF, applying the decision of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights A. v. United Kingdom (2009), that a person accused of terrorism against whom a control order has been issued must be given sufficient information about the allegations against him to enable him to give effective instructions to his special advocate. If this requirement is satisfied, a fair hearing can be conducted without detailed disclosure of confidential information that might compromise national security. On the facts of the case, a special advocate was not permitted further contact with an applicant or his ordinary legal representatives except with permission of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) after viewing confidential (or [...] "closed") materials. The House of Lords recognized that although a special advocate's usefulness is stymied somewhat from having no further instructions after viewing such materials, if the SIAC decides to issue a control order predominantly on the basis of non-confidential (or [...] "open") materials, an applicant cannot be regarded as having been denied an opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of the government's beliefs and suspicions about him. If the evidence against the applicant is largely closed but allegations contained in open material are sufficiently specific, an applicant should be able to provide his legal representatives and special advocate with information to refute it (such as an alibi, if the open material alleges he was at a certain place during a certain period) <b>without</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the detail or sources of the closed evidence. However, if the evidence revealed to the person consists only of general assertions and the case against him is based solely or to a substantive extent on undisclosed adverse evidence, the fair hearing rule under natural justice will not be satisfied.|$|E

40|$|Popular {{discourse}} on constitutional interpretation and judicial review tend {{to employ a}} series of catch phrases that have become constitutional clichés. Phrases such as “judicial activism,” “judicial restraint,” “strict construction,” “not legislating from the bench,” “Framers’ intent,” the “dead hand of the past,” and “stare decisis” so dominate public commentary on the Constitution and the courts that quite often that is all one hears.

In short, they have become clichés. In this Essay, the author explains why these clichés should be abandoned even in casual conversation. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that several of them are connected by a common thread: the apparent desire by commentators to avoid substantive constitutional argument in favor of a process-based analysis that can be easily leveled {{in the absence of any}} expertise on the issues raised by a particular case.

40|$|Abstract Background Computer {{languages}} can be domain-related, and in {{the case}} of multidisciplinary projects, knowledge of several languages will be needed in order to quickly implements ideas. Moreover, each computer language has relative strong points, making some languages better suited than others for a given task to be implemented. The Bioconductor project, based on the R language, has become a reference for the numerical processing and statistical analysis of data coming from high-throughput biological assays, providing a rich selection of methods and algorithms to the research community. At the same time, Python has matured as a rich and reliable language for the agile development of prototypes or final implementations, as well as for handling large data sets. Results The data structures and functions from Bioconductor can be exposed to Python as a regular library. This allows a fully transparent and native use of Bioconductor from Python, <b>without</b> one <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the R language and with only a small community of translators required <b>to</b> <b>know</b> both. <b>To</b> demonstrate this, we have implemented such Python representations for key infrastructure packages in Bioconductor, letting a Python programmer handle annotation data, microarray data, and next-generation sequencing data. Conclusions Bioconductor is now not solely reserved to R users. Building a Python application using Bioconductor functionality can be done just like if Bioconductor was a Python package. Moreover, similar principles can be applied to other languages and libraries. Our Python package is available at: [URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Internet has instigated a {{critical}} need for automated tools that facilitate integrating countless databases. Since non-technical end users {{are often the}} ultimate repositories of the domain information required to distinguish differences in data types, we suppose an effective solution must integrate simple GUI based data browsing tools and automatic mapping methods that eliminate technical users from the solution. We develop a meta-model of data integration {{as the basis for}} absorbing feedback from an end-user. The schema integration algorithm draws examples from the data and learns integrating view definitions by asking a user simple yes or no questions. The meta-model enables a search mechanism that is guaranteed to converge to a correct integrating view definition <b>without</b> the user <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> a view definition language such as SQL or even <b>having</b> <b>to</b> inspect the final view definition.

40|$|This {{empirical}} {{study has}} shown that optimal portfolios need approximately 10 securities to diversify away the unsystematic risk. This challenges previous studies of randomly chosen portfolios which states that at least 30 securities are needed. The result of this study sheds light upon the difference in risk diversification between random portfolios and optimal portfolios and is a valuable contribution for investors. The study suggests that {{a major part of}} the unsystematic risk in a portfolio can be diversified away with fewer securities by using portfolio optimization. Individual investors especially, who usually have portfolios consisting of few securities, benefit from these results. There are today multiple user-friendly software applications that can perform the computations of portfolio optimization <b>without</b> the user <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the mathematics behind the program.

40|$|In general, fatigue is a {{very common}} type of failure in tubular joints. The fatigue life for tubular joints is {{expressed}} {{in terms of the number}} of stress cycles they can sustain. Therefore, an accurate method of converting structural loads to local joint stresses is useful for fatigue life prediction. This is usually done by first converting the global structural loads to loads on individual structural members and then translating the loads on the members joining at each joint to local stresses around the joint. The former can be achieved in a relatively simple fashion using beam-element models. The second step is more conveniently performed by using parametric equations for stress concentration factors that convert nominal beam stresses to hot spot stresses around the joint. Many sets of stress parameter equations have been derived for tubular joint during the last two decades. Except for the present study, all these equations can be used to predict hot spot stress concentration factor for simple tubular joints without considering the effect of extra stiffness. This is partly because developing different parametric equations for every possible reinforcement geometry is impractical. In fact, in certain instances of field repair, the reinforcement may not even be visible and its exact nature unknown due to loss of past records. The present study has introduced a joint dynamic parameter that will represent the stiffening effect of the reinforcement <b>without</b> essentially <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the exact nature of the reinforcement. This study has developed a new and novel method to calculate Stress Concentration Factors using parametric functions of not only the basic geometric functions but also parameter representing extra stiffening provided by various means such as doubler plate, gussets, etc. The application of this concept is demonstrated and proven through detailed finite-element analysis of a wide range of joint and reinforcement geometries. Shell element models are used to calculate the Hot Spot Stresses around the joint as the basis to derive the parametric equations. The non-dimensional dynamic joint parameter introduced in this study can be calculated in most instances by using standard techniques of experimental modal analysis without needing <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the nature and details of the reinforcement. This is especially useful in those cases where the exact nature of reinforcement is not known, for example, hidden in the interior or deteriorated through age or fabrication error...|$|R
