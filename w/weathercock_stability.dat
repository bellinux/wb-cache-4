50|$|Directional or <b>weathercock</b> <b>stability</b> is {{concerned}} with the static stability of the airplane about the z axis. Just {{as in the case of}} longitudinal stability it is desirable that the aircraft should tend to return to an equilibrium condition when subjected to some form of yawing disturbance. For this the slope of the yawing moment curve must be positive.An airplane possessing this mode of stability will always point towards the relative wind, hence the name <b>weathercock</b> <b>stability.</b>|$|E
40|$|Disturbed lateral motions {{have been}} {{calculated}} for a hypothetical small airplane with various modifications of fin area and dihedral setting. The modifications {{of the airplane}} include changes of dihedral and changes of <b>weathercock</b> <b>stability.</b> Fin area and wing dihedral {{were found to be}} of primary importance in side gusts. It was found that the rolling action of the wing with as much as 5 deg dihedral was distinctly unfavorable, especially when the <b>weathercock</b> <b>stability</b> was small. It is pointed out that the greatest susceptibility to lateral disturbances lies in the inherent damping and coupling moments developed by the wing...|$|E

The Results Presented In Chapter 1 Of The Report Show That The Pitch Damping In Flight Is Lower Than That Predicted By NDLM Values And There Is A Noticeable Reduction In The Flight Determined Derivative Câ€žFla (And Hence, <b>Weathercock</b> <b>Stability)</b> And C 15 (Aileron Control Effectiveness). In Chapter 2, The Performance Maneuver Data Generated During The LCA-TD 1 (SG) Flight Tests At Subsonic Speeds Have Been Analyzed.

40|$|Three NASA centers: Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Langley Research Center (LaRC), and Johnson Space Center (JSC) are {{currently}} involved in studying {{a family of}} single-stage- and two-stage-to-orbit (SSTO/TSTO) vehicles {{to serve as the}} next generation space transportation system (STS). A rocketed winged-body is the current focus. The configuration (WB 001) is a vertically-launched, horizontally-landing system with circular cross-section. Preliminary aerodynamic data was generated by LaRC and is a combination of wind-tunnel data, empirical methods, and Aerodynamic Preliminary Analysis System-(APAS) generated values. JSC's efforts involve descent trajectory design, stability analysis, and flight control system synthesis. Analysis of WB 001 's static stability indicates instability in 'tuck' (C(sub mu) less than 0 : Mach = 0. 30, alpha greater than 3. 25 deg; Mach = 0. 60, alpha greater than 8. 04), an unstable dihedral effects (C(sub l(beta)) greater than 0 : Mach = 30,alpha less than 12 deg.; Mach = 0. 60, alpha less than 10. 00 deg.), and, most significantly, an unstable <b>weathercock</b> <b>stability</b> derivative, C(sub n(beta)), at all angles of attack and subsonic Mach numbers. Longitudinal trim solutions for Mach = 0. 30 and 0. 60 indicate flight path angle possibilities ranging from around 12 (M = 0. 30) to slightly over 20 degrees at Mach = 0. 60. Trim angles of attack increase from 6. 24 at Mach 0. 60 and 10, 000 feet to 17. 7 deg. at Mach 0. 30, sea-level. Lateral trim was attempted for a design cross-wind of 25. 0 knots. The current vehicle aerodynamic and geometric characteristics will only yield a lateral trim solution at impractical tip-fin deflections (approximately equal to 43 deg.) and bank angles (21 deg.). A study of the lateral control surfaces, tip-fin controllers for WB 001, indicate increased surface area would help address these instabilities, particularly the deficiency in C(sub n(beta)), but obviously at the expense of increased vehicle weight. Growth factors of approximately 7 were determined using a design C(sub n(beta)) of 0. 100 /radian (approximate subsonic values for the orbiter) ...|$|E
