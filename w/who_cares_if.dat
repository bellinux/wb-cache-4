The study revealed: an average concern for the food type (organic vs conventional: 57 % of the sample declare they care what kind of food they eat); a high interest in label information (76 % declared they read the food label in at least 26 % of the cases when they buy food); dominant perception of organic food as a healthier option than conventional food (by 95 % of the tested consumers) and as opposite to a fad (by 62 % of the subjects); a statistically significant difference between men and women in terms of their appreciations (perceptions) of organic food as being healthier than conventional food (p=. 036); a statistically significant difference between people <b>who</b> <b>cared</b> <b>if</b> they ate organic vs conventional food and those <b>who</b> didn’t <b>care</b> in the levels of label reading frequency (p=. 000).

Ramona's parents and Susan's parents have become friends, and {{both sets of}} parents have asked their daughters {{to get along with}} each other. Ramona is {{frustrated}} by Susan's perfect attitude. She reluctantly invites Susan to her [...] "zero teenth" [...] (or tenth) birthday party at the park at her mother's insistence. At the party, Susan is rude to Ramona, and eats an apple instead of the birthday cake telling everybody that it can cause cavities and might have germs since Ramona blew out the candles. This makes the girls reluctant to eat cake, which upsets Ramona. Daisy stands up for Ramona and tells them that it's rude to talk about germs at a birthday party and <b>who</b> <b>cares</b> <b>if</b> little germs get on the cake saying how it's not like they got the cake from the floor.

5000|$|Since no one {{has ever}} bothered to explain the {{importance}} of learning to Milo, he regards school as the biggest waste of time in his life. Juster intended that the book speak to the importance of learning to love learning. Teaching methods that might bore children, by memorization for example, are mocked in the book, {{as in the case of}} the Spelling Bee.

[...] According to Mary Liston in her journal article on law in fantasy realms, [...] "The Phantom Tollbooth concerns the difference between education and wisdom and what processes are conducive to synthesizing both, so as to encourage an attitude of engagement, alertness, and responsibility within an increasingly autonomous individual." [...] "BOSH!" [...] replied the Humbug. [...] "We're an old and noble family, honorable to the core—Insecticus humbugium, if I may use the Latin. Why, we fought in the crusades with Richard the Lion Heart, crossed the Atlantic with Columbus, blazed trails with the pioneers, and today many members of the family hold important government positions throughout the world. History is full of Humbugs." [...] The Phantom Tollbooth (in Dictionopolis) [...] Another theme is the need for common sense to back up rules.

5000|$|Brecht {{studied with}} John Cage between 1958 and 1959, {{during which time}} he invented, and then refined, the Event Score which would become a central feature of Fluxus. Typically, Event Scores are simple {{instructions}} to complete everyday tasks which can be performed publicly, privately, or negatively (i.e., deciding not to perform them at all). These ideas would be taken up and expanded upon up by La Monte Young, Yoko Ono and many other avant-garde artists who passed through these classes.The two had originally met in 1957 when Brecht heard that Cage was planning to hunt mushrooms in the New Jersey area; he rang him up and invited him to 'stop by and say hello'. Cage accepted, and returned the invitation; it was whilst Brecht, Kaprow and their families were visiting his house in Stony Point on the Hudson, that Cage invited them to attend his classes in New York. Ironically, musicians found the course far harder than the visual artists who had enrolled;"Cage... was very keenly a philosophical mind, not just an artist's mind; his sense of aesthetics was secondary and thought was primary. He impressed me immediately. So I thought, well, <b>who</b> <b>cares</b> <b>if</b> he's a musician and I'm a painter. This is unimportant. It's the mind that transcends any medium....."The rate of attrition was something fierce. The end result {{was that there were}} very few musician types and the event nature of the class became apparent. George Brecht's understanding of an intimate situation was far greater than mine. I needed more space to really work. But George really came to life in that situation..... He became a leader; and immediately he influenced not only me, but everybody else: Jackson Maclow, Higgins, Hansen. George Segal stopped by, and so did Dine, Whitman and Oldenburg." [...] Allan Kaprow [...] Initially writing theatrical scores similar to Kaprow's earliest Happenings, Brecht grew increasingly dissatisfied with the didactic nature of these performances. After performing in one such piece, Cage quipped that he'd [...] "never felt so controlled before." [...] prompting Brecht to pare the scores down to haiku-like statements, leaving space for radically different interpretations each time the piece was performed. Brecht would later refer to Cage as his 'liberator', whilst, in the opinion of some critics, moving beyond Cage's notion of music; Cage was still writing scores to be performed. Brecht had replaced this with a world permeated with music. [...] "No matter what you do," [...] he said, [...] "you're always hearing something." ...|$|E
