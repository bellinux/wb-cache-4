50|$|Super Mario Bros. {{introduced}} the basic three power-ups {{that have become}} staples for the series, especially the 2D games — the Super Mushroom, <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> Mario <b>to</b> grow larger; the Fire Flower, which allows Mario to throw fireballs; and the Starman, which gives Mario temporary invincibility.

6000|$|As Peter Baron {{held his}} discoveries {{successively}} {{in his hands}} he became conscious of a queer emotion which was not altogether elation and yet was still less pure pain. He had made a find, but it somehow added to his responsibility; {{he was in the}} presence of something interesting, but (in a manner he couldn't have defined) this circumstance suddenly constituted a danger. It was the perception of the danger, for instance, <b>which</b> <b>caused</b> <b>to</b> remain in abeyance any impulse he might have felt to break one of the seals. He looked at them all narrowly, but he was careful not to loosen them, and he wondered uncomfortably whether the contents of the secret compartment would be held in equity to be the property {{of the people in the}} King's Road. He had given money for the davenport, but had he given money for these buried papers? He paid by a growing consciousness that a nameless chill had stolen into the air the penalty, which he had many a time paid before, of being made of sensitive stuff. It was as if an occasion had insidiously arisen for a sacrifice--a sacrifice for the sake of a fine superstition, something like honour or kindness or justice, something indeed perhaps even finer still--a difficult deciphering of duty, an impossible tantalising wisdom. Standing there before his ambiguous treasure and losing himself for the moment in the sense of a dawning complication, he was startled by a light, quick tap at the door of his sitting-room. Instinctively, before answering, he listened an instant--he was in the attitude of a miser surprised while counting his hoard. Then he answered [...] "One moment, please!" [...] and slipped the little heap of packets into the biggest of the drawers of the davenport, which happened to be open. The aperture of the false back was still gaping, and he had not time to work back the spring. He hastily laid a big book over the place and then went and opened his door.|$|E

50|$|Based on {{the data}} until 1959 in Pećka Banja were many sources of thermo mineral waters on the {{temperature}} of 23-48 degrees Celsius that formed calcareous flows up to 1 kilometer. The amount of water and chemicals can be concluded to be split in three flows for carrying thermo mineral waters. The high pressure of gases prevented this flow from puncturing <b>which</b> <b>caused</b> <b>to</b> become the source of thermo mineral water, and during the flow were formed layers of Calcium carbonate. From {{the flow of water}} many onix and bigra limestones, which are still created.These diggings were made by experts from Belgrade and Skopje, till the depth of 9m (meters). The more layers of onix and bigra limestones were formed, the smaller was the amount of water that flowed. The close of this canal caused the forming of two smaller sources close to it. When the plastic tubes were put for water transportation, the water amount was calculated and was 18 liters per second.|$|E
