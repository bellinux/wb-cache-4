5|$|Morchella importuna is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Morchellaceae {{described}} from North America in 2012. It occurs in gardens, <b>woodchip</b> beds, and other urban settings of northern California and the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. The fungus has also been reported from Turkey, Spain, France, Switzerland, Canada and China, although it is unknown {{whether this is a}} result of accidental introductions. It is considered a choice edible mushroom. The fruit bodies develop a distinctive ladder-like pattern of pits and ridges on the surface of their conical caps.|$|E

50|$|<b>Woodchipping</b> is the act and {{industry}} of chipping wood for pulp. Timber {{is converted to}} <b>woodchips</b> and sold, primarily, for paper manufacture. In Australia, <b>woodchips</b> are produced by clearcutting or thinning of native forests or plantations.

30|$|The Cu-Au tailing used in {{this study}} was shown to be {{relatively}} stable after decades of natural weathering. Biochar and <b>woodchips</b> had different effects on EHM geochemistry. Biochar was chemically and microbially inert, while <b>woodchips</b> can continue to degrade over time, buffer the release of major saline ions and even mobilize toxic elements in the long run. We speculate that fresh biomass amendment like <b>woodchips</b> may pose challenges for seepage management in a short/medium term since amending and the induced geochemical changes need to be considered in the strategy of tailing revegetation. Considering the distinct impacts of biochar and <b>woodchips</b> on tailing hydrogeochemistry, the combination of biochar and <b>woodchips</b> is of potential to be an ideal amendment for tailing rehabilitation.|$|R
5|$|Stropharia caerulea, {{commonly}} known as the blue roundhead, is an inedible species of agaric fungus in the family Strophariaceae. It is a common species found in Europe and North America, where it grows as a saprophyte in meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and <b>woodchip</b> mulch. S.caerulea was officially described to science in 1979, although it was known to be a distinct species for about two centuries before that. The taxon Stropharia cyanea, as defined by Risto Tuomikoski in 1953, and used by several later authors, is a synonym of S.caerulea.|$|E
5|$|The Great Southern Group {{began as}} the company Great Southern, co-founded in 1987 by {{accountant}} John Carlton Young, and microbiologist Helen Sewell. It began by managing South-east Australian plantations of Pinus radiata, but in 1992 shifted to Eucalytus plantations for <b>woodchip</b> production, dealing in blue gum woodlot investments. Through the 1990s it developed its plantation business in south western Western Australia including the Great Southern region (after which the company is named), leasing woodlots to investors on land owned by Great Southern. A related entity, Templegate Finance Pty Ltd, would also lend finance to investors.|$|E
5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{a species}} of fungus in the stinkhorn family, and the type species of the genus Clathrus. It is {{commonly}} known as the latticed stinkhorn, the basket stinkhorn, or the red cage, alluding to the striking fruit bodies that are shaped somewhat like a round or oval hollow sphere with interlaced or latticed branches. The fungus is saprobic, feeding off decaying woody plant material, and is often found alone or in groups in leaf litter on garden soil, grassy places, or on <b>woodchip</b> garden mulches. Although considered primarily a European species, C.ruber has been introduced to other areas, and now has a wide distribution that includes northern Africa, Asia, Australia, and North and South America. The species was illustrated in the scientific literature during the 16th century, but was not officially described until 1729.|$|E

The company was forced to close all three of these <b>woodchipping</b> mills and most of its sawmills in 2011. After being placed into voluntary administration in 2012, the Longreach mill was reopened and began exporting <b>woodchips</b> once again.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and '70s the high demand for {{paper and the}} {{relatively}} low cost and availability of the native forests made {{the establishment of a}} <b>woodchipping</b> industry a viable proposition. Conversely, the establishment of a <b>woodchipping</b> industry made it economically feasible to clearfell areas of mixed or substandard forest that could not otherwise have been felled. Clearfelling is a controversial forest practice in Australia, and opponents argue that the <b>woodchipping</b> industry is culpable for its continuation.|$|R
40|$|The present chapter {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} ethanol and <b>woodchips</b> addition on nitrate removal in free water surface/vertical flow wetland microcosms operated at a 6 day hydraulic retention time, one received increasing ethanol concentrations (COD varying from 58 to 336 mgfL) and the other received 2140 g (9. 3 kg/rn 2) of dry <b>woodchips.</b> After the addition of COD both system had increased percentage removal of nitrate. COD:N 03 ratios applied here with external carbon (16 : 1 minimum) were higher than the experimental 7 : 1 {{reported in the literature}} for complete denitrification. Excess COD, however, was successfully removed. Parallel to the wetland microcosm, the COD released from <b>woodchips</b> was measured by placing 1 OOg <b>woodchips</b> in IL of water, COD was measured and the I L water batch changed weekly. After 65 days the 1 OOg of <b>woodchips</b> released a total of 2262 mg COD. These trials were preliminary to a large scale constructed wetland receiving up to 2, 000 rn 3 /day of industrial wastewater with high nitrate and low COD. <b>Woodchips,</b> as a low cost biological waste product, can be considered as an alternative to expensive ethanol.

25|$|Founded in 1875 by {{brothers}} John and Thomas Gunn, {{it is one}} of Australia's oldest companies. It {{has over}} 900 square kilometres of plantations, mainly eucalyptus trees. In 2001 Gunns paid $335 million for Tasmania's biggest <b>woodchip</b> company North Forest Products, making it Australia's biggest exporter of woodchips. And became Tasmania’s largest private land-owner. The company employs over 1,200 people and has suffered a dramatic turnaround in revenue in recent years, going from a turnover in excess of A$600 million in 2006, to a loss of over $350 million in 2011. Gunns was one of the largest export <b>woodchip</b> operation in the Southern Hemisphere, and one of two chip export companies sourcing raw materials from Tasmanian forests, the other being Neville Smith Forest Products through their SmartFiber branch in Bell Bay. Gunns announced a $900 million loss for 2011-12 and debts of $3 billion. It appointed voluntary administrators after its financier withdrew its support.|$|E

25|$|Cellulosic ethanol {{is a type}} of biofuel {{produced}} from lignocellulose, a material that comprises much of the mass of plants. Corn stover, switchgrass, miscanthus and <b>woodchip</b> are some of the more popular non-edible cellulosic materials for ethanol production. Commercial investment in such second-generation biofuels began in 2006/2007, and much of this investment went beyond pilot-scale plants. Cellulosic ethanol commercialization is moving forward rapidly. The world’s first commercial wood-to-ethanol plant began operation in Japan in 2007, with a capacity of 1.4 million liters/year. The first wood-to-ethanol plant in the United States is planned for 2008 with an initial output of 75 million liters/year.|$|E

500|$|Returns {{to investors}} {{comprised}} {{a tax deduction}} in {{the year in which}} they bought the products, and returns from the sale of produce {{over the life of the}} project, which was typically at the point of harvest 10–12 years later for plantations, [...] "and up to 23 years for horticultural projects such as almonds". Great Southern would deduct management fees from the final sale value. A typical forestry investment in the early 2000s involved an initial payment of $3000 for one-third of a hectare woodlot, yielding a $2900 tax deduction at that time. Returns on harvesting depended on many variables; Great Southern forecast that investors would recoup their original investment and a further return of between $1923 and $4569 per woodlot, however early schemes did not achieve these figures on the basis of the timber sales, with some resulting in <b>woodchip</b> sales of only around A$1500, half the value of what was originally invested. Investors received their returns when the product (usually <b>woodchip)</b> was harvested and sold.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Woodchips</b> {{are similar}} to wood pellets, in that the {{movement}} and handling is more amenable to automation than cord wood, particularly for smaller systems. <b>Woodchips</b> are less expensive to produce than wood pellets, which must be processed in specialized facilities. While avoiding {{the costs associated with}} refinement, the lower density and higher moisture content of <b>woodchips</b> reduces their calorific value, substantially increasing the feedstock needed to generate an equivalent amount of heat. Greater physical volume requirements also increase the expense and emissions impact of trucking, storing and/or shipping the wood.|$|R

2500|$|The {{company has}} been the focus of {{criticism}} from environmentalists, primarily for its four <b>woodchip</b> mills which produce 4 million tonnes of chips for export annually. Green groups claim that native forests are harvested specifically for woodchipping, whereas Gunns claim that the majority of their chips come from residue from their sawmilling and veneer operations. Gunns' major customers are paper producers in Northern Asia, mainly Japan, including Mitsubishi, Nippon and Oji Paper.

2500|$|Wood burning {{creates more}} {{atmospheric}} CO2 than biodegradation of wood {{in a forest}} (in a given period of time) because {{by the time the}} bark of a dead tree has rotted, the log has already been occupied by other plants and micro-organisms which continue to sequester the CO2 by integrating the hydrocarbons of the wood into their own life cycle. Wood harvesting and transport operations produce varying degrees of greenhouse gas pollution. [...] Inefficient and incomplete combustion of wood can result in elevated levels of greenhouse gases other than [...] CO2, which may result in positive emissions where the byproducts have greater Carbon dioxide equivalent values. In an attempt to provide quantitative information about the relative output of CO2 to produce electricity of domestic heating, the United Kingdom Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has published a comprehensive model comparing the burning of wood (wood chip) and other fuels, based on 33 scenarios. The model's output is kilogram of CO2 produced per Megawatt hour of delivered energy. Scenario 33 for example, which concerns the production of heat from wood chips produced from UK small roundwood produced from bringing neglected broadleaf forests back into production, shows that burning oil releases 377kg of CO2 while burning <b>woodchip</b> releases 1501kg of CO2 per MW h delivered energy.|$|E
