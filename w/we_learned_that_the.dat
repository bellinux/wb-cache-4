2500|$|In the TV series Perversions of Science, {{the episode}} [...] "The Exile" [...] {{involves}} a scientist (played by Jeffrey Combs) who is arrested for killing {{people in his}} experiments. He is sentenced to exile - on Earth, where he lands in Germany of the 1920s. The prison commander (David Warner) doubts that one man can do very much damage, whereupon <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> exiled prisoner will become Adolf Hitler.|$|E
60|$|Of a verity I {{believe a}} full fifteen minutes elapsed before all our {{people were in}} line of battle, which spoke badly for what might happen in case the enemy planned a surprise, and then <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> alarm was a false one.|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of course, we did not then know what was being done; but later <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> President's mansion, the Treasury buildings, the Arsenal, and the barracks, where three {{thousand}} troops could be quartered, were all laid in ashes under the orders of General Ross and Admiral Cockburn.|$|E
50|$|In {{the course}} of <b>the</b> series <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> super, Kurt Blahovec, once thought about marrying her.|$|R

25|$|At lines 2813-2815 <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> thane Wiglaf is a Waegmunding; {{therefore}} {{his father}} Weohstan {{was in some}} way related to Ecgþeow.|$|R
6000|$|After {{that and}} more warning and advice of similar nature, the {{conversation}} became general, and <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> beds were to be raided that very night. As they got into their boats, after an hour's stay, we were invited to join them in the raid with the assurance of [...] "the more the merrier." ...|$|E
60|$|Before Lieutenant Frazier {{brought the}} {{inspection}} to a close, {{one of the}} men who had been sent to spy out the enemy's movements, came aboard the Scorpion to make a report. From him <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British were really encamped for the night, and there seemed little possibility any move would be made before daylight.|$|E
6000|$|Then it was <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{apparently}} valueless {{case was}} none other than the writing-desk, or official portfolio, belonging to General St. Leger himself, and in it were not only private letters and documents, but all his correspondence and papers relating to the campaign, such as afterward served to show that the king's officers had actually hired the Indians to murder those whom they called [...] "rebels." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Robert Hunt, of <b>the</b> holy {{children}} <b>that</b> {{settled in}} Cornwall, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> following gave {{their names to}} Cornish churches ...|$|R

5000|$|In the Voyager episode [...] "Parallax", <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Emergency Medical Holographic Channel is 47 and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> EMH has the {{experience}} of 47 individual medical officers.|$|R
60|$|We {{were always}} trying new logs, and <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> smaller the log the faster {{we could make}} it go. Also, <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> smaller the log the more liable it was to roll over {{and give us a}} ducking. Still another thing about small logs we learned. One day we paddled our {{individual}} logs alongside each other. And then, quite by accident, in the course of play, we discovered that when each, with one hand and foot, held on to the other's log, the logs were steadied and did not turn over. Lying side by side in this position, our outside hands and feet were left free for paddling. Our final discovery was that this arrangement enabled us to use still smaller logs and thereby gain greater speed. And there our discoveries ended. We had invented the most primitive catamaran, and we did not have sense enough to know it. It never entered our heads to lash the logs together with tough vines or stringy roots. We were content to hold the logs together with our hands and feet.|$|E
60|$|On {{the morning}} after General Arnold's arrival, when <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{reinforcements}} which {{had been sent to}} us at Fort Schuyler were to be marched directly back to the main army then at Stillwater, the Minute Boys held a conference to decide what should be done, for it was in my mind that each member of the company had a right to discuss freely the question that must be settled without delay.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did indeed}} hear so, madam," [...] said the Lady Peveril; [...] "and {{that you had}} bidden a bold {{defiance}} to the rebel government, even after all other parts of Britain had submitted to them. My husband, Sir Geoffrey, designed at one time to have gone to your assistance with some few followers; but <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> island was rendered to the Parliament party, and that you, dearest lady, were thrown into prison." ...|$|E
50|$|In one Ottoman {{document}} from 1618 <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monks {{assisted the}} brigands {{and some of}} them even joined their ranks. From 1664 the monastery receives help from Russia.|$|R
5000|$|From Quintilian <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{techniques}} {{employed in}} the art of memory, as developed by Metrodorus, included the use of a memorized scheme based upon 360 places in twelve zodiacal signs: ...|$|R
50|$|Erik (Rolf Lassgård), a Stockholm police officer, reunites {{with his}} {{relatives}} upon {{the death of}} his abusive father in Norrbotten, where his brother Leif (Lennart Jähkel) still lives. <b>We</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> control the father exerted over the family had resulted in Leif giving up singing (despite being clearly talented), instead remaining at home with his father.|$|R
6000|$|... "When our skipper {{came back}} <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> steamer was the Sommerville, Captain Nash, from West Australia to Singapore via Batavia with mails, {{and that the}} {{agreement}} was she should tow us to Anjer or Batavia, if possible, where we could extinguish the fire by scuttling, and then proceed on our voyage--to Bankok! The old man seemed excited. 'We will do it yet,' he said to Mahon, fiercely. He shook his fist at the sky. Nobody else said a word.|$|E
60|$|This {{came home}} to me with added force when, from {{subsequent}} examination, <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> entire mouth of this cave had been sealed up for unnumbered ages. It will be remembered that Marama told me the mountain in the lake had risen much during the frightful cyclone in which we were wrecked {{and with it the}} cave mouth which previously had been invisible. From the markings on the mountain side it was obvious that something of the sort had happened very recently, at any rate on this eastern face. That is, either the flat rock had sunk or the volcano had been thrown upwards.|$|E
60|$|The {{day after}} the Julia left, the old man came up to us in great tribulation, saying that the bucket of bread was no longer forthcoming, and that Wilson had refused to send {{anything}} in its place. One and all, we took this for a hint to disperse quietly, and go about our business. Nevertheless, we {{were not to be}} shaken off so easily; and taking a malicious pleasure in annoying our old enemy, we resolved, for the present, to stay where we were. For the part he had been acting, <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> consul was the laughing-stock of all the foreigners ashore, who frequently twitted him upon his hopeful proteges of the Calabooza Beretanee.|$|E
5000|$|Captain John Sheridan assumes {{command of}} Babylon 5. <b>We</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Minbari still resent {{him because of}} his victory over them in the Earth-Minbari War and protested his command {{assignment}} to the station they helped fund.|$|R
25|$|At lines 2428-2429 <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young Bēowulf was fostered {{and raised}} in the home of Hreðel {{starting}} when he was seven years old; Ecgþēow may have died by then, or the family may just have been following a custom.|$|R
3000|$|From this table, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{reduction}} process of activities for Oldenburg’s public {{would be very}} painful. First, reducing activities stepwise by r^+ = 1.0703, 1.0773,  1.0856, and 1.0956 plus input reduction of (1 - 0.98) × 100 = 2 [...]...|$|R
60|$|Rupert and I had now {{the means}} of {{equipping}} ourselves neatly, though always in sailor guise. After this was done, we proceeded to the Albany basin, in order to ascertain whether the Wallingford were down or not. At the basin <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sloop had gone out that very forenoon, having on board a black with his young master's effects; a lad who {{was said to have}} been out to Canton with young Mr. Wallingford, and who was now on his way home, to report all the sad occurrences to the family in Ulster. This, then, was Neb, who had got thus far back in charge of our chests, and was about to return to slavery.|$|E
60|$|Charley and I were {{consumed}} with curiosity. In {{a few minutes}} we were on board and talking with an engineer who was watching the sunrise from the deck. He was quite willing to satisfy our curiosity, {{and in a few}} minutes <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Streak had come in after dark from San Francisco; that this was {{what might be called the}} trial trip; and that she was the property of Silas Tate, a young mining millionaire of California, whose fad was high-speed yachts. There was some talk about turbine engines, direct application of steam, and the absence of pistons, rods, and cranks,--all of which was beyond me, for I was familiar only with sailing craft; but I did understand the last words of the engineer.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} morning the Inquiry began with due ceremony, the Prince Seti and the Count Amenmeses taking their seats {{at the head of}} a large pavilion with the councillors behind them and the scribes, among whom I was, seated at their feet. Then <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two prophets whom I had seen at Pharaoh's court were not in the land of Goshen, having left before we arrived [...] "to sacrifice to God in the wilderness," [...] nor did any know when they would return. Other elders and priests, however, appeared and began to set out their case, which they did at great length and in a fierce and turbulent fashion, speaking often all of them at once, thus making it difficult for the interpreters to render their words, since they pretended that they did not know the Egyptian tongue.|$|E
5000|$|When Londo {{approaches}} G'Kar {{to confront}} {{him about the}} attacks, G'Kar offers Londo spoo, noting that it is [...] "quite fresh." [...] In the fifth season episode [...] "A Tragedy of Telepaths", <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Centauri consider an offer of fresh spoo an insult.|$|R
50|$|In this section, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Warriors {{have a small}} mythology {{featuring}} three Clans {{with wild}} cats: LionClan, TigerClan, and LeopardClan. There {{is the story of}} how LeopardClan won the river, how the snakes of Sunningrocks came to the forest, and how TigerClan got their stripes.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the Dorians, where a lover {{would usually}} {{have only one}} eromenos, in the east a man might have several eromenoi {{over the course of}} his life. From the poems of Alcaeus <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lover would customarily invite his eromenos to dine with him.|$|R
60|$|Arrived in town, {{we went to}} work at once. We set {{a private}} detective from Marvillier's to watch our friend; and from him <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{so-called}} Doctor dropped in for a picture that day at a dealer's in the West-end (I suppress the name, having a judicious fear of the law of libel ever before my eyes), a dealer who was known to be mixed up before then in several shady or disreputable transactions. Though, to be sure, my experience has been that picture dealers are--picture dealers. Horses rank first in my mind as begetters and producers of unscrupulous agents, but pictures run them a very good second. Anyhow, we found out that our distinguished art-critic picked up his Rembrandt at this dealer's shop, and came down with it in his care the same night to Brighton.|$|E
6000|$|Higbie and I {{cleared out}} on a new mining {{excitement}} the next morning, glad {{to get away from}} the scene of our sufferings, and after a month or two of hardship and disappointment, returned to Esmeralda once more. Then <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Wide West and the Johnson companies had consolidated; that the stock, thus united, comprised five thousand feet, or shares; that the foreman, apprehending tiresome litigation, and considering such a huge concern unwieldy, had sold his hundred feet for ninety thousand dollars in gold and gone home to the States to enjoy it. If the stock was worth such a gallant figure, with five thousand shares in the corporation, it makes me dizzy to think what it would have been worth with only our original six hundred in it. It was the difference between six hundred men owning a house and five thousand owning it. We would have been millionaires if we had only worked with pick and spade one little day on our property and so secured our ownership! ...|$|E
60|$|After a {{while we}} lost count of time, nor was it until later that <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> storm endured for full twenty hours, during {{the latter part of}} which, {{notwithstanding}} our manifold sufferings, we must have become more or less insensible. At any rate, at one moment I remembered the awful roar and the stinging of the sand whips, followed by a kind of vision of the face of my son--that beloved, long-lost son whom I had sought for so many years, and for whose sake I endured all these things. Then, without any interval, as it were, I felt my limbs being scorched as though by hot irons or through a burning-glass, and with a fearful effort staggered up to find that the storm had passed, and that the furious sun was blistering my excoriated skin. Rubbing the caked dirt from my eyes, I looked down to see two mounds like those of graves, out of which projected legs that had been white. Just then one pair of legs, the longer pair, stirred, the sand heaved up convulsively, and, uttering wandering words in a choky voice, there arose the figure of Oliver Orme.|$|E
50|$|The temple, {{built in}} the Dravidian style of architecture, faces east and {{is said to have}} been {{constructed}} by Kanthirava Narasaraja I, king of Mysore. From the inscriptions numbered Tumkur 41 and 42, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> enclosure and tower were repaired in 1858 by the Mysore king Krishnaraja Wodeyar III.|$|R
50|$|We {{are then}} taken {{underwater}} {{in the blue}} ocean as Sebastian (Chris Carmack) and his girlfriend Dani (Laura Vandervoort) are dive surfing with a model. <b>We</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group own a snorkeling business that rents out equipment for clients. Sebastian {{does not want to}} do this line of work forever.|$|R
50|$|Thunderclap is a desolate, sparsely-populated realm first {{described}} in The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass as {{being part of}} End-World and the Borderlands. In Wolves of <b>the</b> Calla, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> marauding wolves come from somewhere in Thunderclap, later named in the book The Dark Tower as the Devar-Toi.|$|R
