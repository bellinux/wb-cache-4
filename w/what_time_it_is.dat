5|$|Alertness is {{a global}} {{observation}} of level of consciousness i.e. awareness of, and responsiveness to the environment, and this {{might be described as}} alert, clouded, drowsy, or stuporous. Orientation is assessed by asking the patient where he or she is (for example what building, town and state) and <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> (time, day, date).|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} circadian {{clock is}} profoundly influenced {{by changes in}} light, since these are its main clues about <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Exposure to even small amounts of light during the night can suppress melatonin secretion, increase body temperature, and increase cognitive ability. Short pulses of light, {{at the right moment}} in the circadian cycle, can significantly 'reset' the internal clock. Blue light, in particular, exerts the strongest effect, leading to concerns that electronic media use before bed may interfere with sleep.|$|E
500|$|Before his {{departure}} from Jive, Big Boi planned {{to release the}} album in 2008. In January 2010, he announced a March 23 release through his Twitter account. In April, its release was pushed back to July 6 in the United States. However, in June, Jive attempted to block its release, claiming that Def Jam could not issue songs featuring both Big Boi and André 3000, as OutKast was represented as a duo by the former label. In a June 7 interview for GQ, Big Boi responded to a question concerning the blocking of his recordings with André 3000 for Sir Lucious Left Foot, stating [...] "Au contraire! They cannot block it. Au contraire. Either they're {{going to do it}} the right way, or they're going to do it my way... The fans' thirst will be quenched. You know, I'm no stranger to that Internet, baby. So you already know <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> The thirst of the fans will be quenched". On June 10, his website released the album's track listing, which excluded tracks featuring André 3000. Of his songs with André 3000, he told GQ, [...] "We're gonna keep one of them for the next OutKast record".|$|E

500|$|Liz (Tina Fey), Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) all {{attempt to}} trick Tracy into {{arriving}} at a rehearsal on time. [...] Tracy arrives not knowing <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> and announces that Liz is racist and treating him like a child. Liz challenges Tracy to behave better so he can be treated as an adult, but he responds by sending a gibbon to replace himself at rehearsal. Liz tells Tracy to arrive on time with his lines memorized the next day {{if he wants to}} be treated equally. Tracy retaliates by acting professionally but convincing everyone to treat Liz equally too, by making her lift heavy water jugs, passing gas near her, and inviting her to a strip club along with the other writers. Liz in turn stops Tracy from going to the strip club, noting that because he is acting so professionally he has to write notes for the upcoming script. Liz is uncomfortable at the strip club and Tracy hates writing all night so they agree to return to the [...] "natural order" [...] of things with both receiving preferential treatment.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene of Act 2, Fleance meets his father, who asks him to take his sword and tells him he is {{reluctant}} {{to go to bed}} due to the [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, however, Banquo demands the sword be returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king. Doing so would make the throne more available for Fleance, and would fulfill the Three Witches' prophecy that his sons would become kings. Since Banquo's good nature is revolted by these thoughts, he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure he does not act on them. Still, he is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands their return. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams {{have nothing to do with}} him killing the king, but that they have revealed to him Macbeth's bloody nature. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night, but when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had these dark dreams about Macbeth, takes back his sword as a precaution. In any case, this scene adds to the dark, uncertain, unsettling tone of the play. Fleance and his father are not even certain of <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> throughout, as Fleance says when asked at the beginning of the scene [...] "The moon is down; I have not heard the clock." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi asked Rabbi Ishmael {{the son of}} Rabbi Jose if he {{had learned}} from his father the actual meaning of [...] "And on the seventh day God {{finished}} the work that He had been doing" [...] (for surely God finished God's work on the sixth day, not the Sabbath). He compared it to a man striking a hammer on an anvil, raising it by day and bringing it down immediately after nightfall. (In the second between raising the hammer and bringing it down, night began. Thus, he taught that God finished God's work {{right at the end}} of the sixth day, so that in that very moment the Sabbath began.) Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai taught that mortal humans, who do not know exactly <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> must add from the profane to the sacred to avoid working in the sacred time; but God knows time precisely, can enter the Sabbath by a hair's breadth. Genibah and the Rabbis discussed [...] Genibah compared it to a king who made a bridal chamber, which he plastered, painted, and adorned, so that all that the bridal chamber lacked was a bride to enter it. Similarly, just then, the world lacked the Sabbath. (Thus by means of instituting the Sabbath itself, God completed God's work, and humanity's world, on the seventh day.) The Rabbis compared it to a king who made a ring that lacked only a signet. Similarly, the world lacked the Sabbath. And the Midrash taught that this is one of the texts that they changed for King Ptolemy (as they could not expect him to understand these explanations), making [...] read, [...] "And He finished on the sixth day, and rested on the seventh." [...] King Ptolemy (or others say, a philosopher) asked the elders in Rome how many days it took God to create the world. The elders replied that it took God six days. He replied that since then, Gehenna has been burning for the wicked. Reading the words [...] "His work" [...] in [...] Rabbi Berekiah said in the name of Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon that with neither labor nor toil did God create the world, yet [...] says, [...] "He rested [...] [...] [...] from all His work." [...] He explained that [...] states it that way to punish the wicked who destroy the world, which was created with labor, and to give a good reward to the righteous who uphold the world, which was created with toil. Reading the words [...] "Because that in it He rested from all His work which God created to make," [...] in [...] the Midrash taught that what was created on the Sabbath, after God rested, was tranquility, ease, peace, and quiet. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Jose ben Nehorai that as long as the hands of their Master were working on them, they went on expanding; but when the hands of their Master rested, rest was afforded to them, and thus God gave rest to the world on the seventh day. Rabbi Abba taught that when a mortal king takes his army to their quarters, he does not distribute largesse (rather, he does that only before the troops go into battle), and when he distributes largesse, he does not order a halt. But God ordered a halt and distributed largesse, as [...] says, [...] "And He rested [...] [...] [...] and He blessed." [...] (Not only did God afford humanity a day of rest, but God also gave humanity the gift of a sacred day.) ...|$|E
