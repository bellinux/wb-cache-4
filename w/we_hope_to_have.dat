2500|$|Truzzi co-authored {{a book on}} psychic detectives {{entitled}} The Blue Sense: Psychic Detectives and Crime. It investigated many psychic detectives and concluded: [...] "e unearthed {{new evidence}} supporting {{both sides in the}} controversy. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> shown that much of the debate has been extremely simplistic." [...] The book also stated that the evidence didn't meet the burden of proof demanded for such an extraordinary claim.|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{concluded}} the Villa in this paper; but {{the importance of}} domestic architecture at the present day, when people want houses more than fortresses, safes more than keeps, and sculleries more than dungeons, is sufficient apology for delay.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> also <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{achieved}} the secondary {{goal of this}} paper so that misconceptions surrounding Bravais lattices in 2 D and plane symmetry groups {{that existed in the}} wider scientific community are now cleared up. Addressing these shall hopefully foster the widespread application of G-AICs by microscopists, computer scientists, and applied crystallographers in the future.|$|R

60|$|Look at this infant in {{any light}} you please, {{and it is}} evident that she was a dead failure and is yet. She did but one good thing, and that was to teach the Siamese Twins how to die. After they shall have taken the hint, <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no more foolish {{experiments}} in double folks born that way. Married couples are sufficiently unpleasing.|$|E

"Well, at first," [...] Mr. Brandreth interposed, [...] "it {{will only}} be a reading-room, {{supplied}} with the magazines and papers, and well lighted and heated, where the work-people--those who have no families especially--could spend their evenings. Afterward <b>we</b> should <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a kitchen, and supply tea and coffee--and oysters, perhaps--at a nominal cost; and ice-cream in the summer." ...|$|R

These things will be given away freely-settings of eggs, young sows, seeds, plants, young trees, &c. All this involves expense, quite rightly too, and after all, I dare say that dear old George will cost about a sixth or an eighth of what we English clergymen think necessary. I dare say £25 per annum will cover his expenses.' ...|$|E

Golden Gate is such an idyllic little spot, too. We go there so often that I fear Miss Sally will think we mean to outwear our welcome. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her visit us in town this winter. Well, good-by for now.

6000|$|On the whole, Homer {{does not}} offer a medley of the {{military}} gear of four centuries--that view <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{shown to be a}} mass of inconsistencies--but describes a state of military equipment in advance of that of the most famous Mycenaean graves, but other than that of the late [...] "warrior vase." [...] He is also very familiar with some uses of iron, of which, as we shall see, scarcely any has been found in Mycenaean graves of the central period, save in the shape of rings. Homer never mentions rings of any metal.|$|E
40|$|If <b>we</b> ever <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{schools that}} are {{engaging}} and that truly embody democracy, then the classes within them must provide opportu-nities for students to experience autonomy, freedom, and choice in what is studied, when, and how.

5000|$|It's {{coming along}} really well. <b>We</b> were <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{everything}} done by now, and we're {{not at all}} done. I keep writing more songs, so that's kind of a good thing, because I keep creating new things, and that's what's halting the process, because we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go in and record that song. It's been a long, arduous process, but the harder you work on something, the prouder you are of it.|$|R

I have written a little note of thanks, saying that <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the pleasure of personally expressing our sense of Mrs. James's courtesy to-morrow.

'We {{have some}} eight only {{out of the}} fifty-one whom I am obliged to treat rather as an awkward squad, not that they are too stupid to learn, but that we cannot give them the {{individual}} attention that is necessary. They teach me their language; but I cannot put them into any class {{where they could be}} regularly taught--indeed, they are not young fellows whom I should bring again. They do the work of introducing us to their islands, and of teaching us something of their language. So I continue to give them what little time I can-- the real strength of our force being given to those whom <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> here again.|$|E

We must not, therefore, be {{surprised}} if, on leaving Italy, where {{the crowd of}} poverty-stricken nobility can still repose their pride in the true villa, we find no farther examples of it worthy of consideration; though <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> far greater pleasure in contemplating its substitutes, the château and the fortress. We must be excused, therefore, for devoting one paper more {{to the state of}} villa architecture in Italy; after which we shall endeavor to apply the principles we shall have deduced to the correction of some abuses in the erection of English country houses, in cases where scenery would demand beauty of design and wealth permit finish of decoration.|$|E

50|$|In February 2016 Thani Al-Kuwari, {{secretary-general}} of the Qatar Olympic Committee, said that the country would unquestionably bid on a future Olympics.

So <b>we</b> are <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> one day, you never know, Maybe 2028.” Doha bid for the 2016 and 2020 Olympics, both times it failed to become a candidate. Qatar hosted the 2015 World Men's Handball Championship, the 2015 AIBA World Boxing Championships and the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships, and will host the 2023 FINA World Aquatics Championships, and 2022 FIFA World Cup.|$|R
60|$|One great regret we had, {{and that}} was to leave our old camp behind us, not only {{for the sake of the}} stores which {{remained}} there, but even more because we were losing touch with Zambo, our link with the outside world. However, we had a fair supply of cartridges and all our guns, so, for a time at least, we could look after ourselves, and <b>we</b> <b>hoped</b> soon <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a chance of returning and restoring our communications with our negro. He <b>had</b> faithfully promised <b>to</b> stay where he was, and we had not a doubt that he would be as good as his word.|$|R

'You {{are to be}} in {{all things}} {{regulated}} and governed,' said the gentleman, 'by fact. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> before long, a board of fact, composed of commissioners of fact, who will force the people to be a people of fact, and of nothing but fact. You must discard the word Fancy altogether. You {{have nothing to do}} with it. You are not to have, in any object of use or ornament, what would be a contradiction in fact. You don't walk upon flowers in fact; you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets. You don't find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery; you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery. You never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls; you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls. You must use,' said the gentleman, 'for all these purposes, combinations and modifications (in primary colours) of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration. This is the new discovery. This is fact. This is taste.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's in {{the very}} nature of things," [...] Mr. Scogan went on; [...] "our {{holidays}} can't help being disappointments. Reflect for a moment. What is a holiday? The ideal, the Platonic Holiday of Holidays is surely a complete and absolute change. You agree with me in my definition?" [...] Mr. Scogan glanced from face to face round the table; his sharp nose moved in a series of rapid jerks through all the points of the compass. There was no sign of dissent; he continued: [...] "A complete and absolute change; very well. But isn't a complete and absolute change precisely the thing we can never have--never, {{in the very}} nature of things?" [...] Mr. Scogan once more looked rapidly about him. [...] "Of course it is. As ourselves, as specimens of Homo Sapiens, as members of a society, how can <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> anything like an absolute change? We are tied down by the frightful limitation of our human faculties, by the notions which society imposes on us through our fatal suggestibility, by our own personalities. For us, a complete holiday is out of the question. Some of us struggle manfully to take one, but we never succeed, if I may be allowed to express myself metaphorically, we never succeed in getting farther than Southend." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{have found}} out Jadin, Alexandre Dumas' friend and {{companion}} in the 'Speronare.' He showed Robert at his house poor Louis Philippe's famous 'umbrella,' and the Duke of Orleans' uniform, and the cup from which Napoleon took his coffee, which stood beside him as he signed the abdication. Then {{there was a picture}} of 'Milord' hanging up. I must go to see too. Said Robert: 'Then Alexandre Dumas doesn't write romances always?' (You know it was like a sudden spectacle of one of Leda's eggs.) 'Indeed,' replied Jadin, 'he wrote the true history of his own travels, only, of course, seeing everything, like a poet, from his own point of view.' Alfred de Musset was to have been at M. Buloz's, where Robert was a week ago, on purpose to meet him, but he was prevented in some way. His brother Paul de Musset, a very different person, was there instead--but <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Alfred on another occasion. Do you know his poems? He is not capable of large grasps, but he has poet's life and blood in him, I assure you. He is said to be at the feet of Rachel just now, and a man may nearly as well be with a tigress in a cage. He began with the Princess Belgiojoso--followed George Sand--Rachel finishes, is likely to 'finish' in every sense. In the intervals, he plays at chess. There's the anatomy of a man! ...|$|E

60|$|One thing seemed plain: we {{must start}} {{down the river}} the next day, if people {{who could not be}} deceived were going to crop up at this rate: an {{unpalatable}} disappointment, for <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a week in St. Louis. The Southern was a good hotel, and we could have had a comfortable time there. It is large, and well conducted, and its decorations do not make one cry, as do those of the vast Palmer House, in Chicago. True, the billiard-tables were of the Old Silurian Period, and the cues and balls of the Post-Pliocene; but there was refreshment in this, not discomfort; for there is rest and healing in the contemplation of antiquities.|$|R
