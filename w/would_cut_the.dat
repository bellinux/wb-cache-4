5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first feasibility study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between San Francisco and San Jose. The 1992 Feasibility Study proposed replacing the existing diesel-electric locomotives with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other ancillary costs, such as lubricating oil, cooling water, maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively close spacing between stops, the improved acceleration using electric locomotives compared to the existing diesel-electric locomotives would cut transit time between San Francisco and San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 Feasibility Study recommended the use of electric locomotives and 25kV AC overhead lines as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|E
5|$|NBC ran three BOCs, in Burbank, California, Chicago, and New York City, {{with the}} last the largest. Cline was {{stationed}} at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before satellite transmission, programming was transmitted by coaxial cable line, {{with the cooperation of}} the telephone company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone wire to a switching station west of Chicago near the Mississippi River. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for Heidi, after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the Heidi feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.|$|E
5|$|To help attract tourists, Harvey often {{brought in}} musicians and hosted dances {{and other events}} to give Monte Ne a {{constant}} festive atmosphere. He used the Monte Ne Herald, run by his son Tom, to promote these events. The newspaper only lasted until 1905, probably due to financial troubles and Harvey's publication of personal attacks. There were sporting events in Monte Ne such as tennis, croquet, and fox hunting. Monte Ne also had the first golf course, which was built sometime before 1909. Harvey's difficult-to-please nature often ended up driving away more people than it attracted. Harvey had a lights-out at 10 p.m. policy, and <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> main electricity to the town if the policy was disobeyed, prompting disgruntled guests to leave prematurely. He was also criticized for holding events on Sunday and for banning children and people who were ill from the resort.|$|E

5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, the Athenians had some disadvantages at Marathon. In order {{to face the}} Persians in battle, the Athenians had to summon all available hoplites; and even then they were still probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1. Furthermore, raising such a large army had denuded Athens of defenders, and thus any secondary attack in the Athenian rear <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> army off from the city; and any direct attack on the city could not be defended against. Still further, defeat at Marathon would mean the complete defeat of Athens, since no other Athenian army existed. The Athenian strategy was therefore to keep the Persian army pinned down at Marathon, blocking both exits from the plain, and thus preventing themselves from being outmaneuvered. However, these disadvantages were balanced by some advantages. The Athenians initially {{had no need to}} seek battle, since they had managed to confine the Persians to the plain of Marathon. Furthermore, time worked in their favour, as every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer. Having everything to lose by attacking, and much to gain by waiting, the Athenians remained on the defensive in the run up to the battle. Tactically, hoplites were vulnerable to attacks by cavalry, and since the Persians had substantial numbers of cavalry, this made any offensive maneuver by the Athenians even more of a risk, and thus reinforced the defensive strategy of the Athenians.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, Frederick {{commanded}} 27 battalions of infantry (17,000 men) and 43 squadrons of cavalry (5,000 horse), plus 72 companies of artillery, {{for a total}} of 22,000 men. He also had several of the siege guns from Leipzig, which arrived late in the morning. He spent the morning watching the French from the Goldacker manor rooftop in Rossbach. The initial stages of Allied movement convinced him that the Allies had started retreating southward towards their magazines; he sent out patrols to learn from the peasants what could be gleaned. They reported back that Soubise had taken the Weissenfels road; it led not only to that village, but also toward Freiburg, where Soubise could find supplies, or to Merseburg, where they <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> Prussians off from the Saale. At about noon Frederick went to dinner, leaving the young captain Friedrich Wilhelm von Gaudi to observe French movements. Two hours later, his watch captain reported the French approaching. Although Gaudi's excited report at first appeared to confirm a French-Austrian retreat, Frederick observed that Allied columns, which from time to time became visible in the undulations of the ground, appeared to turn eastwards from Zeuchfeld. When Frederick saw for himself that hostile cavalry and infantry were already approaching Pettstädt, he realized his enemy's intentions: to attack him in the flank and rear, and break his communications line, if not crush him completely. They now offered him the battle for which he had maneuvered in vain, and he accepted it without hesitation.|$|E

The next step was to glue an eighth inch veneer of wood over the slots. The final step was to saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half inch thick.|$|E

GM 32's objective was a landing zone near the disputed village of Ban Ngik; the RLG had had one of its regiments, Groupement Mobile 42 (GM 42), overrun there in January. However, GM 32's seizure of Ban Ngik <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> 9th Regiment's supply line, which led eastwards along Route 23 into the Trail.|$|E
25|$|Louisville {{plays the}} role of {{newcomer}} to the Final Four by missing its first 13 shots. Over seven minutes into the game, Louisville has taken their second full timeout, has yet to hit a basket, and is losing 16-2. Louisville shook off the opening jitters and began scoring. Just after the final media timeout of the first half, two Angel McCoughtry free throws <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> lead to six, but Oklahoma would outscore Louisville 10-4 to take a twelve-point lead into the half.|$|E

25|$|Making {{and sharing}} mooncakes {{is one of}} the {{hallmark}} traditions of this festival. In Chinese culture, a round shape symbolizes completeness and reunion. Thus, the sharing and eating of round mooncakes among family members during the week of the festival signifies the completeness and unity of families. In some areas of China, there is a tradition of making mooncakes during the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival. The senior person in that household <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> mooncakes into pieces and distribute them to each family member, signifying family reunion. In modern times, however, making mooncakes at home has given way to the more popular custom of giving mooncakes to family members, although the meaning of maintaining familial unity remains.|$|E
25|$|Reliefs are {{slightly}} {{more complicated than}} his sculptures. The pieces have to be completed as quickly as possible, sometimes within one day, {{so that they do}} not dry and contract in size. When a relief was finished, Al-Zahawi <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> relief into equal sized cross-sections that fit wooden squares (approximately 8 inches sq.) so as to allow each square to have its own design portion. Each square is then fired at 1000°C (biscuit firing). Once firing is complete, each square is mounted back onto a large wooden surface to reconstruct the relief into its original design. Often the pieces do not align perfectly but this adds a more unique and creative element to the final finish.|$|E
25|$|During {{the tenure}} of mayor Dragan Đilas (2008–13), the idea of {{expanding}} the zoo to Donji Grad, which it occupied prior to the World War II, resurfaced, but the experts were against it. The urban plan for the fortress from 1965 already projected the complete relocation of the zoo outside of the fortress, {{on some of the}} suburban locations, which in later plans included Veliko Blato, Stepin Lug or Jelezovac. The expansion of the zoo <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> pedestrian communication between the Danube's and Sava's parts of the fortress, which was already cut in 1949 but was restored in 2009 with the reconstruction and opening of the Sava Gate. Also, it would prevent the exploration of Donji Grad, which is still largely unexplored and leave the Gate of Charles VI, a masterpiece of Balthasar Neumann, within the zoo itself. As of 2017, the zoo was not relocated but the idea of expansion was dropped, too.|$|E
