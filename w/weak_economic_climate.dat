50|$|The first lap dancing {{club in the}} UK {{was opened}} in 1995, and, during the 2000s, the lap-dancing {{industry}} grew quickly. In 2008, clubs were being opened {{at a rate of}} about one per week. By 2009, the total number of clubs had reached its peak of 310 (approximately twice the number in 2003), and the number of lap-dancers was estimated at 10,000. There are now lap-dancing clubs in big cities, small towns, and out-of-town business parks. The figures plateaued during the subsequent <b>weaker</b> <b>economic</b> <b>climate</b> and had hardly changed by 2012. At that point, the amount of money a lap-dancer earned in an average shift was £230 (down from around £280 in 2011), and the industry was valued at around £300 million. However, some clubs, particularly in London, charged a house fee for the dancers to perform and had an increased number of dancers, which reduced an individual dancer's earnings. The industry body in the UK representing club owners is the Lap Dancing Association.|$|R
40|$|We {{find that}} Australian mutual fund investors should avoid high fee funds as these funds {{generate}} relatively low after-fee risk-adjusted returns both unconditionally and in <b>weak</b> <b>economic</b> conditions. This result {{is different from}} some of the previous findings which showed that US mutual funds with relatively high expense ratios may generate relatively higher risk-adjusted returns during recessions relative to non-recessions, although their unconditional alphas may be negative. We find some support for the Glode hypothesis in surviving Australian wholesale funds. High-fee surviving Australian wholesale funds perform relatively strongly in both <b>weak</b> <b>economic</b> conditions and unconditionally. High-fee funds in other types of Australian mutual funds generally do not perform strongly either in <b>weak</b> <b>economic</b> conditions or unconditionally. Amongst low-fee funds, we commonly find that those that perform well unconditionally and well in <b>weak</b> <b>economic</b> conditions do charge more than those that perform well unconditionally and poorly in <b>weak</b> <b>economic</b> conditions.

40|$|When newly {{recorded}} {{according to}} the statistical method established by the EU, expenditures for social programs in Austria amounted to ATS 694 billion or 29. 5 percent of GDP in 1995.

Social spending in Austria has increased by 2. 5 percent of GDP since 1980, while the EU average for social outlays has risen by 4. 25 percent over the same period. Following a stable phase in the 1980 s, the social expenditures/GDP ratio has increased markedly during the early 1990 s {{as a result of a}} significant expansion in the number and scope of social services being offered.

The model contains the obtaining price with reduction for the planned writing off. The alternative that IAS 40 offers is the fairvalue principal, which evaluate the investment properties by consideration of the income versus outcome and surrounding factors for every accounting period Since the fairvalue is buildt on numbers the corporations them self choose what to publish and for how long the value depreciation should be lasting before it should be taken up as an unrealized value change in the reporting material. This means that there is a big chance that the evaluation can be distorted Since we just recently have had strong cyclical variation and are on our way from an excess boom into a <b>weak</b> <b>economic</b> <b>climate,</b> {{this will be the first}} study performed about fair value in a <b>weak</b> <b>economic</b> <b>climate</b> since the adoption of IAS 40. The purpose of the essay is to find out how well the booked value of investment properties owned by corporations listed on the Swedish stock market accord with the fairvalue that the market and the Swedish property index indicates on. To be able to test this connection we gathered information from the corporation’s annual reports which we compiled to see how the market comprehends. Hypotheses were concluded thru out the search of theoretic background in the hunt for an explanation to the possible difference between the booked evaluation and the guidelined evaluation. The hypotheses where tested in the program SPSS and the results from the tests form the background for our conclusions. The conclusions is that there is a differing of 2, 85 % in {{the year of}} 2008 between the revaluations in the corporations listed on the stock market and the guidelined value from SFI. Since we have only looked at 17 companies the result have to be regarded with great caution, but none the less it seems as the differing partly can be explained by the information asymmetry and partly by the debt-equity ratio despite of the differing we can establish that the investment properties evaluation to a high degree follows the cyclical variations on the real estate market...|$|E
40|$|Small-to-medium {{enterprises}} {{have often}} struggled to create successful marketing strategies within recent years {{due to the}} <b>weak</b> <b>economic</b> <b>climate</b> within the UK. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate what small-to-medium enterprises do currently to enhance brand awareness and engagement, and make recommendations to Tyre Stocks Ltd on which methods would suit them. One method which was found to be effective for small-to-medium enterprises was to use a social media strategy. This was found to be a simple and cost-effective exercise for small-to-medium enterprises to undertake. Secondary research also highlighted the importance of physical evidence within the vehicle servicing and repair industry. Questionnaires and a focus group were used to discover how suitable the name ‘Tyre Stocks Ltd’ was for the business in terms of representing the overall offering. These methods were also used to determine what vehicle owners found important when taking their vehicle for servicing and repair, as well as their engagement level and usage of social media. The results show that peer reviews and customer service were highly important to consumers when choosing a servicing location. It was determined that the current brand name of ‘Tyre Stocks Ltd’ is not effectively representing the company. Recommendations to the company included a rebrand to ‘TS Garage Services’ as well as a redesigned Facebook presence, as well as to continue providing quality customer service to consumers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Our {{purpose was}} to {{understand}} how social workers experience the possible complexities that working with economical aid can entail. As an example we chose to focus on long-term economical aid work. We aimed {{to address the question}} of which factors could affect their work. In a prior study, done by Dellgran & Höjer (2003) the conclusion was drawn  that  the combination of economical aid, healthcare and schools makeup a third of  practical social work in the terms of the proportion of the amount of social workers, but only 8 percent of the research is done in those areas. Other studies (Stranz, 2007) demonstrate that the research that is done on working with economical aid is deficient. We interviewed six social workers in two smaller municipalities in the southern of Sweden. Our result indicated that the social workers felt pressured by their work-load {{and the fact that the}} amount of new cases had increased. They thought that a possible reason for this could be the <b>weak</b> <b>economic</b> <b>climate</b> and changes in the labour market policies. They also felt that alterations and long office turnaround times at other administrative authorities also contributed.  The results showed that the majority of the social workers in our study used a motivational approach in their meetings with clients and they also had the best interest in mind for each and every client. We chose to use the theoretical perspectives of Human service organizations by Yeheskel Hasenfeld (1983) and Demokratins väktare (our translation: the guardians of democracy) by Lennart Lundquist (1998) when we analyzed our results.   Keywords: Economical aid, social workers, long-termed economical aid, human service organizations...|$|E

40|$|Proefskrif (DEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 19851. INTRODUCTION: This {{research}} was undertaken {{out of a}} conviction that the training of teachers {{in the use of}} the computer as a teaching aid should be a priority in any teacher-training programme. This conviction was strengthened by a study of the literature on computer-based education, as well as by interviews with experts in this field during a study tour undertaken in the United Kingdom in 1983. HSRC research, having been done on a continuing base since 1980, also indicated that computer-based education should receive high priority in the Republic of South Africa. 2. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: This research attempts to answer the following questions: What training should be given to prospective teachers in their pre-service training to make them competent {{in the use of the}} computer as a teaching aid? What competencies should the teacher have in the future with regard to the use of the computer as a teaching aid? Could these competencies be integrated with the present curriculum, and could this curriculum be implemented in a model for the training of teachers? 3. AIM OF THE RESEARCH: Owing to the near absence of teacher-training programmes in computer-based education, the aim of this research is to identify the competencies necessary for a teacher to be able to use the computer efficiently as a teaching aid, to incorporate these competencies in a curriculum for computer-based education and to develop a teacher-training model. 4. HYPOTHESES: The following hypotheses to be accepted or rejected as a result of of the research, were set up: - There is a need for the training of teachers in computer based education in the RSA, the content for this training exists and there are certain competencies which every trained teacher should have. - Content and competencies can be integrated into a competency-based teacher-training model. - Content and competencies can be integrated into the existing curricula for teacher training. 5. METHOD AND PROGRAMME OF RESEARCH: A thorough study of recent literature, i. e. books, articles and conference proceedings, was made. This formed the basis for the development of a theory on a teacher-training model in computer based education. From this theory a teacher-training model in computer-based education was deduced. In chapter one the problem, aims and hypotheses are formulated, as well as the research programme. A thorough situation analysis, both from a computer-based education perspective and from a teacher-training viewpoint, is made in chapter two. Relevant terms are defined, and the relationship between computer-based education and the didactic principles analysed. It is shown that the computer can be used in a variety of teaching and learning modes, for instance drill and practice, tutorial, dialogue, simulation, games, evaluation, etc. The place of the computer in the teaching situation is analysed, as well as its potential and limitations as a teaching aid. In chapter three the goals and aims of a teacher-training programme in computer-based education are discussed. A general goal is formulated for two courses, namely a basic general course for all education students, and a course for students wanting to specialize in computer-based education. These genera 1 goals are analysed into more specific aims, which in turn form the basis for the selection of course, content and the formulation of competencies in chapter four. This is followed in chapter five by a competency-based teacher-training model, and the research is concluded in chapter six with a summary and some recommendations. 6. FINDINGS FROM THE RESEARCH: 6. 1 FINDINGS WITH REGARD TO THE HYPOTHESES: All the hypotheses stated in paragraph 4 of this summary can be accepted on the results of this research. A definite need for the training of teachers in computer-based education is revealed, the content for this training, and the competencies required are described. Content and competencies can be integrated into a competency-based teacher-training model, and can also be integrated into the existing curricula for teacher training. 6. 2 FINDINGS WITH REGARD TO THE RESEARCH PROBLEM AND THE AIMS OF THE RESEARCH: To answer the questions put in the formulation of the research problem, competencies had to be identified, a curriculum, as well as a competency-based training model, had to be designed. These were all achieved. It can therefore be concluded that the aims of the research were realised. 6. 3 FINDINGS FROM THE LITERATURE: The world is on the threshold of a new era, the information era, which will replace the industrial era. It is in line with God's cultural command that the computer should be studied and used in order to help to accomplish God's plan for man. In a number of countries, for instance the United States of America, the United Kingdom and France, strategies have been implemented to promote computer-based education. There are a number of isolated, but well established efforts to implement computer-based education in the RSA. The Human Sciences Research Council is actively involved in research on computer-based education. Computers will become cheaper, more powerful and user-friendly, and will therefore play an ever-increasing role in the everyday life of each individual. A number of serious problems exist in connection with the implementation of computer-based education, for instance the present <b>weak</b> <b>economic</b> <b>climate,</b> black education explosion and the drive toward equality in standards of education in the RSA. From a computer perspective the greatest problems are the backlog in courseware (lesson material) suitable for South African schools, the incompatibility of South African curricula and imported programme packages, and practical problems in the development of courseware. From a teaching perspective, the following conclusions may be reached: - Several computer configurations, from mainframe to micro-computer, are suitable for teaching situations. - Several instructional modes are available in computer-based education, which makes it a very powerful teaching aid. - The computer can play an important role in problem solving strategies. - The simulation mode of computer-based education makes it possible to include projects in the curriculum which would otherwise be too costly, too dangerous or too long to include. - Computer-based education can make drill and practice situations less frustrating for all involved. - Computer-based education can be used effectively in evaluation. - The computer, as a new teaching aid, is in harmony with the existing didactic principles like motivation, individualisation, socialisation, mastery, etc. 7. RECOMMENDATIONS ARISING FROM THE RESEARCH: 7. 1 Recommendations with regard to teacher training are the following: - all authorities concerned with teacher training should start as soon as possible with the training of teachers in computer-based education. - Training for students in preparation for secondary education should receive priority. - An interest group for computer-based education should be formed in each region. These groups can discuss problems and progress at meetings, newsletters can be sent to members, and other activities can be embarked upon to enhance the state-of-the-art of computer-based education. - The various education authorities should give serious thought to a strategy for in-service training in computer-based education. - Dialogue between the teacher training institutions and the computer industry, that is manufacturers and distributors of hardware and software, should be encouraged. Such dialogue is essential in view of the rapid changes taking place in the field of micro-electronics. - Training programmes should be reviewed at short intervals, due to the dynamic nature of this field. -Training programmes and courseware development-programmes should go hand in hand, because of the serious shortage of suitable courseware for the South African situation. - Lecturing staff at all training institutions, but especially those at which teachers are trained, should be involved, on a voluntary basis, in computer-based education projects. - Methods should be devised to encourage lecturing staff at training institutions to become involved in the development of courseware for their students, otherwise they are bound to continue in the traditional way of lecturing, and of writing research papers and textbooks. 7. 2 Recommendations with regard to teaching practice are the following: - Education authorities must provide broad guidelines to schools with regard to computer-based education. At present every educational institution which becomes involved in computer-based education does so on its own initiative - there is no co-operation between different institutions. - Schools and other educational institutions should form computer-based education clubs or interest groups. - The implementation of computer-based education should be done with tact and without force, especially as far as practising teachers are concerned. - The computer can be used initially to lessen the teacher's administrative workload. - The enthusiastic and capable teacher who is interested in computer-based education should receive all help and encouragement possible. If possible, he should be freed from, extra-mural activities and be assigned to computer-based education only. - Schools and other educational institutions should actively support any action emanating from the authorities with regard to computer-based education. - Schools and other educational institutions should encourage computer literacy amongst their students through the formation of computer clubs. Recommendations with regard to further research are: - Research should be conducted on the training of teachers for computer-based education in the various educational systems for black and coloured people. This is necessary because of the vast differences in the initial situation and cultural background between the various groups. - Research should be done on the feasibility of a national strategy for the training of teachers in computer-based education, the introduction of computers into schools and the encouragement of computer literacy in general. - Research should be done on the development of a similar model for the training of teachers for primary education. - This model - and others - should be evaluated in practice. - The role and function of computer-based education in all the different subjects should be researched. - Research should be done with regard to the effect on the general public of a national strategy for computer-based education. - Continuous research should be done on how the computer can be used to 1 mprove teaching. New developments in the field of hardware and courseware necessitate this. It is clear that the field of computer-based education is a dynamic, developing field, which is continually stimulating research. Doctora...|$|E
