He tries to write 1,000 words a day. Commenting on the rigidity of his routine, Chabon said, [...] "There have been plenty of self-destructive rebel-angel novelists over the years, but writing is about getting your work done and getting your work done every day. If {{you want to write}} novels, they take a long time, and they're big, and {{they have a lot of}} words in them.... The best environment, at least for me, is a very stable, structured kind of life." ...|$|E
