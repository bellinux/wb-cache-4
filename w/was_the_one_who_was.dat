He knows that <b>the</b> Atman <b>is</b> truth, is knowledge, is bliss and is eternity. He <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> knows that <b>the</b> same soul in him is in everyone, {{is in all}} things, pervading within and without, {{something that can be}} felt but not reasoned. He <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> free from malice, who fulfills his nature, is not driven by cravings for worldly objects or desire or delusions. He <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> lives a life untouched by spite, ostentation, pride or the need to impress others.|$|R

500|$|Martin O'Donnell {{described}} Bungie's workplace {{culture as}} [...] "a slightly irreverent attitude, and not corporate, bureaucratic or business-focused"; artist Shi Kai Wang noted {{that when he}} walked into Bungie for an interview, [...] "I realized that I <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> over-dressed, [...] I knew this was the place I wanted to work." [...] Frank O'Connor comically noted that at a Gamestop conference, the Bungie team was told to wear business casual, to which O'Connor replied [...] "We [...] don't do business casual." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, {{published}} The Hidden Curriculum, {{arguing that}} education at MIT was often slighted {{in favor of}} following a set of unwritten expectations, and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education. The successful student, according to Snyder, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms. For example, organized student groups had compiled [...] "course bibles"—collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references. This sort of gamesmanship, Snyder argued, hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest.|$|E
2500|$|On October 26, 1927, Duke Ellington's Orchestra {{recorded}} [...] "Creole Love Call" [...] featuring Adelaide Hall singing wordlessly. [...] "She {{sounds like}} a particularly sensitive growl trumpeter", according to Nat Hentoff. He describes her wordless vocals as, [...] "really another instrument...sometimes...evocative growls". The creativity must be shared between Ellington and Hall as he knew the style of performance he wanted, but she <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> able to produce the sound. In 1932, Ellington repeated the experiment {{in one of his}} versions of [...] "The Mooche", with Baby Cox singing scat after a muted similar trombone solo by Tricky Sam Nanton.|$|E

2500|$|Beforehand, {{there was}} a flurry of heated blog posts which {{resulted}} in the museum sending a warning letter detailing appropriate behavior. The visit resulted in two reported incidents. In one, a student wearing a T-shirt that read [...] "There's probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy yourself" [...] It was also reported that a student was asked to leave the Creation Museum after a family visiting the museum complained to staff that they saw him [...] "laughing at the exhibits". Ken Ham however, denied that the student was told to leave, claiming that a photographer who witnessed the incident <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> removed.|$|E
2500|$|Bruce Johnson got his {{job because}} of another scandal. [...] This gets complicated: former Ohio State Treasurer Joe Deters saw two of his aides indicted. Damaged goods, he left in midterm to run for county {{prosecutor}} back home in Cincinnati. Gov. Taft moved then-Lt. Gov. Jennette Bradley into Mr. Deters' job by appointment, hoping she'll hold the spot for Republicans in 2006. And then the governor appointed his development director, Mr. Johnson, as lieutenant governor. The finagling has simply been rampant. For a man to become governor through that process and a gubernatorial scandal would be, uh, scandalous. Whether a new governor with that background would be even weaker than a convicted Gov. Taft is a close call. The decisive factor in determining who should be governor has to be that Gov. Taft <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> elected.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2004, Gaahl again {{received}} a prison sentence, for aggravated assault. He appealed for a reduced sentence, and in February 2005 he was re-sentenced to fourteen {{months in prison}} and ordered to pay the victim 190,000 NOK (about 30,400 US$) in compensation. The incident happened in February 2002 during a late-night party at Gaahl's house in Espedal, when he became involved in a confrontation {{with a man who}} arrived at his house. Gaahl was accused of severely beating the man, collecting his blood into a cup and threatening to make him drink it. Gaahl said [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> attacked, but they think I punished him too hard. As I always say, when people cross my line and I let them know where the line is many steps before they cross it, and still they choose to cross it, then I will be the one to decide what their punishment will be". He also claimed to have given the man the cup [...] "so that he would not make such a mess in my house with all the blood". In March 2006, Gaahl recorded vocals for Gorgoroth's next album, Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam. According to band members, he was in prison from April to December 2006.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{thereafter}} Chesapeake left Norfolk, {{and after}} stopping briefly at Washington for further preparations, set sail for the Mediterranean on June 22. In little {{time she was}} pursued by , {{which at the time}} was part of a British squadron in Lynnhaven Bay. Upon closing with Chesapeake, Barron was hailed by the captain of Leopard and informed that a letter would be sent on board with a demand from Vice-Admiral Humphreys that Chesapeake be searched for deserters. Barron found the demand extraordinary and when he refused to surrender any of his crew, Leopard soon opened fire on Chesapeake. Having just put to sea, Chesapeake was not prepared to do battle and was unable to return fire. Inside twenty minutes, three of her crew were killed and eighteen wounded. Barron struck the ship's colors and surrendered his ship, whereupon she was boarded and the alleged deserters were taken into British custody. Not having any other designs on Chesapeake, Humphreys allowed Barron to proceed with his ship at his own discretion, where he {{had little choice but to}} return home with the battered vessel, reaching Hampton Roads on June 23 with twenty-two shots through her hull, crippled fore- and mainmasts and more than three feet of water in her hold. News of the incident soon reached President Jefferson, the Department of the Navy, [...] and the general population in America. As commander at Gosport, Decatur in particular was outraged over the incident as he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> first confronted with the matter. The incident soon came to be referred to as the Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, an event whose controversy would lead to a duel between Barron and Decatur some years later, as Decatur served on Barron's court-martial and later was one of the most outspoken critics of the questionable handling of Chesapeake.|$|E
