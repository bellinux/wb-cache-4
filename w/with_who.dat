25|$|The {{ideal self}} and real self involve {{understanding}} {{the issues that}} arise from having {{an idea of what}} you wish you were as a person, and having that not match <b>with</b> <b>who</b> you actually are as a person (incongruence). The ideal self is what a person believes should be done, as well as what their core values are. The real self is what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it may not be what the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E
25|$|On April 5, 2010, a {{court ruled}} that Duffy could {{continue}} living on Hopper's property, and that he must pay US$12,000 per month spousal and child support for their daughter Galen.

Though Hopper died two weeks later, Duffy insisted at the hearing that he was well enough to be deposed.

A very ill Hopper did not appear in court though his estranged wife did – case BD518046. Despite Duffy's bid to be named the sole beneficiary of Hopper's million-dollar policy, the judge ruled against her and limited her claim to one-quarter of the policy. The remaining US$750,000 was to go to his estate.|$|E
25|$|A major {{obstacle}} to effective global surveillance and control of infectious diseases {{will continue to be}} the quality of national health statistical reporting by many developing countries and lack of followthrough to properly direct aid and to follow recommended health care practices. Those areas of the world most susceptible to infectious disease problems are least able to develop and maintain the sophisticated and costly communications equipment needed for effective disease surveillance and reporting. In addition to the barriers dictated by low levels of development, revealing a disease outbreakmay harm national prestige, commerce, and tourism. For example, nearly every country initially denied or minimized the extent of the HIV/AIDS virus within its borders, and even today, some countries known to have significant rates of HIV infection refuse to cooperate <b>with</b> <b>WHO.</b> Only a few, such as Uganda, Senegal, and Thailand, have launched major preventative efforts, while many WHO members do not even endorse AIDS education in schools. Similarly, some countries deny the existence of cholera within their borders.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} factors affecting domestic violence risk behaviors among Thai Muslim married couples in Satun Province. The data were collected from 1, 920 wives as representatives of families, and analyzed using the R program to find out frequencies, percentages, chi-square test, odds ratios, and logistic coefficients. The results revealed that 34. 3 percent of Thai Muslim married couples in Satun Province had domestic violence risk behaviors, and the factors affecting domestic risk behaviors with statistical significance consisted of six variables, namely jealous wives, suspicious wives, drinking husbands, drug abusive husbands, being not ready to have one's own family, and lack of time for discussions. Married couples who had high domestic violence risk behaviors were those <b>with</b> wives <b>who</b> were regularly jealous, and those <b>with</b> wives <b>who</b> were occasionally jealous were 3. 70 times, and 3. 43 times more likely to have risk behaviors than those <b>with</b> wives <b>who</b> were never jealous; those <b>with</b> wives <b>who</b> were regularly suspicious, and those <b>with</b> wives <b>who</b> were occasionally suspicious were 3. 19 times, and 1. 76 times more likely to have risk behaviors than those <b>with</b> wives <b>who</b> were never suspicious; those <b>with</b> husbands <b>who</b> regularly drank, and those <b>with</b> husbands <b>who</b> occasionally drank were 2. 14 times, and 1. 41 times more likely to have risk behaviors than those <b>with</b> husbands <b>who</b> never drank alcohol; those <b>with</b> husbands <b>who</b> regularly used drugs, and those <b>with</b> husbands <b>who</b> occasionally used drugs were 1. 86 times, and 1. 39 times more likely to have risk behaviors than those <b>with</b> husbands <b>who</b> never used drugs; married couples who were not ready, and those who were moderately ready to have their own families were 1. 79 times, and 1. 44 times more likely to have risk behaviors than those who were very ready to have a family, and married couples who did not have time for discussions, and those who moderately had time for discussions were 1. 72 times, and 1. 47 times more likely to have risk behaviors than those who had a lot of time for discussions...|$|R
25|$|After the battle, Tetsuo {{tries to}} resurrect Kaori, {{a girl he}} had been acquainted <b>with</b> <b>who</b> {{was killed in the}} battle. He succeeds to a small degree, but she returns to life blind, cold and in agony, so he lets her die once more. He retreats to Akira's {{cryogenic}} chamber beneath the stadium, carrying her body. Kaneda and his friends appear to fight Tetsuo once more, but his powers transform him into a monstrous, amoeba-like mass resembling a fetus, absorbing everything near him. Tetsuo pulls the cryogenic chamber above-ground and drops it onto Lady Miyako's temple. Lady Miyako dies while defying Tetsuo, but not before guiding Kei into space to fire upon him with SOL. Kei's attack awakens Tetsuo's full powers, triggering a psychic reaction similar to Akira's. With the help of Kiyoko, Masaru, and a resurrected Takashi, Akira is able to cancel out Tetsuo's explosion with one of his own. They are also able to free Kaneda, who was trapped in Tetsuo's mass, and he witnesses the truth about the Espers' power as they, alongside Akira and Tetsuo, ascend to a higher plane of existence.|$|E
