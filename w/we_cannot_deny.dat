When our beliefs do not fit the facts, they cannot do what {{they are supposed to}} do because they cannot provide us with reasons. <b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> plausibly <b>deny</b> that a truth norm is among the norms that govern belief. What we should not say is that the truth norm is the fundamental epistemic norm. In this paper, I shall argue that knowledge is the norm of belief and that the truth norm has a derivative status. Only a knowledge-first approach to epistemic normativity can explain why epistemic assessment has its inward looking focus. A commonly held view about the relation between belief and truth is that the one aims at the other. 1 This talk of aims should be understood metaphorically and the metaphor interpreted in normative terms. Your beliefs are defective if they don’t fit the facts. They shouldn’t be like that and you shouldn’t have beliefs like that. The dominant approach to epistemic normativity starts from the idea that th...|$|R

His buttercup, his dandelion, and his meadow-sweet grow thick in every English field. His thyme clothes the hillside; his heather purples the bleak gray moorland. High up among the alpine heights his gentian spreads its lakes of blue; amid the snows of the Himalayas his rhododendrons gleam with crimson light. Even the wayside pond yields him the white crowfoot and the arrowhead, while the broad expanses of Brazilian streams are beautified by his gorgeous water-lilies. The insect has thus turned the whole {{surface of the earth}} into a boundless flower-garden, which supplies him from year to year with pollen or honey, and itself in turn gains perpetuation by the baits that it offers for his allurement."[160] ...|$|R
60|$|The unexpectedness of the {{conclusion}} here, after the somewhat solemn preface, is entirely {{of the essence}} of wit. So, too, is the sudden flirt of the scorpion's tail to sting you. It is almost the opposite of humor in one respect--namely, {{that it would make}} us think the solemnest things in life were sham, whereas it is the sham-solemn ones which humor delights in exposing. This further difference is also true: that wit makes you laugh once, and loses some of its comicality (though none of its point) with every new reading, while humor grows droller and droller the oftener we read it. If <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> safely <b>deny</b> that Swift was a humorist, we may at least say that he was one in whom humor had gone through the stage of acetous fermentation and become rancid. We should never forget that he died mad. Satirists of this kind, while they have this quality of true humor, that they contrast a higher with a lower, differ from their nobler brethren inasmuch as their comparison is always to the disadvantage of the higher. They purposely disenchant us--while the others rather show us how sad a thing it is to be disenchanted at all.|$|R
60|$|There is {{one final}} and {{complete}} {{answer to all}} such charges. It {{is that we have}} now in our hands 42,000 males of the Boer nations. They assert, and <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>deny,</b> that their losses in killed have been extraordinarily light during two years of warfare. How are these admitted and certain facts compatible with any general refusal of quarter? To anyone who, like myself, has seen the British soldiers jesting and smoking cigarettes with their captives within five minutes of their being taken, such a charge is ludicrous, but surely even to the most biassed mind the fact stated above must be conclusive.|$|E
60|$|Be this as it may, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>deny</b> {{that the}} cause of the {{outbreak}} of measles was the collection of the women and children by us into the camps.

And why had we destroyed the means of subsistence? To limit the operations of the mobile bands of guerillas. At the end of every tragedy we are forced back to the common origin of all of them, and made to understand that the nation which obstinately perseveres in a useless guerilla war prepares much trouble for its enemy, but absolute ruin for itself.|$|E

60|$|Man is {{naturally}} a carnivorous animal. This none but greengrocers will dispute. That he was formerly less vegetarian in his diet than at present, {{is clear from}} the fact that market-gardening increases in the ratio of civilization. So we may safely assume that at some remote period Man subsisted upon an exclusively flesh diet. Our uniform vanity has given us the human mind as the ne plus ultra of intelligence, the human face and figure as the standard of beauty. Of course <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>deny</b> to human fat and lean an equal superiority over beef, mutton, and pork. It is plain that our meat-eating ancestors would think in this way, and, being unrestrained by the mawkish sentiment attendant upon high civilization, would act habitually upon the obvious suggestion.

It is said <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>deny</b> that the Budget is driving capital out of the country. I deny it absolutely. To begin with, it is {{impossible}} to drive the greater part of our capital out of this country, for what is the capital of the country? The greatest part of that capital is the land, the state of cultivation which exists, the roads, the railways, the mines, the mills--this is the greatest part of the capital. The owners of that capital might conceivably, if they thought fit, depart from the country, but their possessions would remain behind.|$|E

Over these matters the Kirk, with all her power, and the Free Kirk too, have had absolutely no influence whatever. To leave so delicate a topic, you were but as other swains, or, as 'that Birkie ca'd a lord,' Lord Byron; only you combined (in certain of your letters) a libertine theory with your practice; you poured out in song your audacious raptures, your half-hearted repentance, your shame and your scorn.

60|$|Having said {{so much as}} this in {{compliance}} with the frequent American pretence that the English are without humor, I wish to hedge in the interest of truth. They certainly are not so constantly joking as we; it does not apparently seem to them that fate can be propitiated by a habit of pleasantry, or that this is so merry a world that one need go about grinning in it. Perhaps the conditions with most of them are harder than the conditions with most of us. But, thinking of certain Englishmen I have known, I should be ashamed to join in the cry of those story- telling Americans whose jokes have sometimes fallen effectless. It is true that, wherever the Celt has leavened the doughier Anglo-Saxon lump, the expectation of a humorous sympathy is greater; but there are subtile spirits of Teutonic origin whose fineness <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>deny,</b> whose delicate gayety is of a sort which may well leave ours impeaching itself of a heavier and grosser fibre.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>deny,</b> however, that, {{in spite}} of all faults, these men had a strength. They have {{exercised}} an influence. And they have done so by virtue of seeing a fact which more complete, and in some cases more manly poets, did not see. Strangely enough, Shelley, the man who was the greatest sinner of them all against the canons of good taste, was the man who saw that new fact, if not most clearly, still most intensely, and who proclaimed it most boldly. His influence, therefore, is outliving that of his compeers, and growing and spreading, for good and for evil; and will grow and spread for years to come, as long as the present great unrest goes on smouldering in men's hearts, till the hollow settlement of 1815 is burst asunder anew, and men feel that they are no longer {{in the beginning of the}} end, but in the end itself, and that this long thirty years' prologue to the reconstruction of rotten Europe is played out at last, and the drama itself begun.|$|E

60|$|But {{to return}} to my purpose. When there is {{anything}} deficient in numbers and sound, the reader is uneasy and unsatisfied; he wants something of his complement, desires somewhat which he finds not: and this being the manifest defect of Horace, {{it is no wonder}} that, finding it supplied in Juvenal, we are more delighted with him. And besides this, the sauce of Juvenal is more poignant, to create in us an appetite of reading him. The meat of Horace is more nourishing, but the cookery of Juvenal more exquisite; so that, granting Horace to be the more general philosopher, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>deny</b> that Juvenal was the greater poet--I mean, in satire. His thoughts are sharper, his indignation against vice is more vehement, his spirit has more of the commonwealth genius; he treats tyranny, and all the vices attending it, as they deserve, with the utmost rigour; and consequently a noble soul is better pleased with a zealous vindicator of Roman liberty than with a temporising poet, a well- mannered court slave, and a man who is often afraid of laughing in the right place--who is ever decent, because he is naturally servile.|$|E
6000|$|In the {{meantime}} {{it is not}} surprising that he has his imitators. Whatever exceptions we take to his methods or his results, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>deny</b> him a very great literary genius. To me there is a perpetual delight in his way of saying things, and I cannot wonder that younger men try to catch the trick of it. The disappointing thing for them is that it is not a trick, but an inherent virtue. His style is, upon the whole, better than that of any other novelist I know; it is always easy, without being trivial, and it is often stately, without being stiff; it gives a charm to everything he writes; and he has written so much and in such various directions, that we should be judging him very incompletely if we considered him only as a novelist. His book of European sketches must rank him with the most enlightened and agreeable travelers; and it might be fitly supplemented from his uncollected papers with a volume of American sketches. In his essays on modern French writers he indicates his critical range and grasp; but he scarcely does more, as his criticisms in [...] "The Atlantic" [...] and [...] "The Nation" [...] and elsewhere could abundantly testify.|$|E

The fabric hardly raised its grey and vaulted roof among the crumbling hills of mortality by which it was surrounded, and was indeed so small in size, and so much lowered in height by the graves on the outside, which ascended half way up the low Saxon windows, that it might itself have appeared only a funeral vault, or mausoleum of larger size. Its little square tower, with the ancient belfry, alone distinguished it from such a monument. But when the grey-headed beadle turned the keys with his shaking hand, the antiquary was admitted into an ancient building, which, from the style of its architecture, and some monuments of the Mowbrays of St. Ronan's, which {{the old man was}} accustomed to point out, was generally conjectured to be as early as the thirteenth century.|$|E
