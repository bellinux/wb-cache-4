25|$|Michigan {{seemed to}} be {{fighting}} for a hopeless cause and the hand crawled around the clock {{toward the end of}} the game. In that moment of despair for all those who cheer for Michigan, Harmon came out of nowhere to dominate the field. When the Yale line braced on its own goal, Harmon gambled by <b>waiting</b> <b>patiently</b> with the ball in his hand until John Nicholson could get free to catch the pass that meant defeat for Yale.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} bathypelagic fishes {{are small}} bristlemouth and anglerfish; fangtooth, viperfish, daggertooth and barracudina are also common. These fishes are small, many about 10 centimetres long, and not many longer than 25cm. They {{spend most of}} their time <b>waiting</b> <b>patiently</b> in the water column for prey to appear or to be lured by their phosphors. What little energy is available in the bathypelagic zone filters from above in the form of detritus, faecal material, and the occasional invertebrate or mesopelagic fish. About 20% of the food that has its origins in the epipelagic zone falls down to the mesopelagic zone, but only about 5% filters down to the bathypelagic zone.|$|E
25|$|Tan {{posits that}} most sexual {{language}} in the Philippines is patriarchal: it focuses on the actions and expectations of the male, rather than female, participants. As an example, gamit tends {{to be used as}} Ginamit ako ng mister ko ("My husband 'used' me"), but such turn of phrase would never be used by a straight man. Tan uses other metaphors, such as the relationship between the euphemisms pagdidilig ("to water plants") and magpadilig ("to be watered"), and a woman <b>waiting</b> <b>patiently</b> for sex is described as uhaw (thirsty), to forward this theory: in his view, the Tagalog language subconsciously puts the woman in the passive role.|$|E

25|$|Goatfish are tireless benthic feeders, using {{a pair of}} long chemosensory barbels (whiskers) {{protruding}} from their chins to rifle through the sediments {{in search of a}} meal. Like goats, they seek anything edible: worms, crustaceans, molluscs and other small invertebrates are staples. The yellowfin goatfish (Mulloidichthys vanicolensis) often schools with the blue-striped snapper. The yellowfins change their colouration to match that of the snapper. Presumably this is for predator protection, since goatfish are a more preferred prey than bluestripe snapper. By night the schools disperse and individual goatfish head their separate ways to loot the sands. Other nocturnal feeders shadow the active goatfish, <b>waiting</b> <b>patiently</b> for overlooked morsels.|$|E
25|$|On {{arriving}} in Paris, Pelet insisted on seeing Emperor Napoleon as his orders from Masséna required, despite being discouraged to do so. After <b>waiting</b> <b>patiently</b> {{for an entire}} day, he was finally allowed to see Napoleon, who began by venting his anger at Pelet for the failed campaign in Portugal. After calming down a little, the emperor offered {{up a series of}} pointed criticisms, which the undaunted Pelet carefully explained, defending both Masséna's and his own actions. By the end of the 3-hour interview, Napoleon's attitude changed to a friendlier one. Pelet was invited to return the next day and help Napoleon compose the bulletin that would be released to the public. Pelet recommended to the emperor that the corps commanders be removed. Evidently, this advice was followed because the corps commanders were soon sent home and the Army of Portugal was reorganized into six independent divisions. Napoleon then promoted Pelet to colonel. Another source gave the date of his promotion as 12 October 1812.|$|E
25|$|Goatfishes are {{a family}} Mullidae of about 55 species of perciform fishes, {{associated}} worldwide with tropical reefs. They are typically about 20cm long, though the dash-and-dot goatfish, grows to 55cm. Goatfish are tireless benthic feeders, possess {{a pair of}} long chemosensory barbels ("whiskers") protruding from their chins resembling a goat’s beard. They use these to rifle through the sediments {{in search of a}} meal. Like goats, they seek anything edible; worms, crustaceans, molluscs and other small invertebrates are staples. Many species of goatfish are conspicuously coloured and have the ability to change their colouration depending on their current activity. By day, many form large inactive (non-feeding) schools: these aggregates may contain both conspecifics and heterospecifics. For example, the yellowfin goatfish school with blue-striped snappers. When they do that, the yellowfins changes its colouration to match that of the snapper. By night the schools disperse and individual goatfish head their separate ways to loot the sands. The diurnal goldsaddle goatfish changes from a lemon-yellow to a pale cream when feeding. Other nocturnal feeders will shadow the active goatfish, <b>waiting</b> <b>patiently</b> for overlooked morsels. Goatfish stay within the shallows, going no deeper than about 110 metres. Most species do not tolerate brackish water, so they do not enter estuaries or the mouths of rivers.|$|E

500|$|As a {{daughter}} of a rich and religious family, Agoncillo was referred to in their town as Roselang Hubog which means [...] "a virgin enthroned in the town church".

500|$|The {{title of}} Gather Together is {{inspired}} by Matthew 18:19-20: [...] "Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I {{in the midst of}} them" [...] (King James version). While Angelou acknowledged the title's biblical origin, she also stated that the title counteracted the tendency of many adults to lie to their children about their pasts. Scholar Sondra O'Neale states that the title is [...] "a New Testament injunction for the traveling soul to pray and commune while <b>waiting</b> <b>patiently</b> for deliverance".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, Michigan faced fourth {{down on its}} own 20-yard line with 19 yards needed for a first down from its own 20-yard line. Norm Purucker punted from deep in Michigan territory, and Yale's Gil Humphrey {{returned}} the ball to Michigan's 37-yard line. At that point, sports writer Allison Danzig of The New York Times wrote that Michigan [...] "looked to have met its master." [...] However, Yale was penalized for running into the kicker, resulting in Michigan receiving the ball with a first down at the 25-yard line. From that point, Tom Harmon led the Wolverines on a 75-yard touchdown drive that included three passes from Harmon covering 52 yards. [...] The game-winner was a short pass from Harmon to John Nicholson in the end zone. [...] John Brennan kicked the PAT. The United Press described the game-winning drive as follows:"Michigan seemed to be fighting for a hopeless cause and the hand crawled around the clock {{toward the end of}} the game. In that moment of despair for all those who cheer for Michigan, Harmon came out of nowhere to dominate the field. When the Yale line braced on its own goal, Harmon gambled by <b>waiting</b> <b>patiently</b> with the ball in his hand until John Nicholson could get free to catch the pass that meant defeat for Yale." ...|$|E
