The phone was plugged into AC power overnight; he <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> smell {{of smoke and}} burning matter. In the video, the power cord was shown to be severely burnt and showed warped damage to the power plug. Later in the video, Wygand describes how he attempted to get a replacement: ...|$|E

Once the studios realized that they could exploit the economies of (small) scale, they more or less gave up buying or remaking the films themselves, and either bought the distributors, as Disney had Miramax, or started their own... copy Miramax's marketing and distribution strategies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regiment}} remained stationed near Corinth {{until the}} spring of 1863. [...] During this time the 2nd Iowa was placed on garrison duty. [...] While on garrison duty, the typical soldier <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pounding of drums and the whistles of the band and assembled on the company parade ground for roll call. [...] The soldier was then assigned a duty for the day, most often this was distinguished between standing picket or police duty. [...] Roll call was followed by breakfast, after which the soldiers performed their duty for the day. [...] This was followed by drill time and dinner.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1974 {{they were}} on tour again around England and Europe with Captain Beefheart. It was during this tour that Henry Cow <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reality of what was {{happening}} to them: they were becoming a rock band, playing the same thing night after night. Life was no longer a challenge and they were becoming complacent. After some serious thinking they decided to ask Lindsay Cooper to leave and fulfilled their last outstanding concert obligations (a tour of the Netherlands) as a quartet. Without Cooper they were forced to abandon much of their learned material and worked up a 35–40 minute piece unlike anything else they had done before (this later became the politically charged [...] "Living in the Heart of the Beast" [...] on In Praise of Learning).|$|E
2500|$|From 10 to 14 September 1943, the Germans {{tried to}} force the Italian {{garrison}} in Corfu to surrender, while the political prisoners from the small island of Lazaretto were set free. Finally, {{on the morning of}} 13 September, Corfiots <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disasters of the war, as the Germans attacked the island. The German air raids continued the whole day bombarding the port, the Fortresses and strategic points. During the night of 14 September, huge damages were inflicted to the Jewish quarters of Saint Fathers and Saint Athanasios, the Court House, the Ionian Parliament, the Ionian Academy, in which the Library was lodged, the Schools of Middle Education, the Hotel [...] "Bella Venezia", the Customs Office, the Manor-Houses and the Theatre. Finally the next week the Germans occupied the island with huge losses among the Italians, and subsequently deported the nearly 5,000 Jews (speakers of the Italkian) of the island to concentration camps, where most of them perished.|$|E
2500|$|Superintendent James {{retired in}} 1875 {{and he was}} succeeded by his deputy, Colonel John Cameron. He died {{suddenly}} in 1878 and after his death Clarke was made acting head of the Survey until the appointment of Colonel Anthony C. Cooke. It was surprising that Clarke himself was not appointed. Three years later the War Office intervened in his career once again; [...] "an official of a well-known type <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that he had}} been at a home station (i.e. the Survey at Southampton) for twenty-seven years, and he was ordered to go to Mauritius" [...] [...] Clarke, a man of some-what hasty temper (Close), strongly resented this summary order which involved such a complete break with his life's work and he promptly sent in his resignation from the Army. Despite protestations to the War Office from the scientific establishment, Clarke's resignation was allowed to stand. [...] "Clarke's retirement was a veritable disaster for the Survey, and his departure lowered the whole tone and scientific status of the department for many a long year." [...]|$|E

2500|$|At about 11:00 AM, French troops {{reached the}} [...] bridge. The {{men of the}} two brown-coated Tirailleur battalions burst through the gate at the west end and raced across the span. The Austrian {{artillery}} took the bridge under furious fire, killing friend and foe alike, but its fire was unable to stop the French advance. The bridge had been prepared for burning by Captain Simbschen of Hiller's staff, but the officer {{was not on the}} scene to give the orders to set it on fire. Hiller, who had been unconcernedly lunching on the Ebelsberg Castle terrace, finally <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> danger and began issuing orders. Cut off by the swift French advance, a squadron of Uhlans swam their horses across the river. An Austrian staff officer grabbed a French shako, crossed with the enemy infantry, and escaped into the town. Generalmajor Ferdinand, Graf Bubna von Littitz became a prisoner, while at least 500 of Hoffmeister's men and large numbers of other soldiers surrendered. The 2nd battalion of the Klebeck Regiment of Schustekh's force was captured in a body with its colors. Other soldiers drowned trying vainly to swim across the snow-melt swollen river.|$|E

60|$|Trusting in the {{advantages}} of his position, and confident in the valour of his troops, he chose the last alternative. Very anxiously, during the day, the British officers watched the French line of defence, fearful lest the enemy would again retreat.

The French, indeed, had been so accustomed to beat the Spanish and Portuguese, that they had not <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that they had troops of a very different material facing them.|$|E
6000|$|During the {{afternoon}} we passed Sweetwater Creek, Independence Rock, Devil's Gate and the Devil's Gap. The latter were wild specimens of rugged scenery, {{and full of}} interest--we were {{in the heart of}} the Rocky Mountains, now. And we also passed by [...] "Alkali" [...] or [...] "Soda Lake," [...] and we <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that our journey had stretched a long way across the world when the driver said that the Mormons often came there from Great Salt Lake City to haul away saleratus. He said that a few days gone by they had shoveled up enough pure saleratus from the ground (it was a dry lake) to load two wagons, and that when they got these two wagons-loads of a drug that cost them nothing, to Salt Lake, they could sell it for twenty-five cents a pound.|$|E

[...] That term was a lively one, for some lads came there from another school, and they, led by Nat Poole, {{tried to run}} matters to suit themselves. But when the newcomers lost an important football contest, Oak Hall <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> true condition of affairs, and Dave and his chums quickly regained their places on the eleven, and then won a grand victory. During this time Link Merwell, in company with another bad boy named Nick Jasniff, became a student at Rockville Military Academy, a rival institution of learning. Both bullies {{did their best to}} make trouble for our hero, but, as before, he exposed them, and this time they had to flee to escape arrest.|$|E

60|$|The {{column was}} led by Colonel Dartnel, chief of the Natal Police, whose {{knowledge}} of the district was invaluable to the troops. The roads were heavy, and the rain continued to pour down in torrents. Each man carried three days' provisions; they tramped along silently through the night; stoppages by swollen streams were frequent, and by daybreak the next morning they had only accomplished nine miles of their journey. Early {{in the morning the}} townspeople had <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the army had gone, and there was a general exodus of all who could obtain conveyances. The Boers remained for some time in ignorance that the force whose capture or destruction they had regarded as certain had slipped away. They saw the tents, but the fact that neither men nor horses were visible puzzled them, and it was eleven o'clock before some of the more venturesome galloping down found that the English force had escaped.|$|E
60|$|Even {{the daily}} papers <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{disturbances}} at last, and popular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon Mars. The seriocomic periodical Punch, I remember, made a happy {{use of it}} in the political cartoon. And, all unsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, men could go about their petty concerns as they did. I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days. People in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers. For my own part, I was much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed.|$|E
6000|$|A negro boy--he {{is said to}} {{be still}} alive in St. Vincent--was herding cattle on the mountain-side. A stone fell near him; and then another. He fancied that other boys were pelting him from the cliffs above, and began {{throwing}} stones in return. But the stones fell thicker: and among them one, and then another, too large to have been thrown by human hand. And the poor little fellow <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that not a boy, but the mountain, was throwing stones at him; and that the column of black cloud which was rising from the crater above was not harmless vapour, but dust, and ash, and stone. [...] He turned, and ran for his life, leaving the cattle to their fate, while the steam mitrailleuse of the Titans--to which all man's engines of destruction are but pop-guns--roared on for three days and nights, covering the greater part of the island in ashes, burying crops, breaking branches off the trees, and spreading ruin from which several estates never recovered; and so the 30th of April dawned in darkness which might be felt.|$|E

60|$|The {{manager of}} the Tropical Belt Coal Company, {{unpacking}} them on the veranda in the shade besieged by a fierce sunshine, must have felt like a remorseful apostate before these relics. He handled them tenderly; and it was perhaps their presence there which attached him to the island when he <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> failure of his apostasy. Whatever the decisive reason, Heyst had remained where another would have been glad to be off. The excellent Davidson had discovered the fact without discovering the reason, and took a humane interest in Heyst's strange existence, {{while at the same}} time his native delicacy kept him from intruding on the other's whim of solitude. He could not possibly guess that Heyst, alone on the island, felt neither more nor less lonely than in any other place, desert or populous. Davidson's concern was, if one may express it so, the danger of spiritual starvation; but this was a spirit which had renounced all outside nourishment, and was sustaining itself proudly on its own contempt of the usual coarse ailments which life offers to the common appetites of men.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} so indeed, Chris, but at present they have {{certainly}} not <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact. I see by the telegrams that the London Scottish and the London Irish have both volunteered {{almost to a}} man for service here, {{and that they have}} not even had a civil reply to their application. I tell you, lad, this war {{is going to be a}} big thing, and before it is over we may have both militia and volunteers out here, and perhaps troops from the colonies. I heard that some of the Australian colonies have already offered to send bodies of mounted men, and that our government are ordering out a larger number of men than was at first intended. I hear this morning that at Kimberley and Mafeking fighting has begun. On the 24th Kimberley made a successful sortie, and on the 25th a general attack on Mafeking was repulsed. The fact that both these places are beleaguered, and that we have again been obliged to fall back here, and are likely to be cut off altogether, has evidently stirred them up, and they begin to understand that it is going to be a much bigger affair than they expected.|$|E

They will hunt about for a bit, no doubt, round the house, and may send a few men some distance along the tracks, but they will know there is very little chance of catching us until daylight. Now, Sampson, let us join arms, your right and my left. Wilfrid can sit on them and put his arms round our necks. We carry our rifles on our other shoulders, and that will balance matters. That is right. Now on we go again." [...] With occasional halts they went on for another four hours. By this time the ladies and the little girl were completely exhausted from stumbling over roots and low shrubs in the darkness and the two men also were thoroughly fatigued; for the night was extremely hot, and the work of carrying Wilfrid in addition to the weight of their ammunition, told upon them. They had long since lost the path, but knew by the stars that they were keeping in the right direction.|$|E
