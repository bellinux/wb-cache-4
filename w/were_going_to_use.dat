Teppei {{recruited}} his skate park friend Eddie Breckenridge to play bass, who then brought his brother Riley on as a drummer. In 1998, before their first show, they realized they needed a name. Hard-pressed for time, they decided {{to go with the}} name 'Thrice' out of desperation. Thrice was initially an inside joke between the band members, and they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it only temporarily for their first show. However, they began to gain fans with the name, and people started to associate them with it, so they were forced to keep it.|$|E

Return fire destroyed three enemy gun positions and the Thomas was hit once, causing little damage and no casualties. On May 17, TG-95.2 reported that an interrogation of seven prisoners, captured off Ho-do Pan-do the day before, revealed that the enemy were planning an attack on Yodo in the near future. Troops were being concentrated in two locations on He-do Pan-do and <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> about eighty fishing sampans for transport. Ten days later on May 27, shore batteries at Wonsan fought against the USS Cabildo and Ozbourn. In a typical duel the American ships bombarded the coast and were not damaged, the day after USS Ozbourn accepted the surrender of two North Koreans soldiers.|$|E

500|$|Following Butler's exit, sole {{remaining}} {{original member}} Tony Iommi put Black Sabbath on hiatus, and {{began work on}} a solo album with long-time Sabbath keyboardist Geoff Nicholls. While working on new material, the original Black Sabbath line-up were offered a spot at Bob Geldof's Live Aid benefit concert; the band agreed, performing at the Philadelphia show, on 13 July 1985. The event {{marked the first time}} the original line-up appeared on stage since 1978, and also featured reunions of the Who and Led Zeppelin. Returning to his solo work, Iommi enlisted bassist Dave Spitz, drummer Eric Singer and initially intended to use multiple singers, including Rob Halford of Judas Priest, former Deep Purple and Trapeze vocalist Glenn Hughes, and former Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio. This plan didn't work as he forecasted. [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> different vocalists on the album, guest vocalists, but it was so difficult getting it together and getting releases from their record companies. Glenn Hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Kaneda, the {{two teams}} faced a {{delicate}} balancing act when combining the first-person exploration and user-created mapping of dungeons from Etrian Odyssey with the combat and style of the Persona series, as the two were seen as direct opposites. The two teams were fiercely opposed to making compromises on either side, with them eventually settling on choosing the incorporate the closest paralleling elements from both series. When development first started, the team <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the 3D dungeon design and battle system from the Persona series, but as development progressed, it shifted towards the viewpoint and battle system of Etrian Odyssey. An element carried directly from the Etrian Odyssey series was the FOEs, whose behaviors patterns were designed to be unique to each labyrinth's floors and structures. The battle system was based primarily on that used in Etrian Odyssey, with the most recognizable elements from the Persona series added: these included the Persona systems and elements such as [...] "One More Turn" [...] and exploitable weaknesses. The Sub-Persona system {{was based on the}} Etrian Odyssey series' subclass system, some stat-reducing spells were a combination of elements from both Persona and Etrian Odyssey, while the [...] "Boost" [...] feature was an entirely new addition suggested by the staff. Persona Q was the first entry in the Persona series to appear on a Nintendo platform, which offered challenges to both teams. The gameplay systems were ultimately created so that people familiar with both series would find common appeal, and multiple comprehensive tutorials were added so players would not be confused by the new features.|$|E
