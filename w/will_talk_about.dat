500|$|That September, Yeats {{proposed}} to 25-year-old Georgie Hyde-Lees (1892–1968), known as George, {{whom he had}} met through Olivia Shakespear. Despite warnings from her friends—"George... you can't. He must be dead"—Hyde-Lees accepted, and the two were married on 20 October. Their marriage was a success, {{in spite of the}} age difference, and in spite of Yeats's feelings of remorse and regret during their honeymoon. The couple went on to have two children, Anne and Michael. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women, Georgie herself wrote to her husband [...] "When you are dead, people <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> your love affairs, but I shall say nothing, for I will remember how proud you were." ...|$|E

[...] The Soviet national team's easy victory over the National Hockey League's all-stars in the 1979 Challenge Cup left the Canadians searching to regain command of their rivalry with the Soviets. [...] Coach Scotty Bowman called it a [...] "must win game" [...] for Canada: [...] "We really are favorites in the final. [...] Nobody in this country will tolerate a loss." [...] The players also spoke of their desire to show the Soviets {{that they were the}} world's top hockey nation. During their pre-game preparations, Tikhonov called upon his team to play the finest games of their lives: [...] "Today you got to play so well that the entire Canadian population <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> you afterwards and remember you for a long time. [...] Play so well that the Canadian fans when they will leave Forum will wait for you when you get on the bus after the game and admire you." ...|$|E

500|$|While reassuring Thompson and Maguire that he {{was only}} repudiating the idea that he had given his country away, and not the {{concession}} itself (which he told them would be respected), Lobengula asked Maund to accompany two of his izinDuna, Babayane and Mshete, to England, so they could meet Queen Victoria herself, officially to present to her a letter bemoaning Portuguese incursions on eastern Mashonaland, but also unofficially to seek counsel regarding the crisis at Bulawayo. The mission was furthermore motivated by the simple desire of Lobengula and his izinDuna to see if this white queen, whose name the British swore by, really existed. The king's letter concluded with a request for the Queen to send a representative of her own to Bulawayo. Maund, who saw a second chance to secure his own concession, perhaps even at Rudd's expense, said he was more than happy to assist, but Lobengula remained cautious with him: when Maund raised the subject of a new concession covering the Mazoe valley, the king replied [...] "Take my men to England for me; and when you return, then I <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> that." [...] Johannes Colenbrander, a frontiersman from Natal, was recruited to accompany the Matabele emissaries as an interpreter. They left in mid-December 1888.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{complaints}} about teachers' behavior tend to center around what is {{felt to be}} inappropriate speech in a class or discussion, such as using sexist or sexual references to make a point. However, in some cases, bonds and relationships can form between teacher and student beyond class discussions. Relationships between students and teachers can be often quite intimate and intense as they share common passions and interests. [...] Students are dependent on their teachers' approval for academic success, opportunities, and later career success. They <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> personal issues, such as problems at home, or with boyfriends/girlfriends. Such closeness and intimacy can blur the professional boundaries and lead people—both school employee and student alike—to step over the line. Martin writes, ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, Carson {{came under}} the {{scrutiny}} of contemporary historians, and ideas regarding his historical legacy began to change. Earlier accounts portrayed Carson as an American hero, but in scholarship of this period he became an arch-villain in the military campaigns against the Indians. In 1992, for example, a young professor at Colorado College was successful in demanding that a period photograph of Carson {{be removed from the}} ROTC office. In 1992, a tourist told a journalist at the Carson home in Taos, [...] "I will not go into the home of that racist, genocidal killer." [...] In the 1970s, a Navajo at a trading post said, [...] "No one here <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Kit Carson. He was a butcher."

2500|$|Chicago Sun-Times {{film critic}} Roger Ebert gave the film {{two out of}} four stars and wrote, [...] "House of Wax {{is not a good}} movie, but it is an {{efficient}} one and will deliver most of what anyone attending House of Wax could reasonably expect...assuming it would be unreasonable to expect very much." [...] He said of Hilton's performance that [...] "she is no better or worse than the typical Dead Post-Teenager and does exactly what she is required to do in a movie like this, with all the skill—admittedly finite—that is required." [...] Film critic Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post called it a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] and wrote that it gives horror fans exactly what they want. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, [...] "After a month, no one <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> this movie again. Still, with a picture like this, there is really only one question: Is it fun? Yes. Lots. Definitely." [...] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle called it boring and poorly-acted, though he complimented Cuthbert and Murray. [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, [...] "The set design is fairly elaborate {{by the standards of the}} genre, and the victims don't die in precisely the order you might expect, but everything else goes pretty much according to formula".|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Zimmerman {{critically}} {{framed the}} question of Confucius Institutes and academic freedom, [...] "Let's suppose that a cruel, tyrannical, and repressive foreign government offered to pay for American teens to study its national language in our schools. Would you take the deal?" [...] Zimmerman concluded that more Americans should study Chinese, but [...] "on our own terms, making sure that it also reflects our best civic language of freedom, open discussion, and democracy." [...] Chinese history professor Jonathan Lipman from Mount Holyoke College expressed the dilemma of accepting CI funding thus: [...] "By peddling a product we want, namely Chinese language study, the Confucius Institutes bring the Chinese government into the American academy in powerful ways. The general pattern is very clear. They can say, 'We'll give you this money, you'll have a Chinese program, and nobody <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Tibet.' In this economy, turning them down has real costs." [...] Professor Terry Russell at the University of Manitoba questioned the Hanban's real motivation, fearing the university {{would not be able}} to organize certain activities judged [...] "sensitive" [...] to the Chinese, such as bringing the Dalai Lama onto campus. He said, [...] "'We have a real conflict of our principles of academic freedom,' with the potential to have a faculty version of Chinese history and a Confucius Institute version being taught on campus." [...] According to Cameron Morrill, president of the University of Manitoba Faculty Association, [...] "It is inappropriate to allow any government, either foreign or domestic, control over a university classroom, regardless of how much money they offer." [...] The university later decided against taking Chinese government money to set up CIs.|$|E

[...] It has some funk, some old stuff, it's really fun." [...] She paid tribute to her Filipino culture by incorporating OPM sounds into some of the ballads. While describing the process of working with Leslie, she stated, [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> situations that I was going through at the time and we'll talk about that and it comes straight from the heart that's why it works out well between us," [...] continuing about her songwriting input, [...] "I was just kind of going along with it trying to get the vibe. I'm starting to get into it and I'm excited to write." [...] Cassie also mentioned [...] "Not With You" [...] was one of her favorite songs, [...] "It's slow, it's simple, and you get to really hear me as opposed to all the synthesizers and everything in the background," [...] and compared the second single, [...] "Long Way 2 Go," [...] to Vanity 6's vibe.
