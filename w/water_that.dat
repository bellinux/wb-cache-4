5|$|A {{waterspout}} is a columnar vortex forming over <b>water</b> <b>that</b> is, in {{its most}} common form, a non-supercell tornado over <b>water</b> <b>that</b> is connected to a cumuliform cloud. While it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts, stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur.|$|E

5|$|All air well designs {{incorporate}} a substrate with a temperature sufficiently low so that dew forms. Dew {{is a form}} of precipitation that occurs naturally when atmospheric water vapour condenses onto a substrate. It is distinct from fog, in that fog is made of droplets of <b>water</b> <b>that</b> condense around particles in the air. Condensation releases latent heat which must be dissipated in order for water collection to continue.|$|E

Neaps result in less-extreme tidal conditions. There is about a seven-day interval between springs and neaps.|$|R

5|$|Almost all the {{surviving}} source material is of questionable reliability. The two witnesses who gave evidence, Robert Stubbs and James Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame. It {{is possible that}} the figures concerning the number of slaves killed, the amount of <b>water</b> <b>that</b> remained on the ship, and the distance beyond Jamaica that Zong had mistakenly sailed are inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of {{defensive}} structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into <b>water,</b> <b>that</b> help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E
5|$|Because {{mechanical}} refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors {{are typically}} restricted {{to places where}} there is no supply of <b>water</b> <b>that</b> can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh water to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and even then large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia failed because of the cost of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.|$|E

5|$|Boletus edulis {{constitutes}} a food source which, although not rich in easily absorbed carbohydrates or fat, contains vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Fresh mushrooms consist of over 80% moisture, although reported values tend to differ somewhat as moisture content {{can be affected}} by environmental temperature and relative humidity during growth and storage, {{as well as the}} relative amount of <b>water</b> <b>that</b> may be produced as a result of normal metabolic processes during storage.|$|E
5|$|Breathing air is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in <b>water</b> <b>that</b> {{is little more than}} wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E
5|$|Floatovoltaics are an {{emerging}} form of PV systems that float {{on the surface}} of irrigation canals, water reservoirs, quarry lakes, and tailing ponds. Several systems exist in France, India, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. These systems reduce the need of valuable land area, save drinking <b>water</b> <b>that</b> would otherwise be lost through evaporation, and show a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion, as the panels are kept at a cooler temperature than they would be on land. Although not floating, other dual-use facilities with solar power include fisheries.|$|E

5|$|For {{every seven}} {{soldiers}} who escaped through Dunkirk, {{one man was}} left behind as a prisoner of war. The majority of these prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany. Prisoners reported brutal treatment by their guards, including beatings, starvation, and murder. Another complaint was that German guards kicked over buckets of <b>water</b> <b>that</b> had been left at the roadside by French civilians for the marching prisoners to drink.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{water is}} a form of <b>water</b> <b>that</b> {{contains}} a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen, rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope that makes up most of the hydrogen in ordinary water. Deuterium was discovered by Harold Urey in 1931 and he was later able to concentrate it in water. His mentor Gilbert Newton Lewis isolated the first sample of pure heavy water by electrolysis in 1933.|$|E
5|$|If the {{quantity}} of <b>water</b> <b>that</b> is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 5×108 kg of water vapor are lifted, {{and the amount of}} energy released when this condenses is 1015 joules. This is on the same order of magnitude of energy released within a tropical cyclone, and more energy than that released during the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.|$|E

5|$|Operating {{close to}} the power station is a fishing bait company, Seabait. Seabait uses some of the excess hot <b>water</b> <b>that</b> the plant generates to grow worms four {{times as fast as}} in the wild. The worms are used for several purposes, {{primarily}} for providing worms as bait while fishing. However, the worms are also frozen, packaged and exported to seafood farms. This is seen as environmentally beneficial as it reduces the need for bait digging in natural habitats.|$|E

Keepers are urged to provide them with adequate space and a basking site, and <b>water</b> <b>that</b> is regularly filtered and changed. According to Petco, the animals are described as being somewhat unsuitable for children as they do not enjoy being held. Hobbyists have kept turtles alive for decades.|$|E

5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{does not}} itself have many predators and large {{individuals}} are adept at jumping and swimming to escape attackers. Any attached juveniles benefit from this. However, the scallops are intolerant of low salinity levels, and mortality sometimes occurs {{as a result}} of a pool of relatively fresh <b>water</b> <b>that</b> sometimes forms during the summer months under the sea ice as it melts.|$|E

Roughly 95% of the 4,000tonnes of refuse produced daily by the city is transported to the dumping grounds in Dhapa, which is east of the town. To promote the recycling of garbage and sewer water, agriculture in encouraged on the dumping grounds. Parts of the city lack proper sewerage, leading to unsanitary methods of waste disposal.|$|E
