Instead, all compassion and concern is apparently to be expended upon those who lit the powder trail, and who yell and scream for joy as the embassies of democracies are put to the torch in the capital cities of miserable, fly-blown dictatorships. Let's be sure we haven't hurt the vandals' feelings." [...] <b>William</b> <b>Kristol</b> also wrote that the response of Western leaders, {{with the exception of the}} Danish Prime Minister, was too weak and that the issue was used as an excuse by [...] "those who are threatened by our effort to help liberalize and civilize the Middle East" [...] to fight back against the [...] "assault" [...] on radical Islamists and Middle Eastern dictatorships.|$|E

5000|$|On October 15, {{the cover}} of <b>William</b> <b>Kristol's</b> Weekly Standard carried the headline, [...] "The Case for American Empire." [...] Rich Lowry, {{editor in chief of}} the National Review, called for [...] "a kind of low-grade colonialism" [...] to topple {{dangerous}} regimes beyond Afghanistan. The columnist Charles Krauthammer declared that, given complete U.S. domination [...] "culturally, economically, technologically and militarily," [...] people were [...] "now coming out of the closet on the word 'empire.'" [...] The New York Times Sunday magazine cover for January 5, 2003, read [...] "American Empire: Get Used To It." [...] The phrase [...] "American empire" [...] appeared more than 1000 times in news stories during November 2002 - April 2003. Two Harvard Historians and their French colleague observed: Since September 11, 2001 … if not earlier, the idea of American empire is back... Now … for the first time since the early Twentieth century, it has become acceptable to ask whether the United States has become or is becoming an empire in some classic sense." [...] It used to be that only the critics of American foreign policy referred to the American empire… In the past three or four years 2001-2004, however, a growing number of commentators have begun to use the term American empire less pejoratively, if still ambivalently, and in some cases with genuine enthusiasm. [...] US historians have generally considered the late 19th century imperialist urge as an aberration in an otherwise smooth democratic trajectory... Yet a century later, as the US empire engages in a new period of global expansion, Rome is once more a distant but essential mirror for American elites ... Now, with military mobilisation on an exceptional scale after September 2001, the United States is openly affirming and parading its imperial power. For the first time since the 1890s, the naked display of force is backed by explicitly imperialist discourse. In the book [...] "Empire", Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri argue that [...] "the decline of Empire has begun". Hardt says the Iraq War is a classically imperialist war, and is the last gasp of a doomed strategy. They expand on this, claiming that in the new era of imperialism, the classical imperialists retain a colonizing power of sorts, but the strategy shifts from military occupation of economies based on physical goods to a networked biopower based on an informational and affective economies. They go on to say that the U.S. is central to the development of this new regime of international power and sovereignty, termed [...] "Empire", but that it is decentralized and global, and not ruled by one sovereign state: [...] "the United States does indeed occupy a privileged position in Empire, but this privilege derives not from its similarities to the old European imperialist powers, but from its differences." [...] Hardt and Negri draw on the theories of Spinoza, Foucault, Deleuze and Italian autonomist Marxists.|$|R
