Melua said in a statement: [...] "This album {{was going to be}} my 'singer's album'. I had always wanted to do this one day; singing other people's songs brings something out of you and your voice that isn't perhaps <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have gone vocally with your own material." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Fight for You" [...] is an urban-pop ballad with {{a length}} of four minutes and two seconds. According to Meena Rupani of DesiHits, the song finds Derulo as the male protagonist singing [...] "that he's got a girl in his life he isn't ready {{to let go of}} just yet". The song {{contains}} a sample of the song [...] "Africa" [...] (1982) by American rock band Toto. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Fight for You" [...] features [...] "airy synths and bouncy castle-sized beats". During an interview with New! magazine, Derulo explained the concept of [...] "Fight for You", saying: [...] "It's very relationship-based and the line [...] means so much, whatever you believe in you should go for. The song is based on a personal experience, I was in a relationship and I put myself in that place again <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> do anything to keep the relationship together so I went back to that place." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1992, he {{appeared}} in Roman Polanski's film Bitter Moon, portraying a fastidious and proper British tourist who is married, but finds himself enticed by the sexual hedonism of a seductive French woman and her embittered, paraplegic American husband. The film was called an [...] "anti-romantic opus of sexual obsession and cruelty" [...] by the Washington Post. His other work in period pieces such as Ken Russell's horror film The Lair of the White Worm (1988), award-winning Merchant-Ivory drama The Remains of the Day (1993) and (as Frédéric Chopin in) Impromptu (1991) went largely unnoticed. He later called this phase of his career [...] "hilarious," [...] referring to his early films as [...] "Europuddings, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have a French script, a Spanish director, and English actors. The script would usually be written by a foreigner, badly translated into English. And then they'd get English actors in, because they {{thought that was the}} way to sell it to America." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{critical}} review of Very's book {{was written by}} Margaret Fuller and published in Orestes Brownson's Boston Quarterly Review; it said Very's poems had [...] "an elasticity of spirit, a genuine flow of thought, and unsought nobleness and purity", though she admitted she preferred the prose in the collection over the poetry. She mocked the [...] "sing song" [...] style of the poems and questioned his religious mission. She concluded: [...] "I am... greatly interested in Mr Very. He seems worthy to be well known." [...] James Freeman Clarke admired Very's poetry enough to have several published in his journal, the Western Messenger, between 1838 and 1840. William Ellery Channing admired Very's poetry as well, writing that his insanity [...] "is only superficial". Richard Henry Dana Sr. also commented positively on Very's poetry: [...] "The thought is deeply spiritual; and {{while there is a}} certain character of peculiarity which we so often find in like things from our old writers, there is a freedom from quaintness... Indeed, I know not <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>would...</b> find any thing in this country to compare with these Sonnets." ...|$|E
500|$|Loeb said in July 2017 that Marvel Television had {{no plans}} for series to {{crossover}} across networks. Specifically for the similarly themed Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors, and Runaways, which all deal with young heroes, Loeb noted [...] "You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... {{things that are happening}} in L.A. [...] are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans ... It's being aware of it and {{trying to find a way}} for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense." [...] He added in October that scheduling of each series factors into why crossovers between them are more difficult to pull off, and that network [...] "feelings" [...] need to be considered. He also spoke on why the television series do not show Avengers Tower as it appears in the films when they depict New York City, and stated that Marvel Television wanted to be [...] "less specific" [...] about the television characters' relationships to the tower because that [...] "helps the audience understand that this could be on any street corner" [...] and that the characters could be in an area of the city <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not be able to see the tower, even though it exists.|$|E

500|$|The artwork for Lightning Bolt {{was made}} by Don Pendleton, who {{is best known as}} a {{skateboard}} graphic artist. Ament bought some of Pendleton's paintings [...] "in 2008 or 2009" [...] and later asked the artist to do a logo for their upcoming album, which would later develop into all the illustrations. The bassist then kept in contact with Pendleton to guide his work, sending him the song lyrics, some sketches he had done and an unmastered copy of the album. The intention was to [...] "make something that was a total package", according to Pendleton, who said that there was an attempt to bring back [...] "these classic LPs in the days <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> read the lyrics. You related the band to the imagery to the song to the lyrics." [...] Pendleton tried to [...] "keep it iconic with some symbols but also really heavy with archetypes", given the body of images could be used consistently with all of the promotion. While some of the graphics evolved directly from Ament's sketches, Pendleton took some inspiration from his past work, such as a series of skateboards he painted [...] "based around icons and logos", and the very first image sent to Ament, an eye with a lightning bolt which Pendleton made back in 2006 for a failed project, that evolved into the album cover. Said cover was painted by hand as Pendleton wanted [...] "something so geometric that there would be some flaws in it, especially compared to the vector/computer stuff". Republic Records art designer Joe Spix then handled the presentation, with particular detail in the vinyl packaging. Pendleton also painted Ament's bass, Pearl Jam-themed shirts for Volcom, and posters for the Barclays Center concerts in October 2013. At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2015, the album won the award for Best Recording Package.|$|E
2500|$|... "Afro Blue" [...] was {{the first}} jazz {{standard}} built upon a typical African three-against-two (3:2) cross-rhythm, or hemiola. The song begins with the bass repeatedly playing 6 cross-beats per each measure of 12/8, or 6 cross-beats per 4 main beats—6:4 (two cells of 3:2). The following example shows the original ostinato [...] "Afro Blue" [...] bass line.

2500|$|For {{the end of}} [...] "Exile", Joey Bratazani and Brian Harding {{worked on}} the {{computer}} effects shots of the Kryptonian tattoo, which was burned into Clark’s chest {{at the end of}} season two, disappearing at the end of Clark’s fight with Jonathan. John Wash describes the effect as being similar to a time-lapse, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> watch a flower grow, but in the reverse. Bratazani and Harding had to track the effect to Welling’s chest, in order for it to look like his skin was really being burned from underneath; otherwise, the shot would have appeared to be just a 2-dimensional light being broadcast on his chest. Just like the Krpytonian tattoo was something created digitally in season two, so was the digital body duplication of Ian Randall, which the special effects team had the chance to work on for a second time in season three’s [...] "Asylum". For [...] "Asylum", special effects coordinator Mat Beck and his team used 3-dimensional strands for Ian’s separation, which gave the team more control, as well as make the strands appear [...] "gooier and grosser". The original effect in season two consisted of Entity FX using a primary shot of a CGI face pushing its way through a CGI back in three dimensions. This time, the team used a two dimensional shot appearing on a wall—known as [...] "shadow play"—as though the audience is seeing Ian's shadow as he splits himself; lastly, the team applied another two dimensional effect to the final moment of separation, when strands of CGI flesh snap back to each body.|$|E
