2500|$|Erdoğan harshly criticized Israel's {{conduct in}} Gaza at the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland in January 2009. After the {{assembled}} audience applauded Peres, Erdoğan said: [...] "I {{find it very}} sad that people applaud <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said.</b> You killed people.

Erdoğan complained about the fact, that he was given 12 minutes to talk, whereas Peres talked for a duration of 25 minutes. Erdoğan then proceeded to leave the stage.|$|E

2500|$|Meier {{explained}} {{the story behind}} [...] "Domingo", saying, [...] "Domingo is a false preacher who, with a few sentences, is trying to impress the people there, and then the choir chants 'Domingo, you showed us just nothing like no one before', it means 'you didn't show us anything either, it's all nonsense <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> but somehow you did it right'. Domingo de Santa Clara actually existed. There was an Abraham a Sancta Clara, he was some religious fanatic. I don't know where I got it from, but the name pleased me very much: Abraham a Sancta Clara. And since the name Domingo pleases me as well, I called him Domingo." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sun Quan {{immediately}} summoned Lu Su to {{meet him}} and {{was happy to see}} him. Later, when the other guests left the meeting, Lu Su also took his leave but Sun Quan called him back. They shared a table and had a private conversation over drinks. Sun Quan asked, [...] "The Han dynasty is in decline and there's turmoil everywhere.

2500|$|I {{know you}} need funds. We {{understand}} that and our {{opinion is that}} you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country. But we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait. ... Frankly, we can only see that you have deployed massive troops in the south. Normally that would not be any of our business. But when this happens in the context of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> on your national day, then when we read the details in the two letters of the Foreign Minister, then when we see the Iraqi point of view that the measures taken by the U.A.E. and Kuwait is, in the final analysis, parallel to military aggression against Iraq, then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned.|$|E

2500|$|In 1935 Gertrude Stein gave {{a series}} of talks in the United States that included, on January 12 and 13, a visit to Choate. Fortunately for {{literary}} posterity, her audience included both a stenographer and Dudley Fitts, critic, translator, and longtime teacher of Greek and Latin at Choate. Stein's public speaking style was extemporary, and Fitts recognized the permanent value of a stenographic transcript. After an exchange of letters, Stein authorized Fitts to oversee publication of her talk in The Choate Literary Magazine. On February 5, he sent her the page proofs, saying, [...] "I had to restore {{a great deal of}} the lecture from memory. I hope I didn't spoil anything. Sorry to have missed entirely <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> about the noun." [...] (Fitts's typescript and the Fitts-Stein correspondence are now at Yale.) ...|$|E

Sima Zhao replied, [...] "Have you forgotten <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> previously? Why are you asking me not to go (to Chang'an) now? Please keep secret what we spoke about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?' I replied, 'If I send you on a mission today, do you think I doubt you?' He could not respond to my reply. Everything will be settled when I arrive in Chang'an." [...] By the time Sima Zhao reached Chang'an, Zhong Hui had already been killed in the mutiny, just as Sima Zhao foresaw.|$|E
