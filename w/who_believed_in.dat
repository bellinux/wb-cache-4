5|$|Hancock's General Order Number 40 {{was quickly}} {{condemned}} by Republicans in Washington, especially by the Radicals, while President Johnson wholeheartedly approved. Heedless {{of the situation}} in Washington, Hancock soon put his words into action, refusing local Republican politicians' requests to use his power to overturn elections and court verdicts, while also letting it be known that open insurrection would be suppressed. Hancock's popularity within the Democratic party grew {{to the extent that he}} was considered a potential presidential nominee for that party in the 1868 election. Although Hancock collected a significant number of delegates at the 1868 convention, his presidential possibilities went unfulfilled. Even so, he was henceforth identified as a rare breed in politics: one <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the Democratic Party's principles of states' rights and limited government, but whose anti-secessionist sentiment was unimpeachable.|$|E
5|$|In {{cultures}} {{that did not}} recognize a smallpox deity, there was often nonetheless a belief in smallpox demons, who were accordingly blamed for the disease. Such beliefs were prominent in Japan, Europe, Africa, {{and other parts of}} the world. Nearly all cultures <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the demon also believed that it was afraid of the color red. This led to the invention of so-called red treatment, where victims and their rooms would be decorated in red. The practice spread to Europe in the 12th century and was practiced by (among others) Charles V of France and Elizabeth I of England. Afforded scientific credibility through the studies by Finsen showing that red light reduced scarring, this belief persisted even until the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Various human {{cultures}} have depicted pinnipeds for millennia. The anthropologist, A. Asbjørn Jøn, has analysed {{beliefs of the}} Celts of Orkney and Hebrides <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> selkies—seals that could change into humans and walk on land. Seals are also of great importance {{in the culture of}} the Inuit. In Inuit mythology, the goddess Sedna rules over the sea and marine animals. She is depicted as a mermaid, occasionally with a seal's lower body. In one legend, seals, whales and other marine mammals were formed from her severed fingers. One of the earliest Ancient Greek coins depicts the head of a seal, and the animals were mentioned by Homer and Aristotle. The Greeks believed that seals loved both the sea and sun and were considered to be under the protection of the gods Poseidon and Apollo. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped the sea and its animals, and often depicted sea lions in their art. In modern popular culture, pinnipeds are often depicted as playful and comical figures based on their performances in zoos, circuses and marine mammal parks.|$|E

It is probable that Vologases defeated Papak after he rebelled and forced him to submit to Parthian rule for a while. It is not probable that Papak's kingdom was beyond the Persian land.|$|E

The findings extended previous research, such as a 1992 study which found that 48% of animal rights activists were atheists or agnostic.|$|E
