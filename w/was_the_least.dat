In Amsterdam, on Christmas Day, Abdulmutallab checked in for Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit with only carry-on luggage. On March24, 2011, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Abdulmutallab chose to attack Detroit because the plane ticket there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> expensive of tickets to potential US targets, which included Chicago and Houston. Initially, some media rumored that Abdulmutallab tried {{to fly to}} Detroit {{because it was a}} major hub of the U.S. automotive industry.|$|E

5|$|In 1887, {{the first}} book on tornadoes was written by John Park Finley, {{a pioneer in the}} field of tornado research. While it was a revolutionary book {{containing}} many breakthrough ideas, it contained a few ideas which have since been proven false.

5|$|In 1957 {{another new}} {{strain of the}} virus emerged and caused a {{pandemic}} of Asian flu; although the virus was not as virulent as the 1918 strain, over one million died worldwide. The next pandemic occurred when Hong Kong flu emerged in 1968, a new strain of the virus that replaced the 1957 strain. Affecting mainly the elderly, the 1968 pandemic <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> severe, but 33,800 {{were killed in the}} US. New strains of influenza virus often originate in East Asia; in rural China the concentration of ducks, pigs, and humans in close proximity is the highest in the world.|$|E

Of the surviving Chinese warships from the battle, the Jiyuan <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> damaged. As the other surviving ships from the battle arrived in Port Arthur, their guns were dressed in red. Jiyuan was the exception, with no decoration and was docked away from the other vessels.|$|E

5|$|Music <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> {{restricted}} {{of cultural}} activities, probably because Hans Frank regarded {{himself as a}} fan of serious music. In time, he ordered {{the creation of the}} Orchestra and Symphony of the General Government in its capital, Kraków. Numerous musical performances were permitted in cafes and churches, and the Polish underground chose to boycott only the propagandist operas. Visual artists, including painters and sculptors, were compelled to register with the German government; but their work was generally tolerated by the underground, unless it conveyed propagandist themes. Shuttered museums were replaced by occasional art exhibitions that frequently conveyed propagandist themes.|$|E

The plot features a poetess who {{falls in love}} with and marries an insipid young poet, giving up her own writing to attend to his needs. She becomes bored, writes a successful play, and then goes mad. The False Laurel <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> successful of her books, selling fewer than 200 copies. It received a poor review from The Bookman but a good one from The Athenaeneum.|$|E
5|$|The 1952 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the last}} Atlantic {{hurricane season}} to name tropical cyclones using the phonetic alphabet. It was a near normal Atlantic hurricane season, although it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> active since 1946. The season officially started on June15; however, a pre-season unnamed storm formed on Groundhog Day, becoming the only storm on record {{in the month of}} February. The other six tropical cyclones were named using the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, the first of which formed on August18. The final storm of the season dissipated on October28, {{two and a half weeks}} before the season officially ended on November15.|$|E

5|$|The 1953 Pacific {{hurricane}} season <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> active season on record. The season officially began on May 15 {{in the northeast}} Pacific Ocean and on June 1 in the central northern Pacific. They ended on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit {{the time of year}} when most tropical cyclones form in northeast Pacific Ocean. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data prior to that time on Pacific hurricanes is extremely unreliable as most east Pacific storms are of no threat to land.|$|E
5|$|The 1983 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} in 53years, during which only four tropical storms formed. The season officially began on June 1, 1983, and lasted until November 30, 1983. These dates conventionally delimit {{the period of}} each year when most storms form in the Atlantic basin. The season had very little activity, with only seven tropical depressions, four of which reached tropical storm strength or higher. This led to the lowest Accumulated Cyclone Energy count since 1950, but not since 1900.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 Pacific {{hurricane}} season <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> active Pacific {{hurricane season}} since 1979. Of the eleven tropical cyclones that formed during the season, four affected land, {{with the most}} notable storm of the season being Hurricane Ismael, which killed at least 116people in Mexico. The strongest hurricane in the season was Hurricane Juliette, which reached peak winds of 150mph (240km/h), but did not significantly affect land. Hurricane Adolph was an early-season Category 4 hurricane. Hurricane Henriette brushed the Baja California Peninsula in October.|$|E

The show also drew lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 27.49% of households watching over a 46.31 share. In addition, it also drew a lower 18–49 demo rating with a 16.55 rating over a 34.32 share among viewers in that demographic. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> watched ceremony in a decade and the lowest rated telecast since the 58th awards gala held in 1986.|$|E

There were 13days when storms were active, the same as 2010–11, although the latter season also had a long-lasting subtropical cyclone. It is estimated that Tropical Depression Fely {{and two of the}} other storms in this season would not have been named during the 2010–11 season.|$|E

5|$|Both Houses of Congress were majority-Republican, {{but their}} {{solutions}} differed. The House {{passed a bill}} in June 1890 requiring the government to purchase 4.5 million ounces of silver each month (in addition to the $2– $4 million required to be coined under Bland–Allison). The Senate passed a bill by Republican Preston B. Plumb of Kansas for free coinage of silver at the legal (16:1) ratio. Sherman voted against Plumb's bill, but {{was appointed to the}} conference committee to produce a compromise bill that, now called the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, passed that July. The Treasury would buy 4.5 million ounces of silver and would issue Treasury Notes to pay for it, which would be redeemable in gold or silver. The law also provided that the Treasury could coin more silver dollars if the Secretary believed it necessary to redeem the new notes. Sherman thought the bill <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> harmful option. Harrison believed it would end the controversy, and he signed it into law. The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E
5|$|Derfflinger was {{constructed}} at Blohm & Voss in Hamburg under construction number 213. She <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> expensive {{of the three}} ships, {{at a cost of}} 56 million gold marks. The ship was ready to be launched on 14 June 1913, but during the ceremony, one of the wooden sledges upon which the hull rested became jammed. It took until 12 July for her to enter the water. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. Lützow was built at the Schichau dockyard in Danzig under construction number 885, at the cost of 58million gold marks. The ship was launched on 29 November 1913, and after lengthy trials, commissioned on 8 August 1915. Hindenburg, the final member of the class, was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, under construction number 34. The ship was built at a cost of 59million gold marks, the most expensive of the three vessels. She was launched on 1 August 1915 and commissioned on 10 May 1917.|$|E

This {{was one of two}} British Crown colonies that were permitted to participate independently that year, the other being Malta. Southern Rhodesia, as it was known at the time, competed under the name of Rhodesia. Two athletes from Southern Rhodesia were selected to compete in the 1928 games, both in boxing; Cecil Bissett in the lightweight and Leonard Hall in the welterweight weight division. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> number of athletes sent to a Summer Olympics by Rhodesia, and from the 1980 Summer Olympics as Zimbabwe.|$|E
