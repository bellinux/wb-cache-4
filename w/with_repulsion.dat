25|$|There are few {{instances}} wherein the Casimir effect can {{give rise to}} repulsive forces between uncharged objects. Evgeny Lifshitz showed (theoretically) that in certain circumstances (most commonly involving liquids), repulsive forces can arise. This has sparked interest in applications of the Casimir effect toward the development of levitating devices. An experimental demonstration of the Casimir-based repulsion predicted by Lifshitz {{was carried out by}} Munday et al. Other scientists have also suggested the use of gain media to achieve a similar levitation effect, though this is controversial because these materials seem to violate fundamental causality constraints and the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium (Kramers–Kronig relations). Casimir and Casimir-Polder repulsion can in fact occur for sufficiently anisotropic electrical bodies; for a review of the issues involved <b>with</b> <b>repulsion</b> see Milton et al.|$|E

The electromagnetic susceptibility of a charged Bose gas <b>with</b> short-range <b>repulsion</b> is studied using the perturbation theory with respect to the repulsive force.

40|$|AbstractMotion {{repulsion}} is the illusory {{enlargement of}} the angle between objects moving in two different directions of motion. Previous work suggests that motion repulsion occurs under dichoptic conditions, and therefore is binocular. In reference repulsion the direction of motion is misperceived even if only a single direction of motion is presented. In an experiment I show that repulsion under dichoptic conditions is correlated <b>with</b> reference <b>repulsion,</b> but not <b>with</b> binocular motion <b>repulsion.</b> This suggests that motion repulsion proper, which occurs over and beyond reference repulsion, does not occur under dichoptic conditions, implying that motion repulsion is monocular...|$|R

40|$|We {{probe the}} Ioffe-Regel limits of glasses <b>with</b> <b>repulsions</b> near the zero-temperature jamming {{transition}} {{by measuring the}} dynamical structure factors. At zero temperature, the transverse Ioffe-Regel frequency vanishes at the jamming transition with a diverging length, but the longitudinal one does not, which excludes {{the existence of a}} diverging length associated with the longitudinal excitations. At low temperatures, the transverse and longitudinal Ioffe-Regel frequencies approach zero at the jamming-like transition and glass transition, respectively. As a consequence, glasses between the glass transition and jamming-like transition, which are hard sphere glasses in the low temperature limit, can only carry well-defined longitudinal phonons and have an opposite pressure dependence of the ratio of the shear modulus to the bulk modulus from glasses beyond the jamming-like transition.

40|$|Reflection {{of charge}} {{excitations}} at the {{step in the}} interaction strength in a Luttinger liquid can be of the Andreev type, even if the interactions are purely repulsive. The region <b>with</b> stronger <b>repulsion</b> {{plays the role of}} a normal metal in a normal-metal /superconductor junction, whereas the region <b>with</b> weaker <b>repulsion</b> plays the role of a superconductor. It is shown that this quasi-Andreev reflection leads to a number of proximity-like effects, including the local enhancement (suppression) of superconducting fluctuations on the quasi-normal (quasi-superconducting) side of the step, significant modification of the local density of states, as well as others. The observable consequences of these proximity effects are analyzed for the case of single- and two-particle tunneling from a normal-metal or superconducting tip into an inhomogeneous Luttinger-liquid wire.
