5000|$|Research {{has shown}} that culture and context-specific gender roles have a {{stronger}} influence on emotional expression than do biological factors. [...] "Empirical evidence suggests that girls are socialized to be emotional, nonaggressive, nurturing, and obedient, whereas boys are socialized to be unemotional, aggressive, achievement oriented, and self-reliant. Peers continue this process as children develop and mature in effect constraining how, where, why, and with whom certain emotions are expressed". [...] One study suggests that people tend to exhibit more intense negative facial expressions in solitary conditions, and smile more when others are present. In this experiment, men and women {{did not differ in}} their anger expression in non-social conditions. However, women were more likely to express their anger in the solitary condition as opposed to the social condition. Men, on the other hand, seemed to be less concerned with appearing positive to others; they showed no difference in their expression of anger based on whether or not others were present. [...] In another recent study, Coats and Feldman found that women who were more accurate expressors of happiness <b>were</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> <b>more</b> popular, while men who were more accurate expressors of anger <b>were</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> <b>more</b> popular.

However, some empirical and social controversy exists {{as to whether}} traits truly sway perceptions of attraction. In order to further investigate the ambiguous findings concerning the attractiveness of dominance and personality factors, we formed several hypotheses in alignment with evolutionary literature: (A) Perceived dominance will lead women to <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> less attractive and men <b>as</b> <b>more</b> attractive. (B) Women will <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> <b>more</b> attractive if they are rated higher in submissive Big Five personality traits and males will <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> <b>more</b> attractive if they are rated higher in dominant personality traits. Finally, (C) target gender differences in ratings of dominance and personality will be larger if the participant is high in Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and low on the Attitudes Toward Women scale (AWS). 103 online participants rated male and female target faces in dominance, personality, and attractiveness before rating themselves in personality, SDO, and AWS. No significant results emerged to support our hypotheses in the directions that we predicted. Dominance and attractiveness were slightly correlated for male (r = 0. 14) and female (r = 0. 25) targets. Moreover, {{there were no significant}} relationships between perceptions of attractiveness and personality. Participant SDO scores had no effect on target ratings, and participant AWS affected the ratings of only a couple personality traits.

Analysis of the interactions revealed some between group differences in the use of self presentational strategies.

50|$|The {{impact of}} fluency is moderated by {{expectations}} and attribution. On one hand, fluency has a particularly strong impact on affective experience {{if there are}} no expectations (that is, its source is unknown and fluent processing comes as a surprise). On the other hand, the fluency-based affective experience is discounted as a source of relevant information when the perceiver attributes the experience to an irrelevant source. This helps explain the inverted U-shaped function often found in research on the effect of complexity on preferences: very complex patterns <b>are</b> not <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> beautiful because they are disfluent, and patterns <b>are</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> <b>more</b> beautiful when they become less complex. When viewers perceive a simple pattern, they are often able to detect the source of fluency—the pattern's simplicity—and do not use this experience of ease for judging the beauty of the pattern.|$|R

This experiment presented college students with a proposed mandatory essay-exam program, giving opinion poll results as a heuristic cue, followed either by arguments both for and against essay exams, or by no arguments.
