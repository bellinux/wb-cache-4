5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Potter sketched the {{interior}} of the third Lakefield Cottage belonging to a Mrs. Lord. These drawings included a watercolour and pen-and-ink sketches of the living-room, pen-and-ink sketches of the pots of geraniums on the living-room <b>window</b> <b>sill,</b> the entrance passage, the pantry, the stairs, some of the upstairs rooms, and details of the carved oak furniture. In some of the sketches Potter roughly outlined a cat. She also sketched the village including the sloping path down to the Lakefield Cottages and the post office door. These became the backgrounds for The Pie and The Patty-Pan.|$|E
5|$|St Fflewin's Church, Llanfflewin (sometimes {{referred}} to as St Fflewyn's Church, Llanfflewyn) is a small rural church, situated by a farm in Anglesey, north Wales. The first church on the site {{is said to have}} been built by St Fflewin in 630, but the present building has no structural features dating from before the 18th century, although the church has a font from the 14th or 15th century and part of an inscribed medieval gravestone has been reused in a <b>window</b> <b>sill.</b>|$|E
5|$|Designed by William R. Walker & Son and {{constructed}} by S. Mason & H. A. Smith in 1886, the one story red brick Queen Anne style building is basically rectangular with a low-pitched hipped roof. The red bricks are laid in dark red mortar and is contrasted by the granite sill course and brownstone belt course at <b>window</b> <b>sill</b> level. The building has a central closed entry pavilion which projects out {{and has two}} porches oriented to face Mulberry and Cedar Street. The building has three lunette windows {{on the sides of}} the main block, each divided into thirds, and a smaller windows on the pavilion's pedimented end. The rear ell has double hung two-over-two sash windows. At the time of the nomination, during the renovations to a single family home, the house had its Cedar Street porch closed in with plywood and the smaller lunette windows were boarded in, but the exterior wooden trim was largely extant.|$|E

5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a <b>window</b> <b>sill</b> and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this formative research was to explore the acceptability and feasibility of chan-ging housekeeping behaviors as a low-cost approach that may reduce childhood lead expos-ure in Johannesburg, South Africa. Using the Trials of Improved Practices (TIPs) method-ology, modified housekeeping behaviors were negotiated with participants who chose the be-haviors they wanted to try and then performed them in their homes over 4 weeks. Researchers interviewed them {{at the end of}} the month to understand their experience of trying out the be-haviors. The modified behaviors offered to each participant were as follows: cleaning <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> with detergent and water, cleaning <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> more frequently, mopping floors with two buck-ets (one with soapy water for washing and one with clean water for rinsing), mopping floors more frequently, dusting surfaces with detergent and water and dusting surfaces more frequently. Participants found cleaning <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> with soap and water and cleaning them more often the most acceptable and feasible of behavior modifications. Environmental samples showed a significant reduction in lead dust on <b>window</b> <b>sills.</b> These findings can assist in the development of acceptable and feasible medium-term interven-tions to reduce childhood lead exposure in re-source-poor settings until more robust health policies are implemented...|$|R
25|$|The {{cherries}} {{present on}} the tree outside the window may symbolize love. The oranges which lie on the <b>window</b> <b>sill</b> and chest may symbolize the purity and innocence that reigned in the Garden of Eden before the Fall of Man. They were uncommon and a sign of wealth in the Netherlands, but in Italy were a symbol of fecundity in marriage. The fruit could more simply {{be a sign of}} the couple's wealth since oranges were very expensive imports. It could be a sign of fertility as well.|$|E
25|$|This spider {{builds a}} funnel-shaped web to catch its prey. It usually {{consists}} of a multitude of stressed silk threads spun over a flat surface (such as a <b>window</b> <b>sill)</b> near any corner, with a funnel-like structure reaching for the corner, in which the spider would typically reside (hence the name). These webs can become quite large if undisturbed. They act like cord strings, helping the spider glide over them, and once a prey stumbles into the web, it will quickly get attacked, then dragged inside the funnel part and eaten, but very rarely stored underneath the structure.|$|E
25|$|That night, Lombard appears {{surprised}} when he finds his gun returned to his room. Blore catches a glimpse of someone leaving the house but loses the trail. He then discovers Armstrong is absent from his room, and the remaining three guests conclude that Armstrong must be the killer. Vera, Blore, and Lombard decide to stay together at all times. In the morning, they unsuccessfully attempt to signal SOS to the mainland from outside by using a mirror and sunlight. Blore then decides {{to return to the}} house for food by himself — the others are not hungry — and is killed by a heavy bear-shaped clock statue that is pushed from Vera's <b>window</b> <b>sill,</b> crushing his skull.|$|E

25|$|The {{downside}} {{of the new}} units was the more restricted view through the windows. The Mark 3 bodyshell has a much higher <b>window</b> <b>sill</b> level than the first generation DMUs and moreover the alignment of the windows with the seating positions is poor, a problem common to much Mk 3 derived stock. The view is especially poor for passengers seated nearest to the doors, whose view is obscured by the pockets into which the doors slide when opened, or {{at the ends of}} the vehicle. Also unlike the first generation DMUs, the rear of the driver's cab was not glazed, so passengers in the front seats no longer had a view of the track ahead, which was regretted both by railfans and children.|$|E
25|$|Transoms – These timbers extend {{across the}} low {{parts of the}} hull near the rudder, and are secured (notched and/or bolted) to the sternpost. The transom located {{at the base of}} the stern, and the {{uppermost}} of the main transoms, was typically called the wing transom; the principal transom below this and level with the lower deck was called the deck transom; between these two were a series of filling transoms. If the stern had transoms above the wing transom, they would no longer be affixed to the sternpost. The first of these might be called a counter transom; next up was the <b>window</b> <b>sill</b> transom; above that, the spar deck transom. The larger the vessel, the more numerous and wider the transoms required to support its stern.|$|E
25|$|Visitors {{are confronted}} by the still-impressive west front, with a wide central doorway, surmounted by a round arch. This western end was {{finished}} comparatively late, in the 13th century, and the round arch of the doorway is meant to complement the earlier work visible through the portal. The massive stonework on either side originally carried {{the weight of a}} great western tower, probably destroyed in the siege, along with the west window. The northern base has suffered least and still has arcading {{at the level of the}} vanished <b>window</b> <b>sill,</b> decorated in a trefoil pattern. The pointed gothic arches of its windows contrast sharply with the late romanesque gateway. Moving through the gateway, it is possible to climb a narrow staircase on the north wall of the nave to the level of the arcade, thus obtaining a good view of the remains of the church and of the landscape beyond. There is a small, well-preserved lavabo on the southern wall of the nave.|$|E

25|$|At the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777, the American {{offensive}} stalled when Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Musgrave and 120 British {{soldiers of}} the 40th Foot stoutly defended the Chew House. After artillery and infantry assaults failed, du Plessis and other officers attempted to set the house on fire. To fellow aide John Laurens, du Plessis suggested the idea of fetching hay from the nearby barn and using it to ignite the structure. Using the kitchen outbuilding as cover, du Plessis reached a ground-floor window {{to the left of}} the servant's entrance. He smashed it and tried to climb in. Perched on the <b>window</b> <b>sill,</b> he found himself face to face with a pistol-wielding British officer who demanded his surrender. At that moment, a British soldier burst into the room and fired at du Plessis but hit the officer by mistake. After this close call, the Frenchman decided to retreat. With numerous American soldiers looking on, he refused to run for it. He later claimed that he retired at a walk, which he managed to do without being shot, though Laurens was slightly wounded in the shoulder. Two of Major General John Sullivan's aides, Captains John White and Edward Sherburne were killed while unsuccessfully trying to carry out this dangerous mission.|$|E
25|$|The {{first floor}} {{exterior}} wall consists of limestone quoins {{at the corner}} and stone coursing. A string course with Greek decorative carving is set {{between the first and}} second floors, and acts as the <b>window</b> <b>sill</b> for the second floor windows and as the balustrade for the entrance loggia. The second and third floor exterior walls have stone quoins as well. Between each window on the second floor is a panel inlaid with variegated marble and surrounded by egg-and-dart moldings. The base of the panel is decorated with scrollwork, and the top by a bas-relief urn. Five fruit-shaped clusters decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on this floor (the lowest cluster supported by a tiny putto), while above each window is a false pediment topped by an escutcheon flanked by drapery. Variegated marble panels are set between each window on the third floor as well, the bottom of each decorated with scrollwork and a small dramatic mask. The sill of each third floor window is of scrollwork, while the window is topped by scrollwork and a torch. Circular medallions with pendants decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on the third floor. A bas-relief putto stands atop each medallion and panel, supporting fruit swags. Between the third and fourth (or attic) floors is a molding decorated with repetitive small eggs which serves as the sill for the fourth floor windows. The truncated hipped roof slightly overhangs the walls. The cornice is decorated with dentils and acanthus carvings beneath the roofline. The roof, originally red tile, was changed at some point to asbestos roof shingles with copper flashing. There are seven chimneys on the roof, and about five skylights on the flat section.|$|E
500|$|The windows mainly {{date from}} the 19th century. [...] The south wall of the nave has a blocked-up round-headed window from the 12th century. The 19th-century east window has three lights (sections of window {{separated}} vertically by mullions) topped by tracery in trefoil shapes (decorative stonework in a three-leaf circular pattern). The chapel's north and west window are similar. The north window in the vestry has details {{similar to those of}} the blocked nave window, and reuses some medieval material in the <b>window</b> <b>sill.</b> There is no stained glass in the church; all the windows have clear glass.|$|E
