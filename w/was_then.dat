50|$|In {{a typical}} cycle of excavation, the bucket is {{positioned}} above {{the material to}} be excavated. The bucket <b>is</b> <b>then</b> lowered and the dragrope <b>is</b> <b>then</b> drawn so that the bucket is dragged along {{the surface of the}} material. The bucket <b>is</b> <b>then</b> lifted by using the hoist rope. A swing operation <b>is</b> <b>then</b> performed to move the bucket to the place where the material is to be dumped. The dragrope <b>is</b> <b>then</b> released causing the bucket to tilt and empty. This is called a dump operation.|$|R
50|$|Kilishi is {{made from}} meat that has been cut into very thin slices, which <b>are</b> <b>then</b> spread out to dry. A {{preparation}} of chili pepper, spices and local herbs <b>is</b> <b>then</b> prepared into a paste which is lightly brushed on both sides. This <b>is</b> <b>then</b> briefly grilled.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a theory of}} shells of revolution. Staring with geometrical considerations, {{the expression of the}} strains is deduced. A particular form of the displacement field <b>is</b> <b>then</b> chosen, from which follow the shell strains and changes of curvature. The equilibrium equations <b>are</b> <b>then</b> deduced from a variational point of view. Constitutive equations <b>are</b> <b>then</b> stated and simplified owing to the powers of the parameter h/R. The problem of vibrations round an equilibrium state <b>is</b> <b>then</b> formulated, including the so-called stability terms. Inertia terms <b>are</b> <b>then</b> developed. IN order to treat asymmetrical vibrations, a Fourier development of the displacements is introduced, which allows a clear separation of the eigenmodes...|$|R

50|$|In scotch-tape-based microcleavage, phosphorene is {{mechanically}} exfoliated from a bulk {{of black}} phosphorus crystal using scotch-tape. Phosphorene <b>is</b> <b>then</b> transferred on a Si/SiO2 substrate, where it <b>is</b> <b>then</b> cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol and methanol {{to remove any}} scotch tape residue. The sample <b>is</b> <b>then</b> heated to 180 °C to remove solvent residue.|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} {{starts with}} 100 g graphite and 50 g of sodium nitrate in sulfuric acid at 66 °C which <b>is</b> <b>then</b> cooled to 0 °C. 300 g of potassium permanganate <b>is</b> <b>then</b> {{added to the}} solution and stirred. Water <b>is</b> <b>then</b> added in increments until the solution is approximately 32 liters.|$|R
5|$|Carlton {{delivered}} the series to ITV in August 2003 for broadcast {{in the autumn}} schedules, but it <b>was</b> <b>then</b> rescheduled four times {{over the next several}} months, before ITV eventually set a premiere date of 11 July 2004. It <b>was</b> <b>then</b> rescheduled to the preceding Wednesday, in the 9 pm slot. The series lost two million viewers over two weeks and ITV pulled episode four from the schedules on the morning before it was due for broadcast, replacing it with It Shouldn't Happen on a TV Soap, a bloopers programme, which returned ITV's ratings to above the five million mark.|$|E
5|$|Construction on what <b>was</b> <b>then</b> {{known as}} the Queen Street Extension west of Toronto began in early 1931 as a depression-relief project.|$|E

50|$|To prepare it, dhall is roasted in a kadai, {{possibly}} with {{a little}} ghee. This <b>is</b> <b>then</b> cooled and crushed into a fine powder. Sesame seeds and coconut flakes are similarly and separately roasted and powdered. These powders <b>are</b> <b>then</b> combined with cardamom and jaggery syrup. This <b>is</b> <b>then</b> split into marble-sized balls.|$|R

50|$|The meat {{is first}} finely ground and mixed with water. The mixture <b>is</b> <b>then</b> {{used in a}} {{centrifuge}} or with an emulsifier to separate the fats and myoglobin from the muscle. The product <b>is</b> <b>then</b> allowed to settle into three layers: meat, excess water, and fat. The remaining liquefied meat <b>is</b> <b>then</b> flash-frozen and packaged.|$|R

5|$|Following excavation, several {{stones were}} placed in the {{original}} sockets {{in order to create a}} reconstruction of the original circle. A fence <b>was</b> <b>then</b> erected around the circle to discourage further interference.|$|E
50|$|Purine {{degradation}} {{takes place}} {{mainly in the}} liver of humans and requires an assortment of enzymes to degrade purines to uric acid. First, the nucleotide will lose its phosphate through 5'-nucleotidase. The nucleoside, adenosine, <b>is</b> <b>then</b> deaminated and hydrolyzed to form hypoxanthine via adenosine deaminase and nucleosidase respectively. Hypoxanthine <b>is</b> <b>then</b> oxidized to form xanthine and then uric acid through the action of xanthine oxidase. The other purine nucleoside, guanosine, is cleaved to form guanine. Guanine <b>is</b> <b>then</b> deaminated via guanine deaminase to form xanthine which <b>is</b> <b>then</b> converted to uric acid. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the degradation of both purines. Uric acid <b>is</b> <b>then</b> excreted from the body in different forms depending on the animal.|$|R
50|$|Naringenin is {{converted}} into eriodictyol using flavanoid 3′-hydroxylase. Eriodictyol <b>is</b> <b>then</b> converted into dihydroquercetin with flavanone 3-hydroxylase, which <b>is</b> <b>then</b> converted into quercetin using flavonol synthase.|$|R
50|$|CubeSat {{integration}} {{begins with}} unpacking the CSD from the shipping container and then removing the Base Plate Assembly {{from the rear}} of the CSD. Next, the CubeSat is inserted from the rear and is slid up snug against the doors. Additional CubeSats <b>are</b> <b>then</b> inserted from the rear in the same progress. The Base Plate Assembly <b>is</b> <b>then</b> reinstalled. Four jack screws <b>are</b> <b>then</b> adjusted with the Pusher Plate and locked. The Containment Bolt <b>is</b> <b>then</b> removed, and the deployer is packed for shipment.|$|R

50|$|With {{all modern}} devices {{the same basic}} {{procedure}} is followed. First, the amount of foreskin to be removed is estimated. The foreskin <b>is</b> <b>then</b> opened via the preputial orifice to reveal the glans underneath and ensured that it is normal. The inner lining of the foreskin (preputial epithelium) <b>is</b> <b>then</b> separated from its attachment to the glans. The device <b>is</b> <b>then</b> placed (this sometimes requires a dorsal slit) and remains there until blood flow has stopped. Finally, part, or all, of the foreskin <b>is</b> <b>then</b> removed.|$|R
50|$|After a {{birth of}} a child, four short bamboos are placed {{on the bank of}} the stream.
