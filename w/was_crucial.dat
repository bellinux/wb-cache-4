5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E

5|$|After re-establishing his {{authority}} in England, John planned to retake Normandy and Anjou by drawing the French from Paris while another army (under Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor) attacked from the north. However, his allies were defeated at the Battle of Bouvines {{in one of}} the most decisive battles in French history. John's nephew Otto retreated and was soon overthrown, with John agreeing to a five-year truce. Philip's victory <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> to the political order in England and France, and the battle was instrumental in establishing absolute monarchy in France.|$|E
5|$|As {{a popular}} {{actor in the}} 1860s, Booth {{continued}} to travel extensively to perform in the North and South, and as far west as New Orleans, Louisiana. According to his sister Asia, Booth confided {{to her that he}} also used his position to smuggle the anti-malarial drug quinine, which <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> to the lives of residents of the Gulf coast, to the South during his travels there, since it was in short supply due to the Northern blockade.|$|E
5|$|At Stockach, the French {{concentrated}} {{their forces}} into shorter lines, creating intense fighting conditions; initially, Charles's line was more extended, {{but he quickly}} pulled additional troops from his reserves to strengthen his front. When a small French force commanded by Dominique Vandamme nearly flanked the Austrian Army, Charles's personal intervention <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> for the Austrians, buying time for reinforcements to arrive. General Jourdan, while trying to rally his men, was nearly trampled to death. Ultimately, the French were driven back upon the Rhine River.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 48, {{he learned}} to fly. Kesselring {{believed}} that first-hand knowledge of all aspects of aviation <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> {{to being able to}} command airmen, although he was well aware that latecomers like himself did not impress the old pioneers or the young aviators. He qualified in various single and multi-engined aircraft and continued flying three or four days per week until March 1945. At times, his flight path took him over the concentration camps at Oranienburg, Dachau, and Buchenwald.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides. This inability of the locomotives to operate {{on the line for}} which they were designed <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> in the decision to withdraw the entire class.|$|E
5|$|Before its scandal, Enron was lauded for its {{sophisticated}} {{financial risk}} management tools. Risk management <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> to Enron {{not only because of}} its regulatory environment, but also because of its business plan. Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future energy prices. Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.|$|E

5|$|Bradman saw Miller as a top-order batsman {{and as his}} new ball {{partner for}} Lindwall, {{although}} the Victorian allrounder was a reluctant bowler. The Australian captain felt that Miller <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> to his strategy of attacking England's strong batting line-up—which boasted the likes of Hammond, Denis Compton, Len Hutton, Bill Edrich and Cyril Washbrook—with high pace. Miller was duly selected for the Australian team for the First Test.|$|E
5|$|British wartime {{participation}} in the Manhattan Project provided a substantial body of expertise that <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> {{to the success of}} High Explosive Research, the United Kingdom's post-war nuclear weapons programme, although it was not without important gaps, such as in the field of plutonium metallurgy. The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E

Marcos heavily relied on Imelda, and as time passed, Imelda was no longer a clone of Marcos. Instead, she had become his political partner.|$|E

5|$|In his {{lab at the}} Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Nuttin {{designed}} {{experiments to}} test the hypothesis that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name. It <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.|$|E
5|$|Lapworth {{also had}} a {{prominent}} {{role to play in}} the fame of Dob's Linn, a small gorge in the Scottish Borders, which contains the 'golden spike' (i.e. the official international boundary or stratotype) between the Ordovician and Silurian periods. Lapworth's work in this area, especially his examination of the complex stratigraphy of the Silurian rocks by comparing fossil graptolites, <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> in to the early understanding of these epochs.|$|E
5|$|On March 28, 1941, Seaborg, {{physicist}} Emilio Segrè and Kennedy {{were able}} to demonstrate not only the presence of plutonium, but that was fissile, an important distinction that <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> to the decisions made in directing Manhattan Project research. Arthur Wahl then began exploring the chemistry of the newly discovered element. In 1966, Room 307 of Gilman Hall on the campus at the Berkeley, where they did this work, was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark.|$|E

5|$|Qutayba's role in {{the conquest}} and gradual Islamization of Central Asia <b>was</b> <b>crucial,</b> and in later times, a number of {{locations}} in Ferghana where his tomb was supposedly located (Narshakhi and Jamal Qarsh) were venerated by pilgrims. His descendants too continued to hold influential positions: his son Qatan served as governor of Bukhara, Salm, another son, governed Basra and Rayy, and his nephew Muslim was governor of Balkh. His grandsons, especially the numerous sons of Salm, continued in high office under the Abbasids {{until well into the}} 9th century.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, the Friends of the Constitution (Zgromadzenie Przyjaciół Konstytucji Rządowej)which {{included}} many {{participants in the}} Great Sejmwas organised to defend the reforms already enacted and to promote further ones. It is now regarded as the first modern-style political party in Poland's history. The response to the new constitution was less enthusiastic in the provinces, where the Hetmans' Party enjoyed considerable influence. General support among the middle nobility <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> and still very substantial; most of the provincial sejmiks deliberating in 1791 and early 1792 supported the constitution.|$|E
5|$|The Incense Route {{served as}} a channel for trading of Indian, Arabian and East Asian goods. The incense trade flourished from South Arabia to the Mediterranean between roughly the 3rd century BCE to the 2nd century CE.
