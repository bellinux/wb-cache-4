2500|$|Nick Manoloff {{patented}} the [...] "bakelite tone bar" [...] in 1937, {{made of a}} plastic-like substance, {{no longer}} used, but these have become a collector's item. Necks cut from bottles, segments of copper or PVC plumbing pipe, and even deep length <b>wrench</b> <b>sockets</b> {{have been used by}} those who do not choose to use a commercial product. Some artists have used a commonly available disposable cigarette lighter, oval in shape, as a slide. With the actual lighter mechanism sawed off, the remaining barrel is called a [...] "fireslide" [...] which has been produced commercially.|$|E
50|$|Tuning <b>wrench</b> <b>sockets</b> may be square shaped or 8-pointed star shaped, and {{are found}} in two basic sizes: a large size for pianos, and a smaller size for most other instruments. For pianos, there are some {{gradations}} of size, and several lengths are generally available, and unlike machine-screw sockets which have no taper, piano sockets have a slight taper, to fit tapered tuning pins. Impact piano tuning levers differ from traditional levers {{in that they are}} fitted with a weight {{at the end of the}} handle. The tuner flicks the lever with his or her wrist, causing the weight to do the actual work of moving the tuning pin. Tuning <b>wrench</b> <b>sockets</b> are often attached snugly to the handle with fine-gauge machine-screw threads, to provide a very firm, immobile joint; this is contrast to the square snap-on joints found in sockets used for machinery.|$|E
50|$|Nick Manoloff was {{a pioneer}} in the making, {{patenting}} and commercially marketing slides as early as 1937.In 1989, Terrie Lambert invented the Moonshine (ceramic) slide that produces a timbre in between that of brass and glass, and the Mudslide (porcelain) slide, which like brass slides is quite heavy, producing richer, fuller and resonating tones with more harmonics. As a result, they are often used in blues music. The Moonshine and Mudslide slides are glazed on the outside but porous on the inside so that finger moisture is absorbed, preventing slippage. Metals such as stainless steel, chrome and aluminium cause a bright penetrating sound and are mostly used with electric guitars, among others for rock music. Necks cut from bottles, segments of copper or PVC plumbing pipe, small glass medicine bottles, and even deep length <b>wrench</b> <b>sockets</b> are commonly used by those who do not choose to buy a slide.|$|E
50|$|A {{breaker bar}} {{is a long}} non-ratcheting bar that is used with <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> style <b>sockets.</b> Breaker bars are used to break loose very tight {{fasteners}} because their additional length allows {{the same amount of}} force to generate significantly more torque than a standard length <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b> The use of a breaker bar also prevents damage to the ratcheting mechanism of a <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b> Often, after the first 1/2 turn of a fastener, the fastener is then loose enough to be turned with a <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A <b>socket</b> <b>wrench,</b> {{with the}} correct type of socket, {{can be used to}} loosen or tighten a large variety of {{fasteners}} with lower cost, greater ease and often more torque than can be applied with a screwdriver handle. A common use of these different [...] "screw" [...] head type sockets is to attach to power versions of the <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> (impact <b>sockets)</b> which allow the fasteners to be loosened or tightened much faster and more powerfully than can be done by hand.|$|R

40|$|A drive {{mechanism}} enables a socket-type wrench to rotate a shaft and prevents accidental {{rotation of the}} shaft when the wrench is not coupled to the shaft. In the original intended application, the shaft {{would be part of}} an attachment mechanism on a spacecraft, and the purpose to be served by the drive is to prevent back-driving of the shaft by launch vibrations while enabling an astronaut equipped with the appropriate wrench to actuate the shaft while in orbit. The design could also be adapted to terrestrial applications in which it is necessary to prevent rotational back-driving. The mechanism includes a gear near the tip of the shaft, and a drive nut that constitutes the tip of the shaft. The gear and drive nut are positioned in a recess in a housing. The recess is sized to receive the <b>wrench</b> <b>socket</b> that mates with the drive nut. Also contained in the housing are four linkages that include pins that are spring-loaded into engagement with the gear to prevent rotation of the shaft. When the <b>wrench</b> <b>socket</b> is inserted in the recess, it pushes on the linkages in such a manner as to disengage the pins from the gear...|$|R
40|$|The term "virtual feel" denotes {{a type of}} capaciflector (an {{advanced}} {{capacitive proximity}} sensor) and a methodology for designing and using a sensor of this type to guide a robot in manipulating a tool (e. g., a <b>wrench</b> <b>socket)</b> into alignment with a mating fastener (e. g., a bolt head) or other electrically conductive object. A capaciflector includes at least one sensing electrode, excited with an alternating voltage, that puts out a signal indicative of the capacitance between that electrode and a proximal object...|$|R

50|$|A <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> {{is a type}} of wrench or spanner {{that has}} a socket {{attached}} at one end, usually used to turn a fastener.|$|R
5000|$|A socket is {{typically}} a cylinder {{which has a}} female six- or twelve-point recessed opening sized to fit over the common male hexagonal head of a bolt or nut fastener. The {{opposite end of the}} <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> has a standardized (ANSI B107, ISO, or other consensus standard) square recess to accept the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench's</b> drive size. Male drivers are also produced for use with socket head cap screws, and are often called Allen drivers (trademark) or the generic term male bit drivers ...|$|R
50|$|An impact <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> is a {{cylindrical}} shaped tool with {{a female}} opening to fit over a nut or bolt head, and is most commonly 6-point hexagonal shaped; generally used with the assist of a power tool such as an Impact wrench or hydraulic torque wrench. Sizes range from the very small, to massive sizes weighing hundreds of pounds each. Impact sockets typically connect with the driving tool {{by way of a}} male to female square drive connection (or less commonly a spline drive connection). The use of power tools and ratchet <b>wrenches</b> with <b>sockets</b> makes tightening and removing bolts incredibly easy over alternative methods like combination wrenches and other manual methods.|$|R

50|$|Many socket {{types and}} sizes are {{available}} with a universal joint between the socket and the ratchet attachment for tightening or loosening fasteners which {{are not easy to}} access with the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> plus standard <b>socket</b> arrangement. Also available are short universal joint extensions that allow any socket to be attached to a ratchet at with a universal joint between the two. Wobble extensions can serve the same purpose and may be easier to use since they often give a more solid socket attachment without all the flexing common to universal joint sockets.|$|R

50|$|Originally {{scheduled}} to begin in December 1949, filming was postponed when Costello had to undergo an operation for a gangrenous gall bladder in November 1949. Filming eventually began on April 28, 1950, and ended on May 29, 1950. Despite having a stunt double, Costello did his own wrestling in the film, only to be rewarded with a <b>wrenched</b> arm <b>socket</b> and a stretched tendon.|$|R
5000|$|Universal joints are two {{articulated}} socket joints (about 1" [...] long) combined at a right angle, {{that allow}} {{a bend in}} the turning axis of the <b>wrench</b> and <b>socket.</b> They are used with extensions and ratchets for turning a bolt or nut at a difficult to access location. Wobble extensions may be substituted for some universal joint applications and have the advantage of not wobbling so much.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, DeWalt {{launched}} {{a line of}} contractors' hand tools (including utility knives, pliers, adjustable wrenches, tape measures, saws, and hammers). In 2013, the line was expanded to include mechanics' tools (<b>wrenches,</b> ratchets, and <b>sockets).</b>|$|R

5000|$|Williams {{returned}} with a tire iron and a <b>socket</b> <b>wrench,</b> the latter of which he gave to Draper. Draper, seemingly having second thoughts, urged Williams to leave. Williams replied, [...] "I know what I'm doin, I know what I'm doin. Don't worry about it, I know what I'm doin." [...] He then began battering Norwood's head with the tire iron. When he noticed that Draper was frozen in place, Williams said, [...] "Man, you with me? We {{got to do this}} together." [...] Draper then sprung into action himself, striking Norwood repeatedly with the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b> This violent scene continued until Norwood lay motionless and dead." ...|$|R
5000|$|Specialized [...] "wobble" [...] or swivel sockets {{are made}} {{that have a}} {{separate}} socket head and <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> connection that allows the socket to wobble or swivel over a limited range independent of the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> or tool position when it {{is attached to the}} bolt or nut. This may be a distinct advantage in some applications with restricted access. These [...] "wobble/swivel" [...] sockets, with their typical ball and socket joint swivel attachments, are made {{in a wide variety of}} types and sizes including deep, shallow, impact, triple square. They are often found in impact sets since they can be built sturdier than a common universal joint socket.|$|R
50|$|Using {{the spin}} disk {{will be much}} quicker than using the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench's</b> handle, {{especially}} if its range of motion is limited. If the nut is very loose, just using ones fingers {{may be the best}} option.|$|R
5|$|After the fire, the Apollo {{program was}} {{grounded}} for review and redesign. The Command Module {{was found to}} be extremely hazardous and, in some instances, carelessly assembled (for example, a misplaced <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> was found in the cabin).|$|R

50|$|Some {{aftermarket}} wheels {{will only}} fit smaller lug nuts, or not allow an ordinary lug nut to be properly torqued down because a socket will {{not fit into}} the lug hole. Tuner lug nuts were created {{to solve this problem}} by utilizing a special key to allow removal and installation with standard lug <b>wrench</b> or <b>socket.</b> The design of tuner lug nuts can range from bit style to multisided or spline drive, and are sometimes lightweight for performance purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Impact {{wrenches}} {{are available}} in every standard <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> drive size, from small ¼" [...] drive tools for small assembly and disassembly, up to 3½" [...] and larger square drives for major construction.

50|$|The most {{prevalent}} form is the ratcheting <b>socket</b> <b>wrench,</b> often improperly called a ratchet. A ratcheting <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> is the device within a hand tool {{in which a}} metal handle {{is attached to a}} ratcheting mechanism, which attaches to a socket, which in turn fits onto a type of bolt or nut. Pulled or pushed in one direction, the ratchet loosens or tightens the bolt or nut attached to the socket. Turned the other direction, the ratchet does not turn the socket but allows the ratchet handle to be re-positioned for another turn while staying attached to the bolt or nut. This ratcheting action allows the fastener to be rapidly tightened or loosened in small increments without disconnecting the tool from the fastener. A switch is built into the ratchet head that allows the user to apply the ratcheting action in either direction, as needed, to tighten or loosen a fastener. Other common methods of driving <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> include pneumatic impact wrenches, hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).|$|R
