50|$|National and {{international}} standards {{are used to}} standardize the definitions, requirements, and test methods used for the performance evaluation of chucks. Selection of the standard to be used is an agreement between the supplier and the user and has some significance {{in the design of}} the chuck. In the United States, ASME has developed the B5.60 Standard entitled <b>Workholding</b> Chucks: Jaw-Type Chucks, which establishes requirements and methods for specifying and testing the performance of <b>workholding</b> chucks used primarily in turning operations.|$|E
50|$|Drilling {{fixtures}} cover a {{wider range}} of different designs and procedures than milling fixtures. Though <b>workholding</b> for drills is more often provided by jigs, fixtures are also used for drilling operations.|$|E
50|$|In {{centerless}} grinding, {{the workpiece}} is held between two wheels, rotating {{in the same}} direction at different speeds, and a <b>workholding</b> platform. One wheel, known as the grinding wheel (stationary wheel in the diagram), is on a fixed axis and rotates such that the force applied to the workpiece is directed downward, against the <b>workholding</b> platform. This wheel usually performs the grinding action by having a higher tangential speed than the workpiece at the point of contact. The other wheel, known as the regulating wheel (moving wheel in the diagram), is movable. This wheel is positioned to apply lateral pressure to the workpiece, and usually has either a very rough or rubber-bonded abrasive to trap the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|Tooling University, the {{original}} online training component of Tooling U-SME, was founded {{to address the}} shortage of skilled workers in the manufacturing industry. Tooling U began as a division of Jergens Inc., a <b>workholding</b> and tooling component manufacturer founded in 1942. In 2010, Tooling University was acquired by SME.|$|E
50|$|For certain {{specialist}} jobs, temporary {{or special}} faceplates can be made, perhaps in wood or light alloy, {{that can be}} machined or adapted for difficult <b>workholding</b> jobs. One example might be attaching thin sheet metal to a wooden faceplate using woodscrews, allowing the trepanning of holes, with the tool cutting into the sacrificial faceplate material.|$|E
50|$|A lathe {{faceplate}} {{is a basic}} <b>workholding</b> accessory for a wood {{or metal}} turning lathe. It is a circular metal (usually cast iron) plate which fixes {{to the end of}} the lathe spindle. The workpiece is then clamped to the faceplate, typically using t-nuts in slots in the faceplate, or less commonly threaded holes in the faceplate itself.|$|E
50|$|The {{workpieces}} to {{be joined}} are treated with cleaning flux. Then the workpiece is mounted in the <b>workholding</b> device and immersed in the molten solder for 2 to 12 seconds. The workpiece is often agitated to aid {{the flow of the}} solder. The workpiece holder must allow an inclination of 3 to 5 deg. so that the solder may run off to insure a smooth finish.|$|E
50|$|Enerpac is a {{supplier}} of specialized high-force hydraulic industrial tools. The hydraulic tool line {{consists of a}} broad range of products that are generally sold by industrial and specialty fluid power distributors to customers in the infrastructure, mining, steel mill, cement, rail, oil and gas, and general maintenance industries. Enerpac is {{a supplier}} of hydraulic <b>workholding</b> components and systems. The products are marketed through distributors to the automotive, machine tool and fixture design markets.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{forms of}} <b>workholding</b> on lathes were between-centers holding and ad hoc fastenings to the headstock spindle. The spike-style centers still used on wood lathes represent an ancient method. Ad hoc fastening methods in centuries past included anything from pinning with clenching or wedging; nailing; lashing with cords of leather or fiber; dogging down (again involving pinning/wedging/clenching); or other types. Faceplates {{have probably been}} around {{at least since the}} era of medieval clock-makers.|$|E
50|$|The {{workpiece}} is manually clamped to a lathe dog, {{powered by}} the faceplate, that holds the piece in between two centers and rotates the piece. The piece and the grinding wheel rotate in opposite directions and small bits of the piece are removed as it passes along the grinding wheel. In some instances special drive centers {{may be used to}} allow the edges to be ground. The <b>workholding</b> method affects the production time as it changes set up times.|$|E
50|$|Advantages {{of laser}} cutting over {{mechanical}} cutting include easier <b>workholding</b> and reduced contamination of workpiece (since {{there is no}} cutting edge which can become contaminated by the material or contaminate the material). Precision may be better, since the laser beam does not wear during the process. There is also a reduced chance of warping the material that is being cut, as laser systems have a small heat-affected zone. Some materials are also very difficult or impossible to cut by more traditional means.|$|E
50|$|To chuck a tool or {{workpiece}} {{is to hold}} it with a chuck, {{in which}} case it has been chucked. Lathe work whose <b>workholding</b> involves chucking individual slugs or blanks is often called chucking work, in contrast to bar work or bar feed work. In bar work the bar protrudes from the chuck, is worked upon, then cut off by a lathe tool (parted off) rather than being sawn off. Automatic lathes that specialize in chucking work are often called chuckers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{surface grinder}} is {{composed}} of an abrasive wheel, a <b>workholding</b> device known as a chuck, and a reciprocating or rotary table. The chuck holds the material in place while it is being worked on. It can do this one of two ways: ferromagnetic pieces are {{held in place by}} a magnetic chuck, while non-ferromagnetic and nonmetallic pieces are held in place by vacuum or mechanical means. A machine vise (made from ferromagnetic steel or cast iron) placed on the magnetic chuck can be used to hold non-ferromagnetic workpieces if only a magnetic chuck is available.|$|E

5000|$|The four most {{commonly}} used <b>workholding</b> devices are the three-jaw chuck, the four-jaw chuck, the collet, and the faceplate. The three-jaw chuck is used to hold round or hex workpieces because the work is automatically centered. On these chucks the runout faces limitations; on late-model CNCs, it can be quite low if all conditions are excellent, but traditionally it is usually at least [...]001-.003 in (0.025-0.075 mm). The four-jaw chuck is used either to hold irregular shapes or to hold round or hex to extremely low runout (with time spent indicating and clamping each piece), in both cases because of its independent action on each jaw. The face plate is also used for irregular shapes. Collets combine self-centering chucking with low runout, but they involve higher costs.|$|E
50|$|The {{main spindle}} is {{generally}} hollow to allow long bars to extend {{through to the}} work area. This reduces preparation and waste of material. The spindle runs in precision bearings and is fitted with some means of attaching <b>workholding</b> devices such as chucks or faceplates. This end of the spindle usually also has an included taper, frequently a Morse taper, to allow the insertion of hollow tubular (Morse standard) tapers {{to reduce the size}} of the tapered hole, and permit use of centers. On older machines ('50s) the spindle was directly driven by a flat belt pulley with lower speeds available by manipulating the bull gear. Later machines use a gear box driven by a dedicated electric motor. A fully 'geared head' allows the operator to select suitable speeds entirely through the gearbox.|$|E

There he was the lead {{engineer}} {{for the design of}} friction stir welding machines for aerospace and research. This role required him to carry out the design from clean sheet to final drawings in SolidWorks and Inventor, including structural analysis using the finite element method and hand calculations, as well as spindle design, drivetrain sizing, and servo actuator selection. His reputation for simple, robust and cost-effective design was highly regarded. His particular specialty was high stiffness machines for friction stir welding of steel and high temperature alloys. He also made significant contributions to the design of <b>workholding</b> fixtures for aircraft and spacecraft. He was also responsible for hiring and overseeing full-time and contract engineering staff in addition to project management for multiple projects simultaneously, which included obtaining quotes and verifying vendors as well as scheduling engineering, manufacturing and shipping. At this company he designed, built and installed machines that welded two spaceships, two airplanes, and nuclear fuel rods.

40|$|The {{ability to}} produce {{precision}} ring shaped parts using the turning process depends significantly on the <b>workholding</b> characteristics. <b>Workholding</b> parameters such {{as the number of}} jaws and chucking force are known to influence the roundness tolerance of ring shaped parts commonly used in bearing applications. Experimental trial and error methods are often used in practice to optimize the <b>workholding</b> parameters to achieve the desired part quality. This thesis develops a systematic mathematical approach for optimizing these parameters using a finished cut roundness prediction model and a model for determining the reaction force between the chuck jaws and the ring. The roundness prediction model is verified through experiments for different cutting conditions. The optimization approach takes as input the required roundness tolerance, geometry and mechanical properties of the ring, cutting forces, and the coefficient of friction between the jaws and the ring. The output consists of the minimum number of jaws and the range of acceptable chucking forces that satisfy the required tolerance while preventing slip of the ring. Simulation examples are used to illustrate the proposed <b>workholding</b> optimization approach for a hard turning application. In addition, based on the optimization model, the thesis proposes a novel concept of dynamic chucking force control that promises to yield part roundness that is superior to conventional chucking. M.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a general methodology for automatic fixture design (AFD) concerning the automation and integration issues in a computer environment. The research effort covers several major topics. These topics are studied as general methodology which can also be extended to solve other manufacturing problems. First, a set of proper workpiece orientations is determined. The orientation information is important for the planning of <b>workholding,</b> machining sequence, and production scheduling. To select the required workpiece orientations for all manufacturing activities, information about the workpiece geometry, the available manufacturing tools, and the job specification in general is considered in the analysis procedure. Second, a methodology for automatic <b>workholding</b> configuration is developed to generate the fixturing points for each workpiece orientation. The Projective Spatial Occupancy Enumeration (PSOE) approach is applied to develop the configuration algorithms which can automatically generate the fixturing points for any workpiece with general (prismatic or non-prismatic) shape. Third, an automatic <b>workholding</b> verification model is provided to verify the fixturing results for any workpiece. This model is developed under the domain of the general workholding; therefore, {{it can be used to}} verify other holding applications, such as the robot-hand (grasping) or mechanical manipulators. The model is developed by using non-linear programming to incorporate the fixturing conditions and constraints. These conditions include the force equilibrium, the frictional affects, the workpiece geometry constraints, and the fixturing force limits. ^ Fixture design is one of numerous tasks in a complete manufacturing planning procedure. The AFD results are influenced by planning decisions other than fixturing, and are also used as inputs for these planning activities. Therefore, information integration between the AFD system and the other computer assisted design and planning modules are studied as the fourth research topic. In order to increase the degree of global automation and eliminate the human interaction for information transformation, an integration system shell, called MetaDesigner, is developed. The results of this research provide a global methodology to solve the automation and integration issues in fixture design. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the integration of automated fixture design and automated fixture assembly activities. This is an important requirement due to the continually growing demand for efficient and agile manufacturing technologies. The concurrent fixturing approach developed in this research provides a framework for the integration and capability enhancement in these two areas. A one to one functional mapping of <b>workholding</b> capability to the fixture design domain has been devised. This is utilized in the hierarchical development of innovative fixturing hardware solutions which meet automation, integration and concurrency criteria. Issues of cost, complexity and rigidity are addressed. A device for programmable assembly assistance to the operator is proposed. At the CAD based automated fixture design stage, the same functional mapping is utilized to impose <b>workholding</b> constraints on a 3 D solid model representation of the workpiece. Design criteria used includes modeling of cutter path interference and surface conditions of the workpiece. Accessibility, surface incidence and topological constraints of the workpiece are processed. Optimal placement of the workpiece over the pallet is determined by shift and scan evaluation of all constraints based on which the fixture layout is automatically generated. The design approach has been implemented using the TWIN solid modeler on a Silicon Graphics workstation. Very fast processing times are demonstrated for 3 D workpieces of industrial complexity, using fixturability algorithms developed in this research. The output generated can be directly used as instructions for automated fixture assembly. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to design an innovative vacuum-hydrostatic shoe to solve the workpiece lobing and shoe wear problems in centerless grinding of bearing raceways so as to improve workpiece quality and dimensional accuracies and to reduce the machining cost. The shoe combines a vacuum pocket to a hydrostatic bearing, thus providing a non-contact, high stiffness and good load-carrying capacity workpiece support. Based on the kinematics and mechanics in shoe centerless grinding, the study provides theoretical analyses to systematically reveal the workpiece holding and rotating mechanisms of the planar frictional drivehead. It addresses <b>workholding</b> stability issue for the first time from the viewpoint of driving capacity and constraining capability which are the two contradictory sides of centerless grinding. Dynamic modeling is presented to correlate the lobing and chatter with machine setup parameters and process parameters in both time and frequency domains. A methodology is advanced for the design of vacuum-hydrostatic shoe. A computer model is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the vacuum-hydrostatic shoe in improving workpiece roundness through lobing control. Experimental results show that with the vacuum-hydrostatic shoe, the geometric and <b>workholding</b> instabilities are effectively eliminated or suppressed, which in turn improves workpiece geometric accuracies and surface finish. The shoe has made possible high speed, wear and thermal damage free workpiece support for shoe centerless grinding due to its non-contact support mechanism. With the application of the vacuum-hydrostatic shoe, the shoe centerless grinding process becomes insensitive to the critical parameters, such as offset and shoe setup angles. As a result, the roundness error of a typical bearing raceway of 42 mm in diameter is significantly reduced from the current level of 1. 0 μm to 0. 2 μm. ...|$|E
40|$|The term {{fixturing}} {{refers to}} the task of immobilizing a workpiece for the purpose of performing operations such as assembly and machining. As such, fixturing is of fundamental importance to industrial manufacturing.

40|$|Modelling the {{dimensional}} variation propagation in multi-station machining processes (MMPs) {{has been studied}} intensively {{in the past decade}} to understand and reduce the variation of product quality characteristics. Among others, the Stream-of-Variation (SoV) model has been successfully applied in a variety of applications, such as fault diagnosis, process planning and process-oriented tolerancing. However, the current SoV model is limited to the MMPs where only fixtures with punctual locators are applied. Other types of fixtures, such as those based on locating surfaces, have not been investigated. In this paper, the derivation of the SoV model is extended to model the effect of fixture- and datum-induced variations when fixtures with locating surfaces are applied. Due to the hyperstatic nature of these fixtures, different <b>workholding</b> configurations can be adopted. This will increase the dimension of the SoV model exponentially and thus may make the model-based part quality prediction extremely complex. This paper presents a method of reducing the complexity of the SoV model when fixtures based on locating surfaces are applied and evaluates the worst-case approach of the resulting part quality...|$|E
