No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique <b>ways,</b> <b>you</b> just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
25|$|I've always {{believed}} that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is all that matters. There are two <b>ways</b> <b>you</b> can choose to go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of}} this band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E

[...] In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy [...] "made sure I learned [...] words from our Methodist faith." ...|$|E
50|$|As a witch, Tiffany {{possesses}} First Sight, {{the ability}} to see 'what is really there' (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there). She also possesses Second Thoughts, which are defined as 'the thoughts you think about the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> think'. Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third Thoughts (the thoughts you think about the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> think about the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> think), and Fourth Thoughts (the thoughts you think about the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> think about the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> think about the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> think).

500|$|Prior to the {{dismantling}} project, there was debate by local residents {{on whether the}} wrecked stern should be removed. Some local officials believed the stern, which lay on a remote area of the beach, was not a hazard or an eyesore. Arnie Roblan, a state representative from Coos Bay, called the wreck a potential tourist attraction. For some residents, uncertainty remained surrounding Titan's removal plan, with the worry that the stern {{would be unable to}} withstand the force of the hydraulic pullers and that parts of the ship already buried in the sand would be unmovable. The president of the Coos Bay city council expressed concern that the proposed removal operation could cause ecological damage that would not occur if the ship were left on the beach. He further noted that [...] "shipwrecks on the Oregon Coast are part of our history. There are a lot of <b>ways</b> <b>you</b> could better spend the money here." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Boyz 4 Now" [...] {{was written}} by Lizzie and Wendy Molyneux and {{directed}} by Anthony Chun. Upon hearing the writers' pitch of the episode, series creator Loren Bouchard found its plot to be [...] "such an immediately appealing story" [...] and [...] "a great way to have Louise peek over {{the other side of}} adolescence and look into the abyss." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bouchard cited [...] "Boyz 4 Now" [...] as one of his favorite episodes of the series and revealed his liking of [...] "episodes where Louise is a little vulnerable...you don't want her to be as invulnerable as she pretends to be. If you try to keep the show grounded, then you periodically have to say, she's a nine-year-old girl." [...] He added that while the character has [...] "an adult sensibility about a lot of stuff," [...] he and the writing staff try to [...] "look for ways to bring her back down to earth," [...] citing the episode's depiction of Louise [...] "fighting against growing up," [...] with Tina acting as [...] "her strange ambassador into that world...in some <b>ways,</b> <b>you</b> couldn't ask for a better guide." ...|$|E
500|$|Selman {{told the}} Los Angeles Times that the episode praises {{collaborative}} writing, and answers {{the question of}} whether or not writing in a group is as valuable as writing alone. He commented: [...] "I've been with The Simpsons for 15 years and [...] it's been pretty much writing as a team. We’re proud of what we've done even if it's not the traditional idea of one writer sitting down with a passion and a vision. In a strange way this episode ends up as a defense of writing in a group and celebrating the way it makes you feel connected to the work and to the people in that group in <b>ways</b> <b>you</b> didn't expect. It's all about a writers room ... and you know, in the story, Homer's cynical heist team does end up being incredibly productive." [...] The episode features several references to literature and parodies several popular young-adult book series, particularly Twilight, a vampire-themed fantasy book series by Stephenie Meyer that has received much popularity. While chasing T. R. Francis through the stadium where the dinosaur show took place, Lisa passes a bathroom in which a group of dinosaurs are smoking in reference to a Far Side comic of dinosaurs smoking. The dinosaur show itself, Sitting with Dinosaurs, is based on the live Walking with Dinosaurs show.|$|E

2500|$|This {{definition}} is where X {{is the number}} k of successes given a set of r failures, and is the primary way the negative binomial distribution is defined in this article. The second alternative formula clearly shows {{the relationship of the}} negative binomial distribution to the binomial distribution. [...] The only difference is that in the binomial coefficient of the negative binomial distribution, there are nnbsp&minus&nbsp&1 trials to choose from (instead of n) when evaluating the number of ways that k successes can occur. [...] This is because when you are evaluating the number of <b>ways</b> <b>you</b> can obtain k successes before you reach r failures, the last trial must be a failure. [...] As such, the other events have one fewer positions available when counting possible orderings.|$|E

2500|$|The Mechanismo trilogy {{had been}} told entirely in the Judge Dredd Megazine in 1992-93, and no mention of those events {{had been made in}} sister comic 2000 AD. This was {{addressed}} by a short story in 2000 AD in 1994, beginning the new [...] "Wilderlands" [...] arc which then continued in the Megazine. The story [...] "Wilderlands" [...] itself was told in both comics, but using a different method to the previous crossover [...] "Judgement Day". Whereas [...] "Judgement Day" [...] {{had been told}} in a completely linear fashion, with episodes alternating between the two comics, [...] "Wilderlands" [...] initially began in the same way, but then diverged into two separate plotlines, one following Dredd and the other following Castillo. This meant that readers who only bought one comic could still follow the story. However, some readers who read both titles complained that much of the content of the early episodes was repetitive, as the same events were told twice [...] once in each comic [...] until Dredd and Castillo were separated. Writer John Wagner would not perfect this technique until the third such crossover, [...] "The Doomsday Scenario," [...] in 1999. Nevertheless, after that Wagner said [...] "I'm never again going to try running a story in two comics. It forces the storyline in <b>ways</b> <b>you</b> don't want it to go." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the {{producers}} let the {{users of the}} Internet vote over what direction The Simpsons should take.

The episode ends with Homer and Marge Simpson giving the viewers {{a link to the}} official The Simpsons website, TheSimpsons.com, and encouraging them to go on the website and vote over the summer of 2011 on whether Ned and Edna should stay together. Showrunner Al Jean {{said in an interview that}} the writers decided it would not be interesting for them to do another episode where a relationship ended, and they thought it would be interesting [...] "to see what people think, [...] the Internet certainly has a lot of opinion on the show, might as well have them have their say." [...] When asked why the writers thought Ned and Edna were the right characters for a cliffhanger like this, Jean said that [...] "In life, unusual things happen. People couple together in <b>ways</b> <b>you</b> would not expect, and he's single and she's single. We thought it would be funny, the fact that they both have these connections to the Simpsons but they never really met or if they have met it was minimal." [...] The result of the poll was revealed in the season 23 premiere [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman". According to Jean, the poll was [...] "very strong in one direction". He assured in an interview before the result was presented that the poll was authentic and the writers would not undo the viewers' decision, and added that [...] "What our fans have joined together, let no writer tear asunder." ...|$|E
