2500|$|Hephaestion {{was given}} a {{magnificent}} funeral. Its cost is variously given in the sources as 10,000 talents or 12,000 talents. It is difficult to give a modern equivalent for such a huge amount but <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Hephaestion’s time, the daily wage of a skilled worker was two or three drachmas. In western Europe, 2008, that would be between £50 and £100, so the lowest possible value for 1 drachma in modern terms is £25. We know there were 6,000 drachmas in a talent, so even at the most conservative estimate, Hephaestion’s funeral would have cost £1,500,000,000. Alexander himself drove the funeral carriage {{part of the way}} back to Babylon with some of the driving entrusted to Hephaestion's friend Perdiccas. At Babylon funeral games were held in Hephaestion's honour. The contests ranged from literature to athletics and 3,000 competitors took part, the festival eclipsing anything that had gone before both in cost and in numbers taking part. Plutarch says that Alexander planned to spend ten thousand talents on the funeral and the tomb. He employed Stasicrates, [...] "...as this artist was famous for his innovations, which combined an exceptional degree of magnificence, audacity and ostentation...", to design the pyre for Hephaestion.|$|E
