5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{is upset}} that his {{daughter}} Jada would rather spend Christmas with her mother than him. At the party, Jada begins to lose interest, but Pam and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) try to find fun activities for her; however, Andy ends up ruining most of them. Darryl then takes her to the break room, where she is impressed with the snacks in the vending machines. They take out the snacks and hand them to employees. When she hands one to Michael, he decides to dress up as Santa again so she can tell him what she wants for Christmas as Holly looks on <b>with</b> <b>admiration.</b>|$|E

25|$|Skanderbeg is also {{mentioned}} by Prince of Montenegro, Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, {{one of the}} greatest poets of Serbian literature, in his poem The Mountain Wreath (1847), and in False Tsar Stephen the Little (1851). In 1855, Camille Paganel wrote Histoire de Scanderbeg, inspired by the Crimean War, whereas in the lengthy poetic tale Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812–1819), Byron wrote <b>with</b> <b>admiration</b> about Skanderbeg and his warrior nation..|$|E
25|$|In 1914, {{a teenage}} boy named Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) from Devon, England, {{witnesses}} {{the birth of a}} bay Thoroughbred foal and subsequently watches <b>with</b> <b>admiration</b> the growth of the young horse. Much to the dismay of his mother Rose (Emily Watson), his father Ted buys the colt at auction, outbidding their landlord Lyons, despite their needing a more suitable plough horse for the farm work. Albert's best friend, Andrew Easton, watches as Albert teaches his colt many things, such as to come when he imitates the call of an owl by blowing through his cupped hands. He names the horse Joey.|$|E

25|$|I {{afterwards}} travelled {{much with}} him, and have now only {{to speak of}} him with great respect, or, I ought to say, <b>with</b> <b>admiration...</b> No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; {{he has a very}} powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and you hear the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the poets}} of the Matterhorn {{during these years}} (1834 to 1840) were Elie de Beaumont, a famous French geologist; Pierre Jean Édouard Desor, a naturalist of Neuchâtel, who went up there with a party of friends, two of whom were Louis Agassiz and Bernhard Studer. Christian Moritz Engelhardt, who was so filled <b>with</b> <b>admiration</b> for Zermatt and its {{neighbourhood}} that he returned there at least ten times (from 1835 to 1855), described these places in two valuable volumes, drew panoramas and maps, and collected the most minute notes on the mineralogy and botany of the region. Zermatt {{was at that time}} a quiet little village, and travellers found hospitality at the parish priest's, or at the village doctor's.|$|E
25|$|There {{are little}} {{subsequent}} account of its fortunes. It {{appears to have}} been in Cicero's time a considerable municipal town. Silius Italicus speaks of it as abounding in fish, litus piscosa Calacte and its name, though omitted by Pliny, is found in Ptolemy, {{as well as in the}} Antonine Itineraries; but there is considerable difficulty in regard to its position. The distances given in the Tabula Peutingeriana, however (12 M. P. from Alaesa, and 30 M. P. from Cephaloedium), coincide with the site of the modern town of Caronia, on the shore below which Fazello tells us that ruins and vestiges of an ancient city were still visible in his time. Cluverius, who visited Caronia, speaks <b>with</b> <b>admiration</b> of the beauty and pleasantness of this part of the coast, littoris excellens amoenitas et pulchritudo, which rendered it fully worthy of its ancient name.|$|E

25|$|By 1881, {{having been}} {{exempted}} from his compulsory {{term in the}} Romanian Land Forces as the eldest son of a widow, the young man went on to study at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Letters. Taught and regarded <b>with</b> <b>admiration</b> by academic Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Șăineanu was primarily a student of etymology, stylistics and semantics (which {{formed the basis of}} his first three studies, published in 1882 and 1887). He published his first study, the 1883 Câteva specimene de etimologie populară română ("A Few Samples of Romanian Folk Etymology"), in Hasdeu's magazine Columna lui Traian. By then, Șăineanu had begun contributing to Anuar pentru Israeliți ("The Yearbook for Israelites"), the Hebraist magazine edited by his friends and fellow scholars Moses Gaster and Moses Schwartzfeld, which mainly published articles on Jewish history and espoused a moderate assimilationist agenda (Haskalah). Gaster also sent Șăineanu's various studies on folklore and linguistics also published in Revista pentru Istorie, Arheologie și Filologie, a review founded and led by Romanian historian Grigore Tocilescu. The direct contacts between the two scholars ended in 1885, when Gaster was expelled from Romania for protesting against the antisemitic measures condoned by the National Liberal Party cabinet of Ion Brătianu.|$|E

[...] After the inspection, the pair retreated to Rodman's cabin for coffee, a smoke, and casual conversation, something Rodman noted the king seemed to particularly enjoy.|$|E

500|$|Between 1992 and 1994, {{he wrote}} five books, all {{published}} by mainstream publishers, four in 1993. Love Changes Everything (1992), {{influenced by the}} [...] "channelling" [...] work of Deborah Shaw, is a theosophical work {{about the origin of}} the planet, in which Icke writes <b>with</b> <b>admiration</b> about Jesus. Days of Decision (1993) is an 86-page summary of his interviews after the 1991 press conference; it questions the historicity of Jesus but accepts the existence of the Christ spirit. Icke's autobiography, In the Light of Experience, was published the same year, followed by Heal the World: A Do-It-Yourself Guide to Personal and Planetary Transformation (1993).|$|E
500|$|In his 1996 book on bog bodies, Wijnand Van der Sanden paid {{homage to}} Glob's The Bog Bodies, {{describing}} it as a [...] "highly accessible work" [...] which had {{done more than}} any other to bring publicity to the bog cadavers. Exclaiming that he was filled <b>with</b> <b>admiration</b> for the work, he noted that he wished that he himself had written it 30 years before. In their 2007 edited volume on the reinvestigation of Grauballe Man, Pauline Asingh and Niels Lynnerup stated that Glob's book had represented a [...] "major contribution" [...] to the study of bog bodies which [...] "awoke many people's interest in prehistory".|$|E
500|$|Years {{later as}} {{an elderly man}} {{near the end of}} his life, Marques de Sousa would fondly recall his advancement: [...] "Never in my life had I judged myself so great, nor {{experienced}} such ineffable rejoicing... as in the day I placed my fists into the cuffs of alferes. I walked through all the streets of the city, looking at myself, conceited, believing that everyone looking <b>with</b> <b>admiration</b> envied my luck, that all enamored ladies vied for my hand." [...] For the remainder of the conflict he was stationed in the defense of Montevideo. The conquest of the Banda Oriental was ended in July 1821, when Portugal declared it a province of Brazil with the name of Cisplatina.|$|E

500|$|For all {{his insistence}} that justice {{could not be}} done to Shakespeare's plays on stage, Hazlitt {{frequently}} made exceptions. A devoted playgoer from an early age, and now a drama critic, he relished many of the stage performances he had witnessed. In some cases, as with Edmund Kean (to whom he refers frequently in this book, usually <b>with</b> <b>admiration)</b> and Sarah Siddons (he could [...] "conceive of nothing grander" [...] than her performance as Lady Macbeth), their interpretations of roles in Shakespearean drama left indelible impressions, extending his ideas of {{the potential of the}} characters represented. For example, in [...] "Romeo and Juliet" [...] he proclaims, [...] "Perhaps one of the finest pieces of acting that ever was witnessed on the stage, is Mr. Kean's manner of doing this scene [...] He treads close indeed upon the genius of his author." ...|$|E
500|$|Around {{the end of}} April 1860, Darwin {{discussed}} {{insect pollination}} with his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, and mentioned the bee orchid. Darwin corresponded with Hooker's assistant Daniel Oliver, the senior curator at Kew Gardens, who became a follower of Darwin's ideas. At the start of June, Darwin wrote to The Gardeners' Chronicle asking for readers' observations on how bee or fly orchids were fertilised. His letter described the mechanisms for insect fertilisation he had discovered in common British orchids, and reported his experimental observations that pollen masses were removed from Orchis morio and Orchis mascula plants in the open, but left in their pouches in adjacent plants under a glass bell jar. He wrote to American botanist Asa Gray {{that he had been}} [...] "so struck <b>with</b> <b>admiration</b> at the contrivances, that I have sent notice to Gardeners Chronicle", and made similar enquiries of other experts.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the author}} most {{affected}} by Balzac was American expatriate novelist Henry James. In 1878 James wrote with sadness {{about the lack of}} contemporary attention paid to Balzac, and lavished praise on him in four essays (in 1875, 1877, 1902, and 1913). In 1878 James wrote: [...] "Large as Balzac is, he is all of one piece and he hangs perfectly together". He wrote <b>with</b> <b>admiration</b> of Balzac's attempt to portray in writing [...] "a beast with a hundred claws". In his own novels James explored more of the psychological motives of the characters and less of the historical sweep exhibited by Balzac—a conscious style preference; he stated: [...] "the artist of the Comédie Humaine is half smothered by the historian". Still, both authors used the form of the realist novel to probe the machinations of society and the myriad motives of human behavior.|$|E
