5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were directly or indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation are <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> they intended to resolve in the first place, known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead to the rise of Al-Qaeda.|$|E
5|$|The {{provisional}} government lacked direction in policy and planning, resulting in its quick collapse. The number of rural attacks instigated by the Viet Cong surged {{in the wake}} of Diệm's deposal, due to the displacement of troops into urban areas for the coup. The increasingly free discussion generated from the surfacing of new and accurate data following the coup revealed that the military situation was far <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> was reported by Diệm. The incidence of Việt Cộng attacks continued to increase as it had done during the summer of 1963, the weapons loss ratio worsened and the rate of Viet Cong defections fell. The units that participated in the coup were returned to the field to guard against a possible major communist offensive in the countryside. The falsification of military statistics by Diệm's officials had led to miscalculations, which manifested themselves in military setbacks after Diệm's death. Aside from battlefield setbacks, something that was outside his remit, Thơ was also becoming unpopular in the military establishment. One of the goals of the various anti-Minh coup plots at the time was to remove Thơ, and the prime minister's unpopularity helped to distract some of the incumbent officers from {{the fact that they were}} the primary target; at that time, the MRC was moving toward removing Thơ, and Minh was the only senior general to retain confidence in him.|$|E

Drake reviewed the laws regarding disclosure of information, and decided that if he revealed unclassified information to a reporter, then {{the worst thing that}} would happen to him was probably that he would be fired.|$|E

According to the report, Castro is actually suffering from intestinal cancer {{and will be}} unable to resume control of the Cuban state.

25|$|In July 1933, Trotsky {{was offered}} asylum in France by Prime Minister Édouard Daladier. Trotsky {{accepted}} the offer, {{but he was}} forbidden to live in Paris and soon found himself under the surveillance of the French Police. From July 1933 to February 1934, Trotsky and his wife lived in Royan. The philosopher and activist Simone Weil also arranged for Trotsky and his bodyguards {{to stay for a}} few days at her parents' house. Following the 6 February 1934 crisis in France, the French Minister of Internal Affairs, Albert Sarraut, signed a decree to deport Trotsky from France. However, no foreign government was found willing to accept Trotsky within its borders. As a result, the French authorities instructed Trotsky to move to a residence in the tiny village of Barbizon under the strict surveillance of the French Police, where Trotsky found his {{contact with the outside world}} to be even <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> it had been during his exile in Turkey.|$|E

[...] Although this entire scene was not censored, Fox Broadcasting Company bleeped [...] "erection", which, according to DVD commentary, made what Cleveland said sound <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> was intended. The scene where Peter is promoting 'Crystal Pepsi' was shown only on the DVD, because it is prohibited to promote one product over another on television.|$|E
500|$|The second chapter, [...] "The Great Experiment", {{continues}} {{the examination of}} Stone Age progress {{by looking at the}} advancements in hunting. Wright uses the term [...] "progress trap" [...] to refer to innovations that create new problems for which the society is unable or unwilling to solve, or inadvertently create conditions that are <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> existed before the innovation. For example, innovations in hunting during the Stone Age allowed for more successful hunts and consequently more free time during which culture and art were created (e.g. cave paintings, bone carvings, etc.), but also led to extinctions, most notably of megafauna. As smaller and smaller game were hunted to replace larger extinct animals, the hunts became less successful and culture declined. Agriculture, and subsequently civilisations, independently arising in multiple regions at about the same time, ~10,000 years ago, indicates to Wright that [...] "given certain broad conditions, human societies everywhere will move towards greater size, complexity and environmental demand". The chapter title refers to the human experience which Wright sees as a large experiment testing what conditions are required for a human civilisation to succeed.|$|E
500|$|The {{provisional}} government lacked direction in policy and planning, resulting in it quickly losing control.

The falsification and inflation of military statistics by Diệm's officials had led to miscalculations, which manifested themselves in military setbacks after Diệm's death. Khánh claimed that [...] "After the November coup, there was much relaxation, wining and dining, and little prosecution of the war effort."

500|$|Lost writer Elizabeth Sarnoff {{explained}} that Michael's storyline in season two is about [...] "what a father {{will do to}} save his son"; she noted [...] "there's nothing <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> he does". The second episode of season two was originally going to be Sawyer centric, however this was rewritten [...] "at the proverbial last minute" [...] and changed to a Michael centric episode. Perrineau received swimming lessons in preparation for this episode. Perrineau was unaware that his character had been captured by the Others until he was told Michael {{was going to kill}} Ana Lucia and Libby. Perrineau described shooting the scenes in [...] "Two for the Road" [...] where Michael murders Ana Lucia and Libby as a [...] "tough day". The last scene shot of season two was Michael and Walt sailing away from the Island. As it was a long camera shot, Perrineau had to sail the boat so far from the pier, that by the time he returned, all the equipment had already been packed away. He said, [...] "It felt fitting, actually. Like; that's it". Perrineau knew he would be back one day, but as the producers did not reveal any details to him, he did not know when. He was the first actor that left the show as [...] "part of a grander design to come back", and the only one until Emilie de Ravin.|$|E

They said Hamas's intimidation was no <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> they got from the IDF, and said no armed forces would permit reporters to broadcast militarily sensitive information; and that, furthermore, most reporters seldom saw Hamas fighters, because they fought from concealed locations and in places that were too dangerous to approach.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{cultures}} do {{not place}} a great emphasis on informing the patient of the diagnosis, especially when {{cancer is the}} diagnosis. [...] American culture rarely used truth-telling especially in medical cases, up until the 1970s. [...] In American medicine, the principle of informed consent now takes precedence over other ethical values, and patients are usually at least asked {{whether they want to}} know the diagnosis.. Additionally, The WMA International Code of Medical Ethics explicitly states, [...] "“A physician shall...report to the appropriate authorities those physicians who practice unethically or incompetently or who engage in fraud or deception." [...] There is also the conflict with physicians who are tempted to report made up incidents or make an incident <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> it was for their own personal motives. In vice versa, a physician might be hesitant to report an incident because of a personal friendship he or she may have with his colleague.|$|E
2500|$|It took 15 {{minutes for}} Don Canham {{to be sold}} on Bo Schembechler, {{resulting}} in Schembechler becoming the 15th coach in Michigan football history. At the time, Schembechler's current employer, the Miami RedHawks, could have thrown more money at Schembechler, but Canham managed to sell Schembechler on Michigan's tradition and prestige. Schembechler's respect for Michigan was evident early on when assistants complained about how the equipment they had was <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> they {{had to work with}} at Miami. Schembechler gestured to a rusty chair and said, [...] "See this chair? Fielding Yost sat in this chair. See this nail? Fielding Yost hung his hat on that nail. And you're telling me we had better stuff at Miami? No men, we didn't. We have tradition here, Michigan tradition, and that's something no one else has!" [...] Schembechler immediately got to work in turning around his team. He had a reputation for being hard on his players, causing 65 of his 140 players to quit the team before the season even started. In response, Schembechler promised his team [...] "Those Who Stay Will be Champions," [...] assuring the players that remained that their efforts would be rewarded.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{breakdown}} of peace negotiations with Hanoi, President Nixon launched Operation Linebacker II, an extensive aerial campaign by B-52 bombers and tactical aircraft that began on 16 December 1972. Nixon, {{in an effort to}} conceal the fact that the talks had broken down, ordered that the public explanation for the bombing be linked to [...] "a possible enemy offensive in the South." [...] With no information flowing from the White House, the Pentagon, or MACV, North Vietnam's propaganda was all that correspondents had to go on and it was extensively reported by the media. The American people, however, were unconvinced. According to a Harris poll, fewer than 50 percent agreed that it was [...] "inhuman and immoral for the U.S. to have bombed Hanoi's civilian center" [...] and an impressive 71 percent believed [...] "what we did in bombing Hanoi was no <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> the communists have done in the Vietnam War." [...] Following the campaign Hanoi returned to the negotiating table and (after some wrangling with the Saigon government) the Paris Peace Accords were signed on 27 January 1973. For the United States, the Vietnam War was over.|$|E

2500|$|During November 1939, Halder conspired with General Brauchitsch. Halder {{declared}} that he would support Brauchitsch {{if he were to}} try to curtail Hitler's plans for further expansion of the war, but Brauchitsch declined (the so-called Zossen Conspiracy). Brauchitsch and Halder had decided to overthrow Hitler after the latter had fixed [...] "X-day" [...] for the invasion of France for 12 November 1939, an invasion that both officers believed to be doomed to failure. During a meeting with Hitler on 5 November, Brauchitsch had attempted to talk Hitler into putting off [...] "X-day" [...] by saying that morale in the German Army was <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> it was in 1918. This statement enraged Hitler, who then harshly berated Brauchitsch for incompetence. After that meeting, both Halder and Brauchitsch told Carl Friedrich Goerdeler that overthrowing Hitler was simply something that they could not do, and that he should find other officers if that was what he really wanted to do. Equally important, following heavy snowstorms, on 7 November 1939 Hitler put off [...] "X-Day" [...] until further notice, removing the reason that had most motivated Brauchitsch and Halder to consider overthrowing Hitler.

Attention would be deviated from the content of research, and intrinsic motivation, which is essential for good research, would be crowded out.
