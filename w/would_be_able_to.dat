50|$|Any single discipline’s {{account of}} {{behavioural}} development across {{the life span}} <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> express all aspects of this theoretical framework.

This combination of disciplines <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> delineate the source and mechanisms associated with age-graded, history-graded, and nonnormative influences that one discipline, such as psychology, would find quite difficult to approach.

5|$|Blount called Hout and Petersen to {{apologize}} on September 5. Kelly {{participated in the}} calls.

50|$|During pre-Clovis and Clovis occupations, local hunters <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> find {{bountiful}} hunting.

5|$|Even without {{managerial}} manipulation, quotas {{were very}} often low {{and easy to}} overfulfill. Quotas had been lowered during the Second World War so that new workers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fulfill their output expectations; in industries such as engineering, it was common for workers to double their basic pay through bonuses.|$|E
5|$|G. minor {{is unusual}} because it {{frequently}} is found with embryonic skeletons of the enantiornithine bird Gobipipus. These embryos have well-developed wings, which suggest they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fly very soon after hatching, unlike most modern birds.|$|E

5|$|Marx {{longed to}} return to his {{economic}} studies, as he had left these studies in 1844 and had been preoccupied with other projects over the last thirteen years.

5|$|This Extended Range Nike Zeus, or Zeus EX for short, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> provide {{protection}} over a wider area, {{reducing the number}} of bases needed to provide full-country defense.

5|$|A {{southern}} O-Bahn proposal {{attracted the}} most attention and {{has been the subject}} of various studies and Parliamentary Committees as to its viability since 1996. The rail route through Adelaide's far south is off-centre, without the large catchment area of a more central transport route.

5|$|After the 2014 race {{had been}} held at a resurfaced circuit, causing the teams to fight with the soft tyre choice by Pirelli, speculations arose if drivers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{challenge}} the eleven-year old track record set by Rubens Barrichello in 2004. However, practice showed that lap times actually slowed due to changes to the kerbs, forcing the drivers {{to stay away from}} the insides of the corners. Pirelli chose the soft and medium compounds for the event.|$|E
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E

5|$|An {{unprecedented}} {{event was}} {{the visit of}} Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who arrived incognito in Rome on March 6 and was allowed to enter the conclave.

5|$|As of October2014, Caltrans had {{considered}} relinquishing {{the eastern part}} of SR54 from the SR94 junction up to the El Cajon city limits to the County of San Diego.

This action did sufficient damage that she retreated downriver, forcing André to return to New York overland. Arnold wrote out passes for André so that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pass through the lines, and also gave him plans for West Point.|$|E
