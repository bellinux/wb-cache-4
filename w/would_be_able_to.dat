50|$|Any single disciplineâ€™s {{account of}} {{behavioural}} development across {{the life span}} <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> express all aspects of this theoretical framework.

This combination of disciplines <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> delineate the source and mechanisms associated with age-graded, history-graded, and nonnormative influences that one discipline, such as psychology, would find quite difficult to approach. The field of psychology <b>would</b> only <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> provide a partial representation of human development from conception to death.|$|R

5|$|Blount called Hout and Petersen to {{apologize}} on September 5. Kelly {{participated in the}} calls.

50|$|During pre-Clovis and Clovis occupations, local hunters <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> find {{bountiful}} hunting. Game {{would have}} included mastodon, tapir, ground sloth, deer, giant beaver, and horse (Chandler 2001a).

Einstein's remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.|$|E
5|$|Even without {{managerial}} manipulation, quotas {{were very}} often low {{and easy to}} overfulfill. Quotas had been lowered during the Second World War so that new workers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fulfill their output expectations; in industries such as engineering, it was common for workers to double their basic pay through bonuses.|$|E
5|$|G. minor {{is unusual}} because it {{frequently}} is found with embryonic skeletons of the enantiornithine bird Gobipipus. These embryos have well-developed wings, which suggest they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fly very soon after hatching, unlike most modern birds.|$|E

5|$|Marx {{longed to}} return to his {{economic}} studies, as he had left these studies in 1844 and had been preoccupied with other projects over the last thirteen years.

5|$|This Extended Range Nike Zeus, or Zeus EX for short, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> provide {{protection}} over a wider area, {{reducing the number}} of bases needed to provide full-country defense.

5|$|A {{southern}} O-Bahn proposal {{attracted the}} most attention and {{has been the subject}} of various studies and Parliamentary Committees as to its viability since 1996. The rail route through Adelaide's far south is off-centre, without the large catchment area of a more central transport route.

Former Mayor of Milwaukee, Frank Zeidler, was elected the first national chairperson of the party. Zeidler also helped re-organizing the party structure during its early years.

5|$|After the 2014 race {{had been}} held at a resurfaced circuit, causing the teams to fight with the soft tyre choice by Pirelli, speculations arose if drivers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{challenge}} the eleven-year old track record set by Rubens Barrichello in 2004. However, practice showed that lap times actually slowed due to changes to the kerbs, forcing the drivers {{to stay away from}} the insides of the corners. Pirelli chose the soft and medium compounds for the event.|$|E
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E

5|$|An {{unprecedented}} {{event was}} {{the visit of}} Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who arrived incognito in Rome on March 6 and was allowed to enter the conclave.

5|$|As of October2014, Caltrans had {{considered}} relinquishing {{the eastern part}} of SR54 from the SR94 junction up to the El Cajon city limits to the County of San Diego.

This action did sufficient damage that she retreated downriver, forcing AndrÃ© to return to New York overland. Arnold wrote out passes for AndrÃ© so that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pass through the lines, and also gave him plans for West Point.|$|E
