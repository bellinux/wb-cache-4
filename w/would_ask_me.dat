500|$|Morrison {{returned}} to the A studios between June and August to record the remaining six tracks that featured on the album. For this second session Dahaud Shaar filled the role of engineer, though Shaar did not remember Morrison giving the job to him: [...] "Elliot {{thought he was going}} to be the co-producer, but then again I never saw him calling takes or asking people to change parts ... I didn't consider myself co-producer. Van <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> questions and I would give him answers, but it was never a defined role." [...] Morrison felt unsatisfied with some of the final recordings, and notably reworked the song [...] "Street Choir" [...] shortly before studio work concluded.|$|E
500|$|In Moonwalk (1988), Jackson {{said his}} {{relationship}} with Shields was [...] "romantically serious for a while." [...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together. The suggestions were met with disapproval from Shields, who felt {{such a move would}} have [...] "divided [...] life too much". She recalled: [...] "There were times when he <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to marry him, and I would say, 'You have {{me for the rest of}} your life, you don’t need to marry me, I’m going to go on...have my own marriage and my own kids, and you’ll always have me.' I think it made him relax. He didn’t want to lose things that meant something to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Etheridge {{agreed to}} write An Inconvenient Truths theme song, [...] "I Need to Wake Up" [...] after viewing Gore's slide show. [...] "I was so honored he <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to {{contribute}} to a project that is so powerful and so important, I felt such a huge responsibility," [...] she said. [...] "Then I went, 'What am I going to write? What am I going to say?' [...] " [...] Etheridge's former partner, Tammy Lynn Michaels, told her: [...] "Write what you feel, because that's what people are going to feel." [...] Of Etheridge's commitment to the project, Gore said, [...] "Melissa is a rare soul who gives {{a lot of time and}} effort to causes in which she strongly believes." [...] Etheridge received the 2006 Academy Award for Best Original Song for [...] "I Need to Wake Up." [...] Upon receiving the award, she noted in her acceptance speech: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No;--I would not. Nor <b>would</b> he <b>ask</b> <b>me.</b> I {{will tell}} you what will be his lot in life,--if he escapes from the present danger." ...|$|R

500|$|In the end, the Summit Series {{conclusively}} {{proved that}} {{the gap between the}} best Canadian NHL players and the top national teams of Europe (USSR, Czechoslovakia, Sweden) was much narrower than most observers {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic had anticipated. The Swedish national team coach Billy Harris (a former NHL pro with the Toronto Maple Leafs) later recalled that [...] "the (Swedish) media <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me,</b> 'do you see even one Swedish player who could possibly have a chance in the National Hockey League?' I answered, 'No, I see 14 of them!'" [...] The success of the 1972 Summit Series would lead to the development of the Canada Cup ice hockey world championship tournament open to both pros and amateurs, starting in 1976. It also led to regular series of games between Soviet and NHL clubs, known as the Super Series. By the 1980s, an increasing number of players were former members of the Swedish or Czechoslovak national teams. The top Soviet players were finally allowed to sign contracts with NHL clubs in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the USSR crumbled.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1877, Alice {{returned}} from India and removed the children from Lorne Lodge. Kipling remembers, [...] "Often and often afterwards, the beloved Aunt <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> why I had never told any one how I was being treated. Children tell little more than animals, for what comes to them they accept as eternally established. Also, badly-treated children have a clear notion {{of what they are}} likely to get if they betray the secrets of a prison-house before they are clear of it".|$|E
2500|$|I said to him, 'Commander of the Believers, {{was there}} some matter that troubled you this night?' And he said, 'Yes, I saw how I was {{occupied}} while governing {{the affairs of the}} community, all its black sheep and its white sheep, and I remembered the stranger, beggared and straying, and the poor and the needy, and the prisoners in captivity, and all like them in the far places of the earth, and I realised that God Most High <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> about all of them, and I (Umar) would testify about them, and I feared that I should find no excuse when I was with God, and no defence with me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The weary will! If {{you knew}} how I hated the subject you <b>would</b> not <b>ask</b> <b>me.</b> But {{you must not}} think I hate it because it has given me nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{there is}} {{anything}} within my power which I can do for you, Victor," [...] she said, [...] "it will make me very happy. You <b>would</b> not <b>ask</b> <b>me,</b> I know, unless--unless----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; O'Connor {{promised that}} he <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> for <b>me,</b> {{as soon as}} I could speak the language, so I stuck at it hard; and now, you see, I have got my reward." ...|$|R
2500|$|... “Although she {{was well}} over forty, she had lost none of her high spirits; she was kind and affectionate, but her {{eccentric}} and despotic nature made her rather formidable. When she heard that I {{was going to marry}} her niece, she took me in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where I was staying, and sat reading the papers in my room while I dressed. If I happened to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. I never had a moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually slept through the first act of a play, and then woke up with a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished to go somewhere else. We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on a chair at the door of her box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered. If by chance, she was awake and felt a draft, she <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to bring her such or such a number. I could have put up with all this but unfortunately she had a passion for dancing. At midnight, now wide awake, she would drag me to a night club where she danced till dawn.”The diplomat Maurice Paléologue wrote on 14 October 1913, [...] "Although she is fifty-three, she lives openly with an Argentinian blackguard, dances at Magic City with all comers till two in the morning and associates with the scum of the aerodromes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You <b>would</b> have <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> these an hour ago," [...] {{said the}} lord, [...] "had not your very soul been under Chaubert's covered dishes. You remembered King's affairs will keep cool, and entre-mets must be eaten hot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I couldn't do that," [...] Ned said, [...] "though I do feel awfully {{tired and}} done up; but your {{brothers}} <b>would</b> be <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> questions and wondering why I didn't go home. I {{could not stand}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} it," [...] said Rose earnestly; [...] "for I would do {{anything}} that a woman might venture, to benefit my dear, dear uncle, and I feel assured that you <b>would</b> not <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to do anything wrong or unwomanly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me,</b> you know. I am bothered {{out of my}} life by ever so many things, and now {{he comes}} and adds his botheration." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{a little}} afraid of that," [...] replied Agatha slowly. [...] "What makes the {{situation}} more difficult is that {{he told me he}} <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> again." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{these were}} the very pair I now had at sea; the sailors made {{a great deal of}} fun of them, and were all the time calling on each other to [...] "ftoig" [...] them; and they <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to lend them a button or two, by way of a joke; and then they <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> if I was not a soldier. Showing very plainly that they had no idea that my pantaloons were a very genteel pair, made in the height of the {{sporting}} fashion, and copied from my cousin's, who was a young man of fortune and drove a tilbury.|$|E
60|$|Had he {{known that}} I met a girl under {{it three times}} a week, he <b>would</b> not have <b>asked</b> <b>me.</b> I bowed once more without remark.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My generous Julia! You are of {{the gifted}} few who {{really know how to}} confer a favour! Another woman <b>would</b> have <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> why I wanted the villa--you give it unreservedly. So {{delicate}} an unwillingness to intrude on a secret reminds me that the secret should now be yours!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{lay down}} beside him, {{but not to}} sleep. I was overjoyed with my good fortune. Now I could enter El Obeid boldly and, the wounded man being a native there, no {{questions}} <b>would</b> be <b>asked</b> <b>me.</b> I had a house to go to, and shelter, for the present.|$|R
60|$|Another pause full {{of mistrust}} followed. Necessity, they say, is mother of invention, but fear, too, is not barren of ingenious suggestions. And I {{was afraid he}} <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> point-blank for news of my other self.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! what {{opportunities}} are wasted on some people. Wouldn't I have had fun! But {{of course he}} saw you were a poor little not-come-out thing, and never spoke to you. Oh! if Miss Charlecote <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to London!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Roy! I feared just that. It haunts me. Carmichael {{asked me}} {{to let him go}} pick a fight with Beasley. Asked me, just as he <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> about his work! I was shocked. And now you say Dale--and you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pathfinder {{knows that}} a warrior can have shame. The father <b>would</b> have <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> for his daughter, and I {{could not give}} her to him. I sent the Dew-of-June for the canoe, and no one spoke to the woman. A Tuscarora woman would not be free in {{speaking}} to strange men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} that was your motive," [...] said Beechnut, [...] "in asking. If you had wished to know my opinion in order to correct {{yourself}} of the fault, you <b>would</b> have <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> some time privately. I think that your motive was a wish to get a triumph over Malleville." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, you distort my words. Then I shall say no more. You {{may not see}} me again, madame. Is {{there no}} {{question}} which you <b>would</b> wish to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> before I go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are cases}} enough here, Watson," [...] said he, {{looking at me}} with mischievous eyes. [...] "I think that if you knew all that I had in this box you <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to pull some out instead of putting others in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "that wouldn't do. She {{has kept}} {{account of the}} time, you may be sure, and she <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> at once if I was inquiring in your behalf, and I should {{have to tell her}} the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{if the old}} king, Panda, should {{chance to}} die, she <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me,</b> which of his sons did I think would succeed him--Umbelazi or Cetewayo, or another? Or, {{if he did not}} chance to die, which of them would he name his heir? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] said McMurdo sternly. [...] "It {{was only}} last night, {{as you know}} well, that I swore good faith to our Bodymaster. <b>Would</b> you be <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> to break my oath?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} I can forgive you for not telling me before," [...] said Sara steadily. [...] "That is what I have to forgive--not your {{speaking}} at last, {{even if it}} was dragged from you against your will. Did you think I would make you such a very poor wife, Jeff, that you <b>would</b> not <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to marry you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} an {{interest}} of some sort in Mrs. Beauly," [...] he said, [...] "or you <b>would</b> not have <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> about her. Is it the interest of a friend, or the interest of an enemy?" ...|$|R
