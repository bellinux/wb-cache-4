It is determined that under conditions of external uncertainty it’s reasonable to conduct the strategic planning of entities using the life cycle models of organization and planning on the basis of disclosure. Any organization has to react in a flexible way upon external calls applying the cognitive knowledge about its own business model of development and the ability to intensify internal <b>working</b> <b>reserves.</b> The article determines that in the process of long-term business activity planning managers use traditional approaches based on the familiar facts and conditions that the present tendencies will not be subjected to essential changes in the future. Planning a new risky business one has to act when prerequisites and assumptions are predominant over knowledge. The author proves that under such conditions the powerful tool of enterprise strategic development may be such a well-known approach as “planning on the basis of disclosure”. The approach suggested helps take into account numerous factors of uncertainty of external environment that makes the strategic planning process maximum adaptable to the conditions of venture business development...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is a set of {{problems}} concerning international and foreign exchange banking reserves in national economy. The <b>working</b> of <b>reserves</b> in bath the gold currency system and the managed currency system has been presented in this paper. Metallic currency serves a double purpose in the gold currency system, namely as an internal reserve and a foreign exchange reserve. The internal reserve is a regulator of money circulation. The foreign exchange reserve governs the equilibrium of the balance of payment. Next the <b>working</b> of <b>reserves</b> in the managed currency system has been examined. In that system there is a division of internal and international tasks in the sphere of reserves. The functions of foreign exchange reserves have been described. They consist in guaranteeing international liquidity and currency stability. Next the structure of foreign exchange reserves has been described. Distinction between owned and borrowed reserves has been drawn. The role of gold, of key currencies and international credits has been analyzed. The importance of the new international reserve unit has been emphasized, i. e. the special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund. The problem of cost of keeping foreign exchange reserves and the rule of forming them have been discussed as well. The study of foreign exchange reserves has been supplemented with an analysis of reserve policy in the socialistic economy.

40|$|Men in <b>reserve</b> {{focuses on}} <b>working</b> class {{civilian}} men who, {{as a result}} of <b>working</b> in <b>reserved</b> occupations, were exempt from enlistment in the armed forces. It uses fifty six newly conducted oral history interviews as well as autobiographies, visual sources and existing archived interviews to explore how this group articulated their wartime experiences and how they positioned themselves in relation to the hegemonic discourse of military masculinity. It considers the range of masculine identities circulating amongst civilian male workers during the war and investigates the extent to which reserved workers draw upon these identities when recalling their wartime selves. It argues that the Second World War was capable of challenging civilian masculinities, positioning the civilian man below that of the 'soldier hero' while, simultaneously, reinforcing them by bolstering the capacity to provide and to earn high wages, frequently in risky and dangerous work, all which were key markers of masculinity...|$|R
