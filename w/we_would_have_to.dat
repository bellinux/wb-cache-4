5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{know a great deal}} more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E

However, {{if we look at}} one of these product terms in more detail we come to a very interesting result.|$|E
25|$|In the evening, Crosby did {{the whole}} show before an {{audience}}. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take out the show version and put {{in one of the}} rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.|$|E

But the moral idea of equality does not depend on matters of fact such as intelligence, physical strength, or moral capacity. Equality therefore cannot be grounded on the outcome of scientific investigations into the intelligence of nonhumans. All that matters is whether they can suffer.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} improvement {{can be made}} with an index. In the example above, initial disk reads narrowed the search range by a factor of two. That can be improved substantially by creating an auxiliary index that contains the first record in each disk block (sometimes called a sparse index). This auxiliary index would be 1% {{of the size of the}} original database, but it can be searched more quickly. Finding an entry in the auxiliary index would tell us which block to search in the main database; after searching the auxiliary index, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> search only that one block of the main database—at a cost of one more disk read. The index would hold 10,000 entries, so it would take at most 14 comparisons. Like the main database, the last 6 or so comparisons in the aux index would be on the same disk block. The index could be searched in about 8 disk reads, and the desired record could be accessed in 9 disk reads.|$|E
500|$|ILM filmed starships using {{motion control}} for timed and {{computer-assisted}} model movement. The ship models required multiple camera passes because {{different parts of}} the ship and its lights were filmed at different exposure levels. The Excelsior required eight passes to supplement the main [...] "beauty pass", the Enterprise six. ILM could have combined passes with multiple exposures, but not without risk; [...] "If anything got out of synch, or somehow we dropped a frame, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> reshoot—and then you're stuck.

2500|$|Gabriel {{was shot}} on a JVC GY-HD101E digital video camera. Abbess praised the JVC’s versatility, small size {{and its ability}} to shoot at night. Another crucial {{advantage}} to digital video was its cheapness: [...] "Ten years ago, we couldn’t have made this movie, because <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> shoot on film.

For his role in planning the invasion {{he was awarded the}} Legion of Merit with [...] "V" [...] device. He also was awarded the Purple Heart for the combat wounds he suffered {{during the course of the}} campaign. Ten years after the assault, Shoup remarked of the operation, [...] "there was never a doubt in the minds of those ashore what the final outcome of the battle for Tarawa would be. There was for some seventy-six hours, however, considerable haggling with the enemy over the exact price <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay." [...] In 1968, he returned to Tarawa to dedicate a memorial to the battle and to the American and Japanese troops who had died there.|$|E
500|$|By 1972, Deep Purple had {{achieved}} considerable commercial success in Japan, including several hit singles, so {{it made sense}} to tour there. Three dates were booked; the Festival Hall, Osaka on 11 and 12 May, and the Budokan, Tokyo on 16 August, though these were later changed to the 15 and 16 August, and 17 August respectively due to an earlier US tour being rescheduled. The dates sold out almost immediately, and consequently the Japanese arm of the band's label, Warner Bros. Records, wanted to record the tour for a live album to be released in the country. The band eventually agreed to the idea, but insisted {{if it was going to}} be released, they wanted it to be done properly. Gillan recalled, [...] "we said <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> OK the equipment, we wanted to use our own engineer and we would have the last say on whether the tapes were released". The band enlisted producer Martin Birch, who had worked on previous studio albums, to record the shows onto an 8-track recorder so they could subsequently be mixed.|$|E
500|$|On 1 August, {{before leaving}} the US to take up his post in Mogadishu, Ambassador Bishop visited United States Central Command—the {{military}} command for the Middle East and northeast Africa—where {{he spent most of}} the day with its commander, Gen.Norman Schwarzkopf. Ambassador Bishop, aware of the ongoing strife, believed [...] "the odds were better than even that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances." [...] Ambassador Bishop understood from his past experiences in Beirut and Liberia the importance of being prepared to deal with emergencies and spent the afternoon working with military experts to review the embassy's Emergencies and Evacuation (E) plan until he was [...] "satisfied...that [...] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from Mogadishu and was prepared to do that." [...] In its analysis of Operation Eastern Exit, the Center for Naval Analyses cited the Ambassador Bishop's previous experience and [...] "clear understanding of his role" [...] in the operation as one of the reasons Operation Eastern Exit went so well.|$|E

500|$|Aware of the {{violence}} {{going on in the}} Somali countryside, Ambassador Bishop felt [...] "the odds were better than even that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances." [...] On August 1, Ambassador Bishop visited United States Central Command—the military command for the Middle East and Northeast Africa—where he worked with military experts to review the embassy's Emergencies and Evacuation (E) plan until he was [...] "satisfied...that [...] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from Mogadishu and was prepared to do that." [...] A few hours after his visit, Iraq invaded Kuwait. The US was mobilizing assets for a response when Ambassador Bishop arrived in Mogadishu on September 6. The primary interest of the Ambassador was to maintain the US military's permission and access to airfields and ports in Mogadishu and Berbera, which the US had negotiated in 1979. This was especially important given the mobilization for intervention in Kuwait, Somalia's strategic location near the Arabian Peninsula and the mouth of the Red Sea, and because Saudi Arabia would not allow US troops on their soil. The embassy was also home to a large number of USAID staff, although the spread of unrest into the countryside was making their work increasingly difficult.|$|E
500|$|In September 1978, Joy Division {{made their}} {{television}} debut performing [...] "Shadowplay" [...] on So It Goes, with an introduction by Wilson {{in which he}} misidentified Sumner, and not Hook, as being from Salford. In October, Joy Division contributed two tracks recorded with producer Martin Hannett to the compilation double-7" [...] EP A Factory Sample, the first release by Tony Wilson's record label, Factory Records. In the NME review of the EP, Paul Morley hailed the band as [...] "the missing link between Elvis Presley and [...] the Banshees". Joy Division joined Factory's roster, after buying themselves {{out of the deal}} with RCA. Rob Gretton was made a partner of the label so as to represent the interests of the band. On 27 December, Ian Curtis had his first recognisable epileptic episode. During the ride home after a show at the Hope and Anchor pub in London, Curtis experienced an epileptic seizure and was taken to a hospital. In spite of his illness, Joy Division's career progressed. He appeared on the cover of 13 January 1979 issue of the NME following the persistence of music journalist Paul Morley. That month the band recorded their first session for BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. According to Deborah Curtis, [...] "Sandwiched in between these two important landmarks was the realization that Ian's illness was something <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn to accommodate".|$|E
