They made light {{work of the}} opposition, winning by three goals and once more set a unique record: David O'Leary's strike meant all 10 regular outfield players each had scored for Arsenal during the season. In his match report for The Times, Stuart Jones assessed: [...] "Having {{experienced}} northing but victory {{since the end of}} August, Arsenal are <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> almost too much belief," [...] and felt complacency was the only issue preventing the club from reaching the quarter-finals.|$|E

Alfred is an eccentric character, often <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> his hat on fire, and bringing over his and Victor's great-grandfather's skull. He is a clumsy character too, mistaking the table-cloth for a napkin and dropping the entire contents of the table {{all over the floor}} when he stands up, and breaking a mirror {{in the middle of the}} night after mistaking his own reflection for a burglar. Victor starts to warm to Alfred towards the end of his visit, but Alfred leaves early the next day after finding an unpleasant message about him that Victor had accidentally recorded on a dictaphone.

500|$|Fond of quoting Ai, Wong {{believes}} that art and politics are indissociable, {{and that no}} art is completely without political connotation. Wong sees art {{as one of the}} organic elements in the mix of political movements, playing an indirect and auxiliary role. He has variously participated in the annual 1 July protest marches riding in a pink armoured personnel carrier, <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> a facsimile washing machine on his head, and guiding a 10-foot red robot he created. For the march on 1 July 2014, Wong created the “Warning Squad", where he and several people dressed as police officers holding parody banners inspired by those increasingly seen used by police officers at protests. His signs included “Love the Party” – echoing the CPC slogan [...] “Love the country, love the Party” [...] (愛國愛黨) – “Fake Commie”; “Party-State” referring to the one-party state within China; “Reddening” referring to the gradual infiltration of the communist ethos into Hong Kong; “Land Grabbing” referring to the land acquisition for development in the Northeast New Territories.|$|E
500|$|Breakaways {{critical}} acclaim also enabled Clarkson to also earn critical respect, {{particularly from the}} rock and indie music scene, who had looked down upon American Idol contestants. In his memoir, Davis recalled a meeting with Simon Fuller and Sony BMG President Charles Goldstuck, where Fuller acknowledged how the worldwide success of Breakaway had validated American Idol itself. The popularity of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] among the rock community also resulted in various cover versions by rock acts, such as A Day to Remember, Ted Leo, and Tokyo Police Club. Clarkson herself recalled, [...] "It's ridiculous how well that song was received by hard rockers, by indie people. I was <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> {{a friend of mine}} and this hard-rock guy {{came up to me and}} was like, 'I look stupid, but I tell my friends I love this song.' People at concerts are like, 'That's my guilty pleasure. I don't mean to be mean, but I didn't want to like the American Idol girl.' But they love that song, and it kind of won them over." ...|$|E

He constantly teases Yossarian asking him {{if he wants to}} know why, to which Yossarian invariably says [...] "yes". Orr never gives any straightforward explanation for this other than he wants big cheeks and to detract from the peculiarity of this he keeps rubber balls in his hands. As he explains the latter, [...] "Every time someone asked me why I was <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> crab apples in my cheeks, I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> <b>with,</b> not crab apples, and that they were in my hands, not my cheeks. It was a good story. But I never knew if it got across or not, since it's pretty tough to make people understand you when you're talking to them with two crab apples in your cheeks." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{few days}} later Bakiyev commented from his {{hometown}} of Osh {{that he would not}} resign and called for the UN to send troops to the country to restore order. A rally in his hometown was followed by another bigger rally giving him support in his quest to return to the seat of government. In response the interim Interior Minister said an arrest warrant would be issued for him while his immunity was removed. On 13 April, Bakiyev said he would resign should his security and that of his family and entourage be guaranteed. He said [...] "In what case would I resign? First of all, they should guarantee that in Kyrgyzstan there are no more people <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> weapons, and no seizures or redistribution of property. Also, I need to know that my own security and the security of members of my family and those close to me will be assured." [...] The interim government said it could only guarantee his security should he resign and leave the country. Tension mounted in the country when the interim government threatened to hunt down Bakiyev while simultaneously offering an olive branch should he go to into exile. In response Bakiyev said [...] "Let them try to seize me. Let them try to kill me. I believe this will lead to such a great deal of bloodshed which no one will be able to justify." [...] During a nuclear summit in Washington the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev suggested Kyrgyzstan was {{in the throes of a}} civil war and that it could turn into a [...] "second Afghanistan" [...] if the political deadlock was not resolved.

2500|$|Following {{the loss}} of his IBO belt, Booth spent almost two years away from the ring as he {{struggled}} with an alcohol addiction. Speaking about the matter in 2010 Booth said [...] "I took time off boxing because I was too drunk...No manager would look at me and all the doors were shut. I'd go on these mad binges and spend loads of money." [...] After earning £10,000 in his fight with Damaen Kelly, Booth had spent the money on a combination of drink and drugs with the money disappearing within six weeks. Speaking about his addiction, Booth said that drink had always been a part of family life but the suicide of his sister Deana had hit him particularly hard. Booth said, [...] "It was too young to die. She was a funloving girl. I don’t know why she did it. She got run over when she was young. She’d had a tragic time. It mentally disturbed me." [...] Two weeks later, following the tragedy, Booth fought and beat the Bulgarian boxer Dimitar Alipiev whilst drunk, saying, [...] "I wanted to fight because I didn’t {{know what to do with}} myself after Deana died. I was drinking on the day of the fight. I was numb. I was in no pain. I just didn’t care. It was the only time in my life I didn’t care." [...] It was Booth's 12th professional contest. Booth said that he also fell into bad company: [...] "I was in parks and dosshouses. I was British champion but <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> drunks and thinking they were mates. I’d get up, drink cider and top up during the day. Sometimes, I’d get a bottle of cheap vodka and walk around with it in my pocket." [...] Eventually Booth checked into an alcohol clinic and begun the process of getting clean: [...] "It frightened me and I wanted to stop, but it was only when my body rejected the drink that I found the courage. My stomach packed in. I was sicking blood every morning." [...] He began training once more with trainer Tony Harris and began to rebuild his boxing career despite occasionally relapsing into drink. Eventually he gave up drinking altogether, saying, [...] "I’m one of those who has to be abstinent, because one drink isn’t going to do anything for me except start it all again." ...|$|E
