30|$|In literature, {{there are}} two main {{different}} definitions of the FH capacity [3]: The first one states that FH capacity <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> as the <b>maximum</b> sum data rate transmitted on each FH.

On the other hand, the second definition states that FH capacity <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> as <b>maximum</b> number of users that can be served on each FH. In this paper, we adopt the second definition.|$|R
