Of the drivers' opinions, Stoddart writes: [...] "While I cannot testify that each and every driver agreed with what we were proposing, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> with certainty is that no driver disagreed." [...] The Ferrari drivers expressed no opinion in the matter, leaving the decision to Todt, who was not present. The nine team principals who were present then resolved that, unless they and the FIA could {{come to a decision}} {{in the best interest of}} the sport, they would not participate in the race.|$|E
500|$|In We Are X, Gene Simmons {{claims that}} if the X Japan members were [...] "born in America or England and sang in English, they might be the biggest band in the world." [...] Due to band's various misfortunes with the suicide of band members, Toshi's {{brainwashing}} and lack of overseas success, X Japan have been described in The Times as: [...] "The world's unluckiest band", {{in an article published}} on Friday the 13th October, 2017. When asked in an interview if the band was unlucky, Yoshiki answered: [...] "Kinda? I mean, you know, with so much crazy drama that has happened over the years. But at the same time, we have amazing fans around the world so I can't say 'the world's unluckiest band', but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> is 'the world's luckiest band'.

500|$|During {{the early}} hours of the event, [...] the Foreign Minister of Ivory Coast (the host country of ECOWAS) Daniel Kablan Duncan said that the [...] "information {{indicates}} to us that there is a coup underway. ECOWAS formally and rigorously condemns such an attempted coup d'etat," [...] he added that [...] "it's sad that after the example of Senegal, where the elections finished so well, that we have, after Mali, a new forceful intervention in Guinea-Bissau. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> at this moment is that...the situation won't be accepted by ECOWAS." [...] ECOWAS Commission President Kadré Désiré Ouedraogo issued a statement that read: [...] "The commission firmly denounces this latest incursion by the military into politics and unreservedly condemns the irresponsible act, which has once more demonstrated their penchant to maintain Guinea-Bissau as a failed state." [...] ECOWAS later decided to send a contingent of military personnel in order to provide security. The delegation, which would also include civilians, would be led by Guinean President Alpha Condé. ECOWAS also said the election runoff should go ahead. ECOWAS constitutes a contact group, chaired by Nigeria and comprising delegations from Benin, Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea, Senegal and Togo, to coordinate its efforts at resolving the crisis. ECOWAS also had a stanby force to fill a vacuum that could be left by the departing MISSANG force, as well as considering International Criminal Court recommendations.|$|E

6000|$|There was no {{plantation}} {{about the}} house, {{not even a}} shade tree or cultivated plant of any description, but only some large corrales, or enclosures, for the cattle, of which there were six or seven thousand head on the land. The absence of shade and greenery gave the place a desolate, uninviting aspect, but if I was ever to have any authority here this would soon be changed. The Mayordomo, or manager, Don Policarpo Santierra de Peñalosa, which, roughly done into English, means Polycarp of the Holy Land abounding in Slippery Rocks, {{proved to be a}} very pleasant, affable person. He welcomed me with that quiet Oriental politeness which is never cold and never effusive, and then perused the letter from Doña Isidora. Finally he said, [...] "I am willing, my friend, to supply you with all the conveniences procurable at this elevation; and, for the rest, you know, doubtless, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> to you. A ready understanding requires few words.

60|$|I do not know, now, {{what all}} the edifices are, but there are churches, more than one, and palaces, and the reader can find their names {{in any of the}} guidebooks. If I were buying piazzas in Rome I should begin with the Navona, but there are enough to suit all purses and tastes. The fountains would be thrown in, I suppose, along with the churches and palaces; but I really never inquired, and, in fact, not having carried out my plan of visiting them all, I am in no {{position}} to advise intending purchasers. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> is that {{if you are in a}} hurry to inspect, that kind of property, and in immediate need of a piazza, you cannot do better than take the wagon for touring Rome. In two days you can visit every piazza worth having, including the Piazza di Spagna, where there is a fountain in the form of a marble galley in which you can embark for any fairyland you like, through the Via del Babuino and the Piazza del Popolo. Come to think of it, I am not so sure but I would as soon have the Piazza del Popolo as the Piazza Navona. If the fountains are not so fine, they are still very fine, and the Pincian Hill overtops one side of the place, with foliaged drives and gardened walks descending into it.|$|E

60|$|A more purposed {{sight of}} all this will, of course, supply any defects of chance, though I myself always liked chance {{encounters}} with the monuments of the past. I had constantly cherished a remembrance of the nobly beautiful facade which {{is all that is}} left of the Temple of Neptune, and I meant deliberately to revisit it if I could find out where it was. A kind fortuity befriended me when one day, driving through the little piazza where it lurks behind the Piazza Co-lonna, I looked up, and there, in awe-striking procession, stood the mighty antique columns sustaining the entablature of mediaeval stucco with their fluted marble. I could not say why their poor, defaced, immortal grandeur should have always so affected me, for I do not know that my veneration was due it more than many other fragments of the past; but no arch or pillar of them all seems so impressive, so pathetic. To make the reader the greatest possible confidence, I will own that I passed five times through the Piazza Colonna to my tailor's in the next piazza (at Rome your tailor wishes you to try on till you have almost worn your new clothes out in the ordeal) before I realized that the Column of Marcus Aurelius was not the more famous Column of Trajan. There is, in fact, a strong family likeness between these columns, both being bandaged round from bottom to top with the tale of the imperial achievements and having a general effect in common; but there is no brother or cousin to the dignity of that melancholy yet vigorous ruin of the Temple of Neptune, or anything that resembles it in the whole of ancient Rome. It survives having been a custom-house and being a stock-exchange without apparent ignominy, while one feels an incongruity, to say the least, in the Column of Marcus Aurelius looking down on the sign of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. Whether this is worse than for the Palazzo di Venezia to confront the American Express Company where it is housed {{on the other side of}} the piazza I cannot say. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> is that I believe the Temple of Neptune would have been superior to either fate; though I may be mistaken.|$|E
