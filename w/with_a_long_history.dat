Among the masters of the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.|$|E

Hemphill, who had worked with reformers in the campaigns that ultimately defeated the Republican organization in 1951, was a lawyer <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of involvement in Democratic politics. Unlike in the district attorney's race, the Democrats were united on the choice for city controller and Clark and Dilworth both publicly endorsed Hemphill. The result was a solid victory for the Democrats as Hemphill was elected by a thirteen-point margin.|$|E

In 1890 during Ali ibn Sa'id's reign, Zanzibar became a British protectorate, and although never formally under direct rule was considered part of the British Empire.|$|E

5|$|Several pivotal {{discoveries in}} biology {{were made by}} {{researchers}} using fungi as model organisms, that is, fungi that grow and sexually reproduce rapidly in the laboratory. For example, the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis was formulated by scientists using the bread mold Neurospora crassa to test their biochemical theories. Other important model fungi are Aspergillus nidulans and the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, each of which <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of use to investigate issues in eukaryotic cell biology and genetics, such as cell cycle regulation, chromatin structure, and gene regulation. Other fungal models have more recently emerged that address specific biological questions relevant to medicine, plant pathology, and industrial uses; examples include Candida albicans, a dimorphic, opportunistic human pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, a plant pathogen, and Pichia pastoris, a yeast widely used for eukaryotic protein production.|$|E
5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} as {{to whether}} Domnall was supported in his venture {{by the rest of}} the Uí Briain. Although it is possible that he enjoyed backing from Muirchertach himself, the fact that the Annals of the Four Masters states that Muirchertach had Domnall imprisoned three years before could be evidence that Domnall had made his move into the Isles without Muirchertach's consent. The annal-entry concerning Domnall's seizure of the Isles reveals that Domnall launched his campaign from northern Ireland, and a further entry in the same source shows that Dublin was occupied by Muirchertach for about three months, the very year of Domnall's campaign. These records appear to indicate that Domnall was aided in his undertaking in the Isles by Muirchertach's northern opponents, and that Muirchertach occupied the town as means to directly counter Domnall's campaign, and deny him any support from the Dubliners. In fact, Domnall may well have been supported in the Isles by Domnall Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain (died 1121), a northern monarch who was not only Muirchertach's principal rival, but the representative of a family <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of involvement in the region.|$|E

5|$|Born into {{an aristocratic}} Prussian family <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of {{military}} service, Manstein {{joined the army}} {{at a young age}} and saw service on Western Front and Eastern Front during the First World War (1914–18). He rose to the rank of captain {{by the end of the}} war and was active in the inter-war period helping Germany rebuild her armed forces. In September 1939, during the invasion of Poland at the beginning of the Second World War, he was serving as Chief of Staff to Gerd von Rundstedt's Army Group South. Adolf Hitler chose Manstein's strategy for the invasion of France of May 1940, a plan later refined by Franz Halder and other members of the OKH. Anticipating a firm Allied reaction should the main thrust of the invasion take place through the Netherlands, Manstein devised an innovative operation—later known as the Sichelschnitt ("sickle cut")—that called for an attack through the woods of the Ardennes and a rapid drive to the English Channel, thus cutting off the French and Allied armies in Belgium and Flanders. Attaining the rank of general at the end of the campaign, he was active in the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Siege of Sevastopol (1941–1942), and was promoted to field marshal on 1 July 1942. He also participated in the Siege of Leningrad.|$|E
