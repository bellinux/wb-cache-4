25|$|In 1998, Thierry Georges and {{his team}} at France Télécom R Centre, {{combining}} optical solitons of different wavelengths (<b>wavelength</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexing),</b> demonstrated a data transmission of 1 terabit per second (1,000,000,000,000 units of information per second).|$|E
25|$|Dense <b>wavelength</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexing</b> (DWDM) refers {{originally}} to optical signals multiplexed {{within the}} 1550nm band {{so as to}} leverage the capabilities (and cost) of erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), which are effective for wavelengths between approximately 1525–1565nm (C band), or 1570–1610nm (L band). EDFAs were originally developed to replace SONET/SDH optical-electrical-optical (OEO) re-generators, which they have made practically obsolete. EDFAs can amplify any optical signal in their operating range, regardless of the modulated bit rate. In terms of multi-wavelength signals, {{so long as the}} EDFA has enough pump energy available to it, it can amplify as many optical signals as can be multiplexed into its amplification band (though signal densities are limited by choice of modulation format). EDFAs therefore allow a single-channel optical link to be upgraded in bit rate by replacing only equipment at the ends of the link, while retaining the existing EDFA or series of EDFAs through a long haul route. Furthermore, single-wavelength links using EDFAs can similarly be upgraded to WDM links at reasonable cost. The EDFA's cost is thus leveraged across as many channels as can be multiplexed into the 1550nm band.|$|E
40|$|A multihop, <b>wavelength</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplex</b> (WDM) -based network, BanyanNet, is {{proposed}} for the realization of terabit lightwave networks. BanyanNet {{can be considered as}} the bi-directional equivalent of the popular ShuffieNet. Exploiting its represenation, we developed a fast, decentralized, bi-directional routing algorithm for BanyanNet. The performance of BanyanNet is compared with that of the ShuffieNet. A better performance in channel efficiency, total and user throughput is reported for BanyanNet.

40|$|The article {{describes}} a nonlinear phenomenon SPM (Self Phase Modulation), which {{occurs in the}} all-optical communications systems. In the 21 st century, the WDM (<b>Wavelength</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Multiplex)</b> system cannot be created without the software that simulates the system under real conditions. The most important WDM components include the EDFA (Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier), in which amplification occurs at all wavelengths.

2500|$|Later, SONET and SDH {{were adapted}} to combine carrier {{channels}} into groups {{that could be}} sent over optic fiber. The capacity of an optic fibre is often extended with <b>wavelength</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexing,</b> rather than rerigging new fibre. Rigging several fibres in the same structures as the first fibre is usually easy and inexpensive, and many fibre installations include unused spare [...] "dark fibre", [...] "dark wavelengths", and unused parts of the SONET frame, so-called [...] "virtual channels".|$|E
2500|$|WDM {{systems are}} divided into three {{different}} wavelength patterns, normal (WDM), coarse (CWDM) [...] and dense (DWDM). [...] Normal WDM (sometimes called BWDM) uses the two normal wavelengths 1310 and 1550 on one fiber. Coarse WDM provides up to 16 channels across multiple transmission windows of silica fibers. Dense <b>wavelength</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexing</b> (DWDM) uses the C-Band (1530nm-1565nm) transmission window but with denser channel spacing. Channel plans vary, but a typical DWDM system would use 40 channels at 100GHz spacing or 80 channels with 50GHz spacing. Some technologies are capable of 12.5GHz spacing (sometimes called ultra dense WDM). New amplification options (Raman amplification) enable {{the extension of the}} usable wavelengths to the L-band (1565nm-1625nm), more or less doubling these numbers.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{implementation}} of 32 × 40 Gbps free space optical (FSO) communication system is developed. Analysis is performed for return to zero (RZ) and non return to zero (NRZ) line codes for 1 km free space optic length. Motivation to the current analysis is to compare RZ and NRZ lines codes in <b>wavelength</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplex</b> communication system in free space optic channel and {{it is found that}} the NRZ line code is better than RZ code.

40|$|In <b>wavelength</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> (WDM) optical networks, intraband and/or {{interband}} crosstalk plays a {{major role}} in limiting practical implementation of an OXC subsystem. Again FIBER BRAGG GRATINGS (FBGs), due to their properties, are emerging as very important elements for both the optical fiber communication and sensing fields. The crosstalk sources are related to the different individual components of the OXC's. In this paper, an analytical model is established to evaluate the performance of an FBG-OC-based optical cross connect and proposed a novel scheme of transmission Fiber Bragg Grating for different wavelength separation and determine the BER and power penalty with optical <b>wavelength</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> cross-connect topologies at different bit rate...|$|R
50|$|Arrayed {{waveguide}} gratings (AWG) {{are commonly}} used as optical (de)multiplexers in <b>wavelength</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> (WDM) systems. These devices are capable of multiplexing {{a large number of}} wavelengths into a single optical fiber, thereby increasing the transmission capacity of optical networks considerably.|$|R
2500|$|Coarse <b>wavelength</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexing</b> (CWDM) in {{contrast}} to DWDM uses increased channel spacing to allow less sophisticated and thus cheaper transceiver designs. To provide 16 channels on a single fiber CWDM uses the entire frequency band spanning {{the second and third}} transmission window (1310/1550nm respectively) including both windows (minimum dispersion window and minimum attenuation window) but also the critical area where OH scattering may occur, recommending the use of OH-free silica fibers in case the wavelengths between second and third transmission windows are to be used. Avoiding this region, the channels 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61 remain and these are the most commonly used. [...] With OS2 fibers the water peak problem is overcome, and all possible 18 channels can be used.|$|E
