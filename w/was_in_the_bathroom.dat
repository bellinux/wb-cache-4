500|$|The {{goal was}} not {{reviewed}} immediately, so {{officials did not}} notice Hull's foot in the crease until minutes later. [...] After video reviews showed Hull's position, the goal was still upheld, leaving the Sabres infuriated. Hašek commented, [...] "Maybe [...] <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> Maybe he was sleeping. Maybe he doesn't know the rule." [...] The following season, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announced that video replays {{would no longer be}} used to judge if players are in the crease or not, {{and that it would be}} a judgment call by the officiating crew. After the season ended, Hašek contemplated retirement because of a combination of injuries and a desire to become more involved in his family life. The announcement stunned many of his teammates, particularly Mike Peca and Jason Woolley.|$|E
