Three dimensional profile instruments were {{used to measure the}} <b>wear</b> scar trace for variations of numerical data of two dimensional profiles. By using numerical algorithms, the <b>wear</b> volume measurements of <b>wear</b> profiles are to save considerable time and economical. A new mathematical method is issued for determining <b>wear</b> volumes in this study. The estimated results were precisely fitted as compared with other calculations for three dimensional estimations of <b>wear</b> volumes. <b>Wear</b> rate is a significant reference for considering the <b>wear</b> resistance of coatings.

Fretting <b>wear</b> {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate {{the effects of the}} contacting shapes of spacer grid springs on the <b>wear</b> behavior of a nuclear fuel rod in room temperature air and water. The main objective was to quantitatively compare the <b>wear</b> behavior of the nuclear fuel rod with the variation of the contacting spring shapes. The variation of the real <b>worn</b> area in the <b>wear</b> scar, the change in the <b>wear</b> volume and the maximum <b>wear</b> depth with the slip amplitude were calculated and measured through an optical micrometer and surface profilometry. The results of the <b>wear</b> tests showed that the <b>wear</b> volume and the maximum <b>wear</b> depth were sensitively affected by each spring shape with increasing slip amplitude and with a change of the test environment. From the analysis of the <b>wear</b> scar, it is possible to separate the size of the <b>wear</b> scar from the real <b>worn</b> area and the transferred one. In addition, we found that the <b>wear</b> volume has a linear relation with the real <b>worn</b> area rather than the size of the <b>wear</b> scar and this was only determined by using each spring shape even though the <b>wear</b> tests were carried out with different conditions. From the above results, it is possible to evaluate a <b>wear</b> resistant spring by using the correlation between the variation of the real <b>worn</b> area and the <b>wear</b> behavior at each spring shape...|$|R
