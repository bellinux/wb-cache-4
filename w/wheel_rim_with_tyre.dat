50|$|The company's first steam {{locomotive}} Soho, {{named after the}} works was a 0-4-2 goods type, built in 1833 for carrier John Hargreaves. In 1834 an unconventional, gear-driven four-wheeled rail carriage was conceived for Bolton solicitor and banker, Thomas Lever Rushton (1810-1883). The engine was the first 3-cylinder locomotive and its design incorporated aerodynamic turned iron <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> <b>with</b> plate discs {{as an alternative to}} conventional spokes. The 3-cylinder concept evolved into Hick's experimental horizontal boiler A 2-2-2 locomotive about 1840, adopting the principle features of the vertical boiler engine. The A 2-2-2 design appears not to have been put into production.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Type 2" [...] was {{introduced}} in April 1984. The grille was changed and all models gained a front air dam, while the saloons also received a standard rear spoiler. The three-stud <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> were replaced <b>with</b> the larger four-stud <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> (<b>with</b> the Base, TL and TD just having center caps, and the GTL, Automatic, GTS and GTD all having full wheel trims). The biggest difference, however, was that the dashboard was replaced by that of the Fuego. The 2-litre GTX model {{was introduced}} in France {{in the fall of}} 1983. Subsequent years saw fewer changes to the 18 line, in preparation for the launch of the Renault 21 early in 1986. For 1986, a limited range was sold as the [...] "18 Gala" [...] in France, with the Turbo model discontinued during 1985 (only about 650 Turbos were built that year). July 1986 marked the end for the R18 in France. Production continued in Latin America until 1994, however, and the R18 also continued to be manufactured in France with the 2-litre petrol engine until 1989 for export only.|$|R

50|$|Crazy Eights: This test, {{which was}} also last run in Canada's Worst Driver 6, pits two drivers at a time {{against each other in}} a pair of Suzuki Sidekicks driving in a figure-eight course of <b>wheel</b> <b>rims,</b> <b>with</b> a {{combination}} of S-turns and accurate reversing required to get through the course. Shelby and Shirley make up the first heat, and though Shirley needs Andrew to refresh her memory on how to perform an S-turn, both get through the course flawlessly. Dale and Michael are next-up, and while Michael also makes it through without any trouble at all, Dale hits 19 objects, and fails. The Suzuki Sidekicks are then swapped out for two Pontiac Fieros. Kevin and Angelina make up the next heat, and Kevin continues to demonstrate his problem of only ever looking forward and rarely turning his head, which causes him to run over several <b>wheel</b> <b>rims,</b> and fail. Yet again, Angelina has the worst run, and backs completely off the course and into a field. She attempts to give up after this, but Andrew forces her to continue, and Angelina's repeated complaining causes the viewing judges to conclude that she's emotionally immature. During the challenge, Angelina reveals that her cousin suffered brain injuries in a car crash, causing memory loss which rendered her unable to even remember who Angelina was, leaving Andrew further astonished by her cavalier attitude toward driving. Sly takes the last run alone {{due to the lack of}} another driver, and in a repeat of the initial test is extremely slow, taking 97 minutes to get through the course.|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the dynamic and {{acoustic}} characterisation of an automotive wheel. In particular, an experimental research activity previously performed by the authors about the dynamic behaviour of automotive wheels has been extended to the acoustic field. This experimental research has begun in the laboratory of the Mechanics Department of Politecnico di Torino where the modal analysis of the SAAB 640 / 6 Jx 15 H 2 wheel has been carried on step by step, starting from the rim in the most simple constraint condition to realise in laboratory, that is the free-free condition, up to the <b>wheel</b> (<b>rim</b> <b>with</b> tire) clamped to a real automotive hub; two cases have been considered: the wheel in hanging condition, that is with the vehicle on a lift-bridge, and the wheel laying on the ground. Then an acoustic study, analytical, numerical and experimental, of the cavity tire has also been performed. The experimental analysis has been carried on by introducing a microphone in the tire cavity (with no pressure) and by measuring the corresponding response level. The analytical study has been performed by utilising analytical relationships known in literature and a model of the tire cavity with an equivalent geometry. The numerical analysis has been carried on by means of a Boundary Element Method (BEM) model of the cavity. All obtained results, both dynamic and acoustic, have been analysed and compared to those concerning the experimental tests of the wheel clamped to the vehicle hub...|$|R

500|$|Michelin, Dunlop and Continental {{supplied}} tyres for the race. In the Grand Prix's {{one major}} technical innovation, Michelin introduced the jante amovible: a detachable <b>rim</b> <b>with</b> a <b>tyre</b> already affixed, {{which could be}} quickly swapped onto {{the car in the}} event of a puncture. Unlike in the Gordon Bennett races, only the driver and his riding mechanic were allowed to work on the car during the race, hence carrying the detachable rims could save time and confer a large advantage. The conventional method of changing a tyre, which involved slicing off the old <b>tyre</b> <b>with</b> a knife, and forcing the new tyre onto the rim, generally took around fifteen minutes; replacing Michelin's rims took less than four. The FIATs each used a full set, while the Renaults and two of the Clément-Bayards used them on the rear wheels of their cars.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of railway wheels to {{wear and}} rolling contact fatigue damage {{is influenced by}} the properties of the wheel material. These are influenced by the steel composition, wheel manufacturing process, and thermal and mechanical loading during operation. The in-service properties therefore vary with depth below the surface and with position across the wheel tread. This paper discusses the stress history at the wheel/rail contact (derived from dynamic simulations) and observed variations in hardness and microstructure. It is shown that the hardness of an “in-service” <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> varies significantly, <b>with</b> three distinct effects. The underlying hardness trend with depth can be related to microstructural changes during manufacturing (proeutectoid ferrite fraction and pearlite lamellae spacing). The near-surface layer exhibits plastic flow and microstructural shear, especially in regions which experience high tangential forces when curving, with consequentially higher hardness values. Between 1 [*]mm and 7 [*]mm depth, the wheel/rail contacts cause stresses exceeding the material yield stress, leading to work hardening, without a macroscopic change in microstructure. These changes in material properties through the depth of the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> would tend to increase the likelihood of crack initiation on wheels toward the end of their life. This correlates with observations from several train fleets...|$|R

40|$|At present, in the {{automotive}} industry, the trend {{on the world}} plane is to fit on the <b>wheels</b> <b>with</b> <b>rims</b> made from nonferrous alloys, based on aluminum, magnesium or titanium.

Kevin follows and fares much worse, spending nearly the whole challenge looking out the front windshield despite Lenny repeatedly reminding him that he should be looking out the back, and hits 23 objects. Once again, Margherita fails to make a serious effort due to her bad mood, and plows through the course with little regard as to where she's going or what she's hitting. She ultimately hits 37 objects before Andrew calls a halt to the challenge, and tells her that she {{will not be allowed to}} take any further challenges until she speaks to Shyamala. Flora takes the last run, and immediately applies full gas without even touching the steering wheel, promptly hitting every single rim in the opening stretch before eventually getting wedged, forcing Andrew and Frank to clear out the rims from underneath the car.
