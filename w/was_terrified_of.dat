500|$|... "Christmas Carol" [...] is {{the first}} of a two-part story that concludes with episode seven, [...] "Emily". The episode was {{inspired}} by the 1951 British film Scrooge, starring Alastair Sim. The young actress who originally played Emily <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> the hospital setting in the episode's sequel [...] "Emily", and as a result the producers had to recast the role and reshoot all footage featuring her including her scene featured in this episode. Gillian Anderson's younger sister, Zoe, was chosen to play Scully in a flashback sequence.|$|E

500|$|Nicolas Cage {{was cast}} as Al Columbato. He reflected, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> {{the role of}} Al, because it was like nothing I'd ever done before, and I didn't {{know how to get}} to the places the role was asking me to go emotionally." [...] For scenes in which Al's face is {{disfigured}} and swathed in bandages, Cage lost 15 pounds and had two of his front teeth pulled out. [...] "I wanted to look like I was hit by a bomb," [...] he said. [...] "It gave me a feeling of something I had lost. I felt this was a once-in-a-lifetime part, and it deserved that much." ...|$|E
500|$|While fake frogs were {{considered}} for the scene where they fall from the sky, the producers decided {{to make use of}} real frogs instead, dropped from a short distance. According to Carter, the [...] "fake ones looked too bad and didn't hop away after command". The snake going down the stairs proved difficult to film as the animal kept on falling onto the floor after slithering down the steps. Actor Dan Butler <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> the animal, being unable to talk while shooting the scene in the basement. The actor's fright meant the make-up team did not need to apply fake sweat to his face.|$|E
500|$|According to Haggard's {{daughter}} Lilias, {{the phrase}} [...] "She-who-must-be-obeyed" [...] originated {{from his childhood}} and [...] "the particularly hideous aspect" [...] of one rag-doll: [...] "This doll {{was something of a}} fetish, and Rider, as a small child, <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> her, a fact soon discovered by an unscrupulous nurse who made full use of it to frighten him into obedience. Why or how it came to be called She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed he could not remember". Haggard wrote that [...] "the title She" [...] was taken [...] "from a certain rag doll, so named, which a nurse at Bradenham used to bring out of some dark recess in order to terrify those of my brothers and sisters who were in her charge." ...|$|E

We recast that role and started up again the next day." [...] The show's casters replaced her with Lauren Diewold, who had previously appeared on an episode of Millennium.

500|$|In 1964, Gardner {{began his}} novelist career with The Liquidator, {{in which he}} created the {{character}} Boysie Oakes who inadvertently is mistaken to be a tough, pitiless man of action and is thereupon recruited into a British spy agency. In fact, Oakes was a devout coward who <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> violence, suffered from airsickness and was afraid of heights and Gardner admitted of him that, [...] "though I have denied it many timesâ€”he was of course a complete piss-take of J. Bond". The book appeared {{at the height of}} the fictional spy mania and, as a send-up of the whole business, was an immediate success. Upon reviewing the novel in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher wrote, [...] "Mr. Gardner succeeds in having it both ways: He has written a clever parody which is also a genuinely satisfactory thriller." [...] The book was made into a film of the same name by MGM and another seven light-hearted novels and two short stories about the cowardly Oakes appeared over the next eleven years.|$|E
500|$|When Scott {{unexpectedly}} {{married in}} 1969, {{it appeared that}} the problem might be over, but by 1970 the marriage had ended; Scott convinced himself that Thorpe was to blame. Early in 1971 Scott moved to the village of Talybont, in North Wales, where he befriended a widow, Gwen Parry-Jones, to whom he recounted his tale of ill-treatment at the hands of Thorpe. She passed the information to Emlyn Hooson, who was MP for the adjoining Welsh constituency; Hooson precipitated the party enquiry which cleared Thorpe and left Scott feeling bitter and humiliated. After Parry-Jones's death the following year, Scott fell into a depression and for a while was quiescent. In time, however, he began to tell his story to anyone who would listen. [...] By 1974 Thorpe, at the crest of the Liberal revival, <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> exposure that might lose him the Liberal leadership. As Dominic Sandbrook observes in his history of the times: [...] "The stakes had never been higher; silencing Scott had never been more urgent".|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1956, Childe retired as IOA Director a year prematurely. European {{archaeology}} had rapidly expanded during the 1950s, leading to increasing specialisation and making the synthesising that Childe was known for increasingly difficult. That year, the Institute was moving to Gordon Square, Bloomsbury, and Childe wanted to give his successor, W.F. Grimes, a fresh start in the new surroundings. To commemorate his achievements, the Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society published a Festschrift edition {{on the last day}} of his Directorship containing contributions from friends and colleagues from all over the world, something that touched Childe deeply. Upon his retirement, he told many friends that he planned to return to Australia, visit his relatives, and then commit suicide; he <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> becoming old, senile, and a burden on society, and suspected that he had cancer. Subsequent commentators have suggested that a core reason for his suicidal desires was his loss of faith in Marxism following the Hungarian Revolution and Premier Nikita Khrushchev's denouncement of Joseph Stalin, although Bruce Trigger noted that while Childe was critical of the Soviet Union's foreign policy, he never saw the state and Marxism as [...] "synonymous", thereby dismissing this explanation.|$|E
500|$|Sophie Blanchard {{was born}} Marie Madeleine-Sophie Armant to Protestant parents at Trois-Canons, near La Rochelle. Little {{is known of}} her life before her {{marriage}} to Jean-Pierre Blanchard, the world's first professional balloonist. The date of her marriage is unclear; sources quote dates as early as 1794 [...] or 1797, but most state 1804, the year of her first ascent. Blanchard had abandoned his first wife, Victoire Lebrun, and their four children to travel round Europe pursuing his ballooning career, and she later died in poverty. Variously described as Blanchard's [...] "small, ugly, nervous wife", [...] "small with sharp bird-like features" [...] and later as [...] "small and beautiful", Sophie was more {{at home in the}} sky than on the ground, where her nervous disposition meant she was easily startled. She <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> loud noises and of riding in carriages, but was fearless in the air. She and her husband were in an accident on a joint flight in 1807 (her 11th ascent, possibly his 61st), in which they crashed and he sustained a head injury. The shock apparently left her mute for a while.|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} being {{shuttled}} {{into and out}} of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth. The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while. [...] According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive. [...] After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying [...] "I thought it was our dream come true. All our lives we had seen nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family." [...] However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother. As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, Chris. Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood. He had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades. When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> walking home alone.|$|E

500|$|Washington {{was drafted}} fifth overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1973 NBA draft. A {{week before the}} team began {{training}} camp, Pat and Kermit were married. They invited neither of their families; they just drove together to LA's city hall for the ceremony. He {{had a difficult time}} making the transition from college center to NBA power forward. In basketball, many players succeed {{in high school and college}} due to superior physical skills, but when they arrive in the professional ranks, they are typically going against players that are often as physically gifted as them. Washington also had played in a primarily zone defense system in college and was not versed in man-to-man defense, which is more common in the NBA. He arrived on a team which had legend Jerry West, who was in the waning stages of a career that would result in him becoming the silhouette seen on the NBA's logo. Washington admits that he <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> West, and felt anxiety every time he made a mistake in front of him. Though healthy, he played in only 45 games and averaged 8.9 minutes a game his rookie season. He hurt his back that year but kept quiet about it, fearing he would be [...] "labeled soft." [...] The injury would bother him the rest of his career. He continued to struggle in his second season, and discovered that finding individual coaching in the professional game at that time was difficult. Between the rigorous schedule, and the coaches assuming players already knew how to play for the most part when they entered the league, no one, including head coach Bill Sharman, was willing to work with him on a one-on-one basis.|$|E
500|$|Carla Gugino {{revealed}} in August 2009 {{that she had}} begun taking singing lessons for her part in the film. One month later, Jamie Chung announced {{in an interview with}} E! Entertainment that recording for the soundtrack had begun. When Emily Browning auditioned for her role as Babydoll, Snyder asked her to sing because of the musical element in the film. He told her to record herself while singing, and the actress did a version of [...] "Killing Me Softly with His Song". Browning later said, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>terrified,</b> <b>of</b> course. But he liked it. I have no idea why, but he thought me capable of carrying a tune on the screen." [...] The crew liked the result and offered her to sing more songs. At first it was just a cover of [...] "Where Is My Mind?" [...] by Pixies, which ended up becoming a duet with Yoav, but the producers extended to three songs. One, a version by [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] by Eurythmics, is used to open the movie, and Bates noted that [...] " [...] first line of dialogue is actually 27 minutes into the film so it is an interesting way to introduce her character." [...] The other came up when during a discussion on her favorite music with Snyder, Browning said that The Smiths was her favorite band. Several weeks later, Snyder informed her that he had acquired the rights to The Smiths' song [...] "Asleep", and asked her if she would like to perform the lead vocals. At first, she hesitated, saying that [...] "The offer was flattering, but there was so much pressure". However, she recorded the song and according to Snyder, The Smiths' frontman Morrissey was happy with the result. Regarding Browning's performance, de Vries considered that [...] "having Emily singâ€”essentially commenting in song on her characterâ€™s situation in the film â€” provided an interesting texture, real resonance and depth, and tied the music to the visuals in a way that might otherwise not have been so clearly defined", and Snyder found the actress' [...] "emotional delivery" [...] to [...] "make the songs even more poignant". To work with Browning between takes, de Vries used a portable recording rig on a room with a piano - [...] "a very distressed, out-of-tune, almost-unusable instrument (...) which turned out to have real charm in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{her later}} years, Lamarr turned to plastic surgery to {{preserve}} the looks she <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> losing, but the results were disastrous. [...] "She had her breasts enlarged, her cheeks raised, her lips made bigger, and much, much more," [...] said her son, Anthony. [...] "She had plastic surgery thinking it could revive her looks and her career, but it backfired and distorted her beauty". Anthony Loder also claimed that Lamarr was addicted to pills.|$|E

This production emphasised the physical brutality of the taming, with a macho Lockhart often aggressively lashing out at [...] Scardifield, who began as a punk rebel, but who became less and less assertive as the play went on. Katherina's final speech was delivered in a manner suggesting she <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> disagreeing with Petruchio.|$|E
2500|$|The Caine {{family had}} moved into a larger house in 1873, at 59 South Chester Street, Toxteth, where Caine shared a bedroom with his younger brother John, a {{shipping}} clerk. John contracted tuberculosis which he passed to his brother. By 1875 Caine had permanent lodgings in New Brighton, spending weekends there [...] "for {{the sake of his}} health". Caine became increasingly unwell from the beginning of January 1877. In April the same year John, died from tuberculosis, aged 21. Dangerously ill, Caine <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> suffering the same fate. He recovered, but the disease left him with permanent lung damage, and throughout his life he had attacks of bronchitis. In his 1913 novel The Woman Thou Gavest Me, he describes Mary Oâ€™Neil dying of tuberculosis.|$|E
2500|$|He later {{attributed}} {{his decision}} to an event: on 2 July 1505, he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home. During a thunderstorm, a lightning bolt struck near him. Later telling his father he <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> <b>of</b> death and divine judgment, he cried out, [...] "Help! Saint Anna, I will become a monk!" [...] He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break. He left law school, sold his books, and entered St. Augustine's Monastery in Erfurt on 17 July 1505. One friend blamed the decision on Luther's sadness over the deaths of two friends. Luther himself seemed saddened by the move. Those who attended a farewell supper walked {{him to the door}} of the Black Cloister. [...] "This day you see me, and then, not ever again," [...] he said.
