I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E

I see Michael Chabon write a great book; when I see Philip Seymour Hoffman do Death of a Salesman last year—I see people of my generation being fully realized in their <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> find that really kind of exciting. But politics? I don't know. Paul Ryan is certainly not my man." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 2004, Beckinsale portrayed Ava Gardner in Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator. Scorsese {{decided to}} cast Beckinsale because, [...] "I’ve always liked her. I’ve seen all her <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{was glad that}} she agreed to audition." [...] Beckinsale's {{performance}} received mixed reviews. Ken Tucker of New York Magazine said she played the part [...] "in full va-va-voom blossom" [...] while LaSalle felt that she manages [...] "to convince us that Ava {{was one of the}} great broads of all time." [...] However, Clark described it as [...] "the one performance that doesn't come off (though Beckinsale has the requisite beauty)" [...] while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian stated that [...] "Gardner's rich, voluptuous sexiness is completely absent as Beckinsale sleepwalks through the role as if she was advertising perfume." [...] The film grossed over $213million worldwide.|$|E

500|$|In a May 2012 interview, Whedon {{said that}} it was his {{decision}} to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, although the character is not identified in the film. [...] "He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love with Death and I just think that's so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers [...] was Avengers Annual #7 (1977) that Jim Starlin did followed by Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 (1977) that contained the death of Adam Warlock. Those were {{some of the most important}} texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'" [...] An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown. Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film's release. Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where Fred dies in Wesley's arms in the Angel episode, [...] "A Hole in the World". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors Amy Acker and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, [...] "went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events," [...] which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.|$|E
2500|$|As {{editor of}} Archives of Sexual Behavior, Zucker {{published}} a controversial study on reparative therapy by Robert Spitzer. According to The New York Times, after his {{presentation of the}} study caused controversy, Spitzer asked Zucker to publish it. [...] "I knew Bob {{and the quality of}} his <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> agreed to publish it," [...] Zucker said in an interview. [...] "But I told him I would do it only if I also published commentaries". Spitzer later recanted the study's conclusions.|$|E
2500|$|Rousseau {{had painted}} two portraits of Apollinaire: [...] "I often watched him at <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> know the care {{he gave to}} the tiniest details; he had the {{capacity}} to keep the original and definitive conception of his picture always before him until he had realized it; and he left nothing, above all, nothing essential, to chance. Its nervous draftsmanship, variety, charm, and delicacy of tones make this work's excellence. His pictures of flowers show the resources of charm and emphasis in the soul and hand of the Douanier." ...|$|E

It wasn't that important to me that I had [...] "score by Hans Zimmer" [...] and took sole credit on these things. It's like Gladiator: I gave Lisa Gerrard the co-credit because, even though she didn't write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential. She was more than just a soloist, and this is why I have such a problem with specific credits." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{evolution}} of Kelly's character led to developments both on-screen and off. In a 1995 article on Garth, TV Guide {{reported that the}} show's creators {{made a conscious decision}} to place her character at center stage. An anonymous producer cites [...] "faith in Jennie as an actress," [...] further stating that he and producer Aaron Spelling [...] "knew she had the chops to do it." [...] This development would gradually lead to Kelly supplanting Brenda as the prominent female lead, as the former received what the producer called [...] "better story lines." [...] Reportedly, these matters became a source of tension between Garth and Shannen Doherty, who played Brenda. Following Doherty's final appearance on the show in 1994, however, Garth stated, [...] "We were friends at <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> miss her most of the time." ...|$|E

[...] "I love her [...] <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had an idea to do like a really girl power, fun Valley girl video," [...] Spears claimed of the video partnership, adding {{that it was the}} first video she had done in a long time where she came up with the concept, also stating [...] "there’s a lot of dancing. I got new choreographers to come in and kind of do hip-hop dancing, which I haven’t done in a really long time, so the feel of the video is really different and hi-energy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nozomi Momoi {{was born}} in Tokyo on September 23, 1978. She {{attended}} junior high school in Nagano Prefecture, and remained in touch with friends there, visiting them on vacation, {{for the rest of}} her life. Before beginning work in the AV field, Nozomi worked in what she called [...] "a very normal job." [...] Describing her daily routine at this time, she said, [...] "I used to wake up at 5:30 in the morning to get ready for <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't have time to put on make-up or do my hair... It was the type of job where I was alone most of the time so I didn't bother with it." [...] She wanted a different lifestyle, and to make more money, but she was unable to decide what sort of work she wanted to do. She was in this frame of mind when she was scouted by a representative of the AV industry in Tokyo's Shinjuku neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|He {{remained}} {{with the team}} for five seasons but only managed a best finish of second. Fittipaldi decided to retire from racing {{at the end of}} 1980. He has since said that his last two years in Formula One were very unhappy: [...] "I was too involved in the problems of trying to make the team <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> neglected my marriage and my personal life", although at the time he cited the deaths of many of his colleagues as his reason. He was only 33, but had been racing in Formula One for a decade. He had failed to finish seven of the last ten races that year and had several times been outpaced by his Finnish teammate Keke Rosberg (a future champion himself). He moved into the management of the team alongside his brother. The team struggled on for another two years with minimal sponsorship, going into receivership at the end of 1982.|$|E
2500|$|After the war, Rivers became [...] "another and far happier man – diffidence gave {{place to}} confidence, reticence to outspokenness, a {{somewhat}} laboured literary style to one remarkable for ease and charm". He {{is quoted as}} saying [...] "I have finished my serious <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall just let myself go." [...] In those post war years, his personality seemed to change dramatically. The man who had been most at home in his study, the laboratory, or the field now dined out a good deal, had joined clubs, went yachting and appeared to welcome rather than shun opportunities for public speaking. Always having been a voracious reader, he now began reading in philosophy, as he had not done for some years, and also in imaginative literature. Not all of his friends from former years welcomed these changes; some felt that, along with his shyness, his scientific caution and good sense may have deserted him to a degree but most people who saw how happy Rivers had become agreed that the slight alterations to his character were for the better.|$|E

2500|$|They largely {{function}} as a distinct class, and so distinguish themselves by using language inaccessible to people outside the academy, with more or less deliberately exclusionary effects. In Chomsky's view {{there is little reason}} to believe that academics are more inclined to engage in profound thought than other members of society and that the designation [...] "intellectual" [...] obscures the truth of the intellectual division of labour: [...] "These are funny words actually, I mean being an 'intellectual' has almost nothing to do with working with your mind; these are two different things. My suspicion is that plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do as much or more intellectual work as people in the universities. [...] There are plenty of areas in academia where what's called 'scholarly' work is just clerical <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't think clerical work's more challenging than fixing an automobile engine—in fact, I think the opposite.... So if by 'intellectual' you mean people who are using their minds, then it's all over society" [...] (Understanding Power, p.96).|$|E
2500|$|When Rob Liefeld, one of Image's co-founders, {{split from}} the {{publisher}} and formed his own company Awesome Entertainment, he hired Moore {{to create a new}} universe for the characters he had brought with him from Image. Moore's [...] "solution was breathtaking and cocky – he created a long and distinguished history for these new characters, retro-fitting a fake silver and gold age for them." [...] Moore began writing comics for many of these characters, such as Glory and Youngblood, as well as a three-part mini-series known as Judgment Day to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe. Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld, saying [...] "I just got fed up with the unreliability of information that I get from him, that I didn't trust him. I didn't think that he was respecting the <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> found it hard to respect him. And also by then I was probably feeling that with the exception of Jim Lee, Jim Valentino – people like that – that a couple of the Image partners were seeming, to my eyes, to be less than gentlemen. They were seeming to be not necessarily the people I wanted to deal with." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rousseau also {{mentioned}} the watchmaker theory. He wrote the following in his 1762 book, Emile: [...] I am {{like a man}} who sees the works of a watch for the first time; he is never weary of admiring the mechanism, though he does not know the use of the instrument and has never seen its face. I do not know what this is for, says he, but I see that each part of it is fitted to the rest, I admire the workman in the details of his <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am quite certain that all these wheels only work together in this fashion for some common end which I cannot perceive. Let us compare the special ends, the means, the ordered relations of every kind, then let us listen to the inner voice of feeling; what healthy mind can reject its evidence? Unless the eyes are blinded by prejudices, can they fail to see that the visible order of the universe proclaims a supreme intelligence? What sophisms must be brought together before we fail to understand the harmony of existence and the wonderful co-operation of every part for the maintenance of the rest? ...|$|E

2500|$|Around {{the release}} of Music, Madonna told Rolling Stone about how she felt about the song's leak: [...] "There's not much to say, honestly. I think it's blown out of proportion. They {{downloaded}} a portion of 'Music' before I'd even mixed it. It was astonishing. I {{have no idea how}} they got it. It was still in such a beginning stage. And it freaked me out, because I suddenly thought, 'Oh, my God. If they got that, then they have other things on my record that aren't finished.' And that's really scary. So, basically, I made — well, my manager made — a public statement [...] Simple as that. And then suddenly it was in every headline: 'Madonna is against Napster.' I mean ... I don't take that sort of a stance. I feel covetous about my <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't want people to hear it until it's finished. At the same time, I think, to a certain extent, the trading of information is inevitable. And, on the other hand, Napster could be a great way for people to hear your music who wouldn't have the chance to hear it on the radio. So that's what I have to say about that. Really, I want to strangle the person who got ahold of it. I don't know — I can't control everybody [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Things {{changed for}} O'Brien in 1991, when in quick succession, an {{engagement}} fell through; Lookwell was not picked up; and, burned out, he quit Saturday Night Live. [...] "I told Lorne Michaels I couldn't {{come back to}} <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just {{needed to do something}} else," [...] O'Brien recalled. [...] "I had no plan whatsoever. I was literally in this big transition phase in my life where I decided, I'll just walk around New York City, and an idea will come to me." [...] Mike Reiss and Al Jean, then dual showrunners of The Simpsons, called O'Brien and offered him a job. The series was notorious in the writing community at the time; O'Brien recalls [...] "everyone wanted to be on that show, but they never hired." [...] O'Brien {{was one of the first}} hires after the show's original crew. With the help of old Groundlings friend Lisa Kudrow, O'Brien purchased an apartment in Beverly Hills. He and Kudrow became involved as well, and Kudrow believed he should begin performing rather than writing. O'Brien disagreed, feeling that Kudrow was being overly flattering and that asserting he was happy as a writer. In his speech given at Class Day at Harvard in 2000, O'Brien credited The Simpsons with saving him, a reference to the career slump he was experiencing prior to his being hired for the show.|$|E

He moved into the management of the team and young Brazilian Chico Serra replaced him for 1981. The team, which reverted to the name of Fittipaldi Automotive as Skol sponsorship was lost again, entered a sharp decline from 1981 onwards. Postlethwaite left for Ferrari early in the year and the team once again raced updated variants of the previous season's chassis, using tyres from Michelin, Avon and Pirelli - including one race in which the two cars were on different brands. Rosberg did manage to finish a fourth at the non-championship FOCA South African Grand Prix {{at the start of the}} year, albeit one lap down on the leaders (see FISA-FOCA War), but after that the drivers recorded a succession of DNQs and retirements. When they did finish they were normally at the back of the field and scored no points that year.|$|E
