25|$|Joe Campos Torres (1954 - May 5, 1977) was a 23-year-old Vietnam {{veteran who}} was arrested for disorderly conduct at a bar in Houston's {{predominantly}} Hispanic East End neighborhood. Six Houston police officers took Torres to a spot called “The Hole” next to Buffalo Bayou and beat him. The officers then took Torres to the city jail, where they were ordered {{to take him to}} the hospital.

25|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Mildred became pregnant. In June 1958, {{the couple}} {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C. to marry, thereby evading Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which made marriage between whites and non-whites a crime. They returned to {{the small town of}} Central Point, Virginia. Based on an anonymous tip, local police raided their home {{in the early morning hours}} of July 11, 1958, hoping to find them having sex, given that interracial sex was then also illegal in Virginia. When the officers found the Lovings sleeping in their bed, Mildred pointed out their marriage certificate on the bedroom wall. They <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> certificate was not valid in the Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|M.D. William E. Seidelman is a {{professor}} from the University of Toronto who in collaboration with Dr. Howard Israel of Columbia University published a report on an investigation on the Medical experimentations performed in Austria under the Nazi Regime. In that report he mentions a Doctor Hermann Stieve, whom used the war to experiment on live humans. Dr. Stieve specifically focused on the reproductive system of women. He would tell women their execution date in advanced, and he would evaluate how their psychological distress would affect their menstruation cycles. After they were murdered, he would dissect and examine their reproductive organs. Some {{of the women were}} even raped after they <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> date when they would be killed, so that Dr. Stieve could study the path of sperm through their reproductive system.|$|E

25|$|On 10 May 1940 the German Wehrmacht began Fall Gelb (Case Yellow); an {{invasion}} of Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Belgium and France. 3 Squadron were ordered to readiness that morning and flew to Merville, Nord in France. 3 and 79 Squadron were to form part of 63 Wing RAF. As they crossed the English Channel at 05:30 GMT, they were directed to a Ju 88 which they chased to the Dutch border without success and returned to England refuel. After landing the squadron was ordered to relocate to France. They <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> German Army had invaded France and the Low Countries. They reached Merville and found they were under-equipped in comparison to other squadrons that had been there since September 1939. The squadrons of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) possessed self-sealing fuel tanks, armoured protection for the pilot, and more powerful radio crystals.|$|E
25|$|Malian {{migrants}} {{have long}} worked on cocoa {{farms in the}} Ivory Coast, but in 2000 cocoa prices had dropped to a 10-year low and some farmers stopped paying their employees. The Malian counsel had to rescue some boys {{who had not been}} paid for five years and who were beaten if they tried to run away. Malian officials believed that 15,000 children, some as young as 11 years old, were working in the Ivory Coast in 2001. These children were often from poor families or the slums and were sold to work in other countries. Parents <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> children would find work and send money home, but once the children left home, they often worked in conditions resembling slavery. In other cases, children begging for food were lured from bus stations and sold as slaves. In 2002, the Ivory Coast had 12,000 children with no relatives nearby, which suggested they were trafficked, likely from neighboring Mali, Burkina Faso and Togo.|$|E
25|$|On May 8, 1977, a 24-year-old named Charles Hattula {{was found}} drowned {{in a river}} near Freeport, Illinois. Hattula, an {{employee}} of PDM Contractors, had {{been linked to the}} initial investigation of Gacy after Robert Piest's disappearance; this was after the same employee who had informed the investigators of Gregory Godzik's disappearance informed them of Hattula's death. Moreover, this employee had stated that Hattula was known to have conflicts with Gacy. Gacy had himself informed several of his employees the youth had drowned after Hattula's body was recovered from the Pecatonica River. Des Plaines authorities had contacted colleagues in Freeport during their investigation into Gacy, but <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> youth had fallen to his death from a bridge. At the time of Hattula's death, Gacy had become engaged, and his fiancée had moved into his home, which leaves a possibility that Gacy had disposed of Hattula's body in the Pecatonica River as opposed to burying the man in his crawl space. However, Hattula's death had been ruled as accidental.|$|E

25|$|Though Broadchurch {{was first}} {{conceived}} of in 2003, creator and writer Chris Chibnall first began fleshing {{out the story}} and writing scripts for the first episodes in 2011. He approached ITV in autumn 2011 with the series, and the network quickly approved it for production. The role of Reverend Paul Coates was written for Arthur Darvill, and leads David Tennant and Olivia Colman were the first cast. Other roles were cast using auditions. Principal photography began on 13 August 2012 in Dorset. Most scenes were shot on location, {{with the majority of}} filming in and around Clevedon and West Bay. Soundstages were used for some interior scenes. Dialogue rarely departed from the scripts, but other aspects of the performances were improvised. A documentary visual style and an emphasis on first takes were used to heighten the realism of the series and acting. Few of the crew and none of the actors knew the identity of the murderer when filming began. A number of steps were taken to maintain this secret. Only those cast and crew with an absolute need to know <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> identity of the murderer once filming began on the final three episodes.|$|E
25|$|The {{concert was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} held at San Jose State University's practice field, as there had recently been a three-day outdoor free festival there with 52 bands and 80,000 attendees. Dirt Cheap Productions was asked to help secure the property again for the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead to play a free concert. The Stones and the Dead <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> city of San Jose was not in the mood for another large concert and the grounds were out of bounds. Golden Gate Park in San Francisco was next on the list. However, a previously scheduled Chicago Bears–San Francisco 49ers football game at Kezar Stadium, located in Golden Gate Park, made that venue impractical, and permits were never issued for the concert. The venue was then changed to the Sears Point Raceway. However, a dispute with Sears Point's owner, Filmways, Inc., arose over a $300,000 up-front cash deposit from the Rolling Stones and film distribution rights, so the festival was moved once again. The Altamont Raceway was chosen at the suggestion of its then-owner, local businessman Dick Carter. The concert was to take place on Saturday, December 6; the location was switched on the night of Thursday, December 4.|$|E

500|$|Many of the German {{units were}} recent conscripts {{with very little}} experience. Sergeant Vinz Kuhlbach's platoon was typical. Most of his {{soldiers}} had little combat experience and even less training. The German units had been formed by conscripting teenage boys and men over 50, men previously rejected as physically unfit for service, wounded soldiers newly released from hospitals, and men transferred from the [...] "jobless" [...] personnel of the shrinking Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe. The German 3rd Fallschirmjäger [...] Division, which had previously acquired a superb combat reputation, had been virtually destroyed during the Normandy Invasion in the Falaise pocket. It had been resurrected by using replacements from the 22nd, 51st, and 53rd Luftwaffe Field Regiments. The German units were usually organized around small cadres of seasoned veterans. Although they carried the new StG 44 and were equipped with rifle grenades, few had ever fired them in combat. The German recruits <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> American soldiers they faced {{would not have the}} nerve to stand and fight.

500|$|From {{the time}} that he had taken over as chief of the SS-HA, Berger had made {{considerable}} efforts {{to increase the amount of}} ideological training received by Waffen-SS personnel. In February 1943, in the wake of the German losses at Stalingrad, Berger again told Himmler that the SS needed stronger ideological training. As a result, the SS-HA issued a series of pamphlets on racial ideology, including Der Untermensch (The Sub-Human), which described certain peoples as spiritually and mentally lower than animals. Himmler and Berger also hosted representatives from the Wehrmacht who were keen to learn from SS expertise in ideological indoctrination. On 13 February, following an approach from Reichsjugendführer (German Youth Leader) Artur Axmann for a Waffen-SS division to be raised from the Hitler Youth, Berger and Axmann <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> idea had been approved by Hitler and that they could commence planning. Berger implored Himmler to appoint him as the commander of this new division, but the Reichsfuhrer demurred, telling Berger not to be impatient. Also in February, Berger complained to Himmler that the dispersal of [...] "Germanic" [...] volunteers throughout the Waffen-SS was having significant negative effects on the recruiting of replacements in the occupied countries. In March 1943, Wiking was also upgraded to a panzergrenadier division.|$|E
