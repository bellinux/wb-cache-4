500|$|Katie Hasty of HitFix was not {{impressed}} by the lyrical potential of the song, stating that with lines like [...] "sunburned baby / hurts like crazy," [...] "we're just some silly heartbreakers tonight" [...] and rhyming [...] "yum yum" [...] with [...] "some some" [...] won't get this song [...] "very good scores on the SAT". She concluded by stating that: [...] "In fact, it seems that Lopez goes {{out of her way}} to sing with a little-girl inflection to her 41-year-old pipes. But it comes off youthful, upbeat, and a little lighter than the single [...] and her island-inflected collaboration with Lil Wayne, 'I'm Into You'." [...] Amos Barshad of Vulture questioned Lopez' music, stating that [...] "with the other facets of her multimedia empire clicking [...] <b>why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> insist on continuing to make music? Why not sit back, relax, and enjoy the fact that there is something that you do that people like? [...] Well, one can only assume, Jennifer Lopez keeps making music because Jennifer Lopez actually loves making music. And that's admirable".|$|E
2500|$|Jason Blake of the Sydney Morning Herald said, [...] "Phillips's {{production}} steers {{clear of}} [...] "chandelier moments", favouring sustained invention, seamless flow and an engulfing sense of nightmare. There's wow factor, of course (a galloping carousel {{is an early}} highlight) though quieter scenes are realised with the same attention to detail, particularly the recreation of a Coney Island bar to frame Raoul's saloon song feature (<b>Why</b> <b>Does</b> <b>She</b> Love Me) and his face-off with Mr Y (Devil Take the Hindmost) An inspired, often ravishing production for sure, though of a sequel that doesn't make a strong enough musical or narrative argument for its own existence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Act three {{takes place}} in the {{courtyard}} of castle of the Wittenstein. Five years have passed. Hans has deceived Ondine with Bertha, and Ondine has long since vanished. It is the morning of the day of the marriage of Bertha and Hans. But Hans is troubled. He tells Bertha, that she should have married a man full of pride and joy. [...] He complains, [...] "Oh Bertha, how she lied to me, that woman!" [...] Bertha points out that Ondine was no woman, [...] "you married a creature of another world. You must forget her." [...] Hans remembers the day that Ondine left and asks, [...] "But <b>why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> proclaim to the world that she deceived me with Bertram?" [...] In addition to being preoccupied with Ondine, Hans is worried because the servants are starting to speak in poetry and there is a Wittenstein legend that this always happens just before misfortune strikes. Two fishermen arrive. The second fisherman is the Old One. They have caught Ondine. Two judges from the inquisition are summoned and immediately put her on trial. Ondine is brought in draped in the net in which she was caught. [...] She does not deny being an Ondine and proclaims to all who will listen that she deceived Hans with Bertram. The judge asks Hans to clearly state the exact nature of his complaint. Hans says, [...] "My complaint? [...] My complaint is the complaint of all mankind. [...] I claim the right to be left in peace {{in a world that is}} free of intrusions by these creatures. [...] Has there never been an age when they did not afflict us?" [...] The judge answers, [...] "An age? [...] There has never been a moment." [...] But the other judge says, [...] "Yes, there was once a moment. [...] For that instant, the whole world was single-hearted, at play, at peace—and yet I tasted for the first time a certain loneliness." ...|$|E

60|$|She sat {{leaning on}} her elbow, looking at nothing. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> stay {{listening}} to my absurd chatter? And not only that; but <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> powder her face in preparation for my arrival? It seemed to be her idea of making a toilette, and in her untidy negligence a sign of great effort towards personal adornment.|$|R
6000|$|... "If Germany {{does not}} wish for war," [...] Captain Fielder persisted, [...] "why does she keep such an {{extraordinary}} army? <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> continually add to her navy? <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> infest our country with spies and keep all her preparations as secret as possible?" ...|$|E

60|$|The captain knit his brows.

Could it be that this vessel had been on their track? Could it be that the Peruvian government--But he could not waste time in surmise as to what might be. They must act, not conjecture.|$|R
6000|$|Why, {{the fact}} is, that Mr Westlock was passing at that moment. The Temple {{is a public}} thoroughfare; they may write up on the gates that it is not, but {{so long as the}} gates are left open it is, and will be; and Mr Westlock had as good a right to be there as anybody else. But <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> run away, then? Not being ill dressed, for she was much too neat for that, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> run away? The brown hair that had fallen down beneath her bonnet, and had one impertinent imp of a false flower {{clinging}} to it, boastful of its licence before all men, THAT could not have been the cause, for it looked charming.
