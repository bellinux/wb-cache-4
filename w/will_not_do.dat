5|$|On November 23, 2004, Downey {{released}} his debut musical album, The Futurist, on Sony Classical, {{for which he}} designed the cover art and designed the track listing label on the CD with his son Indio. The album received mixed reviews, but Downey stated in 2006 that he probably <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> another album, as {{he felt that the}} energy he put into doing the album was not compensated.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the orbits}} of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge-on from Earth, with Namaka having {{periodically}} occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on {{the size and shape}} of Haumea and its moons, as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations required at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, a few years before its discovery, and <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, the great torquing of Namaka's orbit by Hiʻiaka preserved the viewing angle of Namaka–Haumea transits for several more years.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris (Rob Lowe) has enacted {{numerous}} {{changes to}} the parks department; he promotes Jerry (Jim O'Heir) to public relations director, appoints April (Aubrey Plaza) as everyone's assistant, places Tom (Aziz Ansari) on the nightmarish fourth floor with Andy (Chris Pratt) as his temporary assistant, and makes Ron (Nick Offerman) sit {{in the middle of}} a circular desk after the removal of his office, to force him to interact with people. Ron believes everything will eventually go back to normal as it has with past city managers that implemented drastic changes. However, Donna (Retta) is concerned the overly-determined Chris <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so and demands that Ron talk to him. On the fourth floor, Tom's attempts to charm some of the elderly women into doing his work fails miserably, as they ignore him and all adore Andy.|$|E

5|$|Though it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} of the halogens, iodine {{is still one of}} the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and sulfur dioxide to phosgene, nitrosyl chloride, and sulfuryl chloride respectively, iodine <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, rhenium metal reacts with chlorine to form rhenium hexachloride, but with bromine it forms only rhenium pentabromide and iodine can achieve only rhenium tetraiodide. By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in iodine heptafluoride.|$|E
5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. Another sign of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance is a factor in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> as much damage as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E

Instead of going inside, she takes a walk and ends up at an all-night cafe. As she walks by, she sees Michael Fitzsimmons — the artsy loner in school she always wished she’d slept with - and goes in to talk to him. After finding out they have more in common than originally thought, they ride off on his motorcycle. In a field, they smoke weed and find out more about one another. When he asks if she is going to marry Charlie, she responds that she already did that and <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> it again. After he recites some of his poetry for her, they have sex.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{hardware}} RAID cards, {{perhaps in the}} mistaken belief that these will 'help' ZFS. While routine for other filing systems, ZFS handles RAID natively, and is designed {{to work with a}} raw and unmodified low level view of storage devices, so it can fully use its functionality. A separate RAID card may leave ZFS less efficient and reliable. For example ZFS checksums all data, but most RAID cards <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> this as effectively, or for cached data. Separate cards can also mislead ZFS about the state of data, for example after a crash, or by mis-signalling exactly when data has safely been written, and in some cases this can lead to issues and data loss. Separate cards can also slow down the system, sometimes greatly, by adding latency to every data read/write operation, or by undertaking full rebuilds of damaged arrays where ZFS would have only needed to do minor repairs of a few seconds.|$|E

Citing differences with the BBC and his dislike of their indifference towards the series, Bell said, [...] "I have now decided I <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> it again. I have had enough of the BBC's attitude." [...] The announcement came following rumours initiated by Bell that the network would not commission another series of episodes following the 30th series and their indecision regarding a possible one-off special.

500|$|In Stage one (obedience and {{punishment}} driven), individuals {{focus on the}} direct {{consequences of their actions}} on themselves.

[...] The worse the punishment for the act is, the more [...] "bad" [...] the act is perceived to be. This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is [...] "egocentric", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own. There is [...] "deference to superior power or prestige".|$|E

[...] Agriculture Canada has developed a [...] "flavour wheel" [...] that details 91 unique flavours that can be present in maple syrup. These flavours are divided into 13 families: vanilla, empyreumatic (burnt), milky, fruity, floral, spicy, foreign deterioration or environment, maple, confectionery, plants forest-humus-cereals, herbaceous, or ligneous. These flavours are evaluated using a procedure similar to wine tasting. Other culinary experts praise its unique flavour.|$|E
