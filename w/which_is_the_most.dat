The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of the heart muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E

5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common form of amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E

5|$|The favored {{temperature}} {{range of the}} roughtail stingray is , <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important factor determining its distribution. It conducts seasonal migrations off the eastern United States: from December to May, this ray is found over the middle and outer parts of the continental shelf from Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to Florida, with larger rays occurring further south than smaller ones. In the spring, the population moves north of the Cape and towards the coast into bays, inlets, and saltier estuaries, though preserving the north-south gradient of body sizes. A similar migration, from shallow coastal waters in summer to deeper offshore waters in winter, apparently occurs in the Mediterranean. Pregnant females tend to be found apart from other individuals.|$|E
