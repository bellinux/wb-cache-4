5|$|Johansson {{has criticized}} {{the media for}} {{promoting}} an image that causes unhealthy diets and eating disorders among women, believing that being skinny is not attractive. In one article she wrote for HuffPost, Johansson encouraged the reader to maintain a healthy body. She appeared nude {{on the cover of}} the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair alongside actress Keira Knightley and fully clothed fashion designer Tom Ford. This caused some controversy as it was believed the photo demonstrated that women are forced to flaunt their sexuality more often than men. In September 2011, nude photographs of Johansson hacked from her cell phone were published online. Following an FBI investigation, the perpetrator was arrested, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Johansson said the photos had been sent to her then-husband, Reynolds, three years before the incident. In 2014, Johansson won a lawsuit against French publisher, JC Lattès, for using her name and featuring a look-alike model of her in the novel The First Thing <b>We</b> <b>Look</b> <b>At</b> by Gregoire Delacourt. Johansson was awarded $3,400, a fraction of the $68,000 she had claimed.|$|E

25|$|Bohm's {{proposed}} implicate order applies both {{to matter}} and consciousness. He {{suggested that it}} could explain the relationship between them. He saw mind and matter as projections into our explicate order from the underlying implicate order.

McLaughlin, who at {{the time}} was the Deputy Director of the CIA, {{described}} the extent of the Agency's investigation into the claim: [...] "Well, on something like the Atta meeting in Prague, we went over that every which way from Sunday. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it from every conceivable angle. We peeled open the source, examined the chain of acquisition. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> photographs. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> timetables. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> who was where and when. It is wrong to say that <b>we</b> didn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. In fact, <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it with extraordinary care and intensity and fidelity." ...|$|R

25|$|Since an RMS value can be {{calculated}} for any waveform, apparent power can {{be calculated}} from this.

25|$|Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, {{argued that}} all things have a {{universal}} form, {{which could be}} either a property or a relation to other things. When <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, {{so that we can}} speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.|$|E
25|$|In October 2017 as <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the {{convenience}} store channel, Reese’s is the largest confection brand by far: It's 62% larger than the next brand, with more households purchasing Reese’s than any other confection brand across the U.S. Reese’s includes the No. 1-selling confection item – the iconic Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups King Size, and six of the top 20 chocolate/non-chocolate items. The Reese’s brand also accounts for over 47% of all seasonal sales within {{the convenience}} store channel, with the top two items in all four seasons (Valentine's, Easter, Halloween, and Holiday). As a comparison, the next largest brand accounts for only 10% of seasonal sales.|$|E

500|$|Post-match {{analysis}} showed that referee Oliver had erroneously awarded the corner kick from which Gillingham's goal had been scored, as the ball had in fact come off Barcham and therefore a goal kick should instead have been awarded to Shrewsbury.

[...] Mark Stimson highlighted the financial benefits of his team's promotion, noting that large crowds would be expected for matches in League One against Leeds United, Norwich City and Southampton.|$|E
500|$|On March 12, Begaye {{announced}} {{his decision to}} keep the zoo open without expanding it and letting the remaining animals live out {{their lives on the}} zoo-grounds. According to Harry Walters, an anthropologist and former chairman of the Center for Diné Studies at Diné College in , the incident demonstrates a crucial difference between Navajo and Western culture in the way visions and supernatural experiences are handled: [...] "Rather than focus on the sightings to determine if who saw it was nuts or not – that's what a Westerner would do – <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it as a message: 'Are we going the way we should? Walters said.|$|E
500|$|In Kiev, Inna Shevchenko, a topless feminist activist {{from the}} group FEMEN, used a {{chainsaw}} to destroy a four-meter wooden sculpture of Christ on the cross, on a hill overlooking the city center. The cross had been erected during the Orange Revolution of 2004–2005, to commemorate victims of Stalin's repression. The desecration of the cross was repudiated by Maria Alyokhina of Pussy Riot, who said [...] "Their surprise displays and protests against authoritarianism are similar to us, but <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> feminism differently, especially the form of speech. We wouldn't take our clothes off, and will not. Their latest action, the sawing of the cross, does not create a feeling of solidarity, unfortunately." ...|$|E

Veteran catcher Luke Carlin said: They bring up Kipnis from Akron, and <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this little guy and say, 'Where did he come from, and {{what is he doing}} here?'

500|$|Ahimsa as {{an ethical}} concept evolved in Vedic texts. The oldest scripts, along with {{discussing}} ritual animal sacrifices, indirectly mention Ahimsa, {{but do not}} emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices {{and the concept of}} Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the concept that describes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words Satya (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra; later, the Yajur Veda dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, [...] "may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> each other with the eyes of a friend".|$|E

[...] He added that, unlike their promotion efforts for Ghost Stories, the band will tour for the seventh record. In an interview with Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 2, Martin hinted at the style of the album by saying that the band was trying to make something colourful and uplifting, yet not bombastic. He also stated that it will be something to [...] "shuffle your feet" [...] to.|$|E

500|$|Wizards & Warriors III {{received}} {{praise from}} Retro Gamer magazine in September2010, {{as part of}} its retrospective on the Wizards & Warriors series. They said that the third installment was the best game in the series as well as developer Ste Pickford's personal favorite, {{despite the fact that it}} did not sell as well as its predecessor Ironsword. Developer Ste Pickford said: [...] "Wizards & WarriorsIII was more like a game that I really wanted to make. IronSword was pretty much a straight sequel for a game dropped in our lap; <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it and tried to make a new version with some improvements." [...] Pickford added that, while he could have done better with both Ironsword and Wizards & WarriorsIII, he wished he would have been able to see the latter to its completion.|$|E
500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Yang as [...] "competitive", [...] "ambitious", and [...] "intelligent", {{while also}} noting her weaknesses: [...] "bossy", [...] "aggressive", and [...] "tactless". Oh {{said of her}} character: [...] "I've always tried to play Cristina with {{a tremendous amount of}} focus and ambition—which is the reality for a female surgeon. I mean, in real life there aren't many of them. But the ones you encounter are {{at the very top of}} their game. You have to have a kind of ascetic personality to survive." [...] James Pickens, Jr. who portrays Dr. Webber said: [...] "That character itself set a bar in terms of how <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> millennial women: independent yet vulnerable, seriously competitive yet caring." [...] Rhimes referred to Yang's relationship with Burke by the portmanteau [...] "Burktina", citing [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] as one of her favorite episodes featuring them because it shows their evolution from the beginning of the second season to its end.|$|E
500|$|Jason Cowley, {{reviewing}} {{the book in}} The Guardian, felt that Outliers was an argument between Gladwell and himself, referring to the many times that he uses the word [...] "we" [...] when defining his position, {{such as in the}} example: [...] "There is something profoundly wrong with the way <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> success. [...] We cling to the idea that success is a simple function of individual merit and that {{the world in which we}} grow up and the rules we choose to write as a society don't matter at all." [...] He also believed that there was a [...] "certain one-dimensional Americanness at work", observing that many of Gladwell's examples are from the United States, particularly in New York City. In an article about the book for The New York Times, Steven Pinker wrote, [...] "The reasoning in 'Outliers,' which consists of cherry-picked anecdotes, post-hoc sophistry and false dichotomies, had me gnawing on my Kindle." [...] In a review in The New Republic, Isaac Chotiner called the final chapter of Outliers [...] "impervious to all forms of critical thinking".|$|E
