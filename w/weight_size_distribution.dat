40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of frozen (− 18 °C) storage time on {{molecular}} <b>weight,</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution,</b> conformation, free amino groups and free sulfhydryl groups of gluten were studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) {{in conjunction with a}} size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and spectrophotometrically. The results showed that the gluten dissolved in 50 mM acetic acid appeared to be similar to quasi-spherical of the chain conformation and the slope of the conformation plot decreased during the storage. Both the molecular weight and radius of gyration of the frozen gluten decreased with the storage time showing a depolymerization in the high molecular weight fraction of gluten (10 5 Da ~ 10 9 Da). Therefore, at constant molecular weight the change of the chain conformation did not show a clear correlation with the storage time. The free amino groups content changed little and the free sulfhydryl groups content of the gluten increased from 9. 8 μmol/g for the control to 12. 87 μmol/g for 120 -day-stored gluten, indicating that the water redistribution and ice recrystallization lead to the breakage of the disulphide bonds and {{may be one of the}} reasons for the depolymerization of gluten polymer...|$|E
40|$|Pre-flocculation {{reduces the}} fouling of {{membranes}} in cross-flow microfiltration thus leading to {{high quality product}} water at economic filtration flux. As such, this hybrid system will {{have a major impact}} in treating the biologically treated sewage effluent. The pre-flocculation achieved through the floating medium flocculation (FMF) was found to increase the phosphorus removal up to 96 %. The decline in microfiltration permeate flux with time was reduced by the incorporation of flocculation. However, the improvement in the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was marginal (from 20 % with membrane alone to 46 % with membrane-flocculation hybrid system). The flocculation followed by adsorption as pretreatment helped to increase the DOC removal as high as 98 %. Flocculation was found to remove more than 66 % of colloidal effluent organic matter (EfOM). An attempt was also made to quantify the hydrophobic fraction in the pretreated effluent and to identify the molecular weight range of organics removed by the flocculation. The pre-treatment of flocculation was found to remove 62. 9 %, 68. 5 %, and 51. 6 % of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and transphilic organic matter.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to examine how {{addition}} of fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) influences the functional and antioxidative properties of fish calces. Hydrolysates from cod backbone were prepared in the laboratory and compared to hydrolysates from commercial producers in Denmark, USA and New Zealand. Two batches of hydrolysates were prepared enzymatically by mincing the backbones and digesting them with the endo-protease Protamex for either 20 or 50 minutes at 50 °C. A moderate increase in degree of hydrolysis and yield was observed by increasing the time of hydrolysis from 20 to 50 minutes. A decrease {{in the proportion of}} large peptides was detected with FPLC. FPH made in the laboratory with 50 minutes time of hydrolysis yielded the highest degree of hydrolysis of all tested powders. Norland had by far the lowest DH tested. FPLC also showed that the molecular <b>weight</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> of the FPHs made in the laboratory were quite similar to distribution of similarity to the MariPep powders. The Norland and Aroma powders molecular weight distribution were also similar to each other. Variations in frying yield of fish cakes were shown to be caused by differences in fat absorption. Fat absorption of the fish cakes was shown to be depend on the emulsifying properties of the added powder. For the FPH made in the laboratory, higher DH gave lower water holding capacity. Differences in the salt content of the hydrolysates caused the salt concentration of the fish cakes to vary, influencing the functional variables that were analysed. </p...|$|E

A two day period in July was selected for an apportionment study from eleven months of highly time resolved data collected at the Baltimore Supersite. Number concentration vs particle size data was partitioned into four size bins as follows: a nucleation mode (nm), fresh combustion (80 - 300 nm), secondary aerosol (0. 3 - 1 µm), and coarse particles (1 - 2. 5 µm). Two multivariate receptor model studies were completed using positive matrix factorization. The first model included size binned particle counts, the second, included binned particle mass concentrations. Using this combination of models, we identified eight factors.

A gap of knowledge remains as to how different processes contributing to the uncertainty in precipitation forecasts compare to each other. This research aims at gaining further insight into how two aspects influencing moist processes interrelate in atmospheric models. For this, high-resolution (3000 m) integrations with the non-hydrostatic Advanced Regional Prediction System were performed for two cases of extreme convection in Belgium, one driven by strong buoyancy and no vertical wind shear and the other driven by strong vertical wind shear and moderate buoyancy. Sensitivity experiments consisted of three integrations with different soil moisture initialization and three experiments with different <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> assumptions in the microphysical parametrization scheme. The gain of spatially distributed soil moisture information was small in our simulations, but it was found important {{to have at least}} the mean soil moisture content right for the realistic simulation of cold-pool intensity.

A subset of the most influential parameters of the model is identified using a parameter estimation approach by minimizing the errors between the predicted and measured data. Some parameters are also obtained from literature. The model is then validated in order to be used to compute optimal profiles of monomers feed-rates which minimize an objective function, subject to a set of tight operational constraints...|$|R

Converting a compressive force into a tensile one is inefficient- {{of the order of}} 1 to 2 percent. On the other hand, blasting shows energy efficiencies of the order of 10 to 20 %. Part of this difference is due to forces being applied directly in tension (from the inside-out), but also because the velocity of impact is orders of magnitude higher (10, 000 m·s- 1 versus 10 m·s- 1), i. e., the rate of energy input is very high (micro-seconds vs. seconds in conventional comminution). This paper reports on studies that show how the energy efficiency of comminution can be enhanced by high-velocity impact. This research project has carried out investigations into the relationship between energy efficiency with energy input level and impact velocity during rock fragmentation by metal projectiles. The project has also examined rock-on-rock breakage. Samples of magnetite particles of varying <b>weights</b> and <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> were impacted by a projectile at velocities from 50 m·s- 1 to 400 m·s- 1. The specific surface area of the sample was measured before and after each experiment, and the energy recovered as new surface energ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work {{some aspects of}} the {{dynamics}} of granular masses with reference to phenomena such as debris flows, dense snow avalanches and rock avalanches have been studied. The issue has been addressed experimentally by tests carried out at the Laboratory of Hydrogeology of the University of Padua. The results of the experimental tests have been used for the calibration of a particle numerical model, built to simulate the dynamics of dry granular masses. The experimental tests have been realized by releasing on the upstream plane of a channel formed by two tiltable planes, a fixed amount of granular material. The slope of the downstream plane has been set in order produce the stopping of the material. Granular materials different in shape, specific <b>weight,</b> particle <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> have been used. The evolution of the laboratory tests have been investigated by using a hardware and software system for the three-dimensional photogrammetric survey, which allowed the reconstruction of the shape of the outer surface of the moving granular mass, at choosen instants of time. The used numerical model solves the dynamics of the granular mass describing the motion of the individual particles with the second dynamics motion equation. The physical parameter essential for the description of the choosen rheology is the friction angle between the granular material and the planes bottom, which has been experimentally determined for the various material...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} in closed access. A multicriteria {{optimization}} procedure {{based on an}} evolutionary algorithm has been developed to determine the optimal control policies for a fed-batch emulsion copolymerization reactor, particularly for styrene and butyl acrylate {{in the presence of}} n-C 12 mercaptan as chain transfer agent (CTA). The process model was elaborated and validated experimentally in order to predict the global monomer conversion, the number and weight average molecular <b>weights,</b> the particle <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> and the residual monomers mass fraction. The process objectives were to produce core-shell particles (hard core and smooth shell) with specific end use properties and high productivity. This has been achieved by the maximization of the conversion {{at the end of the}} process and the minimization of the error between the glass transition temperature and a designed profile subject to a set of operational constraints. The nondominated Pareto solutions obtained were ranked according to a decision aid strategy based on a decision maker preferences and experience using multiple attribute utility theory (MAUT). Finally, the best solution was implemented experimentally...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} aimed to {{determine}} the species diversity, carapace width (CW) -body <b>weight</b> (BW) relationship, <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> and sex ratio of mud crab, genus scylla from Setiu Wetlands of Terengganu coastal waters, Malaysia. A total of 1, 000 crabs of various sizes (6 – 15 cm CW), sex and species were randomly collected during the monsoon season. The study showed that the mud crab species composition was dominated by Scylla olivacea (65. 0 %), followed by Scylla paramamosain (21. 8 %) and Scylla tranquebarica (13. 2 %). The male crabs were significantly bigger and heavier than females for all the mud crab species sampled. The rate of increase in body weight of S. olivacea {{was more than the}} other two mud crab species of S. paramamosain and S. tranquebarica. The dominant size range with respect to carapace width for all the mud crabs sampled was between 9. 0 cm and 9. 9 cm. The male crabs are relatively more abundant than the females for all the mud crab species sampled (1 : 0. 82) ...|$|R
