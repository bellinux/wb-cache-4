5|$|Members of the Akodon boliviensis group, {{including}} A.caenosus, {{are generally}} similar {{and difficult to}} separate, but they differ in relative cranial measurements and some other characters. A.spegazzinii is larger than A.caenosus; A.sylvanus is darker and has less contrast between the upper- and underparts and less <b>well-developed</b> eye-rings; A.polopi has a squared interorbital region and more <b>well-developed</b> ridges on its skull; and A.boliviensis is paler and has more densely furred ears.|$|E
5|$|The kakapo has a <b>well-developed</b> {{sense of}} smell, which {{complements}} its nocturnal lifestyle. It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported {{in only one}} other parrot species. One {{of the most striking}} characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour. Given their <b>well-developed</b> sense of smell, this odour may be a pheromone. The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapos.|$|E
5|$|Bahrain has a <b>well-developed</b> road network, {{particularly}} in Manama. The discovery {{of oil in}} the early 1930s accelerated the creation of multiple roads and highways in Bahrain, connecting several isolated villages, such as Budaiya, to Manama.|$|E
5|$|G. minor {{is unusual}} because it {{frequently}} is found with embryonic skeletons of the enantiornithine bird Gobipipus. These embryos have <b>well-developed</b> wings, which suggest {{they would be}} able to fly very soon after hatching, unlike most modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has cream {{spore print}} {{with a slight}} salmon tinge. The spores are oval, with largish warts of around 1 {{micrometre}} (μm) which are joined by a <b>well-developed</b> network of mostly thin ridges. The spores measure 7.5–11μm by 6.5–9μm, and are amyloid or ellipsoid in shape.|$|E
5|$|Larva: Lepidoptera larvae {{are known}} as caterpillars, and have a <b>well-developed</b> head and mandibles. They can have from zero to five pairs of prolegs, usually four.|$|E
5|$|Oecomys sydandersoni is an {{arboreal}} {{species of}} rodent in the genus Oecomys. It lives in forest patches {{in a small}} area in eastern Bolivia. It is a medium-sized species, weighing about , with mostly grayish and brownish fur and short and broad hindfeet with <b>well-developed</b> pads.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys {{species have}} a large skull with a short rostrum and high braincase. The interorbital region, located between the eyes, is narrowest {{to the front and}} is flanked by <b>well-developed</b> beads at its margins. The {{zygomatic}} plate is broad and has a <b>well-developed</b> zygomatic notch at its front. The zygomatic arch is robust and contains a small but distinct jugal bone. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is narrow and short; its narrowness is a synapomorphy for O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat according to Weksler's analysis. The incisive foramina are long, with their back margin {{at the front of the}} first molars or further back. The palate is also long, extending beyond the back margin of the maxillary bone, and is perforated near the third molars by <b>well-developed</b> posterolateral palatal pits. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some other oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The auditory bullae are large. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. In the mandible (lower jaw), the coronoid process, a process at the back, is well developed and the capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone housing the root of the lower incisor, is conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels seem to {{be largely}} free of blood parasites, even when in close {{proximity}} to carrier species such as the yellow-legged gull. It has been suggested that seabird species with long incubation periods and long lives have <b>well-developed</b> immune systems that prevent serious blood parasitism.|$|E
5|$|The Pug is a {{breed of}} dog with {{physically}} distinctive {{features of a}} wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes {{in a variety of}} colours, most often fawn or black, and a compact square body with <b>well-developed</b> muscles.|$|E
5|$|The country {{also has}} a <b>well-developed</b> {{education}} system, with one in eleven adults holding a tertiary degree. Given the country’s solid knowledge base and abundant natural resources, Zimbabwe {{has the potential to}} figure among the countries leading growth in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020.|$|E
5|$|The extraocular {{muscles of}} the walrus are <b>well-developed.</b> This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to {{protrude}} its eyes and see in both a frontal and dorsal direction. However, vision in this species {{appears to be more}} suited for short-range.|$|E
5|$|The <b>well-developed</b> upper incisors have orange enamel {{at their}} front {{surfaces}} and are slightly opisthodont (with their cutting edge behind the vertical {{plane of the}} incisors). The molars are brachyodont (low-crowned) and bear crests and cusps arranged in pairs opposite each other. The front cusp of M1, the anterocone, {{is divided into two}} smaller cusps {{on each side of the}} tooth by a valley, the anteromedian flexus. Both M1 and the second molar (M2) have a <b>well-developed</b> mesoloph (a crest near the middle of the tooth). Although M3 is relatively large, its back part is reduced.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{attaining}} typhoon status, Meranti turned {{towards the}} northeast {{in response to}} a strengthening near-equatorial ridge south of the typhoon. Visible satellite images of the typhoon depicted a small, ragged eye within a <b>well-developed</b> cyclone. Gale-force winds extended 155km (100mi) at this time. <b>Well-developed</b> outflow allowed the storm to maintain its peak intensity for roughly 18hours before dry air became entrained in the circulation. The combined effects of decreasing sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear caused Meranti to quickly weaken. By 0600UTC on August6, the eye was no longer visible on satellite imagery and several hours later deep convection rapidly diminished, leading to both agencies downgrading the typhoon to a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|Zimbabwe has {{relatively}} <b>well-developed</b> {{national infrastructure}} and a long-standing tradition of promoting {{research and development}} (R), {{as evidenced by the}} levy imposed on tobacco-growers since the 1930s to promote market research.|$|E
5|$|Afrasia {{is known}} from four {{isolated}} molar teeth {{found in the}} Pondaung Formation of Myanmar. These teeth {{are similar to those}} of Afrotarsius and Eosimiidae, and differ only in details of the chewing surface. For example, the back part of the third lower molar is relatively <b>well-developed.</b> In the Pondaung Formation, Afrasia was part of a diverse primate community that also includes the eosimiid Bahinia and members of the families Amphipithecidae and Sivaladapidae.|$|E
5|$|Another {{choke point}} has been Main Street in New Paltz, a section shared by NY32 and NY299. This {{is the main}} route back to the Thruway and downstate from the heavily used hiking and {{climbing}} areas at Mohonk Preserve and Minnewaska State Park Preserve in the Shawangunks. It is also a <b>well-developed</b> commercial area in a college town, with ample street parking.|$|E
5|$|Canada has a <b>well-developed</b> media sector, but its {{cultural}} output; particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines, is often overshadowed by imports from the United States. As a result, {{the preservation of}} a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and {{institutions such as the}} Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{with all}} insects, {{the anatomy of}} the termite thorax {{consists}} of three segments: the prothorax, the mesothorax and the metathorax. Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the wings are located at the mesothorax and metathorax. The mesothorax and metathorax have <b>well-developed</b> exoskeletal plates; the prothorax has smaller plates.|$|E
5|$|Metalwork was an {{important}} and <b>well-developed</b> craft, and metal tools such as axes, mammoties and hoes were widely used. Weapons and tools of iron and steel were produced in large scale for the military. A good indication {{of the development of}} metalwork of this period is the Lovamahapaya, which had been roofed entirely with copper.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria is {{classified}} as a mixed economy emerging market, and has already reached lower middle income status according to the World Bank, with its abundant supply of natural resources, <b>well-developed</b> financial, legal, communications, transport sectors and stock exchange (the Nigerian Stock Exchange), which is the second largest in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys nelsoni was {{distinctive}} in {{its large}} skull with broad, <b>well-developed</b> incisors {{and a strong}} front part (rostrum) that is strongly curved downwards. In O.albiventer, the rostrum and incisors were not as massive, but the molars are larger. The interparietal bone, part of {{the roof of the}} braincase, was broad and the incisive foramina, which perforated the palate between the incisors and the molars, were relatively short.|$|E
5|$|Present weather, which present {{restrictions}} to visibility or {{presence of}} thunder or squalls, {{are reported in}} observations to indicate to aviation any possible threats during landings and takeoffs from airports. Types included in surface weather observations include precipitation, obscurations, other weather phenomena such as, <b>well-developed</b> dust/sand whirls, squalls, tornadic activity, sandstorms, volcanic ash, and dust storms.|$|E
5|$|Satyanarayana, an aged MP, visits Ramapuram. After {{talking to}} the locals, Satyanarayana finds that Ramapuram is <b>well-developed</b> and civilised due to the {{activities}} of a man named Suryam. He meets Suryam and asks him what inspired him {{to take up the}} task of developing Ramapuram. After learning of Satyanarayana interest in Ramapuram's development, Suryam agrees to relate the village's story in the parliament.|$|E
5|$|Specimens of Archaeopteryx {{were most}} notable for their <b>well-developed</b> flight feathers. They were {{markedly}} asymmetrical {{and showed the}} structure of flight feathers in modern birds, with vanes given stability by a barb-barbule-barbicel arrangement. The tail feathers were less asymmetrical, again {{in line with the}} situation in modern birds and also had firm vanes. The thumb did not yet bear a separately movable tuft of stiff feathers.|$|E
5|$|The Dhyana mantras in the Purashcharyarnava and the Tantrasara {{describe}} Matangi as blue in colour. The {{crescent moon}} adorns her forehead. She has three {{eyes and a}} smiling face. She wears jewellery and is seated on a jewelled throne. In her four arms, she carries a noose, a sword, a goad, and a club. Her waist is slim and her breasts <b>well-developed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The M2 {{is similar}} to that of eosimiids and almost {{identical}} to that of Afrotarsius libycus. It shows <b>well-developed</b> small accessory cusps (the paraconule and metaconule) that are connected to equally <b>well-developed</b> crests. The conules are stronger than in Eosimias and Bahinia, but weaker than in Phileosimias. The stylar shelf, the outer area of the tooth, is broad, particularly at the metacone cusp. However, the shelf is better developed near the paracone cusp in Afrasia than in Afrotarsius, which makes the ectoflexus (an invagination in the outer wall of the tooth) more symmetrical in the former. The parastyle, a small cusp in the outer front corner of the tooth, is located more buccally (towards the outer side of the tooth) than in Afrotarsius and is larger. The stylar shelf is larger than that of Bahinia and Phileosimias, but smaller than that of Eosimias. The parastyle is also less developed than in Eosimias, but the protocone, the main cusp on the lingual side of the tooth, is more expansive. The lingual cingulum is incomplete; it is stronger in Phenacopithecus.|$|E
5|$|The Noronha skink {{is covered}} with light and dark spots above, but there is {{substantial}} variation in the precise colors. There are no longitudinal stripes. The scales on the underparts are yellowish or grayish. The eyelids are white to yellow. It has a small head with small nostrils, which are placed far to the front {{at the sides of}} the head. The mouth contains small and conical teeth and a thin but <b>well-developed</b> tongue. The eyes are small and placed laterally and contain dark, rounded irises. There are three to five <b>well-developed</b> auricular lobules (small projections) in front of the ears; these lobules are absent in true Mabuya. The hindlimbs are longer and stronger than the forelimbs, which are small. The tail is longer than the body and is muscular but very brittle. It is nearly cylindrical in form and tapers towards the end.|$|E
5|$|The {{circuits}} in the cerebellum {{are similar}} across all classes of vertebrates, including fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. There {{is also an}} analogous brain structure in cephalopods with <b>well-developed</b> brains, such as octopuses. This has been taken {{as evidence that the}} cerebellum performs functions important to all animal species with a brain.|$|E
5|$|The last lower molar, m3, {{is smaller}} {{and has a}} longer talonid, with a <b>well-developed</b> hypoconulid lobe at the back, and {{generally}} resembles that of Phenacopithecus, but the trigonid is smaller. The paraconid is distinct. The hypoconulid lobe is longer than in Afrotarsius and the entoconid is located further to the front. Unlike on m2, there is no notch between the hypoconulid and entoconid, though a shallow valley is present.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the nasal {{chambers}} of Ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was unidirectional, (looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), although it {{may also have been}} bidirectional in the posterior nasal chamber, which directed air past the olfactory lobes. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a <b>well-developed</b> sense of smell, and the position of the orbits of Ankylosaurus suggest some stereoscopic vision.|$|E
5|$|The <b>well-developed</b> {{compound}} {{eyes were}} stalked. The striking morphological similarities {{of the eyes}} of Waptia fieldensis to that of extant mysid shrimp make it very likely that they were capable of producing true visual images or were at least sensitive to motion. A median eye may have also been present. Nervous tissue, including a putative brain, has been identified.|$|E
5|$|There is a <b>well-developed</b> social {{structure}} within {{large groups of}} condors, with competition to determine a 'pecking order' by body language, competitive play behavior, and vocalizations. Generally, mature males tend {{to be at the}} top of the pecking order, with post-dispersal immature males tending to be near the bottom.|$|E
5|$|There is no anterocone on M2, {{but a large}} anteroloph {{is present}} {{in front of the}} paracone. There is a protoflexus—an {{indentation}} in the crown in front of the protocone. As in M1, the paracone is connected to the front or middle of the protocone, the mesoloph is <b>well-developed,</b> and the valleys meet at the midline of the tooth. There are three roots: two at the labial and one at the lingual side.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most bony fish, {{sharks are}} K-selected reproducers, {{meaning that they}} produce {{a small number of}} <b>well-{{developed}}</b> young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young. Fecundity in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle. Sharks mature slowly relative to many other fish. For example, lemon sharks reach sexual maturity at around age 13–15.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-pressure}} area {{developed into}} a weak tropical depression on September24 off the north coast of Honduras in the western Caribbean Sea. It was initially disorganized, without a <b>well-developed</b> circulation. On September25, while still a tropical depression, the system was named Debbie. Without intensifying further, the depression crossed the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula on September26. The next day, the depression turned toward the north in the central Gulf of Mexico before beginning a northeast motion. On September28, Debbie intensified into a tropical storm, attaining peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). This occurred after the storm developed two distinct spiral rainbands.|$|E
