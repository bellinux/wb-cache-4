500|$|<b>William</b> <b>Butler</b> Yeats– <b>Yeats</b> {{wrote an}} essay on Noh titled [...] "Certain Noble Plays of Japan" [...] in 1916. As much {{as he tried to}} learn Noh, there were limited {{resources}} available in England at the time. The lack of complete understanding of Noh led him to create innovative works guided by his own imagination and what he fantasized Noh to be. Yeats wrote four plays heavily influenced by Noh, using ghosts or supernatural beings as the central dramatis personæ for the first time. The plays are At the Hawk's Well, The Dreaming of the Bones, The Words upon the Window-Fane, and Purgatory.|$|R
40|$|Note: p. 67 missing, Handwritten {{changes have}} been made. It {{is the purpose of}} this thesis to show <b>William</b> <b>Butler</b> <b>Yeat’s</b> {{development}} towards unity in his work and life, and how symbolism provided for him that focal point where his life and work could converge. In the epilogue to “A Vision” Yeats drops his mask, and reveals the uncertainty which had followed him, wraithlike, throughout his life. “Day after day I have sat in my chair turning a symbol over in my mind, exploring its details, defining and again defining its elements, testing my convictions and those of others by its unity, attempting to substitute particulars for an abstraction like that of Algebra. I have felt the convictions of a lifetime melt through at an age when the mind should be rigid, and others take their place, and these in turn give way to others…… Then I draw myself up into the symbol and it seems as if I should know all if I could but banish such memories and find everything in the symbol. ” This statement, made at the end of Yeats’s life, shows the importance of the symbol to himself and to his work. Through the medium of symbolism Yeats produced {{some of the most beautiful}} lyric poetry of our age, and its excellence testifies to the intense personal interest he had in the symbol. It was a faith for him, to which he willingly dedicated his life and his work. Because of the personal importance of the symbol, he had to define his theories of symbolism precisely, and in essays and letters, he constantly clarified his theories [ [...] . ...|$|R
5|$|Augusta, Lady Gregory retold many of {{the legends}} of Cú Chulainn in her 1902 book Cuchulain of Muirthemne, which paraphrased the originals but also romanticized some of the tales and omitted most of the more violent content. This first {{translation}} was very popular, supported by the Celtic Revival movement. It featured an introduction by her friend <b>William</b> <b>Butler</b> <b>Yeats,</b> who wrote several pieces based on the legend, including the plays On Baile's Strand (1904), The Green Helmet (1910), At the Hawk's Well (1917), The Only Jealousy of Emer (1919) and The Death of Cuchulain (1939), and a poem, Cuchulain's Fight with the Sea (1892).|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October 1962, Plath {{experienced}} a great burst {{of creativity and}} wrote most of the poems on which her reputation now rests, writing at least 26 of the poems of her posthumous collection Ariel during the final months of her life. In December 1962, she returned alone to London with their children, and rented, on a five-year lease, a flat at 23 Fitzroy Road—only a few streets from the Chalcot Square flat. <b>William</b> <b>Butler</b> <b>Yeats</b> once lived in the house, which bears an English Heritage blue plaque for the Irish poet. Plath was pleased by this fact and considered it a good omen.|$|E
5|$|Isabella Augusta, Lady Gregory (née Persse; 15 March 1852 – 22 May 1932) was an Irish dramatist, folklorist and theatre manager. With <b>William</b> <b>Butler</b> <b>Yeats</b> and Edward Martyn, she co-founded the Irish Literary Theatre and the Abbey Theatre, {{and wrote}} {{numerous}} short works for both companies. Lady Gregory produced {{a number of}} books of retellings of stories taken from Irish mythology. Born into a class that identified closely with British rule, she turned against it. Her conversion to cultural nationalism, as evidenced by her writings, was emblematic of many of the political struggles to occur in Ireland during her lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Of Anglo-Irish descent, <b>William</b> <b>Butler</b> <b>Yeats</b> {{was born}} at Sandymount in County Dublin, Ireland. His father, John Butler Yeats (1839–1922), was a {{descendant}} of Jervis Yeats, a Williamite soldier, linen merchant, and well-known painter who died in 1712. Benjamin Yeats, Jervis's grandson and William's great-great-grandfather, had in 1773 married Mary Butler of a landed family in County Kildare. Following their marriage, they kept the name Butler in the family name. Mary was a descendant of the Butler of Ormond family from the Neigham (pronounced Nyam) Gowran branch of the family. They were descendants of the first Earls of Ormond.|$|E
5|$|During 1929, {{he stayed}} at Thoor Ballylee near Gort in County Galway (where Yeats had his summer home since 1919) {{for the last}} time. Much of the {{remainder}} of his life was lived outside Ireland, although he did lease Riversdale house in the Dublin suburb of Rathfarnham in 1932. He wrote prolifically through his final years, and published poetry, plays, and prose. In 1938, he attended the Abbey for the final time to see the premiere of his play Purgatory. His Autobiographies of <b>William</b> <b>Butler</b> <b>Yeats</b> was published that same year. In 1913, Yeats wrote the preface for the English translation of Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali (Song Offering) for which Tagore received Nobel Prize in literature.|$|E
5|$|Well-known poets of the Edwardian {{era of the}} 1890s, such as Alfred Austin, Stephen Phillips, and William Watson, {{had been}} working {{very much in the}} shadow of Tennyson, {{producing}} weak imitations of the poetry of the Victorian era. They continued to work in this vein into {{the early years of the}} 20th century. As the new century opened, Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate, a post he held up to 1913. In the century's first decade, poetry still had a large audience; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy's The Dynasts, Christina Rossetti's posthumous Poetical Works, Ernest Dowson's Poems, George Meredith's Last Poems, Robert Service's Ballads of a Cheechako and John Masefield's Ballads and Poems. Future Nobel Prize winner <b>William</b> <b>Butler</b> <b>Yeats</b> was devoting much of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage, producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period. In 1907, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Rudyard Kipling.|$|E

In 1908 she founded the embroidery department of Cuala Industries, with which she was involved until its dissolution in 1931. She is known for her embroidered pictures.|$|R

25|$|Theosophy {{was also}} an {{influence}} {{over a number of}} early pioneers of abstract art. The Russian abstract expressionist Wassily Kandinsky was very interested in Theosophy and Theosophical ideas about colour. The Dutch abstract artist Piet Mondrian was also influenced by Theosophical symbolism. Theosophical ideas were also an influence on the Irish literary movement of the late 19th and early 20th century, with writers like Charles Johnston, George Russell, John Eglinton, Charles Weeks, and <b>William</b> <b>Butler</b> <b>Yeats</b> having an interest in the movement.|$|E

Well known Irish poets include Patrick Kavanagh, Thomas McCarthy, Dermot Bolger, and Nobel Prize in Literature laureates <b>William</b> <b>Butler</b> <b>Yeats</b> and Seamus Heaney (born in Northern Ireland but resided in Dublin).

25|$|Literary critics such as Wesley D. Sweetser and S. T. Joshi see Machen's {{works as}} a {{significant}} part of the late Victorian revival of the gothic novel and the decadent movement of the 1890s, bearing direct comparison to the themes found in contemporary works like Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. At the time authors like Wilde, <b>William</b> <b>Butler</b> <b>Yeats,</b> and Arthur Conan Doyle were all admirers of Machen's works. He is also usually noted in the better studies of Anglo-Welsh literature. The French writer Paul-Jean Toulet translated Machen's The Great God Pan into French and visited Machen in London. Charles Williams was also a devotee of Machen's work, which inspired Williams' own fiction.|$|E
