5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and cobbing the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls in their late teens forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to sort the ore ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of ore left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable ore from <b>waste</b> <b>rock.</b> Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken ore per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and bucking did not take place. Instead, the chunks of spalled ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin ore from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{investigation}} of the characteristics of the <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> of Xinqiao pyrite mine in Tongling, the possibility of AMD was discussed, and the speciation of Pb in the <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> was studied by the improved five steps sequential extraction method. The results reveal that the NP is less than the AP, the <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> have a high acid potential and produce AMD. The speciation of Pb in the <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> exist mainly in the silicate, secondly in deoxidize and oxidizable mode. But the Pb contents in the deoxidize mode are correlative to the total contents in <b>waste</b> <b>rocks,</b> if the <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> react with the AMD, the Pb in the deoxidize and oxidizable modes may easily release from the <b>waste</b> <b>rocks.</b> So the Pb has high environmental risk...|$|R

The proposed analytical system of the XRD-XRF-ICP-GC methods enables to conduct an examination of carboniferous <b>waste</b> <b>rocks.</b> The offered system of chemical testing is less time consuming and much more efficient.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether the application of phosphate compounds (phosphorite rock, phosphate fertilizer) to polyminerallic <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> can inhibit sulfide oxidation and metal mobility (Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Ni, Mn, Mg). <b>Waste</b> <b>rocks</b> comprised sulfidic carbonaceous shales and were sourced from the Century Pb–Zn mine, NW Queensland, Australia. The acid producing, Pb–Zn rich rocks consisted of major quartz, muscovite/illite, dolomite, siderite and kaolinite as well as smaller amounts of sulfide minerals (e. g. galena, sphalerite, pyrite). Laboratory leach experiments were conducted on finely granulated phosphate-treated <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> (> 2 to < 30 mm) over 13 weeks, whereas phosphate amendment of coarsely granulated <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> (sand to boulder size) was investigated using heap leach piles at the mine site over an 11 months period. Results of the laboratory experiments demonstrate that the treatment of finely granulated <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> with phosphorite rock produced leachates with near-neutral pH values due to calcite dissolution. This in turn did not allow the leaching of apatite, formation of secondary phosphate phases and phosphate stabilization to occur. Metal mobility in these amended wastes was restricted by the dissolution of calcite and the resultant near-neutral pH conditions. By contrast, the application of the water-soluble phosphate fertilizer MKP (KH 2 PO 4) to polyminerallic sulfidic <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> during the shortterm laboratory experiments led to the formation of phosphate coatings and precipitates and inhibited acid and metal release (Cd, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn). At least in the short term, the application of phosphate fertilizers proved to be an effective method. However, results of the long-term field trials demonstrate that coarsely granulated <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> were not coated by secondary phosphate phases and that amendment by phosphorite rock or superphosphate fertilizer did not improve leachate quality compared to the unamended waste. Thus, phosphate stabilization appears ineffective in suppressing oxidation of sulfides in coarsely granulated mine wastes...|$|R

25|$|In-situ {{leaching}} (ISL), {{also known}} as solution mining, or in-situ recovery (ISR) in North America, involves leaving the ore where {{it is in the}} ground, and recovering the minerals from it by dissolving them and pumping the pregnant solution to the surface where the minerals can be recovered. Consequently, there is little surface disturbance and no tailings or <b>waste</b> <b>rock</b> generated. However, the orebody needs to be permeable to the liquids used, and located so that they do not contaminate ground water away from the orebody.|$|E
25|$|Sub-surface mining {{consists}} of digging tunnels or shafts {{into the earth}} to reach buried ore deposits. Ore, for processing, and <b>waste</b> <b>rock,</b> for disposal, are brought to the surface through the tunnels and shafts. Sub-surface mining can be classified {{by the type of}} access shafts used, the extraction method or the technique used to reach the mineral deposit. Drift mining utilizes horizontal access tunnels, slope mining uses diagonally sloping access shafts, and shaft mining utilizes vertical access shafts. Mining in hard and soft rock formations require different techniques.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSedimentary {{phosphate}} mines produce {{millions of}} tons of <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> during their open-pit mining. In addition, during ore phosphate beneficiation, fluorapatite is separated from associated gangue minerals by a combination of successive mineral processing steps that involve crushing / screening, washing, and flotation. These operations generate large volume of tailings (called phosphate sludge) that are deposited in large surface ponds and <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> stockpiled within the mining site. The potential reuse of these phosphate mine by-products (<b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> and sludge) has been investigated in the last 10 years. The first investigated option consisted in using the alkaline <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> (APW) to control the acid mine drainage (AMD). Indeed, these alkaline mine wastes contain significant quantities of calcite (46 wt%) and dolomite (16 wt%) that help in neutralizing the acidity generated by the wastes from the closed Kettara mine, located near Marrakech, Morocco. The addition of 15 wt% APW to the coarse Kettara tailings produced leachates with significantly lower acidity and metal loads in comparison to the un-amended control sample. Secondly, the efficiency of APW was assessed in the laboratory as an alternative alkaline material for passive AMD water treatment. In semi-arid climate, the oxic passive treatment has been proven to be the most suitable. The pH of the water and its quality were significantly improved. As a third option, the hydrogeotechnical characterization of original and screened phosphate limestone <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> as well as the phosphate sludge showed their suitability for use as a component of store-and-release (SR) covers for industrial mine site reclamation. Lab tests (columns) and field tests (instrumented columns and experimental cells) showed that water infiltration can be controlled, even for extreme rainfall events (150 mm/day), by 1 m thick of a SR cover made with APW. Further research is currently being investigated around the recycling and valorization of phosphate sludge from phosphate mines as ceramics. Furthermore, the overburden of the phosphates sedimentary basins are mainly composed of marls; limestones blocks; silex bed; silex nodule; marls and clays; silicified limestone; which have a significant reuse potential as marble-mosaic floor, mortars and concrete, and natural stone products slabs for floors and stairs...|$|R

40|$|Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) {{prediction}} {{is complicated by}} the number and complexity of influencing parameters. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of particle size and mineral liberation on the production of ARD. This information was used to classify <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> from an Australian mine site for their potential use as cover material. Samples were crushed and sieved into different particle size fractions, and were subjected to varying static and kinetic tests including paste-pH, Acid-Neutralization-Capacity tests, kinetic Net Acid Generation tests and Humidity Cell tests. The results showed a strong influence of particle size, which can be attributed to the widely different mineral liberation characteristics of acid generating and neutralizing minerals. Whereas standard Acid Base Accounting (ABA) resulted in an uncertain or Non Acid Forming classification of open-pit <b>waste</b> <b>rocks,</b> the application of modified ABA test procedures using different particle size fractions resulted in an uncertain or Potentially Acid Forming classification of the very same material. The study demonstrated that the standard ABA procedure may lead to erroneous classification with potentially costly environmental consequences by overlooking particle size specific mineral liberation effects. Testing different particle size classes proved to be a practicable method to investigate the ARD characteristics of <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> and to gain a clearer insight into the consequences of mineral liberation...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the natural attenuation of antimony (Sb) in the drainage water {{of an abandoned}} mine. Drainage water, <b>waste</b> <b>rocks,</b> and ocherous precipitates collected from the mine were investigated {{in terms of their}} miner-alogy and chemistry. The chemistry of the drainage water was analyzed by measuring pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and electric conductivity on site as well as by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and ion chromatog-raphy. As the drainage flowed downstream, the pH decreased rapidly from 7. 05 to 3. 26 and then increased slowly to 3. 50. In a section where the pH increased, ocherous precipitates occur on a drainage water channel. We determined Sb levels in the drainage water, and the distribution of Sb in the mineral phases of <b>waste</b> <b>rocks</b> and precipitates was estimated by means of a sequential extraction procedure.
