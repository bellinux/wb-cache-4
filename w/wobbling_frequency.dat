40|$|The {{wobbling}} {{motion of}} a triaxial rotor coupled to a high-j quasiparticle is treated semiclassi- cally. Longitudinal and transverse coupling regimes {{can be distinguished}} depending on, respectively, whether the quasiparticle angular momentum is oriented parallel or perpendicular to the rotor axis with the largest moment of inertia. Simple analytical expressions for the <b>wobbling</b> <b>frequency</b> and the electromagnetic E 2 and M 1 transition probabilities are derived assuming rigid alignment of the quasiparticle {{with one of the}} rotor axes and harmonic oscillations (HFA). Transverse wobbling is characterized by a decrease of the <b>wobbling</b> <b>frequency</b> with increasing angular momentum. Two examples for transverse wobbling, 163 Lu and 135 Pr, are studied in the framework of the full triax- ial particle-rotor model and the HFA. The signature of transverse wobbling, decreasing <b>wobbling</b> <b>frequency</b> and enhanced E 2 inter-band transitions, is found in agreement with experiment. Comment: Phys. Rev.

40|$|The {{amplitude}} of oscillations of the freely wobbling kink in the ϕ^ 4 theory decays due to the emission of second-harmonic radiation. We study the compensation of these radiation losses (as well as additional dissipative losses) by the resonant driving of the kink. We consider both direct and parametric driving at a range of resonance frequencies. In each case, we derive the amplitude equations which describe {{the evolution of the}} {{amplitude of}} the wobbling and the kink's velocity. These equations predict multistability and hysteretic transitions in the wobbling amplitude for each driving frequency [...] the conclusion verified by numerical simulations of the full partial differential equation. We show that the strongest parametric resonance occurs when the driving frequency equals the natural <b>wobbling</b> <b>frequency</b> and not double that value. For direct driving, the strongest resonance is at half the natural frequency, {{but there is also a}} weaker resonance when the driving frequency equals the natural <b>wobbling</b> <b>frequency</b> itself. We show that this resonance is accompanied by translational motion of the kink. Comment: 19 pages in a double-column format; 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{wobbling}} motion excited on triaxial superdeformed nuclei is {{studied in}} terms of the cranked shell model plus random phase approximation. Firstly, by calculating at a low rotational frequency the γ-dependence of the three moments of inertia associated with the wobbling motion, the mechanism of the appearance of the wobbling motion in positive-γ nuclei is clarified theoretically [...] the rotational alignment of the π i_ 13 / 2 quasiparticle(s) is the essential condition. This indicates that the wobbling motion is a collective motion that is sensitive to the single-particle alignment. Secondly, we prove that the observed unexpected rotational-frequency dependence of the <b>wobbling</b> <b>frequency</b> is an outcome of the rotational-frequency dependent dynamical moments of inertia.

40|$|The {{existence}} of one-phonon and possible two-phonon transverse wobbling bands is {{proposed for the}} first time in two even-even nuclei, ^ 134 Ce and ^ 136 Nd. The predominant E 2 character of the Δ I = 1 transitions connecting the one-phonon wobbling band in ^ 134 Ce to the two-quasiparticle yrast band supports the wobbling interpretation. The extracted <b>wobbling</b> <b>frequencies</b> decrease with increasing spin, indicating the transverse character of the wobbling motion, with the angular momenta of the two quasiparticles aligned perpendicular to the axis of collective rotation. A candidate for two-phonon wobbling motion is also proposed in ^ 136 Nd.

Wobbling bands with n_ω = 0 and 1 are identified along with the interconnecting Δ I = 1, E 2 transitions, which are {{regarded as one of the}} characteristic features of the wobbling motion. An increase in <b>wobbling</b> <b>frequency</b> with spin implies longitudinal wobbling for ^ 133 La, in contrast with the case of transverse wobbling observed in ^ 135 Pr. This is the first observation of a longitudinal wobbling band in nuclei.

40|$|The {{recently}} reported wobbling bands in $^{ 135 }$Pr are {{investigated by the}} collective Hamiltonian, in which the collective parameters, including the collective potential and the mass parameter, are respectively determined from the tilted axis cranking (TAC) model and the harmonic frozen alignment (HFA) formula. It is shown that the experimental energy spectra of both yrast and wobbling bands are well reproduced by the collective Hamiltonian. It is confirmed that the wobbling mode in $^{ 135 }$Pr changes from transverse to longitudinal with the rotational frequency. The mechanism of this transition is revealed by analyzing the effective moments of inertia of the three principal axes, and the corresponding variation trend of the <b>wobbling</b> <b>frequency</b> {{is determined by the}} softness and shapes of the collective potential.

Solving the collective Hamiltonian by diagonalization, the energies and the wave functions of the wobbling states are obtained. The obtained results are compared with those by harmonic approximation formula and particle rotor model. The wobbling energies calculated by the collective Hamiltonian are closer to the exact solutions by particle rotor model than harmonic approximation formula. It is confirmed that the <b>wobbling</b> <b>frequency</b> increases with the rotational frequency in simple and longitudinal wobbling motions while decreases in transverse wobbling motion.

5000|$|DVD+R and DVD+RW have a {{constant}} <b>wobble</b> <b>frequency</b> of 817.4 kHz, but encodes its addressing information by periodically inverting {{the phase of}} the wobble signal (bi-phase modulation) to encode an exact address of the location on the spiral track (Address in Pregroove).

The spectrum of the atmospheric wind excitation function shows a striking peak near the 14 -month period. As a result, the atmospheric (wind plus pressure) excitation function shows exactly the same power {{as that of the}} geodetic excitation function inferred from the observed wobble at the Chandler <b>wobble</b> <b>frequency</b> (about 14 months), suggesting that the atmosphere excited the Chandler wobble between 1980 and 1993.

40|$|In this study, a novel lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) of CO 2 {{dissolution}} at porous {{scale is}} proposed and developed {{to predict the}} CO 2 dispersion and dissolution in geo-formations. The developed LBM dissolution model consists of an interfacial momentum interaction model, a mass transfer model and a convection (advection) model. Shen-Chen’s pseudopotential model using Equation of State (EOS) of real fluids is tested for momentum interaction model. It is found that a sharp interface can be maintained by optimizing the interaction strengths of two fluids with minimum numerical diffusion in the interfacial momentum interaction model. This {{makes it possible to}} model physical diffusion and interfacial tension individually. A new diffusion force, describing the particle diffusion driving by chemical potential at given solubility, is proposed for mass transfer model by applying the interparticle interaction pseudopotential concept. The dissolution is governed by coupling mechanism of diffusion and convection. The interface between the solute of CO 2 and solvent water is monitored by the solubility, which changes and indicates the moving of interface as CO 2 dissolving. The solution is considered as the mixture of dissolved CO 2 and water. Instead of using an additional Lattice that is requested by the existed LBM, the further dispersion of dissolved solutes is attached to the Lattice of water, by which the cost of computing memory size and time is significantly reduced. The developed LBM dissolution model is calibrated by the data from Lab experiment of dissolution of CO 2 droplet in water at a state of CO 2 geological storage about 1000 m depth. The calibration is made by comparison of simulation results with the data, in terms of the shrinking rate of CO 2 droplet and the concentration distribution of dissolved CO 2 in the solution layer. As the whole, the numerical predictions are well agreement with those of lab experiment. The developed model is then applied to investigate the mechanism of dispersion and dissolution of CO 2 droplet in channels at pore scale, in terms {{of the effects of the}} Eo number, channel width and channel tilt angle. It is found under the state at 1000 m depth that it is difficult for a dissolving CO 2 droplet, unlike that of an immiscible droplet, to reach to a ’terminal velocity’. Because of the shrinking, dissolving CO 2 droplets accelerate from a quiescent state to a maximum velocity and then decelerate in the channels. The ratio of droplet diameter (Do) to channel width (Lx), M=Do/Lx, and the inclination are the parameters that significantly affect the dynamics of dissolving CO 2 droplets. The smaller the channel width or the tilt angle of the pores of the geoformation, the slower of stored CO 2 can penetrate vertically and dissolve out. While, as the channel width increases to provide enough space, M< 1, the shrinking rate is independent of the channel width and wobbling of droplets is observed at the region with the Re number of 300 - 600 and the Eo number of 20 - 43. The interactions of droplets in the channels (M= 1 and M= 0. 3) are investigated by simulating of a pair of droplets dispersion and dissolution, with an initial distance of 4. 5 times of droplet diameter. Comparison is made to that of single droplet in terms of the rising velocity and shrinking rate. It is found that the shrinking rate of the upper droplet is larger than that of the following droplet when the following droplet moves into the solution field of the upper droplet. The following droplet rises, when M= 1 and M= 0. 3, faster than that of the upper droplet and also than that of the single droplet under the same conditions. The coalescence of two droplets is observed in the channel at M= 0. 3, which is due to the action of tail vortex of the upper droplet on the following droplet. The following droplet accelerates at a different <b>wobbling</b> <b>frequency</b> with that of the upper droplet. As the implication in model development, in term of numerical stability, the so called ’non-linear implicit trapezoidal lattice Boltzmann scheme’, proposed by Nourgaliev et al. [1], is re-examined in order to simulate the large density ratio of two-fluid flows. It is found from the re-derivation that the scheme is a linear scheme in nature. Therefore, the re-derived scheme is more efficient and the CPU time can be reduced. The test cases of the simulation of a steady state droplet using SC EOS show that re-derived scheme improves the numerical stability by reducing the spurious velocity about 21. 7...|$|E

As a result, a simple scaling of the earth's Chandler wobble excitation rate to that of Venus suggests that an appreciable wobble could exist.

40|$|Introduction It {{is usually}} assumed that photon events, as X-ray photons {{observed}} by a satellite, may be {{described by the}} theory of point processes (cf e. g.

Photons are usually generated in a Poisson process {{and in addition to}} that, the detection of photons is a Poisson process too. In the case of ROSAT satellite there is an additional complication. The spacecraft itself wobbles with a period of 400 seconds in order to avoid that the same parts of the sensor mosaic are constantly receiving photons from the same sources on the sky. The final result is a photon flux controlled by several Poisson processes and modulated by the spacecraft wobble. In order to study the dynamical properties of a source it is necessary to study the spectrum of variations of the Poisson parameter l (intensity of the process), at least above the <b>wobble</b> <b>frequency.</b> For frequencies from...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLaser {{beam welding}} (LBW) coupled with “wobble effect” (fast {{oscillation}} {{of the laser}} beam) is very promising for high precision micro-joining industry. For this process, similarly to the conventional LBW, the laser welding process parameters play a very significant {{role in determining the}} quality of a weld joint. Consequently, four process parameters (laser power, <b>wobble</b> <b>frequency,</b> number of rotations within a single laser pulse and focused position) and 5 responses (penetration, width, heat affected zone (HAZ), area of the fusion zone, area of HAZ and hardness) were investigated for spot welding of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy (grade 5) using a design of experiments (DoE) approach. This paper presents experimental results showing the effects of variating the considered most important process parameters on the spot weld quality of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy. Semi-empirical mathematical models were developed to correlate laser welding parameters to each of the measured weld responses. Adequacies of the models were then examined by various methods such as ANOVA. These models not only allows {{a better understanding of the}} wobble laser welding process and predict the process performance but also determines optimal process parameters.

40|$|The tidal {{potential}} {{generated by}} {{bodies in the}} solar system contains Poisson terms, i. e., periodic terms with linearly time-dependent amplitudes. The influence of these terms in the Earth’s rotation, although expected to be small, could be of interest in the present context of high accuracy modelling. We have studied their contribution in the rotation of a non rigid Earth with elastic mantle and liquid core. Starting from the Liouville equations, we computed analytically the contribution in the wobble and showed that the presently-used transfer function must be supplemented by additional terms to be used in convolution with the amplitude of the Poisson terms of the potential and inversely proportional to (σ − σn) 2 where σ is the forcing frequency and σn are the eigenfrequencies associated with the retrograde free core nutation and the Chandler wobble. These results have been detailed in a paper that we published in Astron. Astrophys. in 2007. In the present paper, we further examine the contribution from the core on the wobble and the nutation. In particular, we examine the contribution on extreme cases such as for <b>wobble</b> <b>frequencies</b> near the Free Core Nutation Frequency (FCN) or for long period nutations. In addition to the analytical computation, we used a time-domain approach through a numerical model to examine the core and mantle motions and discuss the analytical results. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The stacking is an efficient way of getting ridof local effects and improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the combined data sets. Using thestacking method, we find a gravimetric factor amplitude and phase of 1. 118 ± 0. 016 and− 0. 45 ± 0. 66 deg, respectively, which is smaller in amplitude than expected. The sources oferror are then carefully considered. For both local and global analyses, the uncertainties onour results are reliably constrained by computing the standard deviation of the estimates of thegravimetric factor amplitude and phase for increasing length of the time-series.
