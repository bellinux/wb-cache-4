25|$|Velarde's oeuvre marks {{a moment}} of {{transition}} between modernism and the avant-garde. His work was marked by a novel approach to poetic language.

25|$|The {{microscopic}} {{kinetic energy}} of a system arises as {{the sum of the}} motions of all the system's particles with respect to the center-of-mass frame, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> motion of atoms, molecules, atomic nuclei, electrons, or other particles. The microscopic potential energy algebraic summative components are those of the chemical and nuclear particle bonds, and the physical force fields within the system, such as due to internal induced electric or magnetic dipole moment, as well as the energy of deformation of solids (stress-strain). Usually, the split into microscopic kinetic and potential energies is outside the scope of macroscopic thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Young Earth creationism is {{most famous}} for an {{opposition}} {{to the theory of}} evolution, but believers also are on record opposing many measurements, facts, and principles in the fields of physics and chemistry, dating methods including radiometric dating, geology, astronomy, cosmology, and paleontology. Young Earth creationists do not accept any explanation for natural phenomena which deviates from the veracity of a plain reading of the Bible, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> origins of biological diversity, the origins of life, or the origins of the universe itself. This has led some young Earth creationists to criticize other creationist proposals such as intelligent design, for not taking a strong stand on the age of the Earth, special creation, or even the identity of the designer.|$|E
25|$|The {{administration}} of known goitrogen substances {{can also be}} used as a prophylaxis in reducing the bio-uptake of iodine, (<b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> nutritional non-radioactive iodine-127 or radioactive iodine, radioiodine - most commonly iodine-131, as the body cannot discern between different iodine isotopes). Perchlorate ions, a common water contaminant in the USA due to the aerospace industry, has been shown to reduce iodine uptake and thus is classified as a goitrogen. Perchlorate ions are a competitive inhibitor of the process by which iodide, is actively deposited into thyroid follicular cells. Studies involving healthy adult volunteers determined that at levels above 0.007 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/(kg·d)), perchlorate begins to temporarily inhibit the thyroid gland’s ability to absorb iodine from the bloodstream ("iodide uptake inhibition", thus perchlorate is a known goitrogen). The reduction of the iodide pool by perchlorate has dual effects—reduction of excess hormone synthesis and hyperthyroidism, on the one hand, and reduction of thyroid inhibitor synthesis and hypothyroidism on the other. Perchlorate remains very useful as a single dose application in tests measuring the discharge of radioiodide accumulated in the thyroid as a result of many different disruptions in the further metabolism of iodide in the thyroid gland.|$|E

500|$|Isaac Cline was {{the first}} to {{investigate}} rainfall distribution around tropical cyclones in the early 1900s. [...] He found that a larger proportion of rainfall falls in advance of the center (or eye) than after the center's passage, with the highest percentage falling in the right front quadrant. [...] Father Viñes of Cuba found that some tropical cyclones have their highest rainfall rates in the rear quadrant within a training (non-moving) inflow band. [...] Normally, as a tropical cyclone intensifies, its heavier rainfall rates become more concentrated around its center. [...] Rainfall is found to be heaviest in tropical cyclone's inner core, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> eyewall or central dense overcast, within a degree latitude of the center, with lesser amounts farther away from the center. Most of the rainfall in tropical cyclones is concentrated within its radius of gale-force (34knots/39mph/63km/h) winds. [...] Rainfall is more common near the center of tropical cyclones overnight. [...] Over land, outer bands are more active during the heating of the day, which can act to restrict inflow {{into the center of the}} cyclone. [...] Recent studies have shown that half of the rainfall within a tropical cyclone is stratiform in nature. [...] The chart to the right was developed by Riehl in 1954 using meteorological equations that assume a gale radius of about , a fairly symmetric cyclone, and does not consider topographic effects or vertical wind shear. [...] Local amounts can exceed this chart by a factor of two due to topography. [...] Wind shear tends to lessen the amounts below what is shown on the table.|$|E
