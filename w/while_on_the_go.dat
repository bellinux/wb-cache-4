5000|$|Curse Voice is a Voice over IP (VOIP) client {{produced}} in-house by Curse. Intended {{to replace}} other VOIP solutions for games such as League of Legends, the client boasts a robust feature set, including an in-game voice overlay, an auto-match making service for automatically connecting {{you to the}} members of your team, and the use of URL links to join sessions. The client was originally rejected by Riot Games, who felt that the timers included for various spawn times could be considered cheating, but Curse has since removed the offending content and brought the software in line with the terms of service for League of Legends. The German version is still in the beta-phase. In 2015, Curse Voice initiated a PR campaign to show users, developers and publishers all of the benefits that the service had to offer. The service boasted how its safety features could help prevent users from getting swatted with Curse's CTO explaining how this was possible in an interview with Polygon. Other publications such as IGN, Gamecrate, and Yahoo News to name a few picked up the story. On May 6, Curse reported on the amazing growth of its VoIP service on GameSpot and Game Informer as it prepared to show off the service at E3 2015. In June 2015, Curse Voice made its way to not only PC, but Mac and mobile, giving users more ways to use the service <b>while</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>go</b> or at home. Gamers started to take note of all the great features that Curse Voice has to offer and publications like Kotaku and PC Gamer recommended using the service while playing online games like League of Legends (LoL). Consequentially, on July 7, SEC reports revealed that Riot Games had invested $30 million in Curse which is the company behind LoL but no further details were revealed at the time. The company had stated that they wanted to help games improve their in-game chat and many gamers speculated if maybe this {{was the case with the}} recent investment. Curse Voice has been proven to improve a game's community according to recent interviews with Smite and Robocraft alongside the release of the company's whitepaper. With all of these big gains in the Curse Voice Client, Curse officially announced the opening of a brand new headquarters for their VoIP service on September 10 to Irvine, California. It is no surprise with all of the recent success by Curse headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama that Bloomberg would name the city one of [...] "The Unlikely Cities That Will Power The U.S. Economy." [...] On March 16, 2017, Curse Voice was relaunched as the Twitch Desktop App. Largely a reskin of Curse Voice, the new Desktop App boasted tighter integration with the Twitch streaming services including whispers, activity sharing, and giveaways.|$|E

Darren was small when he was at college weighing only 195 pounds, this is the main reason scouts weren't looking at him. He played his 2 years and moved on to Arizona State University and played Linebacker. When he was a senior he got his weight up to 215 pounds but pro scouts thought that he still wasn't big enough. Being unwanted out of high school and college he was determined to keep playing football. He was released 4 times from the NFL but didn't quit on his dream.

40|$|Communication and {{collaboration}} is often independent {{of time and}} place. Thus, the collaboration tools should also be available when the users are moving around. The mobile devices have {{a key role in}} aggregating information <b>while</b> people are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>go.</b> Therefore it would be beneficial to use that potential also for sharing information collaboratively. In this thesis, one possible solution to this challenge is given. This work provides the theoretical and technical background for mobile peer-to-peer collaboration, by combining and merging results from research on mobile collaboration and collaborative Web services. Moreover, requirements are gathered from these background studies in order to define the scope for this work. In this thesis the main objective has been to design architecture for mobile collaborative work as well as to implement a prototype system to evaluate the design. Existing technologies were used whenever possible. The proposed solution integrates a lightweight Web Service Architecture and a mobile device equipped with a standard Web server in order to enable a mobile collaborative sharing of information. In addition to the design and implementation, a background survey and a user study has been conducted to evaluate the approach from the user's perspective. The goal was to gain insight for the whole concept as well as to evaluate the architecture and the usability of the proposed client applications. From these evaluations it seems that the approach for mobile collaboration is feasible and usable <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of the results. This gives a sound background for future investigations and innovations build on top of this approach.

40|$|Mobile {{communications}} are {{an integral}} part of modern society. People want to talk to their friends, play on-line games, or watch YouTube videos <b>while</b> they are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>go.</b> This forces Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to continuously upgrade and extend their mobile networks in order to keep up with the ever growing data rate requirements and provide the users with satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS). However, users are not willing to pay more for mobile communications leading to a decrease in the price per data unit. Due to this development, MNOs are faced with a serious pressure to reduce their Operational Expenditure (OPEX). The focus, thereby, lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reduction of manual efforts in network operations, i. e., the configuration and control of the Base Stations (BSs) such that the operational objectives by the MNO, defined as target values for network Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), are satisfied. Self-Organizing Network (SON) is a concept for automating the operation of mobile networks by relieving human operators from repetitive, low-level network operations tasks. In principle, a SON consists of a set of close-loop control functions, referred to as SON functions, which perform specific operations tasks. For instance, Coverage and Capacity Optimization (CCO) improves the network capacity and Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO) optimizes the handover performance. The introduction of SON lifts the work of human operators from network operations to SON operations: instead of analyzing and configuring all the BSs in the network, the operational personnel has to configure and control the SON functions in order to adapt them to the network environment and specific operational objectives. This is due to the gap between the objectives and the low-level, technical configuration interface of the SON functions. As a result, MNOs ask for a further increase in the level of automation. This thesis introduces the Objective-Driven SON Operations (ODSO) concept that enables autonomic mobile network operations, i. e., the control of network operations through operational objectives on network KPIs. ODSO is built on top of SON and automates three manual tasks of SON operations: SON management that configures the SON functions, SON coordination that detects and resolves run-time conflicts between the concurrently running SON functions, and SON self-healing that detects and resolves failures in the network and the SON system. The specific contributions of this thesis are: 1. We analyze the specific requirements for autonomic operations of a mobile network and develop an architecture that extends an existing SON system with the ability to process the operational objectives of the MNO. The architecture integrates three components, one for each SON operations task, in order to reduce the manual control efforts. 2. We develop a generic decision making process that enables the ODSO components to autonomically control SON functions based on two types of information: a formalized representation of the operational objectives in an objective model, and a formalized representation of the task-specific technical knowledge in several technical models. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> foundation of Multiattribute Utility Theory (MAUT), the ODSO components are able to process these models in order to automatically operate the SON functions such that they optimize the network to satisfy the operational objectives. In this way, the MNO's objectives serve as a unified, high-level operations interface for SON. 3. We apply the generic decision making process to each of the three SON operations tasks which enables them to determine the best configuration of the SON functions, the best approach to resolve run-time conflicts, and the best recovery action to overcome failures with respect to the provided operational objectives. Thereby, we are able to account for the diverse characteristics of each task with our flexible approach. 4. We evaluate the feasibility and performance of the ODSO approach in a simulation of a realistic mobile network. As a result, we are able to show that the increased automation in SON operations reduces manual efforts and may also lift additional optimization potential in network operations. This leads to improved network performance compared to SON-based network operations...|$|R
