We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original '82 version.

500|$|Criticism of his {{perceived}} long-ball tactics became more intense as he managed West Ham United in the Premier League, including discontent from West Ham's own supporters. In January 2014, following a 0–0 draw at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea manager, José Mourinho criticised West Ham's football, likening it to [...] "football from the 19th century". In October 2014, Allardyce claimed {{his reputation for}} playing long ball football was [...] "not founded in fact" [...] and had been used as an excuse by opposing managers such as Arsène Wenger, David O'Leary, Graeme Souness and Rafael Benítez following defeats by sides managed by Allardyce. Allardyce wrote in his autobiography that [...] "when they hit a 50-yard ball it was a cultural pass; <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it, it was a hopeful hoof".|$|E

500|$|Corman felt Poe's two strongest stories after Usher were Masque of the Red Death, and Pit and the Pendulum. He {{considered}} {{making the}} former but {{was worried about}} similarities between the story and The Seventh Seal (1957), so he decided on adapting the latter. However Samuel Z. Arkoff said it was his and James H. Nicholson's decision to make Pit as the second Poe film [...] "because {{it was a lot}} more graphic and in the second place, Masque of the Red Death would have needed a dancing troupe that would have been quite expensive. In all those early Poe pictures we had relatively few actors, so <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> finally make Masque of the Red Death we went to the UK where it would be less expensive to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{undertook}} {{the recording}} of Abbey Road {{with a sense of}} discipline and cooperation that had largely been absent while making the White Album and Let It Be. Having temporarily left the group in January 1969 {{partly as a result of}} McCartney's criticism of his musicianship, Harrison exhibited a greater level of assertiveness regarding his place in the band, particularly while they worked on his compositions [...] "Something" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Sun". In addition, like Lennon and McCartney, Martin had come to fully appreciate Harrison as a songwriter, later saying: [...] "I first recognised that he really had a great talent <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> 'Here Comes the Sun.' But when he brought in 'Something,' it was something else... It was a tremendous work – and so simple." ...|$|E
500|$|Fincher, Fischer and Vanderbilt {{spent months}} {{interviewing}} witnesses, {{family members of}} suspects, retired and current investigators, the only two surviving victims, and the mayors of San Francisco and Vallejo. Fincher said, [...] "Even <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> our own interviews, we would talk to two people. [...] One would confirm some aspects of it and another would deny it. Plus, so much time had passed, memories are affected and the different telling of the stories would change perception. So when there was any doubt we always went with the police reports". During {{the course of their}} research, Fincher and Fischer hired Gerald McMenamin, an internationally known forensic linguistics expert and professor of linguistics at California State University Fresno, to analyze the Zodiac's letters. Unlike document examiners in the 1970s, he focused on the language of the Zodiac and how he formed his sentences in terms of word structure and spelling.|$|E

500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could {{keep an eye out for}} her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Jam stated, [...] "We required that they put her in our hands. We had to do it on our turf, with no bodyguards, no star trips and none of Joe Jackson's people hanging around making suggestions." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis.

500|$|Another dispute {{occurred}} between TLC and Rolston {{was over the}} choice of clothing. The director was interested in [...] "tight and sexy" [...] lingerie looks for them while they only liked baggy, tomboy clothes. Combining the two, he finally gave out {{the idea of the}} girls wearing the silk pajamas with each custom-made cost more than 1,000. Thomas also talked about their exhaustion on the set: [...] "People don't realize that for video shoots you have to wake up at like 5 in the morning for your call time. So <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> that part {{at the very end of}} the video where we're talking to the camera and looking all silly, we were so tired.

500|$|Broderick's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed Dirty Dancing).

[...] "I got well enough to do {{what you see in the}} parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> shoot it, we had all this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess."

500|$|Despite all {{the glowing}} reviews, FreeSpace 2 sold poorly. The April 2000 issue of PC Gamer stated that only 26,983 copies {{had been sold}} {{in the first six}} months of its release.

[...] He, however, stated that as the team had stayed within budget by sticking to schedule, Volition should at least be breaking even with the estimated final sales of the game. In NowGamer's interview with Jim Boone, a producer at Volition, he stated that this could have been due to joysticks' being sold poorly because they were [...] "going out of fashion" [...] because more modern first-person shooters, such as Quake, were [...] "very much about the mouse and [...] keyboard". He went further on to state [...] "Before that, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> Descent for example, it was perfectly common for people to have joysticks – we sold a lot of copies of Descent. It was around that time [...] the more modern FPS with mouse and keyboard came out, as opposed to just keyboard like Wolfenstein [...] or something.".|$|E

500|$|Several {{breaking}} {{practitioners and}} pioneers tend {{to side with}} the camp that does not believe breaking came from capoeira.

[...] B-boy crew Spartanic Rockers adds: [...] "Despite of [...] many rumours and opinions Breaking didn't originate from Capoeira but during the last few years many moves, steps and freezes of this Brazilian (fight-) dance have inspired more and more B-Girls and B-Boys who integrated them into their dance." [...] B-boy Ken Swift was breaking long before he saw capoeria: [...] "In '78 I started [...] and I didn't see it [...] til '92 ... I was around, too—I was in Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, I went around and I didn't see it. What we saw was Kung Fu—we saw Kung Fu from the 42nd Street theaters. So those were our inspirations... <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> the Kung Fu sh-t we switched it up and we put this B-boy flavor into it..." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers {{enlisted the help}} of his former Chic bandmates Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played the drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange for their help. The recording sessions did not start until the afternoon as Rodgers, who attended late-night parties, was not accustomed to work in early mornings. The schedule was also difficult for Madonna, who recalled that she used to [...] "go to the swim club on the Upper West Side and go swimming and walk from there to the recording studio. It was impossible for me to reach there at morning." [...] Rodgers recalled that Madonna was a real hard worker and incredibly tenacious. He commented: [...] "I am always amazed by Madonna's incredible judgement {{when it comes to making}} pop records.
