40|$|Abstract − In the {{proposed}} paper {{the influence of}} motor aspirated psychrometer on calibration process is investigated. Proper humidity measurement with psychrometer requires sample gas stream of sufficient velocity {{in order to achieve}} accurate measurements. For this reason modern psychrometer typically have integrated aspiration motor to assure such gas stream over the thermometer, which is enclosed by a wet wick (<b>wet</b> <b>thermometer).</b> The wick has to be maintained in a wet condition, which causes evaporation and consequently the unwanted humidification of the air being measured, especially in a closed humidity chamber or humidity generator. Different psychrometers were tested in a humidity test chamber in order to estimate the level of such humidification. The results are summarised in the paper. In addition, special considerations are addressed regarding the calibration of motor aspirated psychrometer in closed calibration environment...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the objective of evaluating the use of concrete or hard-packed dirt floor in broiler houses. This experiment was carried out in two different phases. The following performance parameters were studied: live weight, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, and mortality. Litter moisture, pH and temperature were measured. Litter residual contamination after cleaning and disinfection was also evaluated. A dry bulb <b>thermometer,</b> a <b>wet</b> bulb <b>thermometer,</b> and a black bulb thermometer were placed inside each broiler house at bird height and outside the broiler house for data collection. Environmental data were collected at 3 h intervals from 00 : 00 to 24 : 00 hours during weeks 4, 5, and 6 of the grow-out. Based on the collected data, air relative humidity (RH) was determined, after which wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and Radiant Heat Load (RHL) were calculated. There were no differences in live performance parameters. However, total mortality and sudden death were higher in birds raised on dirt floor. On days 0, 14 and 35, litter pH was higher in the dirt floor as compared to the concrete floor, {{but at the end of}} the grow-out, this difference disappeared. There was a cubic effect of bird age on litter moisture, which increased up to day 28, and then stabilized or decreased. Litter coliform contamination was higher at the end of the grow-out as compared to that found at housing, but it was not influenced by floor type.

40|$|Aim: To {{find out}} the {{influence}} {{of different types of}} roofing materials on micro-climate in animal loose housing system during rainy season. Materials and Methods: Different shade materials were used for covered area under each of three treatments. Thatch shading roof (T 1), Agro-net shading roof (T 2), Asbestos with canvas shading roof (T 3). Long axis of the paddock was east-to-west orientation. The covered area floor space was 1. 5 × 1 m (excluding manger) for each animal and open paddock was 2 × 1 m. Height of shed at eaves was 2 meter. Daily temperature (maximum and minimum) and dry bulb and wet bulb temperature of macro and micro- environment under different treatments were recorded at 9 : 30 AM and 2 : 00 PM of Indian Standard Time (IST) by using maximum and minimum thermometer and dry and <b>wet</b> bulb <b>thermometer.</b> Both inside and outside surface temperatures of shade materials were measured by infrared digital thermometer (ebro, TFI 220). The statistical procedures followed were two way ANOVA and Paired 'T' test. Results: During the experimental period, maximum temperature was recorded under asbestos and lowest temperature was in agro-net and maximum protection from high temperature was given during peak hot hours in agro-net than asbestos. THI was more (P< 0. 05) under asbestos than agro-net and thatch. The outside surface temperature at 9. 30 AM and 2 : 00 PM (IST) was significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in agro-net than thatch and asbestos. Conclusion: Thatch and agro-net were better in warding off the hot and humid environmental condition in comparison to asbestos. [Vet World 2013; 6 (8. 000) : 482 - 485...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} about to present the {{planning}} and manufacturing process of a system, capable of recollection of data from the environment, their adequate interpretation, holding actions {{based on the results}} and presentation on the user's interface. The first part of the content represents the description of the basic widgets of the system. I presented the reasons for the choice of individual software and electronic elements, their role in the system with advantages and disadvantages of the chosen parts. I described some commercial solutions, up to some extent similar to the presented one and available on the market. The goal of the thesis is to elaborate a similar system, but cheaper and more adjusted to our problem domain. 	The entire system is divided into two sections. The first one is formed by electronic elements, required for the recollection and transmission of data from the temperature sensors DS 18 S 20 to the server. The second section is the software, compiled by open code software with the Digitemp program and own software which works as a linking particle of entire system to create a complete entity. The adjusted program Digitemp checks the availability of temperature sensors, inputs the data into the database and from the nearest weather station reads the data of the outside air humidity. Own software processes the data and changes it into a form, required for the situation of snowmaking – this is the temperature of a <b>wet</b> bulb <b>thermometer.</b> That form is used for the upgrading processes, such as suitable data display and, depending on the will of the user, updating and informing by the e-mail. 	The last part of the thesis represent working results of the system and examples of usage. I also provided a critical judgement of the results and suggested some changes regarding the potential improvement in the operation of the system. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of {{microclimate}} alteration on temperature-humidity index (THI), milk yield, and milk composition of Murrah buffaloes during summer for a period of 90 -day from March to May- 2014 at Buffalo Research Station, Venkataramannagudem, Andhra Pradesh, India. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 lactating Murrah buffaloes were selected having similar body weight, parity, and milk yield. They were divided into four groups of 10 each. Three groups of buffaloes were provided with microclimate alteration using supplemental cooling like foggers, fans and foggers plus fans, and the fourth group (control) was without any cooling system. The daily THI was measured using dry and <b>wet</b> bulb <b>thermometer.</b> The physiological responses viz. rectal temperature, respiration rate, and pulse rate were measured by a clinical thermometer, measuring the flank movements a minute and observing the pulsation of the middle coccygeal artery at the base of tail with the help of finger. Milk samples were analyzed for chemical composition viz., fat, solids-not-fat (SNF), total solids (TS), specific gravity. Results: In the present study, significant (p< 0. 001) decrease in the average THI values were observed in experimental Murrah buffalo houses of GroupII (foggers), GroupIII (fans), and GroupIV (foggers and fans) compared to GroupI (control). Significant (p< 0. 001) decrease in average rectal temperature (°F), respiration rate (breaths/min) and pulse rate (beats/min) values were recorded in Murrah buffaloes of Groups II, III and IV compared to Group I. Significant (p< 0. 001) increase in the average milk yield (kg/day) was recorded in Murrah buffaloes of Groups II, III, and IV compared with Group I. Significant (p< 0. 001) increase in the average milk fat, SNF, and TS percent were recorded in Murrah buffalo Groups of II, III, and IV compared with Group I. Conclusion: Microclimate alteration by the provision of foggers and air circulators in the buffalo houses increased feed intake in buffaloes resulting increased milk production, fat and SNF yield which was due to decreased heat stress in buffaloes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{indirect}} evaluation of the natural wet bulb temperature, tnw, {{one of the two}} quantities forming the basis of the well known WBGT index, considered worldwide a suitable and user friendly tool for the preliminary assessment of hot thermal environments. This quantity can be measured by a <b>wet</b> bulb <b>thermometer</b> (a temperature sensor covered with a wetted wick naturally ventilated), or, if not available, calculated from others microclimatic parameters (i. e. the air temperature, the globe temperature, the air velocity and the humidity) using a quite trivial energy balance equation. Because of the strong non linear structure of such an equation, the risk of a multiplicity of steady state solutions could result in the failure to obtain a reliable index evaluation. To dispel all doubts, this work carries out an in-depth analysis of the heat balance equation to be solved for the indirect evaluation of the natural wet bulb temperature. A preliminary investigation of each heat flow term involved in the heat balance on the sensor has been carried out; in a second phase a special continuation method has been implemented highlighting the effect of microclimatic parameters on the multiplicity of solutions. Results show that under free convection the evaluation produces a single solution only under uniform conditions, whereas, in the presence of even slight differences between the air temperature and the mean radiant temperature there can be as many as three solutions. This phenomenon, if confirmed by a further experimental investigation, could become a ticklish matter since a sensor, in principle, has to read a sole value of the measurand. In any case, from a numerical point of view, the presence of many values of tnw greatly reduces the possibility of an indirect WBGT calculation from the other involved physical quantities; as a consequence, the indirect evaluation of WBGT should be clearly avoided by ISO 7243 Standard...|$|R

This study design was cross-sectional study, and data collection was performed during busy time in commercial kitchen from August to September 2006. The research subjects were 8 institutions, involving 7 cookers, and 16 men. Measured environmental variables were air temperature, radiant heat index, <b>wet</b> bulb globe <b>thermometer</b> index (WBGT) in front of the cookers, ambient temperature, and estimated ambient WBGT around the workers. The thermal strain on workers was evaluated by fluid loss, body temperatures, heart rate and amount of physical activity (METs). All average estimated ambient WBGTs in front of cookers were less than 27. 5 °C. The average heart rate was 107 ± 10 bpm, and average METs was 2. 0 ± 0. 6. The peak values of upper arm skin temperature and auditory canal temperature were less than 37. 5 °C. The work environments were affected by the kitchen spaces, cooling devices, heating methods, and heat sources. Even in the midsummer, if environmental temperatures were controlled adequately, estimated ambient WBGTs around workers were below the occupational exposure limit.
