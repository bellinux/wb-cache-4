500|$|One {{point of}} dispute was the {{calculation}} of Malay equity. Although officially, as of 1992, the Malays controlled 18% of the economy, some dismissed this figure as misleading. It was argued that as in reality, much of this amount comprised equity held by government agencies, therefore it belonged to Malaysians as a whole. The practice of awarding public <b>works</b> <b>contracts</b> mainly to Bumiputras was argued to be stifling Malay competency by providing little incentive to improve. Many Bumiputra contractors in turn subcontracted their jobs to others, who were in some cases Chinese; [...] "Ali Baba" [...] arrangements with [...] "the Malay [...] using his privileges to acquire licences and permits denied the non-Malay, then accepting a fee to be the front-man while the non-Malay [...] ran the business," [...] were prevalent. Some suggested that the NEP [...] "might have worked, if the Malay had actually wanted to learn the ropes. But more often than not, {{he just wanted to}} be rich." ...|$|E

40|$|Non-renewable {{fixed-term}} {{and agency}} <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> {{are becoming more}} used instead of the traditional Russian model of open-ended employment. The authors examine the influence of institutional and organizational factors {{on the use of}} two forms of non-standard <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> in Russia with data from a Survey covering 3313 enterprises for the years 2009 to 2011. Probit and Tobit regressions are used to test several hypotheses about the use of non-standard <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> derived from the literature. The results indicate that state-owned and unionized enterprises are more likely to use fixed-term contracts; and a high level of perceived dismissal protection for permanent workers is positively associated with fixed-term contracts use. The incidence and intensity of fixed-term and agency <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> are lower at enterprises with flexible wages. A significant impact of organizational factors is confirmed only for fixed-term contracts. Enterprises use less fixed-term contracts, if they have workers with tenure from 5 to 10 years and high job complexity...|$|R

40|$|Great social {{inequality}} {{has been one}} of the worrisome features of economic development in Latin America. This study focuses on Chile, one of Latin America's fastest growing economies with one of the highest levels of income inequality during the 1990 s. Using micro-level data from the 1994 and 2000 Encuestas de Caracterizacion Socio-Economica, this article examines the role of <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> in explaining male and female earnings and earnings inequality among wage and salary workers over the second half of the 1990 s. The analysis distinguishes between wage and salary work without a <b>work</b> <b>contract</b> - referred to as 'informal' work, and wage and salary work with a <b>work</b> <b>contract.</b> Within the latter group, the study further differentiates by the type of <b>work</b> <b>contract</b> held, such as permanent and a variety of contingent <b>work</b> <b>contracts.</b> The findings reveal that the majority of employees in informal and contingent wage and salary work arrangements earned significantly less than their permanent counterparts. Additionally, informal and contingent wage and salary work arrangements accounted for a small, although increasing, fraction of male and female earnings inequality from 1994 to 2000. Finally, the proliferation of seasonal, fixed-term, and informal wage and salary work arrangements {{has been one of}} the few economically significant factors in explaining changes in male and female earnings inequality over the second half of the 1990 s. ...|$|R
