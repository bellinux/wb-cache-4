25|$|In 2003, the Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale was introduced. It {{was made}} for three {{different}} age groups. The AMAS takes into account age-related situations that affect an individual's anxiety. The divisions include one scale for adults (AMA-A), one scale for college students (AMAS-C), {{and the other for}} the elderly population (AMAS-E). Each scale is geared towards examining situations specific to that age group. For example, the AMAS-C has items pertaining specifically to college students, such as questions about anxiety of the future. The AMAS-A is geared more toward mid-life issues, and the AMAS-E has specific anxieties the older population deals with, such as fear of aging and dying. The AMAS-A contains 36 items. It has 14 questions relating to worry/oversensitivity, 9 questions about physiological anxiety, 7 questions about social concerns/stress, and 6 questions about lies. An example of an age appropriate item for this scale is, “I am worried about my job performance”. The AMAS-C contains 49 items about the same topics, but incorporates 15 items related specifically to test anxiety. Questions relating to the items on this scale include, “I <b>worry</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> tests and exams”. This scale is similar in structure to the CMAS discussed above. The AMAS-E contains 44 items related to worry/oversensitivity, physiological anxiety, lying, and the fear of aging. Twenty- three of the questions on the AMAS-E are related to worry/oversensitivity, but The Fear of Aging category of this scale includes items such as, “I worry about becoming senile”. Similar to the TMAS, the AMAS can be given in a group or individual setting, and the person responds either yes or no to each item listed according to if it pertains to themselves or not. The more items that are answered yes, suggest a higher level of anxiety. The scale has been said to be easy to complete and practical, because it takes only about 10 minutes to complete and just a couple minutes to score.|$|E

Entire parts of Scorpio's dialogue, such as his hammock speech, are Brooks's lines and not the writers'. Dan Castellaneta described how, after he prepared something for Homer to say in response to Brooks's new Scorpio lines, Brooks would deliver totally different lines in the next take. Josh Weinstein said Homer's reactions are exactly like someone talking to Albert Brooks. In all, his recordings amounted to over two hours in length. Brooks voiced the character Russ Cargill in The Simpsons Movie and for [...] "about a week", he was to reprise the role of Scorpio, but the staff felt that creating a new character was a better idea.|$|E

40|$|All {{too often}} {{we rely on}} Monte Carlo {{simulations}} without <b>worrying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> basic physics. It is possible {{to start with a}} very simple calorimeter (a big cylinder) and learn the functional form of pi e by aninduction argument. Monte Carlo simulations provide sanity checks and constants. A power-law functional form describes test beam results surprisingly well. The prediction that calorimeters respond differently to protons and pions of the same energy was unexpected. The effect was later demonstrated by the CMS forward calorimeter group, using the most noncompensating calorimeter ever built. Calorimeter resolution is dominated by fluctuations in piz production and the energy deposit by neutrons. The DREAM collaboration has recently used a dual readout calorimeter to eliminate the first of these. Ultimate resolution depends on measuring neutrons on an event-by-event basis as well...|$|R

40|$|When {{people talk}} about erotism, the {{first thing in the}} mind of most people are nudity, sexuality, and vulgarity.

50|$|During {{qualifying}}, forty-four {{cars were}} entered, but only forty-three {{were able to}} start because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Busch clinched his eleventh career pole position, with a record-setting time of 14.813 seconds. After his qualifying run, Busch commented, “The car felt great during that lap. We’ve never really <b>worried</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> qualifying runs.

Hamlin qualified third, Brian Vickers took fourth, and Paul Menard started fifth, after being scored fifteenth in the final practice session. McMurray, Keselowski, Tony Stewart, Martin Truex Jr., and Joey Logano completed the first ten positions on the grid. The driver that failed to qualify was Scott Riggs.|$|R
40|$|Somatic symptom {{disorder}} (SSD) {{is defined}} by the prominence of somatic symptoms associated with abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to the symptoms, resulting in significant distress and impairment. Individuals with these disorders are more commonly encountered in primary care and other medical settings, including dermatology practice, than in psychiatric and other mental health settings. What defines the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as abnormal is that they are excessive, that is, out of proportion to other patients with similar somatic symptoms, and that they result in significant distress and impairment. SSD may occur with or without the presence of a diagnosable dermatologic disorder. When a dermatologic disorder is present, SSD should be considered when the patient is <b>worrying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> his or her skin, spending <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time and energy on it, and especially if the patient complains of many nondermatologic symptoms in addition. The differential diagnosis includes other psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, delusions of parasitosis, and body dysmorphic disorder...|$|R

The Austrian also nearly won the Portuguese Grand Prix before spinning and handing McLaren's Alain Prost his record 28th Grand Prix win (where Berger admitted it was a result of <b>worrying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> Prost who consequently stated that he believed that Alboreto would not have made the same mistake), and the Mexican Grand Prix which he was leading before reliability issues forced him out once again.|$|R
