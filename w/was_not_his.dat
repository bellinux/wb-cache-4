5|$|After a brief spell {{teaching}} at Christ's College, Finchley, {{for six months}} during 1887, Shaw Jeffrey became an assistant mathematics and science master at The Skinners' School, Royal Tunbridge Wells, whilst simultaneously studying for an Inter Bachelor of Science, with first class honours. Whilst at Skinners' he published words he had written for the school song, set to music by Cuthbert H. Cronk, which persist to the present day. Although it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> initial intention, in 1893 he took up a post as private tutor to a student he had been coaching at The Skinners' School and travelled to Florida with him.|$|E

5|$|Born in Derby, England, Hickling served from 1941 until 1946 in the British Royal Navy during World War II, {{and then}} joined the Colonial Legal Service. In 1955, Hickling was posted to Malaya (now Malaysia), where he gained {{prominence}} as a lawmaker. He drafted the Constitution of Malaysia, and as Commissioner of Law Revision wrote the Internal Security Act (ISA) of 1960, which {{provided for the}} detention of persons without trial. The ISA was later used to oppress political opponents or those dedicated to non-violent activities, which Hickling later said <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> intention.|$|E
5|$|Chase's {{decision}} {{to end the}} last episode abruptly with just a black screen was controversial. While Chase has insisted that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> intention to stir controversy, the ambiguity over the ending and question of whether Tony was murdered has continued for years after the finale's original broadcast and has spawned numerous websites devoted to finding out his true intention.|$|E
50|$|His chief defects are: (1) Lack of {{appreciation}} of existing institutions, organisations, and stolid, dull people...their ways <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> ways and their methods <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> methods. (2) Fondness for a grandiose scheme in preference to {{an attempt to}} improve existing machinery.

5|$|Edward the Martyr (Old English: Eadweard; 18 March 978) was King of England from 975 {{until he}} was murdered in 978. Edward was the eldest son of King Edgar the Peaceful but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> father's {{acknowledged}} heir. On Edgar's death, the leadership of England was contested, with some supporting Edward's claim to be king and others supporting his much younger half-brother Æthelred the Unready, recognized as a legitimate son of Edgar. Edward was chosen as king and was crowned by his main clerical supporters, the archbishops Dunstan and Oswald of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|Eureka {{has been}} read in many ways, {{in part because}} Poe's sincerity in the work is questionable. It has been {{considered}} prophetically scientific, intuitively romantic, and even calculatingly ironic. Lacking scientific proof, Poe said it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> goal to prove what he says to be true, but to convince through suggestion.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Clarke {{spent some}} time writing war histories. Until his {{retirement}} from the army in 1947, with the rank of brigadier, he recorded the history of 'A' Force. The document was never published and remained classified till the 1970s. His first complete book was published in 1948. Seven Assignments recorded Clarke's activities during the early wartime period of 1939 and 1940 (before the Middle East posting). It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> first attempt at a book. In 1925 Clarke had found a publisher for his coverage for the Rif rebellion, but the work was never finished.|$|E

5|$|Haraldr Guðrøðarson's reign {{was not a}} long one. In 1250, {{the chronicle}} records that he was summoned by letter to the Norwegian royal court because Hákon was displeased at how Haraldr Guðrøðarson had wrongfully seized the kingship which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> by right. The chronicle notes that the Norwegian king {{intended}} that Haraldr Guðrøðarson should never return to Mann, and he was consequently kept from returning to the island-kingdom. Nothing further is heard from him.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Kaczynski {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan, where he earned his master's and doctoral degrees in mathematics in 1964 and 1967, respectively. Michigan <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> first choice for postgraduate education; he had also applied to the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago, both of which accepted him but offered him no teaching position or financial aid. Michigan offered him an annual grant of $2,310 (equivalent to $18,700 in 2017) and a teaching post.|$|E

5|$|In January 1909, {{just prior}} to an 18.1 balkline {{championship}} at Madison Square Garden (in which Spinks was not competing), he and Maurice Daly were observed playing practice games with Sutton for the latter's pre-event training, in Daly's billiard hall in New York City, on multiple occasions over a several-day stretch. While Spinks lost {{all but one of}} the recorded matches of this series, one loss was by a single point, at 400–399, and another was a close 400–370. His victory was 300–194 – surprising given that 18.1 <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> preferred game.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{first major}} success came with Life of Savage, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>his</b> first biography; Savage {{was the fourth}} in a series which also {{included}} biographies of Jean-Philippe Baratier, Robert Blake and Francis Drake.

5|$|Modern {{scholars}} have not shared {{the confidence of}} their Hellenistic counterparts, and today the Catalogue is {{generally considered to be}} a post-Hesiodic composition.

By September, however, {{he was back}} in the south of England at Buckingham, where Constantine witnessed a charter as subregulus, that is a king acknowledging Æthelstan's overlordship. In 935 a charter was attested by Constantine, Owain of Strathclyde, Hywel Dda, Idwal Foel, and Morgan ap Owain. At Christmas of the same year Owain of Strathclyde was once more at Æthelstan's court along with the Welsh kings, but Constantine <b>was</b> <b>not.</b> <b>His</b> return to England less than two years later would be in very different circumstances.|$|E
