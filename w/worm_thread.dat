40|$|A {{face gear}} drive with a spur {{involute}} pinion is considered. The {{generation of the}} face gear is based on application of a grinding or cutting worm whereas the conventional method of generation is based on application of an involute shaper. An analytical approach is proposed for the determination of: (1) the <b>worm</b> <b>thread</b> surface; (2) avoidance of singularities of the <b>worm</b> <b>thread</b> surface, (air) dressing of the worm; and (3) determination of stresses of the face-gear drive. A computer program for simulation of meshing and contact of the pinion and face-gear has been developed. Correction of machine-tool settings is proposed for reduction of the shift of the bearing contact caused by misalignment. An automatic development of the model of five contacting teeth has been proposed for stress analysis. Numerical examples for illustration of the developed theory are provided...|$|E

40|$|The dual-lead worm and {{worm gear}} drive is a {{convenient}} anti-backlash mechanism. It {{can be used}} in precision machine tools and indexing tables. The objective is to minimize the frictional force between the worm and the gear. The constraints include the worm geometry, stresses, displacements and the natural frequency of the worm. To avoid a difficult 3 -D shape optimization problem, a two-stage optimization method is introduced in this paper. The first stage optimization uses an approximate <b>worm</b> model. The <b>threads</b> of the <b>worm</b> are approximated by plate elements in this stage. The design variables are pitch diameter of the worm, the module of the gear and the difference of {{the left and the right}} modules.

40|$|Abstract- Nematodes are {{commonly}} referred to as non segmented round <b>worm,</b> <b>thread</b> worms or pin worms. It‟s body is elongated, cylindrical, bilaterally symmetrical and tapering towards both end. It is pseudocoelomate and dioecious with sexual dimorphism. It‟s impact on agriculture by way of inflicting is quite substantial. In the District Bilaspur of Himachal Pradesh, in the present study on nematodes, two types of nematodes have been detected from the roots and rhizosphere of okra crop. These two are Ectoparisitic and Endoparisitic. The present study also reveals that percentage of Meliodogyne incognita is quite high {{in some parts of the}} District of Bilaspur. Okra is susceptible to root-knot nematodes damage. If Okra is to be grown in areas prone to nematode attacks Nematicide must be sprayed prior to planting. Non chemical management of nematodes can be accomplished through the use of soil solarization, crop rotation or the use of nematodes suppressive crops...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Worm gears are {{commonly}} used in windshield wipers and power windows of automobiles. The goal of this work is to study several material problems, such as production bottlenecks and excessive scrap, resulting from the production of steel worm shafts. A possible solution is explored in this work by characterizing material properties of a promising candidate (glass reinforced acetal copolymer) that can replace steel in worm gears. Finite element analysis of the <b>worm</b> <b>thread</b> under static loading and constant temperature is performed in order to calculate {{the size of the}} new composite part. The results obtained in this work support the possibility of manufacturing composite worm shafts that could operate at elevated temperatures without sacrificing part performance, while reducing part weight leading to improved fuel economy, noise reduction, and manufacturing problems associated with the steel part. The finite element analysis shows that compared to a steel gear, the axial pitch of a composite worm gear must be increased by 250 % in order for it to operate without failure for 10 years at a constant temperature of 23 C. This increase in the axial pitch would ramp up to 400 %, if the composite worm gear is expected to operate for 10 years at a constant temperature of 100 C.

40|$|Research and {{development}} of wormgear drives have significantly focused on their geometrical accuracy, loadability tests, and their wear resistance and efficiency. The research {{has been going on}} in several directions. Individual method of problem solving is development new worm-gear sets and tools for their manufacturing. In the present study, worms with concave profile of their thread have been considered. To avoid the technological difficulties relevant to the application of special cutting tools for machining such gear sets, a rigid incongruent generating pair consisting of a standard hob and toroidal tool has been developed for processing the concave worm profile. The generating surface of the developed toroidal tool, which is essential for the tool manufacturing, was modeled on the basis of hob-toroidal tool interaction. The proposed method of modeling w as divided into three steps: first, the common surface for both hobbing and toroidal tools has been found in terms of hyperboloid of revolution of one sheet, then, the matrix method of transforming the coordinates, from the hob-axis reference frame to the toroidal tool-axis reference frame, has been utilized, and finally, an equation described the generating surface of the toroidal tool has been derived and presented. By using the proposed model and the obtained final equation the <b>worm</b> <b>thread</b> surface machined by the mentioned tool can be defined and experimented...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWorm gears {{are widely}} used in power {{transmission}} applications, in which a compact high reduction and a relatively low speed drive is required. This paper presents a numerical model developed to compute the quasi-static load sharing. This method uses the equation of displacement compatibility and the influence coefficient method, which allows a fast and accurate computing. The bending deflections of the gear teeth and <b>worm</b> <b>threads,</b> and the local contact deformations of mating surfaces are included. The bending deflections of the gears are determined with the combination of: only one standard FEM computation and interpolation functions. To calculate the local contact deformations, the Boussinesq theory is used.

50|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} are a {{group of}} nematodes (<b>thread</b> <b>worms),</b> causing death to insects. The term entomopathogenic has a Greek origin entomon, refers to insect, and pathogenic, which denotes causing disease. They are multi-cellular metazoans that occupy a bio control middle ground between microbial pathogens and predator/ parasitoids, and are habitually grouped with pathogens, most likely because of their symbiotic relationship with bacteria. Although many other parasitic <b>thread</b> <b>worms</b> cause diseases in living organisms(sterilizing or otherwise debilitating their host), entomopathogenic nematodes, are specific in only infecting insects. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) live parasitically inside the infected insect host, {{and so they are}} termed as endoparasitic. They infect many different types of insects living in the soil like the larval forms of moths, butterflies, flies and beetles as well as adult forms of beetles, grasshoppers and crickets. EPNs have been found in {{all over the world and}} a range of ecologically diverse habitats. They are highly diverse, complex and specialized. The most commonly studied entomopathogenic nematodes are those that can be used in the biological control of harmful insects, the members of Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae (Gaugler 2006). They are the only insect-parasitic nematodes possessing an optimal balance of biological control attributes. (Cranshaw & Zimmerman 2013).|$|R

40|$|International audienceThread milling is {{becoming}} more and more employed as a technique for producing thread, due to its advantages for industrial manufacturing sectors, such as the aeronautics, aerospace, and energy industries. The thread milling operation is atypical and several aspects have to be taken into account to perform it in good conditions. As for milling or grinding <b>worms,</b> grooves, <b>thread</b> or others sculptured surfaces, in thread milling, there exists a geometrical interference between the tool and the nominal surface which would be obtained. Thread mills have quite complex geometry and their profile has an effect on the machined thread. The present study details geometrical aspects of the thread milling process. This article deals with the link between thread mill geometry and nominal thread profile. An approach is proposed to analyze the thread profile generated by the thread mill envelope. It is deduced that thread milling produces interferences, i. e. the machined thread profile is affected by an overcut. A method is proposed to correct this geometrical error in order to produce accurate thread...|$|R
