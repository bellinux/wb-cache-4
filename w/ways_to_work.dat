5|$|Manuel Belgrano {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{politicians}} to advocate the development of an important educative system. He did so at the first report he made as head of the Consulate of Commerce, suggesting the creating of schools of agriculture and commerce. A school of agriculture would teach about important topics such as crop rotation, the specific <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with each crop, methods of seeding and harvesting, preservation of seeds, and identification of pests. Until that time, the only previous attempts to teach agriculture was done by the Jesuits, who were banished in 1767.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{was born}} in 1725, most likely {{in what is now}} Fairfax County, Virginia. His father died when he was young, and his mother managed the family estates until he came of age. He married in 1750, built Gunston Hall, and lived the life of a country squire, supervising his lands, family, and slaves. He briefly served in the House of Burgesses and {{involved}} himself in community affairs, sometimes serving with his neighbor George Washington. As tensions grew between Britain and the American colonies, Mason came to support the colonial side, and used his knowledge and experience to help the revolutionary cause, finding <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> around the Stamp Act of 1765 and serving in the pro-independence Fourth Virginia Convention of 1775 and the Fifth Virginia Convention of 1776.|$|E

25|$|Although {{alienated from}} Stalinism, Padmore {{remained}} a socialist. He sought new <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for African independence from imperial rule. Relocating to France, where Garan Kouyaté was an ally from his Comintern days, Padmore {{began to write}} a book: How Britain Rules Africa. With the help of former American heiress Nancy Cunard, he found a London agent and, eventually, a publisher (Wishart). It published the book in 1936, the year the publisher became Lawrence and Wishart, known to be sympathetic to communists. Publication of books by black men {{at that time was}} rare in the United Kingdom. A Swiss publisher distributed a German translation in Germany.|$|E

500|$|Reece Thompson plays Hal Hefner, a shy fifteen-year-old {{student at}} Plainsboro High School, New Jersey with a {{pronounced}} stutter. Beginning in late 2004, Rocket Sciences producers traveled to several American and Canadian cities {{looking for an}} actor to play the lead role of Hal. At one point, Carter Jenkins was set to play Hal, but NBC blocked this as he was contracted for further episodes of Surface. HBO Films told the producers {{after six months of}} searching for a Hal that it would abandon the project if a lead actor was not found in two weeks, at which point a desperate Jeffrey Blitz watched all of the unsolicited audition tapes that he had been sent and [...] "knew immediately we had a promising candidate" [...] when he saw Thompson's tape. Although a casting call was originally posted for a teenage boy aged 13–18 who had a stutter and could also act, Thompson had previously been taught how to stutter. However Blitz wanted Hal to stutter in a different style, knowing he was going to block up on a particular word and looking for <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> round it. Before filming, Thompson was taught this specific style by a speech pathologist.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his speech}} Seventy Faces Lamm warns his {{listeners}} {{that there will}} be an [...] "unbridgeable and cataclysmic rupture within the Jewish community" [...] unless Jews from all the denominations, including Orthodoxy, listen to each other and {{try to find a way}} to work together. [...] In this speech (now an essay) he rejects maximal ideas of religious pluralism, especially relativism. He denies that non-Orthodox Jews have halakhic legitimacy, explaining that their views on halakha do not have normative status. However he goes on to affirm a moderate form of religious pluralism, and holds that Orthodox Jews must accept that non-Orthodox rabbis are valid Jewish leaders, and possess spiritual dignity. [...] He holds that marriages that are officiated at by non-Orthodox Jews can be halakhically valid, but not so non-Orthodox divorces. Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews must find <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> together.|$|E

I wanted to do something different – I didn't want to just sing about love over regular beats". Norwood also stated how Frank Ocean inspired her on this album: [...] "We've always had that great chemistry, and we both understand music in the same <b>ways,</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with him on this album was great as well, and I hope I can get in [...] with him some more because his music is just so moving; I'm inspired by him.

2500|$|Before {{cutting a}} tree, the builder had {{to assess the}} log, its shape, length, areas of damage {{and the extent of}} heart rot, as well as <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> the bow and stern. [...] A major {{requirement}} while working with such an enormous log must have been to minimize the number of times the log had to be turned over. The first stage, therefore, would be to externally flatten the bottom and slightly upturn the bow and stern and shape the hull sides, as well as drilling holes for thickness gauges as required. [...] The log would then be rolled over and placed on some sort of timber framework so that access to the bottom was still possible. The next stage would be to work the upper section of the log to produce a sheerline and then work the inside until thickness gauges were reached. In this case, {{because of the presence of}} extensive rot, hollowing was probably done by tools rather than by fire. The thickness of the sides would be achieved by eye or by sound, simply by tapping the log. For the bottom, however, the holes left by the thickness gauges were later plugged by tightly fitted and dried oak tree-nails to ensure they were completely watertight upon expansion of the timber. The log would then be finished internally, with all the rebates for fitting bow timbers, transom, washstrakes, and holes along the sheerline cut. As the final step, bow and stern timbers, which were separate pieces from the hull log, would be caulked with moss and the whole structure made watertight.|$|E
