I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when we try to produce a vacuum.|$|E

Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: [...] "I think Rhys is going {{to fall in love}} again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E

We felt great about that cast, but <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it not just a sitcom. <b>We</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it an hour, which ultimately has more dramatic weight than a half-hour.

Kermode's book is a well received piece of literary criticism. Critic Colin Burrow called it one of “the three most inspiring works of literary criticism written in the twentieth century”, comparing Kermode's work with Erich Auerbach's [...] and E.R. Curtius's European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages. The critic Boyd Tonkin adds the additional interpretation that Barnes's “show-off” characters could be typical readers of Kermode's work.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} continuity, events in {{different}} episodes contradict each other, {{as there is}} a loose sense of canon. One such example is in [...] "The Other Cousin" [...] and [...] "N.R.A.y RAY", in which Toot is pictured with a penis, something that is not consistent with other episodes. Another is Foxxy's various and contradictory stories about her son Timmy (one involves selling him on the black market, another involves her accidentally shooting him after believing him to be rabid, when he was really just brushing his teeth). Plots and gags are often used that do not make any type of internal sense, but are used as one-off jokes, as when Foxxy, who is in her twenties, is said to have a teenage grandson. Some episodes begin with a fake recap of events supposed to have happened in a (non-existent) previous episode. According to executive producer Bill Freiberger, [...] "Very little on Drawn Together can be considered canon. If you try to find continuity on this show you'll drive yourself nuts. The only thing that's consistent is <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the show as funny as possible. And we'd never let a little thing like continuity {{get in the way of}} that." ...|$|E

Why should we without shame help the nation lie, and then be ashamed to do a little lying on our own account? Why shouldn't we be honest and honourable, and lie every time we get a chance? That is to say, why shouldn't we be consistent, and either lie all the time or not at all? Why should we help the nation lie the whole day long and then object to telling one little individual private lie in our own interest to go to bed on? Just for the refreshment of it, I mean, and to take the rancid taste out of our mouth.|$|E

Our {{knowledge}} of human labor, if intimate enough, will, I think, mass {{it for the}} most part into two kinds--mining and molding; the labor that seeks for things, and the labor that shapes them. Of these the last should be always orderly, for we ought to have some conception of the whole of what we have to make before <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any part of it; but the labor of seeking must be often methodless, following the veins of the mine as they branch, or trying for them where they are broken. And the mine, which we would now open into the souls of men, as they govern the mysteries of their handicrafts, being rent into many dark and divided ways, {{it is not possible to}} map our work beforehand, or resolve on its directions. We will not attempt to bind ourselves to any methodical treatment of our subject, but will get at the truths of it here and there, as they seem extricable; only, though we cannot know to what depth we may have to dig, let us know clearly what we are digging for. We desire to find by what rule some Art is called good, and other Art bad: we desire to find the conditions of character in the artist which are essentially connected with the goodness of his work: we desire to find what are the methods of practice which form this character or corrupt it; and finally, how the formation or corruption of this character is connected with the general prosperity of nations.|$|E

6000|$|Could Helen have {{suspected}} that, with Pen's returning strength, his unhappy partiality for little Fanny would also reawaken? Though she never spoke a word regarding that young person, after her {{conversation with the}} Major, and though, to all appearances, she utterly ignored Fanny's existence, yet Mrs. Pendennis kept a particularly close watch upon all Master Arthur's actions; on the plea of ill-health would scarcely let him out of her sight; and was especially anxious {{that he should be}} spared the trouble of all correspondence for the present at least. Very likely Arthur looked at his own letters with some tremor; very likely, as he received them at the family table, feeling his mother's watch upon him (though the good soul's eye seemed fixed upon her teacup or her book), he expected daily to see a little handwriting, which he would have known, though he had never seen it yet, and his heart beat as he received the letters to his address. Was he more pleased or annoyed, that, day after day, his expectations were not realised; and was his mind relieved, that there came no letter from Fanny? Though, no doubt, in these matters, when Lovelace is tired of Clarissa (or the contrary) it is best for both parties to break at once, and each, after the failure of the attempt at union, to go his own way, and pursue his course through life solitary; yet our self-love, or our pity, or our sense of decency, does not like that sudden bankruptcy. Before we announce to the world that our firm of Lovelace and Co. can't meet its engagements, <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> compromises: we have mournful meetings of partners: we delay the putting up of the shutters, and the dreary announcement of the failure. It must come: but we pawn our jewels to keep things going a little longer. On the whole, I dare say, Pen was rather annoyed that he had no remonstrances from Fanny. What! could she part from him, and never so much as once look round? could she sink, and never once hold a little hand out, or cry, [...] "Help, Arthur?" [...] Well, well: they don't all go down who venture on that voyage. Some few drown when the vessel founders; but most are only ducked, and scramble to shore. And the reader's experience of A. Pendennis, Esquire, of the Upper Temple, will enable him to state whether that gentleman belonged to the class of persons who were likely to sink or to swim.|$|E
