25|$|Percy Stallard was {{a bright}} and {{energetic}} man with a vision for his sport. But he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> to tolerate argument or those with other views.

25|$|He was {{progressive}} and anti-progressive at once, and likewise at once both {{a critic of}} the Zeitgeist and its most interesting expression. He was, in effect, stranded on a beachhead of his own thinking between past and future. That he was not able, by himself, to fashion a bridge between them is neither surprising, nor, in the end, disappointing. We should see this failure, rather, as an aspect of his genius. He both was and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of his time.|$|E

Bandić responded in outrage saying he went through great emotional pain during his divorce saying Josipović <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> unless he apologized.|$|E
25|$|For all his {{strengths}} though, Zaheer <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{of crises}} unlike his contemporaries, Asif Iqbal and Majid Khan and later Javed Miandad. None of his 12 hundreds came under testing situations {{and apart from}} his 80 at Guyana against the West Indies in 1977, even his fifties were generally fair-weather efforts. His reputation was forged by his four double-hundreds, including two big ones in England, and two high-scoring series against India at home, apart from which he was generally inconsistent, except when playing county cricket, a fact surprisingly lost {{on some of the}} most seasoned Pakistani experts including Qamar Ahmed who found his consistency at Test level 'phenomenal'.|$|E
500|$|Early in September 1862, the IX Corps, Reno commanding, {{returned}} to the Army of the Potomac. Gen. Lee, emboldened by his victories, invaded Maryland and McClellan moved the Army of the Potomac northwest from Washington to meet the Confederates. Portions of the armies clashed during the Battle of South Mountain, during which the 21st played only a small part. Psychologically, however, it was a devastating fight in that it saw the death of Maj. Gen. Reno, {{who had been the}} 21st's brigade commander {{at the start of the}} war. [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> in the 21st who did not love him," [...] Capt. Walcott of the 21st wrote, [...] "he always stood with his men in battle." ...|$|E

500|$|When Rhodes was {{involved}} in matches, Cardus believed that [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> given to affability", showing annoyance {{on the field and}} being critical of the performances of others. According to historian Anthony Woodhouse, Rhodes was a [...] "dour, methodical and calculating cricketer." [...] Not popular in the way that a player like Hirst was popular, Rhodes [...] "commanded respect rather than plaudits" [...] in the words of Bowes. An introvert, he did not always get along with the more extrovert Hirst, possibly owing to mutual jealousy and some of Hirst's jocular comments, and was rarely pictured smiling. However, Rhodes became more relaxed and approachable in later life, particularly after his eyesight failed. Cardus was surprised, after meeting him in 1950, at how much more readily Rhodes engaged in conversation, commenting that [...] "history comes from his mouth in rivers". His obituary in The Times concluded: [...] "Gruff or mellow, he was all of a piece, a fighting Yorkshireman, superbly gifted." ...|$|E
500|$|Appel {{wrote of}} Stengel, [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> for all seasons; {{he was a}} man for {{baseball}} seasons." [...] Stengel remains the only manager to lead his club to victory in five consecutive World Series. How much credit he is due for that accomplishment is controversial, due to the talent on the Yankee teams he managed—Total Baseball deemed that the Yankees won only six games more than expected during the Stengel years, given the number of runs scored and allowed. According to Bak, [...] "the argument—even among some Yankees—was that the team was so good anybody could manage it to a title". Rizzuto stated, [...] "You or I could have managed and gone away for the summer and still won those pennants." [...] Appel noted, [...] "There was no doubt, by taking on the Mets job, he hurt his reputation as a manager. Once again, it was clear that with good players he was a good manager, and with bad players, not. Still, his Yankee years had put him so {{high on the list of}} games won, championships won, etc., that he will always be included in conversations about the greatest managers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{peculiar}} {{aspect of}} the game was the confusion behind the main character's gender. In an interview for Sinclair User, Chris Bourne asked, [...] "Is the androgynous Kim a man or woman?" [...] Pete Austin pointed out that [...] "there's a credit at the end {{for the design of}} 'Ms Kimberley's costume,' [...] " [...] but also admitted that Kim Kimberley was [...] "a deliberately unisex name." [...] The debate came to an end with the release of Return to Eden, where it was made more explicit that Kim <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> because the surviving crew members confuse her with the woman who tried to destroy the ship.|$|E

2500|$|I {{saw that}} he had short hair, cut short, I thought; and I {{suddenly}} realized that his neck was oddly leathery and extremely filthy. [...] "That chap's got a very dirty and wrinkled neck!" [...] I said to myself. His body was as large as a medium-sized native's and he had thick square shoulders, not sloping at all... he seemed to be quite as tall as I. Then I saw that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> It was not an orang-utan. I had seen one of these large apes a short time before. It was more like a monstrously large siamang, but a siamang has long hair, and there was no doubt that it had short hair.|$|E
2500|$|Amongst {{those who}} took part in the council of war was Sir Richard Grenville, a younger brother of Sir Bevil. In the {{historian}} S.R. Gardiner's opinion [...] "A selfish and unprincipled man, [...] had gone through the evil schooling of the Irish War", and, falling into the hands of the Parliamentarians upon his landing at Liverpool, he had declared himself willing to embrace their cause. His military experience gained him the appointment of lieutenant-general of Waller's horse. He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> to feel at home in an atmosphere of Puritanism, and on 3 March 1644 he fled to Oxford, carrying with him the secret of Paulet's treachery. Grenvile's name was attached with every injurious epithet to a gallows in London, while at Oxford he was regarded as a pattern of loyalty.|$|E
2500|$|Williams married four times. She met {{her first}} husband Leonard Kovner while {{attending}} Los Angeles City College. She later wrote in her autobiography The Million Dollar Mermaid that [...] "he was smart, handsome, dependable...and dull. I respected his intelligence, and his dedication to a future career in medicine. He loved me, or so he said, and even asked me to marry him." [...] They were married in the San Francisco suburb of Los Altos on June 27, 1940. On their split she said [...] "I found, much to my relief, that all I needed for my emotional and personal security was my own resolve and determination. I didn't need a marriage and a ring. I had come to realize all too quickly that Leonard Kovner <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> I could ever really love." [...] They divorced on September 12, 1944.|$|E

2500|$|In the Long Parliament, though Hampden was by {{no means}} a {{frequent}} speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator. [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of many words," [...] says Clarendon, [...] "and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future" [...] (Hist. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.|$|E
2500|$|Like the All Blacks, Munster {{have played}} Australia many times. They first met in 1947, where Australia won 6–5. Munster claimed their first {{victory over the}} Wallabies in 1967, when they won 11–8. In 1992, Australia, reigning world champions, having won the 1991 Rugby World Cup, visited Munster {{as part of a}} European Tour. Munster won 22–19 in a rough {{encounter}} in Cork. Ten years later, London newspaper The Daily Telegraph recounted part of the legend in a feature on Munster prop Peter Clohessy: [...] "The then Wallabies coach, Bob Dwyer, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who readily accepted that opposition sides could legitimately score more points than his team, immediately branded the Munster Number 3 a 'disgrace'. It had been a typically rugged, robust and memorable Munster triumph, with leather and fists flying on both sides. Clohessy, who wouldn't generally be known for misconduct, was no more guilty than the next man but world champions are not supposed to lose against a hastily assembled Irish provincial XV. There had to be a reason, an excuse, and Dwyer rounded on Clohessy".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the long}} fourth reading ( [...] , aliyah), the angel {{replied that he}} would grant Lot this favor too, and spare that town. The angel urged Lot to hurry there, for the angel could not do {{anything}} until he arrived there, and thus the town {{came to be called}} Zoar. As the sun rose and Lot entered Zoar, God rained sulfurous fire from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah and annihilated the entire plain. Lot's wife looked back, and she turned into a pillar of salt. Next morning, Abraham hurried to the place where he had stood before God and looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and saw the smoke rising like at a kiln. Lot was afraid to dwell in Zoar, so he settled in a cave in the hill country with his two daughters. The older daughter told the younger that their father was old, and there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> on earth with whom to have children, so she proposed that they get Lot drunk and have sex with him so that they might maintain life through their father. That night they made their father drink wine, and the older one lay with her father without his being aware. And the next day the older one persuaded the younger to do the same. The two daughters thus had children by their father, the older one bore a son named Moab who became the father of the Moabites, and the younger bore a son named Ben-ammi who became the father of the Ammonites.
