As Regina takes Henry home, Emma, Mary Margaret, and the sheriff decide to investigate what happened and visit the security room. They encounter the janitor Leroy (Lee Arenberg), and the security guard Walter, who was sleeping on the job (since he is actually Sleepy).

25|$|Washington {{appointed}} von Steuben {{as temporary}} inspector general. He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the camp {{to talk with}} the officers and men, inspect their huts, and scrutinize their equipment. Steuben established standards of sanitation and camp layouts that would still be standard {{a century and a half}} later. There had previously been no set arrangement of tents and huts. Men relieved themselves where they wished and when an animal died, it was stripped of its meat and the rest was left to rot where it lay. Steuben laid out a plan to have rows for command, officers and enlisted men. Kitchens and latrines were on opposite sides of the camp, with latrines downhill side. There was the familiar arrangement of company and regimental streets.|$|E

25|$|Promoted to {{rear admiral}} on 8 February 1693 and to vice admiral in June 1693, Aylmer hoisted his flag in the first-rate HMS Royal Sovereign and served under Admiral Edward Russell as second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet. He also became Whig Member of Parliament for Portsmouth at a {{by-election}} in 1695 {{but had to}} stand down when the House of Commons declared the by-election void in January 1696. Nevertheless, he was elected Whig Member of Parliament for Dover in December 1697. The Treaty of Ryswick was signed in September 1697, bringing the Nine Years' War to an end and, after a delay in fitting out his squadron, Aylmer <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the Mediterranean, with his flag in the second-rate HMS Boyne, to ensure the treaty was being observed in September 1698; he then retired from active service in October 1699. In around 1700 he acquired Wallett's Court Manor at Westcliffe in Kent as a property {{in which he would}} live in retirement. He also had a property at No. 12 Great Piazza in Covent Garden.|$|E

He {{anchored}} the ship just off Staten Island, where Sarah used the delay to send a final letter to her mother-in-law, in which she wrote: [...] "Tell Arthur I make great dependence on the letters I shall get from him, and will try to remember anything that happens on the voyage which he would be pleased to hear."

2500|$|Having been bowled out in 11 overs on {{the third}} morning, New Zealand <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the field with a lead of 253 runs. And the second Zimbabwean innings {{proceeded}} {{in much the same}} way as the first - Bond dismissing Ebrahim early, Brendan Taylor and Tatenda Taibu staging a recovery, before Blessing Mahwire staged fireworks towards the end. Interestingly, three of the wickets came as run outs, the last one with Chris Mpofu running back towards Mahwire, who was concentrating on celebrating his half-century. This had evidently not registered with Mpofu, and before he realised his mistake, the stumps at his end were down. Following the match, Zimbabwe's coach Phil Simmons was sacked and replaced with former Zimbabwean international and Zimbabwe A coach Kevin Curran.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Belle Époque, Paris was lit by a constellation of thousands of gaslights that were often admired by foreign visitors and helped give the city its nickname La Ville-Lumière: the [...] "City of Light". In 1870, there were 56,573 gaslights used exclusively to illuminate the streets of the city. The gas was produced by ten enormous factories {{around the edge of the}} city that were located near the circle of fortifications. It was distributed in pipes installed under the new boulevards and streets. The street lights were placed every twenty meters on the Grands Boulevards. At a predetermined minute after nightfall, a small army of 750 uniformed allumeurs ("lighters") carrying long poles with small lamps at the end <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the streets to turn on a pipe of gas inside each lamppost and light the lamp. The entire city was illuminated within forty minutes. The Arc de Triomphe was crowned with a ring of gaslights, and the Champs-Élysées was lined with ribbons of white light.|$|E

At a predetermined minute after nightfall a small army of 750 allumeurs in uniform, carrying long poles with small lamps at the end, <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the streets, turned on a pipe of gas inside each lamppost, and lit the lamp. [...] The entire city was illuminated within forty minutes. The amount of light was greatly enhanced by the white stone walls of the Haussmann apartment buildings, which reflected the brilliant gaslight. Certain buildings and monuments were also illuminated; the Arc de Triomphe was crowned with a ring of gaslights, as was the outline of the Hôtel de Ville. The Champs-Elysees was lined with ribbons of white light. [...] The major theaters, cafés and department stores were also brightly lit with gaslight, as were some rooms in apartments in the new Haussmann buildings. The concert gardens in which balls were held in summer had gas lighting as well as small gas lamps in the gardens, where gentlemen could light their cigars and cigarettes.|$|E

2500|$|Brigham Young {{taught that}} if women [...] "should {{stand behind the}} counter, study law or physic , or become good book-keepers {{and be able to}} do the {{business}} in any counting house, and this to enlarge their sphere of usefulness for the benefit of society at large." [...] Many women in Brigham Young's time worked; in 1874, Utah had a respectable class of literate and professional women and a visitor noted that no profession was closed to women. After the church officially ended polygamy, church members adopted a more mainstream Victorian view towards women's work, which confined women's roles to the home. By 1920, the church's ideals for women mirrored society's until the 1960s and 70s, when some Church leaders strongly advised against (presumably married) women working outside the home. Spencer W. Kimball said, [...] "Numerous divorces can be traced directly to the day when the wife left the home and <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the world into employment." [...] Gordon B. Hinckley made allowances for single mothers and other women in similar circumstances: [...] "I recognize [...] that there are some women (it has become very many, in fact) who have to work to provide for the needs of their families. To you I say, do the very best you can." [...] A 1986 Ensign article emphasized that husband and wife share the responsibility of providing for their children's temporal needs, and that each family would prayerfully decide if a mother would go to work. Mormon women were to reject the secular values of individuality and devote themselves to the eternal women's roles of marriage, motherhood, and submissiveness.|$|E
