25|$|In 1836, Carson met an Arapaho {{woman named}} Waanibe (Singing Grass, or Grass Singing) at a {{mountain}} man rendezvous held along the Green River in Wyoming. Singing Grass {{was a lovely}} young woman, and many mountain men <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> her. Carson was forced to fight a duel with a French trapper named Chouinard for Waanibe's hand in marriage. Carson won, {{but he had a}} very narrow escape. The French trapper's bullet singed his hair. The duel {{was one of the best}} known stories about Carson in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Dionysus organizes a {{swimming}} contest and allows Ampelus to win. Ampelus is elated by his success and dresses up as a Bacchante {{as a form}} of celebration. Dionysus warns the boy to stay close to him, just in case a deity is jealous of their happiness and tries to kill him. A portent tells Dionysus that Ampelus will die and become a vine. Ate (Delusion) makes Ampelus jealous reminding him that Dionysus and the gods usually give their friends a special present, a special mount, and suggests that he should make a bull his own. Deluded, Ampelus rides a bull and provokes Selene by saying that he is a better bull-rider than her. Selene sends a gadfly to sting the bull. The animal starts kicking and Ampelus falls on his head on the ground. A satyr brings Dionysus the ill news. Dionysus prepares the body for the funeral and makes a long lament. Eros tries to console and distract him with the story of Calamos and Carpos, two handsome youngsters who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> each other. During {{a swimming}} contest Carpos drowns and Calamos, incapable of living without him, commits suicide. Calamos becomes the reeds of the river and Carpos the fruit of the earth. Dionysus is comforted with the story but mourning does not leave him. In the meantime the Seasons visit the house of Helios, the Sun.|$|E
