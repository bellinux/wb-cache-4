5|$|Not only {{is there}} no reason {{to get rid of}} the Viceroy, but even if no part of Spain {{remained}} unsubdued, the Spaniards in America ought to take it back and resume command over it.

25|$|Stephen R. L. Clark, Mary Midgley, and Bernard Rollin also discuss {{animal rights}} {{in terms of}} animals being {{permitted}} to lead a life appropriate for their kind. Egalitarianism favors an equal distribution of happiness among all individuals, which makes {{the interests of the}} worse off more important than those of the better off. Another approach, virtue ethics, holds that in considering how to act <b>we</b> <b>should</b> consider the character of the actor, and what kind of moral agents <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be. Rosalind Hursthouse has suggested an approach to animal rights based on virtue ethics. Mark Rowlands has proposed a contractarian approach.|$|E
