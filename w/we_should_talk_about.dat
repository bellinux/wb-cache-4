The recording sessions for the album {{took place at}} Milk Studios in Manhattan, New York, Metropolis Studios in London, England, Studios Davout in Paris, France and at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. Rihanna worked with several different songwriters and producers on the album, including Chuck Harmony, The-Dream, Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart, Chase & Status, StarGate, Demo, and Justin Timberlake. Rihanna wanted the album to be less influenced by synthpop, attempting to avoid the lighthearted commercial pop of her previous albums.

In {{the early stages of}} the production, she worked with Adonis Shropshire, who stated that Rihanna had brainstormed a large number of ideas over the course of a few weeks. Rihanna also worked with Norwegian producer duo StarGate, who mused that the collaboration was [...] "very rewarding" [...] and [...] "inspiring for us", commenting: [...] "I don't think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> titles just yet.

Attention is devoted here to describe the artistic space as a space of silence. This way of description lets us ask a question about the presence of mysticism in Mickiewicz's poem. This article argues that Mickiewicz's mysticism is different from the classical definition of this concept. In traditional mysticism the sole manifestation of transcendence is God.
