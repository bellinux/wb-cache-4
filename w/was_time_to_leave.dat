5|$|With the Matabele wars over, Burnham {{decided it}} <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Africa {{and move on}} to other adventures. The family {{returned}} to California. Soon after, Fred traveled to Alaska and the Yukon to prospect in the Klondike Gold Rush, taking with him his eldest son Roderick, who was then 12 years old. On hearing of the Spanish–American War, Burnham rushed home to volunteer his services, but the war had ended before he could get to the fighting. Burnham returned to the Klondike having played no part in the war. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt regretted this as much as Burnham and paid him a great tribute in his book.|$|E
5|$|To {{convince}} {{the rest of}} the colony, Peter and Thea plan to use a piece of mythology, that a dog with four white paws would be supposedly born when it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> Such a dog had been born several days ago but has yet to open his eyes. Thea decides to proceed without using the dog and tries to {{convince the}} colony at a reenactment of the Settler's escape to Greenland with several allies who know of Rowen's actions. Just as Thea and her allies are about to lose the argument, Peter arrives with the dog, whose eyes are open. That, coupled with the fact that Peter is an eye adept, the first in a hundred years, convinces the colony to listen to Thea instead of Rowen. The novel ends eight months later as the people of Gracehope are slowly educated on global warming and the dangers of staying in their colony.|$|E

Mendel remained with the Foo Fighters, joining The Fire Theft when his schedule allowed it.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} for the people in attendance to follow specific rules. The medicine man's chanupa (ceremonial pipe) is present during the ceremony, which involves prayer, the drum, and traditional songs.

25|$|After Faas Wilkes as {{the third}} player in Dutch history moved abroad to become a {{professional}} football player more and more players decided it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country and create a job out of their hobby. Van der Hart {{was one of these}} players as he moved to France to play for Lille OSC, where {{he became one of the}} first professional footballers of his country. The KNVB, which suspended all players that left the country to play professional football also suspended Van der Hart.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{her release}} from the compound, Phillips was reunited with her son Clifford, and became a {{grandmother}} in 1946. Feeling that it was impractical to try to recover her private practice, Phillips instead took a position with Radio Peking, broadcasting a half-hour program three times a week. With the Chinese Civil War looming overhead, Clifford convinced his mother that it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> China and, after 43 years, Phillips left China behind. She suffered aftereffects from the Weixan Internment Compound and died {{of congestive heart failure}} on 17 May 1951.|$|E
25|$|In early 1972, Santana and the {{remaining}} members of the band started working on their fourth album, Caravanserai. During the studio sessions, Santana and Michael Shrieve brought in other musicians: percussionists James Mingo Lewis and Latin-Jazz veteran, Armando Peraza replacing Michael Carabello, and bassists Tom Rutley and Doug Rauch replacing David Brown. Also assisting on keyboards were Wendy Haas and Tom Coster. With the unsettling influx of new players in the studio, Gregg Rolie and Neal Schon decided that it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> {{after the completion of}} the album, even though both contributed to the session. Rolie returned home to Seattle, and later, along with Schon, became a founding member of Journey.|$|E

60|$|The {{arrangement}} was, {{that on the}} morrow Jess was to {{be driven}} in the Cape cart to Martinus-Wesselstroom, more commonly called Wakkerstroom, there to catch the post-cart, which <b>was</b> <b>timed</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the town at mid-day, though when it would leave was quite another matter.

25|$|In 1983, Kiss began {{performing}} without {{makeup and}} costumes, {{thinking that it}} <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the makeup behind. The band accordingly experienced a minor commercial resurgence, and their music videos received regular airplay on MTV. Drummer Eric Carr, who had replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of a rare type of heart cancer {{and was replaced by}} Eric Singer. In response to a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup in 1996, which also saw the return of their makeup and stage costumes. The resulting Alive/Worldwide Tour was commercially successful. Criss and Frehley have both since left the band again and have been replaced by Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band have continued with their original stage makeup, with Singer and Thayer using the original Catman and Space Ace makeup, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The Harmonites were Christian pietist Separatists who {{split from}} the Lutheran Church {{in the late}} 18th century. Under the {{leadership}} of George Rapp, the group left Württemberg, Germany, {{and came to the}} United States in 1803. Due to the troubles they had in Europe, the group sought to establish a more perfect society in the American wilderness. They were nonviolent pacifists who refused to serve in the military and tried to live by George Rapp's philosophy and literal interpretations of the New Testament. They first settled and built the town of Harmony, Pennsylvania, in 1804, and established the Harmony Society in 1805 as a religious commune. In 1807, celibacy was advocated as the preferred custom of the community in an attempt to purify themselves for the coming Millennium. Rapp believed that the events and wars {{going on in the world}} at the time were a confirmation of his views regarding the imminent Second Coming of Christ, and he also viewed Napoleon as the Antichrist. In 1814, the Society sold their first town in Pennsylvania and moved to the Indiana Territory, where they built their second town. In 1824, they decided it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Indiana, sold their land and town in Indiana, and moved to their final settlement in Western Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|Freud {{continued}} {{to maintain his}} optimistic underestimation of the growing Nazi threat and remained determined to stay in Vienna, even following the Anschluss of 13 March 1938, in which Nazi Germany annexed Austria, and the outbreaks of violent anti-Semitism that ensued. Ernest Jones, the then president of the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA), flew into Vienna from London via Prague on 15 March determined to get Freud {{to change his mind}} and seek exile in Britain. This prospect and the shock of the detention and interrogation of Anna Freud by the Gestapo finally convinced Freud it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Austria. Jones left for London the following week with a list provided by Freud of the party of émigrés for whom immigration permits would be required. Back in London, Jones used his personal acquaintance with the Home Secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare, to expedite the granting of permits. There were seventeen in all and work permits were provided where relevant. Jones also used his influence in scientific circles, persuading the president of the Royal Society, Sir William Bragg, to write to the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, requesting to good effect that diplomatic pressure be applied in Berlin and Vienna on Freud's behalf. Freud also had support from American diplomats, notably his ex-patient and American ambassador to France, William Bullitt.|$|E

Bart builds a chapel, in which he commands the family to attend Sunday sermons, presided over by Joel. Cathy and Chris eventually become disgusted by the [...] "fire and brimstone" [...] sermons and tell Bart that they will no longer attend. Bart secretly starts bringing the twins to the chapel, which Cathy overhears. She confronts Bart, and tells him <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the twins alone, also telling Toni never to let them out of her sight, unless she knows they are with Jory. After again catching Bart bringing the twins to the chapel, Cathy decides it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> after two years in Bart's home. Chris agrees it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and <b>to</b> take Jory, Cindy, and the twins with them.

500|$|After Motherless Brooklyn and The Fortress of Solitude, Lethem {{decided that}} [...] "t <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Brooklyn in a {{literary}} sense anyway... I {{really needed to}} defy all that stuff about place and memory." [...] In 2007, he returned as a novelist to California, where some of his earlier fiction had been set, with You Don't Love Me Yet, a novel about an upstart rock band. The novel revolves around {{a woman in the}} band, Lucinda, who answers phones for her friend's complaint line and uses some of a caller's words as lyrics. [...] According to Lethem, the book was inspired by the years he spent as the lead singer in an upstart California band in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during what he called [...] "the unformed posturing phase of life". [...] The novel received mixed reviews.|$|E
500|$|Rising {{standards}} of achievement at Dartington enabled Imogen to organise performances of more demanding works, such as Bach's Mass in B minor in July 1950 to honour the 200th anniversary of Bach's death. Three years in preparation, this endeavour brought a tribute {{from one of}} the audience: [...] "I don't know, and can't imagine what the music of heaven is like. But when we all get there, please God, if any conducting is still necessary I hope your services will be required and that I will be in the chorus". By the middle of 1950 Imogen's professional focus was changing. She had attended the first two Aldeburgh Festivals in 1948 and [...] 1949, and in 1950 accepted a commission [...] to provide a choral work for performance at the 1951 festival. Sensing that it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Dartington, she gave a year's notice, part of which was spent on sabbatical, studying Indian music at Rabindranath Tagore's university in West Bengal. A fruit of this visit was her Ten Indian Folk Tunes for recorder. On 21 July 1951 her one-act opera, Benedick and Beatrice, was performed at Dartington, to mark her departure.|$|E
500|$|Bourlamaque had {{withdrawn}} with all but 400 {{of his men}} to Fort St. Frédéric {{as soon as he}} learned that the British were approaching. [...] The cannon fire by this small force killed five and wounded another 31 of the besieging British. [...] Captain Louis-Philippe Le Dossu d'Hébécourt, who had been left in command of the fort, judged on the evening of July 26 that it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> [...] His men aimed the fort's guns at its walls, laid mines, and put down a powder trail to the overstocked powder magazine. [...] They then lit the fuse and abandoned the fort, leaving the French flag flying. [...] The British were notified of this action by the arrival of French deserters. [...] General Amherst offered 100 guineas to any man willing to enter the works to find and douse the fuse; but no one was willing to take up the offer. [...] The entire works went off late that evening with a tremendous roar. [...] The powder magazine was destroyed, and a number of wooden structures caught fire due to flying embers, but the fort's walls were not badly damaged. [...] After the explosion, some of Gage's light infantry rushed into the fort and retrieved the French flag. [...] Fires in the fort were not entirely extinguished for two days.|$|E

2500|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} season with Juventus, Laudrup decided it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> {{looking for a}} new experience after six years in Italy. In 1989, he joined Spanish club Barcelona on the premise that Netherlands legend Johan Cruyff, his childhood role model, had been assembling a team that was striving for success. Immediately, Laudrup enjoyed major success under Cruyff's leadership, citing the Dutchman's philosophy and perception of the game as one of the main assets that helped foster his talent. He was one of the restricted three foreign players allowed in the team, alongside Dutch defender Ronald Koeman and Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoichkov, who were the pillars of the Barça [...] "Dream Team", along with rising stars Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero, and Txiki Begiristain.|$|E
