5|$|The Deltas are despondent, but Bluto rallies {{them with}} an impassioned, if {{historically}} inaccurate, speech ("Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!"), and so they decide {{to take action against}} Wormer, the Omegas, and the college. They convert Flounder's damaged car into an armored vehicle and hide it inside a cake-shaped breakaway float in order to sneak into the annual homecoming parade. As they <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> <b>on</b> the event, the futures of several of the student main characters are revealed using freeze-frame labels. Most of the Deltas become respectable professionals, while their adversaries suffer less fortunate outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Later, Overman's corpse is discovered. Reviewing the body, Kay {{realizes that}} the shark that killed him is the first shark's mother, and that {{it must also be}} inside the park. She is able to {{convince}} Calvin about this newest development when the shark herself shows up at the window of the underwater cafe. Flushed out from her refuge inside a filtration pipe, the shark begins to <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> <b>on</b> the park, injures a water skier, and causes a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel. FitzRoyce and his assistant, Jack, go down to the filtration pipe in an attempt to lure the shark back in as a trap. FitzRoyce leads the shark into the pipe, but is then attacked and killed.|$|E
5|$|Scharnhorst joined Gneisenau, in {{preparation}} for Operation Berlin, the planned breakout into the Atlantic Ocean designed to <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> <b>on</b> the Allied shipping lanes. Severe storms caused damage to Gneisenau, though Scharnhorst was undamaged. The two ships were forced to put into port during the storm: Gneisenau went to Kiel for repairs while Scharnhorst put into Gdynia (Gotenhafen). Repairs were quickly completed, and on 22 January 1941, the two ships, again {{under the command of}} Admiral Lütjens, left port for the North Atlantic. They were detected in the Skagerrak and the heavy units of the British Home Fleet deployed to cover the passage between Iceland and the Faroes. The Germans' radar detected the British at long range, which allowed Lütjens to avoid the British patrols, {{with the aid of a}} squall. By 3 February, the two battleships had evaded the last British cruiser patrol, and had broken into the open Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of repairs, Scharnhorst underwent trials in the Baltic before returning to Kiel in December 1940. There she joined Gneisenau, in preparation for Operation Berlin, a planned raid into the Atlantic Ocean designed to <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> <b>on</b> the Allied shipping lanes. Severe storms caused damage to Gneisenau but Scharnhorst was undamaged. The two ships were forced to put into port during the storm: Scharnhorst went to Gotenhafen while Gneisenau went to Kiel for repairs. Repairs were quickly completed, and on 22 January 1941, the two ships, {{under the command of}} Admiral Günther Lütjens, left port for the North Atlantic. They were detected in the Skagerrak and the heavy units of the British Home Fleet deployed to cover the passage between Iceland and the Faroes.

25|$|However, by 1979-80, {{the bubble}} had burst {{due to the}} global {{economic}} crisis {{set in motion by}} the Yom Kippur War between Israel and the Arabs in 1973.

25|$|The purchase-like Cafritz lease was controversial. Since no deeds for the {{improvements}} changed hands, Cafritz {{was able to}} avoid paying $3 million in transfer taxes and recordation fees. Since the District of Columbia did not tax leases, Cafritz only paid taxes and fees on the land, which amounted to only $620,000. Elected officials in the cash-strapped city were angered by the deal, and worried that numerous other purchase-like leases would soon <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> <b>on</b> the city's income from transfer taxes. The controversy raged for several months until, in May 1989, the D.C. City Council approved legislation increasing the transfer tax and closing the purchase-like lease loophole.|$|E

25|$|After {{years of}} living {{on the wrong side}} of the law, Simon Templar has been pardoned for past (perceived) crimes and is now working as an agent of Scotland Yard. His first mission is to {{investigate}} a crime ring called the Angels of Doom, which specializes in (among other things) helping convicted felons escape police dragnets and ambushes. The Angels of Doom is run by Jill Trelawney, a young woman who is willing to condone just about any action—including the murder of The Saint, if needs be—in her quest to <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> <b>on</b> Scotland Yard, which she blames for the death of her father. But Templar, in his pursuit of Trelawney, finds within her an unexpected kindred spirit.|$|E
25|$|One notable tactic was Kammhuber's {{offensive}} action. In {{keeping with}} the Luftwaffes defence by offensive action over enemy territory, Kammhuber suggested tracking bombers and attacking them as they took off from their bases in Britain. Hitler refused {{on the grounds that}} the German people needed to see the British bombers being brought down over Germany so as to be convinced they were being defended. After October 1941, the Luftwaffe stopped their mini offensive. Hitler's decision relieved Harris and Bomber Command. In 1940–1941 these intruders had been responsible for two-thirds of the RAF losses. The chance to <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> <b>on</b> the bomber offensive was lost. In response, Kammhuber concentrated on building the Kammhuber Line.|$|E
25|$|In three days, {{however, the}} Harriman-Hill imbroglio managed to <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> <b>on</b> the stock market. Northern Pacific stock was quoted at $150 a share on May 6, and is {{reported}} to have traded as much as $1,000 a share behind the scenes. Harriman and Hill now worked to settle the issue for brokers to avoid panic. Hill, for his part, attempted to avoid future stock raids by placing his holdings in the Northern Securities Company, a move which would be undone by the Supreme Court in 1904 {{under the auspices of the}} Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Harriman was not immune either; he was forced to break up his holdings in the Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific Railroad a few years later.|$|E

25|$|Biological invasions and {{the spread}} of {{pathogens}} and diseases are two mechanisms that spread both inadvertently and purposefully. Biological invasions begin with introductions of foreign species or biota into an already existing environment. They can be spread by stowaways on ships or even as weapons in warfare. In some cases a new species may <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> <b>on</b> a landscape, causing the loss of native species and destruction of the landscape. In other cases, the new species may fill a previously empty niche, and play a positive role. The spread of new pathogens, viruses, and diseases rarely have any positive effects; new pathogens and viruses sometimes destroy populations lacking immunities to those diseases. Some pathogens have the ability to transfer from one species to another, and may be spread as a secondary effect of a biological invasion.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{the salt}} marsh snail Littoraria irrorata {{and its effects}} on marsh plant productivity, have {{provided}} strong evidence of consumer control in marshes triggered by overexploitation. This snail is capable of turning strands of cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) (>2.5m tall) into mudflats within 8 months, which is less than one growing season (Silliman and Bertness 2002). As previously referenced, marsh snails inflict cuts on cordgrass leaves when they graze, providing substratum and nutrients for fungus. At high snail densities, cordgrass can succumb to fungal infections and marsh die-off can ensue (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005). Natural predators of the marsh snail are blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and terrapin turtles (Malaclemys terrapin), which historically regulated snail abundances. However, these predators have been commercially overexploited, and now suffer from diseases due to small population size, releasing the snails from consumer pressure, and allowing the snails to <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> <b>on</b> salt marsh cordgrass populations (Silliman and Zieman 2001).|$|E
25|$|Howard {{returned}} to his business as a private eye, working {{in the same building}} as She-Hulk, in Brooklyn. One of his first new clients was Jonathan Richards, who hired Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by the Black Cat. With the help of Tara Tam, his new friend and assistant, Howard managed to recover the necklace. But on his way to give it back to Richards, he found himself kidnapped by the Collector and allied with the Guardians of the Galaxy to escape the villain's collection. Upon returning to Earth, he confronted the Ringmaster, who had been hypnotizing old people into robbing for him, after he was robbed by May Parker, Spider-Man's aunt. After recovering the necklace for a third time, Howard was approached by Richards {{in the middle of his}} fight against the Ringmaster and Richards revealed himself to be Talos the Untamed, who revealed that the necklace was part of a marginally powerful item known as the Abundant Glove. With help from Doctor Strange, Howard and Tara located the final piece of the Abundant Glove, but were unable to put it all together when Talos grabbed it, who proceeded to use it to <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> <b>on</b> the city. Talos was confronted by numerous heroes while Howard and Tara took cover. He was able to point out that Tara, who revealed to possess shapeshifting powers similar to that of a Skrull, could help him defeat Talos. Tara used her powers to impersonate Skrull Emperor Kl'rt (Super-Skrull), distracting Talos long enough for Howard to snatch the Abundant Glove from his hand. Talos was later apprehended by the Fantastic Four and everything went back to normal. Afterwards, with the help of new arrival Gwenpool, Howard prevented Hydra from infecting the world with a deadly virus. He also has a crossover event with The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl. Howard the Duck was shown to be living in She-Hulk's apartment building when Patsy Walker moves out.|$|E
