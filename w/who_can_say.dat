LuPone made a guest appearance as herself in the Sardi's scene, which {{was shot in the}} morning on Thursday to accommodate her schedule—she had an 11:00am rehearsal for another show. Washington Square Park, which was used {{on the final day of}} filming, had not been approved as a location by the city until after the production team arrived in New York.
