500|$|Spotnitz's {{favorite}} magician was Ricky Jay, and so, for the episode, Jay {{was brought}} in to play the part of The Amazing Maleeni. Initially, however, the episode hit a snag. The production crew discovered that Jay's production agency had not been informed and that he would be unable to guest star in the episode. The staff's back-up magician, David Blaine, was unavailable for shooting as well. Series creator Chris Carter, however, later stated that the show would not take no for an answer: [...] "We got on the phone with him. He agreed to come to our offices to talk about the script and ended up doing some card tricks for us that reduced Frank and I to being six-year-olds again." [...] Jay eventually agreed to do the part, but requested that he only do the tricks he was accustomed to doing. Thus, many of Jay's trademark tricks were included in the episode's script. Gilligan, in retrospect, later noted, [...] "There was no choice other than Ricky Jay as far as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned.</b> He was not looking forward to the idea of playing a magician because I think he felt that magicians were never portrayed very realistically in movies or television shows." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gouldman, in a 1995 interview, was {{philosophical}} {{about the}} album: [...] "When we finally did {{come back to}} record again, {{it was based on}} market research that our record company had done, that said a new 10cc album would do really, really well. And, ah, history has proved that wrong." [...] Yet according to Stewart, both he and Gouldman had approached the album positively. [...] "We wrote in a three-month period, 22 songs. Every day we were coming up with new ideas, and they were getting better and better, as far as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned.</b> And they sounded like 10cc songs again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perry, however, {{recalled}} his {{days on the}} professional tour differently. He maintained that [...] "{{there was never any}} easing up in his tour matches with Ellsworth Vines and Bill Tilden since there was the title of World Pro Champion at stake." [...] He said [...] "I must have played Vines in something like 350 matches, yet there was never any fixing as most people thought. There were always people willing to believe that our pro matches weren't strictly on the level, that they were just exhibitions. But as far as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned,</b> we always gave everything we had." ...|$|E

2500|$|Comey also {{testified that}} Ashcroft [...] "expressed himself in very strong terms." [...] Goldsmith testified that Ashcroft spoke {{at length about}} the legal issue. [...] "Attorney General Ashcroft… [...] a couple of minutes' speech {{in which he said}} that he…. shared the Justice department's concerns." [...] Although he was not present for the {{conversation}} between Gonzales and Ashcroft, FBI Director Bob Mueller testified, [...] "Ashcroft complained to Judge Gonzales about White House compartmentalization rules preventing Ashcroft from getting the advice he needed." [...] On July 24, 2007, Gonzales testified that he and Card were also concerned about Ashcroft's competency. [...] "Obviously there was concern about General Ashcroft's condition. [...] And we would not have sought nor did we intend to get any approval from General Ashcroft if in fact he wasn't fully competent to make the decision." [...] In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Gonzales continued, [...] "Obviously <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> about the condition of General Ashcroft. [...] We obviously knew he had been ill and had surgery. [...] And we never had any intent to ask anything of him if we did not feel that he was competent. [...] When we got there, I will just say that Mr. Ashcroft did most of the talking. [...] We were there maybe five minutes – five to six minutes. [...] Mr. Ashcroft talked about the legal issues in a lucid form, as I've heard him talk about legal issues in the White House.|$|E
2500|$|The MRF {{had both}} a [...] "defensive" [...] {{surveillance}} role and an [...] "offensive" [...] role. MRF operatives dressed like civilians and were given fake identities and unmarked cars equipped with two-way radios. They patrolled {{the streets in}} these cars in teams of two to four, tracking down and arresting or killing suspected IRA members. They were armed with Browning pistols and Sterling sub-machine guns. Former MRF members admitted that the unit shot unarmed people without warning, both IRA members and civilians, knowingly breaking the British Army's Rules of Engagement. Former MRF members claim they had a list of targets they were ordered to [...] "shoot on sight", the aim being to [...] "beat them at their own game" [...] and to [...] "terrorise" [...] the republican movement. According to Cursey, the unit was told that these tactics had British Government backing, [...] "as part of a deeper political game". He said his section shot at least 20 people: [...] "We opened fire at any small group in hard areas [...] armed or not – it didn't matter. We targeted specific groups that were always up to no good. These types were sympathisers and supporters, assisting the IRA movement. As far as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> they were guilty by association and party to terrorist activities, leaving themselves wide open to the ultimate punishment from us". Cursey mentions two occasions where MRF members visited pubs and [...] "eliminated" [...] IRA members. One member interviewed for the BBC's Panorama, Soldier F, said [...] "We were not there {{to act like a}}n army unit, we were there to act like a terror group". Soldier H said [...] "We operated initially with them thinking that we were the UVF", to which Soldier F added: [...] "We wanted to cause confusion". Another said that their role was [...] "to draw out the IRA and to minimise their activities". They said they fired on groups of people manning defensive barricades, on the assumption that some might be armed. The MRF member who made a statement in 1978 opined that the unit's role was one of [...] "repression through fear, terror and violence". He said that the unit had been trained to use weapons favoured by the IRA.|$|E

Rectus and I agreed, however, that we would rather have a pride-of-India tree than a charter, as far as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned.</b> These trees have on them long bunches of blossoms, which smell deliciously.|$|E

The announcement that she was to be the heiress of half of Mr. Harmer's large fortune, elicited the greatest reprobation and disgust among the very portion of the population who had been most cordial in their congratulations as to the destination of the other half; namely, among the country gentry, the clergy--a very numerous and powerful body in Canterbury,--the professional men, and respectabilities of the place.|$|E

The verandah was crowded with bearded men in khaki uniforms or brown suits of flannel--smoking, reading, or talking. They looked up as we arrived. The iron gate was opened, and passing in we joined sixty British officers 'held by the enemy;' and the iron gate was then shut again.|$|E
