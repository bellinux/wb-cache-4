Upon review of the dailies, Craven found the footage was out of focus and unusable. Irwin was initially ordered to fire his camera crew. He retorted that if his crew were to be fired, they <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fire him. The producers fired him and replaced him with Peter Deming, who finished the film.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors made escape {{attempts}} daunting for the internees. They would have to navigate through Japanese-occupied territory, find food, and as few internees spoke Cantonese, they <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with the language barrier if they succeeded in escaping. Despite these difficulties, there were three major escape attempts, of which two in March 1942 were successful. One group of eight internees escaped on a small boat to neighbouring Macau. Another group, consisting of two internees, escaped through the New Territories and into mainland China. The third group, four policemen, in April 1942 managed to escape the camp grounds but were caught within {{a few miles of}} camp. They were subsequently imprisoned and released back to camp after a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Times Union of Albany {{received}} {{letters from}} readers requesting {{that all of}} NY149 be widened from two to four lanes. The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT, who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont, the amount of traffic that the route carries was not high enough to warrant a four-lane divided highway. Additionally, the state <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take {{a significant number of}} properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect the character of the area.|$|E

5|$|On November 17, 2008, Aliferi {{returned}} {{yet again}} to the Old Bridge Township Council. The council this time gave the go-ahead for construction {{to begin with a}} condition. The council set that if Aliferi wants to construct it, he has to include commercial development before constructing residential homes to minimize community impact. Also before construction would begin, Aliferi <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> return for a new General Development Permit (GDP). The proposal for the hotel that Aliferi brought up, was held off due to the location, which was on depressed elevation. There was no official decision for a new train station, which was proposed several times during Aliferi's plans.|$|E
5|$|To {{compensate}} Luxembourg for {{the loss}} of the Commission and Council, a number of provisions were laid out. Firstly, the Court of Justice would remain in the city. Some departments of the Commission and the Assembly, including the Secretariat of the Assembly would remain along with European Investment Bank (further, particularly financial, institutions would also be prioritised for Luxembourg). The Council <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hold sessions in Luxembourg during April, June and October. It also confirmed Strasbourg as the seat of the Parliament. With the prioritisation of Luxembourg for future institutions, in 1977 the Court of Auditors became provisionally located in Luxembourg.|$|E

40|$|This article compares default {{patterns}} among prime and subprime mortgages, {{analyzes the}} factors correlated with default, and examines how forecasts of defaults {{are affected by}} alternative assumptions about trends in home prices. The authors find that extremely pessimistic forecasts of home price appreciation could have generated predictions of subprime defaults that were closer to the actual default experience for loans originated in 2006 and 2007. However, for prime loans one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> anticipate that defaults would become much more sensitive to home prices. ...|$|R
5|$|While the tricking of a {{tortoise}} was {{the most}} popular method in Bulgarian mythology, in Dalmatia the legend refers to snakes, and among Serbs another version involves the locking of young hedgehogs in a box for their mother to unlock.

In any case, turtles, snakes and hedgehogs are all animals with chthonic characteristics which were often variously associated with the underworld in South Slavic tradition.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers {{began to}} find {{objects in the}} same region of space as Pluto (now known as the Kuiper belt), and some even farther away. Many of these shared several of Pluto's key orbital characteristics, and Pluto started being seen as the largest member of {{a new class of}} objects, plutinos. This led some astronomers to stop {{referring}} to Pluto as a planet. Several terms, including subplanet and planetoid, started to be used for the bodies now known as dwarf planets. By 2005, three trans-Neptunian objects comparable in size to Pluto (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) had been reported. It became clear that either they <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be classified as planets, or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers were also confident that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly if Pluto were to remain a planet.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May 1916, Engadine was {{attached}} to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Trevylyan Napier, and carried two Short Type 184 and two Sopwith Baby floatplanes aboard. The two-seat Type 184s were intended for observation and were fitted with a low-power wireless while the Babys were intended to shoot down Zeppelins. Engadine accompanied the cruisers when the Battlecruiser Fleet sortied from Rosyth that evening to intercept the German High Seas Fleet. For a time on 31 May she was actually leading the BCF and may {{have been one of the}} first ships to spot the oncoming Germans. Her position in the vanguard was dictated by the requirement for smooth water to successfully launch her aircraft; turbulent water from ships' wakes was enough to ruin a take off attempt. She <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> come to a complete stop to hoist her aircraft over the side and prepare it for launch, a process that took at least 20 minutes at anchor. Thus she could launch her floatplane in unruffled water and then fall back among the main body of the fleet.|$|E

5|$|A {{controversy}} has erupted {{since the late}} 20thcentury over the four lower Snake River dams, with the primary argument being that removing the dams would allow anadromous fish to reach the lower Snake River tributaries—the Clearwater River, the Tucannon River and the Grande Ronde River—and spawn in much higher numbers. However, removal of the dams has been fiercely opposed by some groups in the Pacific Northwest. Because much of the electricity in the Northwest comes from dams, removing the four dams would create {{a hole in the}} energy grid that would not be immediately replaceable. Navigation on the lower Snake would also suffer, as submerged riffles, rapids and islands would be exposed by the removal of the dams. Irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern Washington <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> reach further to access the water of the Snake River. However, aside from restoring salmon runs, dam removal proponents argue that the power is replaceable, that the grain transportation system could be replaced by railroads, and that only one of the four reservoirs supplies irrigation water. Irrigators in the Snake River Plain would likely need to allow less water into the Snake River during low flow {{in order to create a}} current in the four lower reservoirs, and recreation and tourism would likely benefit.|$|E
5|$|Command of A Company was {{temporarily}} {{handed over to}} the second-in-command, Captain Bob Murdoch. Present at Pakchon in November 1950, O'Dowd understood first-hand the dangers of withdrawing while in contact. The challenge was to protect the forward platoons as they withdrew from being followed up by the Chinese occupying the old B Company positions and from D Company's position after they broke contact. The Australians <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> clear the withdrawal route of any blocking forces, {{while at the same time}} the evacuation of a large number of wounded and Chinese prisoners would hamper their movement. As such the timing of the withdrawal would be critical to its success. Consequently, the lead company would not move until mid-afternoon so that the rearguard would be able to use the protection of darkness to break contact, while at the same time offering good observation and fields of fire during the daylight to support the initial moves. Orders were delivered at 14:30. B Company would lead the withdrawal down the ridge line, carrying any wounded that still required evacuation, as well as clearing the route and securing the ford near the Middlesex position. C Company would wait for the artillery to neutralise the Chinese on the old B Company position, before moving to establish a blocking position behind D Company. A Company would then withdraw to a blocking position behind C Company, in order to allow Gravener and Saunders to establish a clean break. Finally, D Company would withdraw through both C and A Company and set up a blocking position to delay any follow up and allow those companies to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1913–14 NHA season, Ross {{refused to}} sign a {{contract}} for the Wanderers, requesting a salary increase. As {{one of the top}} players on the team, the Wanderers agreed to his demands of $1,500 for the forthcoming season, in which he finished with four goals and nine points in eighteen games. The next season Ross, again concerned with his salary, began negotiating with other players in the NHA to leave their teams and form a new league that would offer higher wages. These actions resulted in his suspension in November 1914 by Emmett Quinn, president of the NHA. Ross responded by declaring himself a free agent and claiming his contract with the Wanderers was no longer valid. Consequently, although having no technical power to do so, Quinn suspended Ross from all organized hockey. The proposed new league failed to materialize and Ross applied for reinstatement to the NHA, which was granted {{at a meeting of the}} team owners on December 18, 1914. The owners realized if they suspended Ross, they <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> suspend all those he signed, hurting the league. However, Ross's actions led to his release by the Wanderers. At first he trained with the Montreal Canadiens, then joined the Ottawa Senators.|$|E

5|$|The Whig Party {{was also}} divided in Kentucky, not only between Clay and Taylor, but between gubernatorial candidates. William J. Graves, out of {{politics}} since his fatal shooting of Representative Cilley, had the backing of sitting Whig governor William Owsley, while Archibald Dixon had secured support from former Whig governor Robert P. Letcher. Letcher wrote to Crittenden that a Whig split and Democratic victory in the gubernatorial election would have an injurious effect on Whig hopes of carrying Kentucky in the 1848 presidential election; another former Whig governor, Thomas Metcalfe, concurred. At the Whig nominating convention, both Graves and Dixon withdrew their names and a delegate from Logan County put forward Crittenden's name without his consent. The nomination easily carried before Crittenden's friends could block it. The governorship was less prestigious and paid less than Crittenden's position in the Senate. He <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> abandon his growing legal practice before the Supreme Court and would lose input on national issues of importance to him such as the territorial questions {{that grew out of}} the Mexican War. Nevertheless, he believed that his candidacy would unite the Whigs and help Taylor win Kentucky's electoral votes in the general election. He accepted the nomination a week after it was made.|$|E

50|$|On June 21, Chatham House and Institute of Iranian Studies of the University of St. Andrews {{released}} a report noting several anomalies in the election results. In two provinces, Yazd and Mazandaran, turnout exceeded 100%. The report also compared voting results in the highly competitive 2005 first round and 2009. In 10 provinces, Ahmadinejad could not have achieved his reported totals through retaining his own 2005 voters, winning every voter who voted for other conservatives in 2005, winning every Rafsanjani voter, and winning every single 2005 non-voter who turned out in 2009. He <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get a number of voters who had previously voted for a reformist candidate in 2005 to defect to him.
