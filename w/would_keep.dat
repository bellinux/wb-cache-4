5|$|Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. {{had planned}} to publish The Well of Loneliness in the United States {{at the same time}} as Cape in the United Kingdom. But after Cape brought forward the {{publication}} date, Knopf found itself in the position of publishing a book that had been withdrawn in its home country. They refused, telling Hall that nothing they could do <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> the book from being treated as pornography.|$|E

5|$|As the war progressed, the {{clientele}} of Salon Kitty decreased. In July 1942, {{the building was}} demolished during a British air attack and the brothel had to be relocated. Within the year the SD decided to abandon the project and handed the salon back to Schmidt, with the threat that she <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> silent or face retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{created his}} own raised-dot system {{by using an}} awl, {{the same kind of}} {{implement}} which had blinded him. In the process of designing his system, he also designed an ergonomic interface for using it, based on Barbier's own slate and stylus tools. By soldering two metal strips across the slate, he created a secure area for the stylus which <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> the lines straight and readable.|$|E
5|$|During 2002, Prost {{spent time}} with his family and competed in eight bicycle races, {{finishing}} third in the Granite – Mont Lozère. The Frenchman raced in the Andros ice race series in 2003, finishing second in the championship behind Yvan Muller; he also became an Ambassador for Uniroyal, a position he <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> until May 2006.|$|E

5|$|Healey I {{advised to}} go to his brother at Bolton, and get some money, and keep out of sight entirely, until {{something}} further was known. His best way would be to avoid Manchester, and go over Kersal moor and Agecroft bridge; and as I had a relation in that quarter who wished to see me, I <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> him company as far as Agecroft.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 2016, Microsoft {{announced}} it planned {{to acquire the}} professional networking site LinkedIn for $26.2 billion, {{to be completed by}} the end of 2016. The acquisition <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> LinkedIn as a distinct brand and retain its current CEO, Jeff Weiner, who will subsequently report to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. The acquisition was completed on December 8, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Washington had {{considered}} abandoning Fort Washington, {{but he was}} swayed by Nathanael Greene, who believed the fort could be held {{and that it was}} vital to do so. Greene argued that holding the fort <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> open communications across the river and might dissuade the British from attacking New Jersey. Magaw and Putnam concurred with Greene. Washington deferred to Greene and did not abandon the fort.|$|E

5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Nation of Islam, MalcolmX {{announced}} {{his willingness to}} work with leaders {{of the civil rights}} movement, though he advocated some changes to their policies. He felt that calling the movement a struggle for civil rights <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> the issue within the United States, while changing the focus to human rights would make it an international concern. The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where MalcolmX said the emerging nations of the world would add their support.|$|E
5|$|Allenby {{reviewed}} {{the threat of}} counterattack and his supply situation and decided that a force large enough to attack into the Judean Hills and a separate force to operate on the maritime plain could be maintained far from base. He decided to quickly attack Fevzi Pasha's Ottoman 7th Army in the Judean Hills {{with the hope of}} capturing Jerusalem. This <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> pressure on this army in the hope of denying them time to complete their reorganisation, dig deep trenches or worst of all, counterattack.|$|E

5|$|Also on 10 October 19, {{his wife}} Livilla {{had given birth}} to twin sons, Tiberius Gemellus and Germanicus, whom he named after his adoptive brother. Their birth was celebrated by his father who claimed that never before in the history of Rome had twins been born to a man as high in rank as Drusus, and the event was commemorated on the reverse of coins. Tiberius had hoped that Drusus <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> the {{imperial}} family together and entrusted him with the guardianship of Germanicus' sons, Nero and Drusus.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} proposal <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> the existing station open but with many services calling {{only at a}} new Westbrae Drive station. This proposal was backed in August 2001 by Charlie Gordon, then leader of Glasgow City Council, who said that having a second station in Jordanhill would assist students at the nearby Jordanhill campus of the University of Strathclyde. The proposed new station would have been only roughly 500 yd (460 m) away.|$|E
5|$|Christopher McQuarrie, {{who went}} uncredited {{for his work}} on X-Men, was hired to write the {{screenplay}} for the second Wolverine film in August 2009. Darren Aronofsky was chosen to direct the film, though bowed out, stating the project <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> him out of the country for too long. James Mangold was later chosen to direct the film. Mark Bomback was then hired to rewrite McQuarrie's script. Principal photography began in August 2012 in Sydney, Australia, and ended in November. The film was released on July 26, 2013.|$|E

5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
5|$|Due to its poor performance, Friedman {{believed}} that the Federal Reserve Board should be abolished. Friedman was deeply critical about Federal Reserve policies, even during the so-called 'Volcker shock' that was labelled 'monetarist.' He further {{believed that}} if the money supply was to be centrally controlled (as by the Federal Reserve System) that the preferable {{way to do it}} would be with a mechanical system that <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate.|$|E
5|$|For many at the indaba, {{the most}} {{pressing}} motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, he understood that Britain was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> his land, and the British would be obliged {{to protect him from}} incursions by the Boers.|$|E
60|$|This is {{showed us}} by the intercession of the high priest under the law, that was to bear away the iniquities of the holy things of the {{children}} of Israel; yea, and also by his atonement for them that sinned; for that it saith, 'And the priest shall make an atonement for him, for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.' (Lev 5:10) This also is intimated even where our Lord doth make intercession, saying, 'I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.' (John 17:15) That Christ prayed that the converted should be kept from all manner of commission of sin, must not be supposed, for that is the way to make his intercession, at least in some things, invalid, and to contradict himself; for, saith he, 'I know that thou hearest me always.' (John 11:42) But the meaning is, I pray that thou <b>wouldest</b> <b>keep</b> them from soul-damning delusions, such as are unavoidably such; also that thou <b>wouldest</b> <b>keep</b> them from the soul-destroying evil of every sin, of ever temptation. Now this he doth by his prevailing and by his pardoning grace.|$|R
