The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E

25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E

In a low-scoring match in which the Indian team led England by 13 on the first innings, it was Gimblett's top-scoring 67 not out in the second innings that brought victory to his side. England had been set 107 to win, but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> pitch and uncertain weather, [...] "the task could not be regarded as an easy one," [...] Wisden wrote. It went on: [...] "As Gimblett got {{the pace of the}} wicket, he developed sound hitting powers and hooked superbly." [...] In partnership with Maurice Turnbull, who made 37, Gimblett hit off the runs in 100 minutes, playing [...] "with much skill and verve".|$|E
2500|$|It {{quickly became}} {{evident that the}} men who stayed in their places {{suffered}} less than those who ran away, as any movement worsened {{the effects of the}} gas, and that those who stood up on the fire step suffered less—indeed they often escaped any serious effects—than those who lay down or sat {{at the bottom of a}} trench. Men who stood on the parapet suffered least, as the gas was denser near the ground. The worst sufferers were the wounded lying on the ground, or on stretchers, and the men who moved back with the cloud. Chlorine was less effective as a weapon than the Germans had hoped, particularly as soon as simple countermeasures were introduced. The gas produced a visible greenish cloud and strong odour, making it easy to detect. It was water-soluble, so the simple expedient of covering the mouth and nose <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> cloth was somewhat effective at reducing the effect of the gas. It was thought to be even more effective to use [...] urine rather than water, as it was known at the time that chlorine reacted readily with urea (present in urine) to form dichloro urea.|$|E

40|$|The valve {{and seat}} in modern mud pumps {{for oil and}} gas well {{drilling}} are expendable pump parts. New types of valve <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> chamber without rubber or polyurethane seal and with metal-to-metal contact area and heavy-duty load bearing capacity have been elaborated [1]. Lighter weight body of plate characterizes this design. In comparison with the valve of ordinary construction <b>a</b> valve <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> chamber contains additional struc-tural elements, which in the moment of setting on of the plate forms the chamber of the pro-moted pressure between a seat and plate. It is considered that application of damper cham-ber will decrease the shock loadings or “hammer-effect ” at the setting of plate. However, for development of reliable working construction it is necessary to resolve next basic problems: – to calculate the optimum size of clearances in damper chamber, – to define speed of landing of plate at the entrance in <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> chamber, – to overcome hydroabrasive wear in the clearances of <b>damper</b> chamber as <b>a</b> result of high speeds of mud flow. It is possible to resolve first two problems by the mathematical model of work of mud pump valve <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> chamber. For possibility of resolving of mathematical model it is necessary to define the coefficient of discharge in valve by the computer design of fluid flow, as a nonlinear function depending on the height of getting up of plate above a seat. The computer three-dimensional parametric model of valve <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> chamber has been developed for the valve assembly No. 7 of triplex single action pump. A paramet-ric model gives a possibility to change the height of getting up of plate H and the geometri-cal parameters of seat and plate and clearances in <b>damper</b> chamber. By <b>a</b> programmatic complex CosmosFlowWorks®, which will realize the finite ele-ment method for the tasks of hydrogasdynamics the value of speeds of stream and pressure was calculated in the area of landing of plate (Fig. 1).
