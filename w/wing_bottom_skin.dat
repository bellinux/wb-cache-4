40|$|Aircraft is {{symbol of}} a high {{performance}} mechanical structure, which {{has the ability to}} fly with a very high structural safety record. Aircraft experiences variable loading in service. Rarely an aircraft will fail due to a static overload during its service life. For the continued airworthiness of an aircraft during its entire economic service life, fatigue and damage tolerance design, analysis, testing and service experience correlation play a pivotal role. The present study includes the stress analysis and damage tolerance evaluation of the wing through a stiffened panel of the bottom skin with a landing gear cutout. <b>Wing</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>skin</b> experiences tensile stress field during flight. Cutouts required for fuel access and landing gear opening and retraction in the bottom skin will introduce stress concentration. Fatigue cracks will initiate from high tensile stress locations. An integral stiffened panel consisting a landing gear cutout is considered for the analysis. Stress analysis will identify the maximum tensile stress location in the panel. In a metallic structure fatigue manifests itself {{in the form of a}} crack which propagates. If the crack in a critical location goes unnoticed it could lead to a catastrophic failure of the airframe. A critical condition will occur when the stress intensity factor (SIF) at the crack tip becomes equal to fracture toughness of the material. SIF calculations will be carried out for a crack with incremental crack lengths using MVCCI method. Analytical evaluation of the crack arrest capability of th...|$|E

40|$|Design for {{prevention}} of aeroelastic instability (that is, the critical speeds leading to aeroelastic instability lie outside the operating range) {{is an integral}} part of the wing design process. Availability of the sensitivity derivatives of the various critical speeds with respect to shape parameters of the wing could be very useful to a designer in the initial design phase, when several design changes are made and the shape of the final configuration is not yet frozen. These derivatives are also indispensable for a gradient-based optimization with aeroelastic constraints. In this study, flutter characteristic of a typical section in subsonic compressible flow is examined using a state-space unsteady aerodynamic representation. The sensitivity of the flutter speed of the typical section with respect to its mass and stiffness parameters, namely, mass ratio, static unbalance, radius of gyration, bending frequency, and torsional frequency is calculated analytically. A strip theory formulation is newly developed to represent the unsteady aerodynamic forces on a wing. This is coupled with an equivalent plate structural model and solved as an eigenvalue problem to determine the critical speed of the wing. Flutter analysis of the wing is also carried out using a lifting-surface subsonic kernel function aerodynamic theory (FAST) and an equivalent plate structural model. Finite element modeling of the wing is done using NASTRAN so that wing structures made of spars and ribs and top and <b>bottom</b> <b>wing</b> <b>skins</b> could be analyzed. The free vibration modes of the wing obtained from NASTRAN are input into FAST to compute the flutter speed. An equivalent plate model which incorporates first-order shear deformation theory is then examined so it can be used to model thick wings, where shear deformations are important. The sensitivity of natural frequencies to changes in shape parameters is obtained using ADIFOR. A simple optimization effort is made towards obtaining a minimum weight design of the wing, subject to flutter constraints, lift requirement constraints for level flight and side constraints on the planform parameters of the wing using the IMSL subroutine NCONG, which uses successive quadratic programming...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{crosslinked}} layer-by-layer (xLbL) forward osmosis (FO) membranes with a double-skinned design {{have been}} synthesized and characterized {{in the present}} work. Cross flow reverse osmosis test {{results showed that the}} membrane top skin generally had higher hydraulic resistance and better solute rejection compared to the <b>bottom</b> <b>skin</b> even when the same number of polyelectrolyte layers were deposited. The overall water permeability of the double-skinned FO membrane can be estimated from the respective values of the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>skins</b> using a resistance-in-series model. For FO tests performed at high feed solution (FS) concentration (0. 5 M MgCl 2), the water flux was not affected by the membrane separation properties nor its orientation. However, much higher FO water flux was obtained in the top-skin-facing-the-draw-solution (Top-DS) orientation compared to the alternative Top-FS orientation when the FS concentration was low. Using DI water as FS and 0. 5 M MgCl 2 as DS, FO water fluxes ranged from 40 to 80 L/m 2 h in Top-DS and ∼ 30 L/m 2 h in Top-FS. Higher DS concentrations resulted in greater FO water fluxes (e. g., 50 - 110 L/m 2 h at 2 M MgCl 2 DS). Fouling tests demonstrated that the double-skinned membrane had much better resistance against FO fouling in the Top-DS orientation. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first systematic study on the synthesis and characterization of double-skinned xLbL membranes.
