Wild birds usually appear soiled with a rusty or brown shade {{to the white}} plumage, derived from mud or iron-rich soil. Captive specimens without access to soil have clean white plumage. It has been suggested as a case of cosmetic colouration. The bill is slender and long, and {{the tip of the}} upper mandible is hooked. The nostril is an elongated horizontal slit. The neck feathers are long and form a hackle. The wings are pointed, with the third primary being the longest; the tail is <b>wedge</b> <b>shaped.</b> The legs are pink in adults and grey in juveniles. The claws are long and straight, and the third and fourth toes are slightly webbed at the base.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{construction}} methods using gunpowder {{have been}} widely used to crush bedrock, concrete, etc. However, when these methods are used in urban areas, there can be negative safety and environmental effects. Therefore, there has been a growing demand for electric discharge shock crush, which is a static, non-blasting crush method that does not use gunpowder. This research aims to develop a method of controlling the crack direction during electric discharge shock crush. For the experiment, we used test pieces with a water-cement ratio of 55 %, a height of 200 mm, and a diameter of 100 mm. Then, we created four types of <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> to use on the test pieces, including a two-way <b>wedge</b> <b>shape,</b> a three-way <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> (a downward <b>wedge</b> is added), a lateral disc <b>wedge</b> <b>shape,</b> and a four-way <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> (decahedron). For the discharge characteristics, the current and voltage waveforms had little difference between the test pieces, and it was confirmed that a larger waveform resulted from an increase in the charging voltage. Also, the two-way <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> could not control the crack direction. However, the three-way <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> could control a crack in the vertical direction and divide the test piece into two pieces. Thus, {{it is important to have}} a downward wedge (three-way wedge) to control the crack in the vertical direction. In addition, the lateral disc <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> generates a crack in the horizontal direction, and as a result, the test piece was sliced horizontally like a disc. Also, the four-way <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> cracked the test piece in the vertical and horizontal directions along the edges of the wedge. In conclusion, it was found that the <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> controls the crack directions...|$|R

The fuselage was essentially tubular, tapering to a point at the nose, housing the guidance equipment, warhead and systems equipment.

25|$|In 2014, archaeological work in {{the former}} prison grounds led to the {{discovery}} of three rare panopticons (named after Jeremy Bentham’s prison design of 1791) located near the A and B Divisions that were built of bluestone in the 1850s. The first uncovered and excavated was to the north of A division and was built of bluestone in the 1850s. The circular design, with walls coming out from the centre, created <b>wedge</b> <b>shaped</b> 'airing yards' where prisoners would be permitted access for one hour per day without coming into contact with each other. The panopticons fell out of use, due to prison overcrowding, and were largely demolished in the early 1900s. The panopticons were based on the design concepts of British philosopher and social reformer Jeremy Bentham. The footings of the first panopticon that was excavated and uncovered is located to the north of A Division and remains relatively intact. The excavation and uncovering of the other two panopticons next to B Division only revealed the remains of its rubble footings.|$|E
25|$|According to the Strategikon, the Huns did {{not form}} a battle {{line in the}} method that the Romans and Persians used, but in irregularly sized {{divisions}} in a single line, and keep a separate force nearby for ambushes and as a reserve. The Strategikon also states the Huns used deep formations with a dense and even front. Otto Maenchen-Helfen states that the Huns likely formed up in divisions according to tribal clans and families which Ammianus calls Cunei, the leader of which was called a Cur and inherited the title as it was passed down through the clan. The Strategikon states that the Huns kept their spare horses and baggage train {{to either side of}} the line about a mile away, with a moderate sized guard, and would sometimes tie their spare horses together behind the main battle line. The Huns preferred to fight at long range, utilizing ambush, encirclement, and the feigned retreat. The Strategikon also makes note of the <b>wedge</b> <b>shaped</b> formations mentioned by Ammianus, and corroborated as familial regiments by Maenchen-Helfen. The Strategikon states the Huns preferred to pursue their enemies relentlessly after a victory and then wear them out by a long siege after defeat.|$|E

500|$|Absorption filters {{dissipate}} {{the energy}} in unwanted frequencies internally as heat. [...] This {{is in contrast}} to a conventional filter design where the unwanted frequencies are reflected back from the input port of the filter. [...] Such filters are used where it is undesirable for power to be sent back towards the source. [...] This is the case with high power transmitters where returning power can be high enough to damage the transmitter. [...] An absorption filter may be used to remove transmitter spurious emissions such as harmonics or spurious sidebands. [...] A design that has been in use for some time has slots cut in the walls of the feed waveguide at regular intervals. [...] This design is known as a leaky-wave filter. [...] Each slot is connected to a smaller gauge waveguide which is too small to support propagation of frequencies in the wanted band. [...] Thus those frequencies are unaffected by the filter. [...] Higher frequencies in the unwanted band, however, readily propagate along the side guides which are terminated with a matched load where the power is absorbed. [...] These loads are usually a <b>wedge</b> <b>shaped</b> piece of microwave absorbent material. [...] Another, more compact, design of absorption filter uses resonators with a lossy dielectric.|$|E
