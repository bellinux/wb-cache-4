The bulk freight market is very volatile, and it fluctuates, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> cargo, the ship's size, and the route {{traveled}} all affect the final price. Moving a capesize load of coal from South America to Europe cost anywhere from $15 to $25 per ton in 2005. Hauling a panamax-sized load of aggregate materials from the Gulf of Mexico to Japan that year could cost as little as $40 per ton {{to as much as}} $70 per ton.|$|E

These were followed by 28 more aircraft that were ordered in February 1945 for operational use by the 509th Composite Group. This batch included the aircraft which were used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Including the Pullman B-29, a total of 46 Silverplate B-29s were produced during and after World War II. An additional 19 Silverplate B-29s were ordered in July 1945, which were delivered between {{the end of the war}} and the end of 1947. Thus, a total of 65 Silverplate B-29s were made.|$|E

Similarly, Psilocybe specialist Gastón Guzmán suggests that P.zapotecorum, as described by Rolf Singer in 1958, is misidentified as it agrees well <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> P.hoogshagenii.

5|$|With 19 minutes left, Arsenal finally scored. A poor {{clearance}} by Westerveld fell to Grimandi, {{who passed}} {{the ball to}} Pirès. Ljungberg received it and rounded the goalkeeper to score, much to Wenger's delight. Henry missed a chance to give Arsenal a two-goal lead in the 74th minute, as his shot was point-blank saved by Westerveld and on the follow up cleared by Hyypiä. Both managers made changes in the final period of the game; Ray Parlour came on for Wiltord {{in order to protect}} Arsenal's lead, whereas Liverpool made an attacking double substitution – Fowler and Berger on for Šmicer and Murphy. Liverpool survived the onslaught and found a foothold in the game when Owen equalised with eight minutes left. Arsenal failed to clear substitute McAllister's free-kick, and Owen pounced with a right-foot finish past Seaman from eight yards. Liverpool's comeback was completed five minutes later in the 88th minute, with extra time looming; Owen was released down the left by a weighted long ball pass from Berger, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> vision which had been earlier missing from their play, and he outpaced both Tony Adams and Dixon before shooting low and accurately past Seaman, beating him at the far post.

25|$|Unlike {{corporate}} bonds, most securitizations are amortized, {{meaning that}} the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan, rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan. Fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets, such as home equity loans, auto loans, and student loans. Prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing ABS. The possible rate of prepayment varies widely <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> underlying asset pool, so many prepayment models {{have been developed to}} try to define common prepayment activity.
