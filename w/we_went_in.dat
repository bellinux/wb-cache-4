500|$|In 1910, Vanderbilt's only blemish was {{fighting}} defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie. Team captain Bill Neely, recalling the tie with Yale said: [...] "The score {{tells the story}} a good deal better than I can. All I {{want to say is}} that I never saw a football team fight any harder at every point than Vanderbilt fought today – line, ends, and backfield. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> to give Yale the best we had and I think we about did it." [...] The team was led by third-team Walter Camp All-American guard Will Metzger, and piloted by Morrison.|$|E

500|$|Taylor wanted Asgard in {{this film}} {{to have a more}} natural look than its predecessor. To achieve this, crews filmed the coast of Norway with an Arri Alexa camera for three days in a helicopter, {{capturing}} six hours of footage. Double Negative then embedded their CG rendering of Asgard on shots of the natural landscape. Double Negative visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, [...] "The benefit of that is that you have some real world terrain to work with – so you have buildings that have to convey natural features. Then from there <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> there populating the terrain with different buildings." [...] For scenes taking place on Svartalfheim, production filmed in Iceland with Double Negative adding ruins, mountains, Dark Elf ships, and skies.|$|E
500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano. Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd have {{somebody}} write out a chord sheet for us, and then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> and figured {{it out on the}} date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It reminds me of the way we used to do the Beatles. John [...] and I would write a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about. They'd work it out right there in the room".|$|E
500|$|Although Noel rejoined Oasis a {{few weeks}} later, the band's {{management}} and handlers were worried. With an album's worth of songs already demoed, the general feeling among the Gallaghers was that they should record as soon as possible. Their manager, Marcus Russell, said in 2007 that [...] "in retrospect, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> the studio too quickly. The smart move {{would have been to}} take {{the rest of the year}} off. But at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. If you're a band and you've got a dozen songs you think are great, why not go and do it." [...] Morris expressed opposite sentiments, arguing that [...] "It was a mistake on everyone's part, management very much included, that we didn’t record Be Here Now in the summer of 1996. It would have been a much different album: happy probably." [...] He described the Mustique demos as [...] "the last good recordings I did with Noel" [...] and had a good rapport with Gallagher before Knebworth, regarding the concert as having changed things for the worse.|$|E

Smith stated that the team tried to create a record [...] "for the Britney Spears that we know and love" [...] and that it did not [...] "touch on anything that was really dealing with all the stuff that she was dealing with." [...] Both commented that although Spears arrived late to the recording sessions, she caught them off guard with her efficiency and professionalism, with Lewis adding, [...] "It was absolutely nuts, and she took directions very well.

500|$|A guest {{appearance}} by English actor and comedian Steve Coogan as Rowan Priddis, {{the director of}} the cruise, is also featured. In the episode, when the Simpsons are having dinner at the restaurant on the ship, the character makes a stage performance of a song called [...] "Enjoy It While You Can" [...] that prompts Bart to make sure the cruise lasts forever. This song was a contribution by [...] Broadway composer and lyricist Robert Lopez, who produced it in New York City in 2011 for the episode. Coogan recorded the song in New York as well. The writers of the show provided Lopez their suggestion for the song's lyrics, which [...] "he then tweaked", according to William Keck of TV Guide. Lopez told Keck that he and the Simpsons staff decided to create something [...] "cheesy that actually could be performed on a cruise ship. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> a Carnival Cruise, 'Feelin' Hot Hot Hot' direction." [...] According to The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma, Lopez produced [...] "Enjoy It While You Can" [...] with a [...] "synthesizer band" [...] and The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen [...] "added a Vegas-style house orchestra arrangement for the final version." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Chabon (pronounced, in his words, [...] "Shea as in Shea Stadium, Bon as in Bon Jovi", i.e., [...] ) {{was born}} in Washington, DC to Robert Chabon, a {{physician}} and lawyer, and Sharon Chabon, a lawyer. Chabon said he {{knew he wanted to}} be a writer when, at the age of ten, he wrote his first short story for a class assignment. When the story received an A, Chabon recalls, [...] "I thought to myself, 'That's it. That's what I want to do. I can do this.' And I never had any second thoughts or doubts." [...] Referring to popular culture, he wrote of being raised [...] "on a hearty diet of crap". His parents divorced when Chabon was 11, and he grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Columbia, Maryland. Columbia, where Chabon lived nine months of the year with his mother, was [...] "a progressive planned living community in which racial, economic, and religious diversity were actively fostered." [...] He has written of his mother's marijuana use, recalling her [...] "sometime around 1977 or so, sitting in the front seat of her friend Kathy's car, passing a little metal pipe back and forth before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> to see a movie.". He grew up hearing Yiddish spoken by his mother's parents and siblings.|$|E

500|$|Thau explained, [...] "I {{worked on}} Ladyhawke and that's how I really met Dick [...] and Tom Mankiewicz. I {{used to hear}} those {{wonderful}} stories in the cutting room that Tom and Dick and Stuart would tell about Superman and that's how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of 'Taking Flight' and 'Making Superman'". Donner commented, [...] "There are a few shots where Chris 's costume looked green. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> and cleaned that up, bringing the color {{back to where it}} should be." [...] Thau wanted to make the film shorter: [...] "I wanted to take out the damn poem where Lois is reciting a poem [...] when they're flying around. I also wanted to take out a lot of that car chase where it was just generic action… It was like a two-minute car chase. But Dick didn't want to take [...] out [...] the poem." [...] It was followed by a box set release in the same month, containing [...] "bare bones" [...] editions of Superman II, Superman III, and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. In November 2006, a four-disc special edition was released, followed by an HD DVD release and Blu-ray. Also available (with other films) is the nine-disc [...] "Christopher Reeve Superman Collection" [...] and the 14-disc [...] "Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In the Dark" [...] was {{directed}} by Ethan Lader. Dev enlisted Lader to make the video as he regularly makes videos for her and The Cataracs. Lader originally contacted her with ideas for the clip, and she soon replied with what she would want in the video. She said, [...] "So we did that back and forth, which he always does with me until I get my point across. ... and then we met up and we got both of our ideas and feelings across. I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is, in a really interesting way, and we pulled it off, I think." [...] The video was filmed in Los Angeles, California in late-April 2011, just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour. Dev took {{more control over the}} [...] "In the Dark" [...] video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director [...] "take a little bit of control" [...] when she was inexperienced in the process. In an interview with Idolator, Dev elaborated on the video's concept, stating that she wanted a dark feel similar to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland: [...] "I wanted the video to be sexy as well. I wanted it to reflect all the dark aspects of the song, and initially <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> thinking that we'd have an Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton type of feel." ...|$|E

[...] "Radar" [...] was originally planned to be released as the third single from Blackout, according to Lewis. [...] "Break the Ice" [...] was released instead and [...] "Radar" [...] was chosen as the fourth single. In July 2008, a CD single was released in countries such as New Zealand and Sweden. However, a wider release was scrapped when Spears began recording new material for her sixth studio album, Circus. On May 7, 2009, the song was announced as the fourth single from Circus.|$|E

The band expanded its sound, spending more time with Date and giving more thought to the album's production. Cunningham varied his drum sound and experimented by using different types of snare drum on almost every track. The album was praised for its loud-soft dynamics, the flow of the tracks, Moreno's unusual vocals, and the strong rhythm-section performance of Cheng and Cunningham. Stephen Thomas Erlewine's review noted that [...] "while they don't have catchy riffs or a fully developed sound, Around the Fur suggests they're about to come into their own".|$|E
