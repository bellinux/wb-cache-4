5|$|Lownds infuriated the Special Forces {{personnel}} {{even further}} when the indigenous survivors of Lang Vei, their families, civilian {{refugees from the}} area, and Laotian survivors from the camp at Ban Houei Sane arrived at the gate of KSCB. Lownds feared that NVA infiltrators were mixed up in the crowd of more than 6,000, and lacked sufficient resources to sustain them. Overnight, they were moved to a temporary position {{a short distance from}} the perimeter and from there some of the Laotians were eventually evacuated, although the majority turned around and <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> down Route 9 toward Laos.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened on}} 17December 2015, with a bridge walk, in which Sheet Harbour {{residents}} {{walked across the}} old bridge to commemorate its closure, then <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> across the new bridge signifying its opening. That same day, the new bridge was opened for pedestrians, and open to traffic the following day. The new bridge has a projected lifespan of at least 75years, until 2090. It also has a sidewalk, which connects to Sheet Harbour's current sidewalk system. Officials hope this will encourage active transportation.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May {{the brigade}} became the corps reserve and at noon {{were ordered to}} assist the 179th (2/4th London) Brigade in their attack on El Haud. The {{regiment}} crossed the bridge and started forward, through artillery fire, first walking then increasing their pace to a canter, until they reached cover. But then they were ordered back and {{had to return to}} Umm Es Shert, so they headed back through the shellfire until they reached the village. They remained there overnight until ordered forward to support the 4th Light Horse Brigade defending the road from the Ed Damieh ford to Es Salt, which was the only route back {{for the rest of the}} force attacking Es Salt. For the next day the regiment held a defensive position along the road, and then moved, dismounted, into the mountains to help the Australian Mounted Division extricate themselves. On 3 May, once the Australians had moved past them, the regiment <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> down the track behind them, shelled by Turkish artillery. They then moved into the lines held by the infantry until the other forces had reached safety, before forming the rearguard back to Ghoraniyeh, arriving at 16:00 on 5 May.|$|E

Claiming to have trouble understanding Binh's speech, Vaughn encouraged Binh to lean closer. When he did so, Vaughn restrained Binh in a choke hold and he and two passengers knocked the package from Binh's hand and pinned him to the floor. Vaughn signalled the retired police officer, who shot Binh five times, killing him. Vaughn then carried Binh's body to the rear exit of the aircraft and threw it onto the tarmac.|$|E

50|$|Five years later, {{the band}} held a reunion gig in 1999, and this led on {{to a new}} album, <b>Walking</b> <b>Back</b> Home, with the band now working on a {{part-time}} basis. The <b>Walking</b> <b>Back</b> Home album combines eight songs that were brand new compositions, previously unreleased tracks, or released only with limited availability, with nine previously released Deacon Blue songs. In this sense, it is not purely a studio album nor a typical compilation album. Because, however, <b>Walking</b> <b>Back</b> Home {{marked the beginning of}} a new period of reformation and activity for the group, it is a significant album in their catalogue. The band released another album, Homesick, in 2001.|$|R

25|$|However, the Thai {{artillery}} strongpoint at Ban Na {{had come}} under siege {{during the opening}} of Campaign 74B. Now the 165th Regiment from the 312th Division joined the attack. However, weather {{was not the only}} hindrance to close air support for the Thais; U.S. tactical air was also being diverted to bomb North Vietnam. Instead, BC 605 and BC 606 were tasked with seizing Hill 1663, four kilometers southwest of Ban Na. On 29 March, they lined up on the landing zone for insertion into a landing zone at the foot of Hill 1663. Forty troopers from BC 605 deserted rather than load up; they <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to Long Tieng.

25|$|The 1965 Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway {{was one of}} {{the wildest}} races in NASCAR history. Rookie driver Buren Skeen died after two cars ran into the side of his car in the early laps. Sam McQuagg was leading the race, when Cale Yarborough tried to muscle past McQuagg for the lead. Yarborough flew over the guardrail, rolled around six times, and ended {{up at the end of}} the parking lot by a light post. Yarborough waved to the crowd as he <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the pits. A video clip of the wreck was used on ABC's Wide World of Sports for several years. With 44 laps left, Fred Lorenzen and Darel Dieringer were {{fighting}} for the lead far ahead of Jarrett. Lorenzen's motor expired, and even before he could get into the pits Dieringer's motor started smoking too. Dieringer continued at a slower pace to finish third. The race was won by Ned Jarrett by 14 laps and 2 car lengths or 19.25 miles, which is the farthest margin of victory in NASCAR history (in terms of miles).|$|E

25|$|Geelong met North Melbourne in the Preliminary Final in a match {{which proved}} even more nailbiting than their match with Footscray 2 weeks prior. North Melbourne started well, but Geelong {{dominated}} {{the second and}} third quarters to lead by six goals in the third quarter. A fine feat given that Geelong's target all season, Gary Ablett was being beaten by North Melbourne's full back, Mick Martyn. However, North Melbourne came back strongly in the last quarter and took the lead late in the match. However, Geelong scored a behind to level the scores. With 25seconds left and a boundary throw-in, the ball came to ground and Martyn cleared, only for the ball to be marked by Leigh Colbert. Colbert then kicked long, where ruckman John Barnes dropped the mark, allowing Leigh Tudor, a former North Melbourne player to swoop, and kick the ball over Martyn's head to land in the hand of Gary Ablett. As Ablett <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to take his kick, the siren went, and Ablett kicked the winning goal, propelling Geelong to its third Grand Final in seven years.|$|E
25|$|Clara Schumann {{often took}} charge of {{finances}} and general household affairs. Part of her responsibility included making money, which she did by giving concerts, although she continued to play throughout her life {{not only for the}} income, but because she was a concert artist by training and by nature. She was the main breadwinner for her family, and the sole one after Robert was hospitalized and then died, through giving concerts and teaching, and she did most of the work of organizing her own concert tours. She hired a housekeeper and a cook to keep house while she was away on her long tours. She refused to accept charity when a group of musicians offered to put on a benefit concert for her. In addition to raising her own large family, when one of her children became , she took on responsibility for raising her grandchildren. During the May Uprising in Dresden in 1849, she famously walked into the city through the front lines, defying a pack of armed men who confronted her, rescued her children, then <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> out of the city through the dangerous areas again.|$|E
25|$|Pietersen {{played in}} the first Test against India {{and in the first}} innings, he made 37 but not without controversy. He edged the ball behind of Zaheer Khan to Dhoni. He walked, but after seeing replays on the screen, he <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the middle and the {{decision}} was overturned. Ironically, he was out shortly afterwards caught Dhoni, bowled Khan. In the second innings he was top scorer with a knock of 134 to set up a potential England victory. Pietersen described this as his best century, in very testing conditions. In the second test, he was twice lbw to RP Singh for 13 and 19 in a defeat which subsequently cost them the series. After making 41 in the first innings, Pietersen scored his 10th Test century in the third and final Test at the Oval, helping England to draw the game with 101. In the one-day series that followed, he struggled at the start with a top score of 33 not out in the first five matches of the series. He scored two half-centuries in the final matches including 71 not out in the final match at Lord's, hitting the winning runs to give England the series.|$|E

25|$|It {{remains unclear}} whether {{the release of the}} 15 British naval {{personnel}} had any coincidence with the release of a senior Iranian diplomat, Jalal Sharafi, who was taken hostage during a kidnapping in 2007. He was released on Tuesday, 3 April 2007, and <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> into the Iranian embassy in Baghdad, although it is not clear who had abducted him. He was taken captive by a group of men dressed in uniforms of the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion – a special Iraqi unit under US direction. After his release, Sharafi claimed he had been kidnapped and tortured by American troops and agents of an Iraqi organisation acting {{under the supervision of the}} US Central Intelligence Agency. Signs of torture were reportedly found on Sharafi's body for which he received medical treatment. Iran also allegedly now has access to five Iranian nationals arrested in the US raid on Iranian liaison office in Arbil. An International Committee of the Red Cross team also visited the Iranian detainees. The British government however repeatedly stated that it made no deals with the United States or with Iran to secure the release of the detainees, and the timing of these events may be purely coincidental.|$|E
25|$|Having {{missed the}} first Victoria game Ted Dexter led the MCC in the return match. Bill Lawry won the toss, put the MCC in to bat and Ian Meckiff (5/93) had them in {{immediate}} trouble at 6/2 and 96/5. Tom Graveney was dropped in the slips, but returned to form with a magnificent 185 with 23 fours and supported by Fred Titmus (28), Alan Smith (46) and David Allen (25) he hoisted to score up to 375. Victoria's reply relied heavily on Jack Potter's 106 - nobody else made 35 - and Allen bowled himself back into form with 5/43 with help from David Larter (4/105) dismissed the Victorians for 307. The MCC made 218/5 {{to set up a}} run-chase, Ted Dexter making 70, Ken Barrington 66 and Graveney 38 not out, Meckiff taking 2/47. This left Victoria 252 minutes to make 287 runs, which they did not go for, instead they slumped to 116/7 and when Bob Cowper was out for 51 they were 148/8 with 50 minutes to go and certain to lose. Allen had taken 3/24 and Larter 3/45, but Meckiff's 38 held them up until he was dismissed by Barrington (2/60). Ken Kirby and Alan Connolly saw out the last few minutes and the game ended in a draw when they <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> on 188/9.|$|E
