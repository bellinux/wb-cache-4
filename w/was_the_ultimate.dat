5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that discussions over different types of deicing fluid were discussed, along with different deicing equipment and techniques.

5|$|The Tupolev Tu-85 (USAF/DoD {{reporting}} name 'Type 31', NATO reporting name Barge) was a Soviet prototype {{strategic bomber}} {{based on the}} Tu-4, an unlicensed reverse engineered copy of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> development of the B-29 family, being over 50% heavier than its ancestor and had nearly double the range. Only two prototypes were built before the program was canceled {{in favor of the}} Tupolev Tu-95 bomber which was much faster and had the same range.|$|E

50|$|Regarding of a tandem-queue roadway having 3 BNs with μ1<μ2, if μ1<μ2<μ3, {{similarly}} as the 2-BN case, D3(t) will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> {{departure of}} this 3-BN tandem-queue roadway. If, however, μ1<μ3<μ2, D2(t) will then still <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> departure of <b>the</b> 3-BN tandem-queue roadway. Thus, it can <b>be</b> summarized that, <b>the</b> {{departure of the}} bottleneck with the minimum capacity will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> departure of <b>the</b> entire system, regardless of the other capacities {{and the number of}} bottlenecks. Figure 16 shows a general case with n BNs.|$|R

5|$|The delegates {{also agreed}} with Madison that the {{executive}} function {{had to be}} independent of the legislature. In their aversion to kingly power, American legislatures had created state governments where the executive was beholden to the legislature, and by the late 1780s this was widely seen as being a source of paralysis. The Confederation government <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> example of this.|$|E
5|$|In the end, {{air superiority}} and {{command of the}} sea allowed the Allies to heavily {{reinforce}} their position on Los Negros. The 1st Cavalry Division could then overrun the islands. The campaign officially ended on 18May 1944. The Allied victory completed {{the isolation of the}} major Japanese base at Rabaul that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> objective of the Allied campaigns of 1942 and 1943. A major air and naval base was developed in the Admiralty Islands that became an important launching point for the campaigns of 1944 in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms to fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit. The result <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus {{into the ranks of}} the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. A new culture of dependency was emerging, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E

5|$|The emperor <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> {{authority}} in policy- and decision-making, {{but in the}} early Principate he was expected to be accessible to individuals from all walks of life, and to deal personally with official business and petitions. A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually. The Julio-Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians, but trusted slaves and freedmen. After Nero, the unofficial influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion, and the emperor's council (consilium) became subject to official appointment for the sake of greater transparency. Though the senate took a lead in policy discussions {{until the end of the}} Antonine dynasty, equestrians played an increasingly important role in the consilium. The women of the emperor's family often intervened directly in his decisions. Plotina exercised influence on both her husband Trajan and his successor Hadrian. Her influence was advertised by having her letters on official matters published, as a sign that the emperor was reasonable in his exercise of authority and listened to his people.|$|E
5|$|The {{rulers of}} the Vijayanagara empire {{maintained}} the well-functioning administrative methods developed by their predecessors, the Hoysala, Kakatiya and Pandya kingdoms, to govern their territories and made changes only where necessary. The King <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> authority, assisted by a cabinet of ministers (Pradhana) headed by the prime minister (Mahapradhana). Other important titles recorded were the chief secretary (Karyakartha or Rayaswami) and the imperial officers (Adhikari). All high-ranking ministers and officers were required to have military training. A secretariat near the king's palace employed scribes and officers to maintain records made official by using a wax seal imprinted with the ring of the king. At the lower administrative levels, wealthy feudal landlords (Goudas) supervised accountants (Karanikas or Karnam) and guards (Kavalu). The palace administration was divided into 72 departments (Niyogas), each having several female attendants chosen for their youth and beauty (some imported or captured in victorious battles) who were trained to handle minor administrative matters and to serve men of nobility as courtesans or concubines.|$|E

25|$|In Eng{{land in the}} 12th and 13th Centuries, {{the legal}} {{ownership}} of land was defined through a hierarchical system of estates. The monarch <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> owner of all land in the realm, {{and out of his}} estate lesser estates existed, held by individuals known as tenants in capite. Further estates could be created out of these estates in a process called subinfeudation.|$|E
25|$|A {{traditional}} local {{justice system}} called Gacaca predominated {{in much of}} the region as an institution for resolving conflict, rendering justice and reconciliation. The Tutsi king <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> judge and arbiter for those cases that reached him. Despite the traditional nature of the system, harmony and cohesion had been established among Rwandans and within the kingdom since the beginning of Rwanda.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{during the}} period of Ottoman Empire, Alevis were {{forbidden}} to proselytise, and Alevism regenerated itself internally by paternal descent. To prevent penetration by hostile outsiders, the Alevis insisted on strict endogamy which eventually made them into a quasi-ethnic group. Alevi taboos limited interaction with the dominant Sunni political-religious centre. Excommunication <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> punishment threatening those who married outsiders, cooperated with outsiders economically, or ate with outsiders. It was also forbidden to use the state (Sunni) courts.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1711, a flood rushed into Fort Louis forcing {{soldiers}} and citizens to seek safety in the trees. The houses of the settlement were submerged {{to the top of}} their roofs for nearly a month. The flood <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> factor in the decision to relocate the settlement. When the French abandoned Twenty-Seven Mile Bluff, the fort and houses were burned. It is likely that the structures were destroyed to prevent enemies from easily establishing a fortification at the site.|$|E
25|$|Laurence Tisch, who led Loews Corporation {{with his}} brother, Robert Tisch, {{for more than}} half a century, also embraced value investing. Shortly after his death in 2003 at age 80, Fortune wrote, “Larry Tisch <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> value investor. He was a {{brilliant}} contrarian: He saw value where other investors didn't -- and he was usually right.” By 2012, Loews Corporation, which continues to follow the principles of value investing, had revenues of $14.6 billion and assets of more than $75 billion.|$|E
25|$|The king of Bagratuni Armenia held {{unlimited}} {{powers and}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> authority {{when it came}} to resolving questions on foreign and domestic affairs. The princes and nakharars were directly subordinate to the king and received and kept their lands only through his permission. Should certain nobles have disobeyed the king's orders, he would have the right to confiscate their lands and distribute them to other nobles. The concept of divine right, however, did not exist and insubordination by the nakharar elite could only be matched by the steadfastness of the king himself.|$|E

In 970, al-Azhar University was founded in Cairo, which to this day remains the most important center of Sunni Islamic learning. In the 12th century Egypt, the Jewish Talmudic scholar Maimonides produced his most important work.|$|E
25|$|Three {{historical}} currents were at {{work during}} this period. The first was {{the efforts of the}} Mongolians to form an independent, theocratic state that embraced Inner Mongolia, Barga (also known as Hulunbuir), Upper Mongolia, Western Mongolia and Tannu Uriankhai ("pan-Mongolia"). The second was the Russian Empire's determination to achieve the twin goals of establishing its own preeminence in the country but, at the same time ensuring Mongolia's autonomy within the newly independent Chinese state. The third <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> success of China in eliminating Mongolian autonomy, and creating its sovereignty over the country.|$|E
25|$|The Mamluk sultan <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> authority, {{while he}} {{delegated}} power to provincial governors known as nuwwab as-saltana (deputy sultans, sing. na'ib as-saltana).

In Hama, the Mamluks had permitted the Ayyubids to continue to govern until 1341 (its popular governor in 1320, Abu'l Fida, was granted the title sultan by Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad), but otherwise the nuwwab of the provinces were Mamluk emirs.|$|E
