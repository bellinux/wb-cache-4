25|$|Llamas, {{which are}} well-socialized and trained to halter and lead after weaning, are very {{friendly}} and pleasant to be around. They are extremely curious and most will approach people easily. However, llamas that are bottle-fed or over-socialized and over-handled as youth will become {{extremely difficult to}} handle when mature, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> begin to treat humans as they treat each other, which is characterized by bouts of spitting, kicking and neck wrestling.|$|E

25|$|Many saw in a {{contrasting}} light Ratzinger's {{planning and}} overseeing {{of the opening}} of the long-sealed Inquisition archives, making available at the beginning of 1998 all materials up to the 1903 death of Pope Leo XIII. However, the lag behind availability of other Vatican archives (at that point open up to the 1922 death of Pope Benedict XV and, since Ratzinger became Pope himself, up to the 1939 death of Pope Pius XI), has led to some criticism; it is still unclear what the Vatican's plan for future accessibility to post-1903 Holy Office archives is, nothing having been said since 1998 regarding whether and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be made available to scholars.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in burlesque theater, {{the modern}} popular form of strip theater can {{minimize}} {{the interaction of}} customer and dancer, reducing the importance of tease in the performance in favor of speed to undress. Most clubs have a dancer rotation where each dancer in turn will perform for one or more songs in a fixed sequence which repeats during a shift. Less formal clubs will have dancers take turns when a stage becomes empty or have a free flow of entertainers where the stage has any number of entertainers who wander off and on at will. Featured entertainers are not usually part of the rotation and they generally have set times <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> perform that are advertised throughout the shift. If a DJ is present, {{he or she will}} emcee the rotation and typically announce the current dancer(s) on stage and possibly whom to expect in future sets.|$|E

25|$|The {{plants are}} as highly adapted in their methods of {{surviving}} seasonally inclement conditions {{as they are}} in their structure and feeding habits. Temperate perennials can require a winter period in which they die back each year, and they will weaken in cultivation if they are not given it; tropical and warm-temperate species, on the other hand, require no dormancy. Floating bladderworts in cold temperate zones such as the UK and Siberia can produce winter buds called turions at the extremities of their stems: as the autumnal light fails and growth slows down, the main plant may rot away or be killed by freezing conditions, but the turions will separate and sink {{to the bottom of the}} pond to rest beneath the coming ice until the spring, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> return to the surface and resume growth. Many Australian species will grow only during the wet season, reducing themselves to tubers only 10mm long to wait out the dry season. Other species are annual, returning from seed each year.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} other dimmer double and binary stars in Cygnus. Mu Cygni is a binary star with an optical {{tertiary}} component. The binary system has {{a period of}} 790 years and is 73 light-years from Earth. The primary and secondary, both white stars, are of magnitude 4.8 and 6.2, respectively. The unrelated tertiary component is of magnitude 6.9. Though the tertiary component is divisible in binoculars, the primary and secondary currently require a medium-sized amateur telescope to split, as they will through the year 2020. The two stars will be closest between 2043 and 2050, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> require a telescope with larger aperture to split. The stars 30 and 31 Cygni form a contrasting double star similar to the brighter Albireo. The two are divisible in binoculars. The primary, 31 Cygni, is an orange-hued star of magnitude 3.8, 1400 light-years from Earth. The secondary, 30 Cygni, appears blue-green. It is of spectral type A5IIIn and magnitude 4.83, and is around 610 light-years from Earth. 31 Cygni itself is a binary star; the tertiary component is a blue star of magnitude 7.0. Psi Cygni is a binary star divisible in small amateur telescopes, with two white components. The primary is of magnitude 5.0 and the secondary is of magnitude 7.5. 61 Cygni is a binary star divisible in large binoculars or a small amateur telescope. It is 11.4 light-years from Earth and has a period of 750 years. Both components are orange-hued dwarf (main sequence) stars; the primary is of magnitude 5.2 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.1. 61 Cygni is significant because Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel determined its parallax in 1838, the first star to have a known parallax.|$|E
500|$|Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) wrote a poem called [...] "Itylus" [...] {{based on}} the story in which Philomela and Procne, after being {{transformed}} into the nightingale and swallow, ask <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be able to forget the grief of having slain Itylus—the answer being they will forget when the world ends.|$|E

50|$|Black-backed bitterns are solitary, secretive {{and seldom}} seen, mainly active at dusk or at night. They are skulkers of reed beds, walking in a {{crouched}} posture with head extended forward, crossing patches of open ground rapidly, stalking their prey at the water’s edge. <b>When</b> alarmed <b>they</b> <b>will</b> assume the cryptic posture {{typical of many}} bitterns, standing still with the head and bill extended vertically upwards. Usually reluctant to fly, <b>when</b> flushed <b>they</b> <b>will</b> do so with retracted head and dangling legs, skimming low over {{the water and the}} wetland vegetation.|$|R

500|$|Canada {{entered the}} final facing {{pressure}} {{to defeat the}} Soviets.

[...] Coach Scotty Bowman called it a [...] "must win game" [...] for Canada: [...] "We really are favorites in the final. [...] Nobody in this country will tolerate a loss." [...] The players also spoke of their desire to show the Soviets {{that they were the}} world's top hockey nation. During their pre-game preparations, Tikhonov called upon his team to play the finest games of their lives: [...] "Today you got to play so well that the entire Canadian population will talk about you afterwards and remember you for a long time.

500|$|The ship {{stopped in}} New London, Connecticut, {{to pick up}} a {{replacement}} assistant engineer, leaving on July 3, 1871. By the time the ship reached St. John's, there was dissension among the officers and scientific staff. Bessels, backed up by Meyer, had openly rejected Hall's command over the scientific staff. The dissension spread to the crew, which was divided along nationalist lines. In his diary, Assistant Navigator George Tyson wrote that {{by the time they reached}} Disko Island, Greenland, [...] "...expressions are freely made that Hall shall not get any credit from this expedition. Already some have made up their minds how far they will go and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> get home again." [...] Hall asked Captain Davenport of the supply ship Congress to intervene. Davenport threatened to have Meyer shackled for insubordination and sent back to the United States, at which point all of the Germans threatened to quit. Hall and Davenport were forced to back down, however Davenport delivered a strongly worded speech on naval discipline to the crew.|$|E
