40|$|Contemporary eco-tourism {{includes}} {{the basic principles}} of sustainable development and actively contributes to the preservation of natural and cultural heritage of a specific area by involving the residents of local communities in the planning, development and distribution of generated revenues. It is based on the abundance of biodiversity (particularly rare and endemic species), the traditional knowledge and folklore tradition of a specific area. Products and services that are specific to this form of tourism have always been {{on the verge of being}} both beneficial and harmful for the identity of a particular area. Yet, one of the current solutions for attaining good economic results of eco-tourism is grouping all available resources within a particular local community for the purpose of promoting its distinctive features and diversity. In this paper, the author discusses a significant trend of forming eco-tourism clusters and points out to the contemporary solutions aimed at protecting the genetic resources, traditional knowledge and folklore of local communities <b>within</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>services.</b> The development of intellectual property protection, whose goal is to preserve traditional knowledge and skills of certain local communities, has a significant impact on the development of eco-tourism as well as on the increase of its competitiveness in the global market...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the narrow}} {{research}} focus on „determinants of organisational innovation ‟ or on „innovation output ‟ rather than understanding the dimensions, the term innovativeness lacks clarity {{and has become a}} notoriously ambiguous construct for tourism practitioners and academics. Reliable and valid constructs of firm-level innovativeness have not been well established in the <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> literature. Accordingly, there is an absence of significant empirical research activity on innovativeness <b>within</b> the small <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> firm. Using exploratory qualitative research in the form of interviews, this paper aims to disentangle the innovativeness construct and identify its key dimensions. The authors offer a new multidimensional conceptualisation and integrated conceptual model of firm-level innovativeness...|$|R
40|$|The {{specificity}} of accounting and taxation <b>services</b> in <b>tourism</b> business {{is the result}} of the peculiarity of tourism product offered to customers and it consequently must take into consideration two aspects of accounting in tourism and hospitality companies. Firstly, it should be determined which activity is dominant in a tourism and hospitality company. Secondly, it is possible to identify the <b>services</b> of <b>tourism</b> and hospitality companies by complying with the laws and regulations on tax, accounting and tourism. In regard to the above mentioned criterion, all the <b>services</b> of <b>tourism</b> companies can be divided into two major groups: the services of travel intermediaries as well as tourism companies which organize tours by themselves (unique, quasi-unique and non-unique <b>tourism</b> <b>service).</b> Unlike the hospitality business which provides accommodation and meals either individually or as a package, a unique <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> is always offered <b>within</b> <b>tourism</b> offer, whereas a part of it (unique service) can be provided in addition to the hospitality service too. This paper will clearly show how to provide unique <b>tourism</b> <b>services</b> independently, taking into consideration specific accounting and tax treatment different from situations when the unique <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> is provided as a part of the hotel or hospitality service...|$|R
40|$|Organizational {{impact on}} {{information}} systems {{plays an important}} role for tourism managers' attention towards improving <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> quality. As <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> quality depends on information systems, which is important to determine what aspects of organizational impact that are critical to the managers of tourism enterprises to devise effective <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> quality improvement strategies. In this paper, the model of the relationship of information systems, <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> quality and organizational impact is constructed to solve the problems of the correlation among them. The organizational impact is hypothesized in which information systems and <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> qualities are high. Meanwhile, a positive relationship between information systems, <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> quality can be drawn. Hereafter, the hypotheses can be tested with the survey data. Finally, the results of this paper show that the <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> quality is the most influential variable in the model proposed, which highlighted the importance of information systems applied to <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> quality based on organizational impact. 漏 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER...|$|R

40|$|People in most {{cultures}} {{would probably}} agree that politeness is needed during their interaction. However {{there may be}} differing opinions as to {{when they should be}} polite. In <b>tourism</b> industry, <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> providers 2 ̆ 7 act as hosts and tourists act as guests. Typically hosts will try to act politely and use appropriate politeness norms when serving guests to ensure their satisfaction. The research findings show that the <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> providers in Central Java use various unggah-ungguh ‘politeness norms 2 ̆ 7 when serving English speaking tourists and Indonesian speaking tourists. Besides that, there are some violations made by the <b>tourism</b> <b>service</b> providers in using unggah-ungguh ‘politeness norms 2 ̆ 7.

40|$|To satisfy customers, {{managers}} of <b>tourism</b> <b>services</b> {{need to understand}} their customers' value requirements and then develop a unique service value offering based on those requirements. This understanding underpins their effort to provide superior value to customers and deliver the proposed services through employees. Problematically, previous work on value creation (i. e. customer value) has focused separately on either the firm or customer. This theoretical separation does not allow investigation of whether there may be discrepancies between what value firms offer and what value customers perceive they have received.
