5|$|I {{consider}} {{him to be}} {{one of my best friends}} but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. So, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E
5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number of possibilities was enormous, since there are many possibilities for each component of a reactor—fuel, coolant, moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the coolant may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the moderator may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, at the very beginning of nuclear power, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> choose which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E
5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{discourage}} the cheap tricks of controversy, the retort, {{the search for}} inconsistency. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> realize that these things are as foolish and ill-bred and anti-social as shouting in conversation or making puns; and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work out habits of thought purged from the sin of assurance. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do this for our own good quite as much as {{for the sake of}} intercourse.|$|R
30|$|In these conditions, we can {{say that}} both systems show good results and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> choose our priority: if we are looking for {{localization}} preservation, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> select IPCMD; and if we are looking for data injection preservation, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> choose IPCMD-A.|$|R
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{figure out ways to}} separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} {{generally}} very well received outside London, {{and especially in}} north, where rugby was dominated by the working-class. Reaction to the team in the south, where the public school establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wrote—"I shall never forget the trip, notwithstanding the extremely heavy programme of fixtures <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go through. Perhaps the most delightful part of our experiences was tasted {{not so much on}} the field of play as off it".|$|E

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> create our own {{journals}} {{because it}} was impossible to obtain entry into the official journals of psychiatry and medicine.

25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E
25|$|The fusion really worked, {{and after}} two days of intense rehearsals we had an amazingly tight piece, {{although}} we had problems with twenty dancers being covered in bruises! In order to get the attitude across and the intensity with the choreography they really had to slap each other. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> change the styling to hide all the bruises, particularly on the thighs.|$|E

Did <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> lose our elites, which were slaughtered? Did <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> lose millions of our citizens, murdered by totalitarian occupiers, the Germans and the Soviets? Did <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> lose our independence for 50 years? The answer to these questions is politically incorrect, because Poland was not doomed to fail. And the answer is included in my book, in which I write that history could have been different".|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to Twain's specific allegations, Ament said:The clan in China {{is responsible for}} the individuals and in collecting from the clans we did only what it is the settled policy of the Chinese themselves to do. It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> provide for these people, and so we went to the abandoned grain shops and took what we could find. If we had not done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold off all the furniture and goods in the place and used the money to support our Christians. I have been surprised to hear that this was criticised.|$|E
25|$|We {{did some}} rather audacious things. We shot {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so we could get the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of there. And we {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E
25|$|It's like St. Patrick's Day. I {{came out}} of respect for what my people are doing, not because I believe it will do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the {{official}} approval from Mastah Kennedy, Mastah Wagner, Mastah Spellman, and they started setting limits on how <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> march peacefully, I knew that the march {{was going to be a}} mockery, that they were giving us something again.|$|E

25|$|In the evening, Crosby did {{the whole}} show before an {{audience}}. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but {{we would have to}} take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.|$|E

This march covered the {{distance}} of 700 miles going and returning {{to and from the}} vicinity of Kansas City. The weather was much of the time during the march, cold, and the ground rough and frozen, the shoes of the men worn out and much severe suffering was endured.|$|E
25|$|Congratulations to Australia, {{they were}} the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> gamble on the first morning.

25|$|When {{the first}} {{prisoners of war}} were captured, the German Army’s superiority was put on display by making them march through towns, which {{produced}} scenes of collective hate. In certain train stations, mannequins dressed in Allied uniforms were hung, visible to prisoners passing by in trains: “I noticed that in many stations, the Krauts hung mannequins depicting sometimes a zouave, other times a grunt or an artilleryman”. Camp visits were organised for schoolchildren. “Sunday, schoolchildren ordered about by their teachers with drums, fifes and flags toured the camp. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tour the cinemas and the…menageries surrounding the city, for the public would not stop flooding in.

25|$|Australia won the Test, only just, by 13-12 on a wet and windy Athletic Park. Another one-point margin. We had it {{won more}} comfortably than it looked until David Campese, {{who was at}} fullback, made a mistake {{towards the end of}} the game. Standing in a tackle, he flicked the ball back infield where it was snapped up by All Black centre Joe Stanley who then popped up a pass as he was being tackled to {{breakaway}} Mark Brooke-Cowden for a try beside the posts. The easiest of conversions made it one point the difference, and in the dozen minutes remaining <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tackle like mad dogs in the fierce wind and pelting rain to keep them out.
