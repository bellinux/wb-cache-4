5|$|Originally {{intended}} to {{only be a}} one-year project, Cirque du Soleil was scheduled to perform in 11 towns in Quebec {{over the course of}} 13 weeks running concurrent with the third La Fête Foraine.

No food or medical aid was given to the civilians as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by the lack of support and poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his people <b>were</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> more like an enemy. On 10 February, Laotian civilian refugees started walking back to Laos along Highway 9, because they feared for their lives and preferred to die in their own country.
