5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University. A normal season as defined by NOAA has six to fourteen named storms of which four to eight reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes. The June 1988 forecast was that eleven storms would form and that seven <b>would</b> <b>reach</b> hurricane status. The forecast did not specify how many hurricanes <b>would</b> <b>reach</b> major hurricane status.|$|E

5|$|Before {{observations}} of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios {{for the future}} of the universe.

5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts like Dr. William M. Gray, {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University. A normal season, {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has six to fourteen named storms, with four to eight of those reaching hurricane strength, and one to three major hurricanes. The July 23, 1983 forecast predicted that after the slow start to the season, that a total of eight storms would form, and five of the storms <b>would</b> <b>reach</b> hurricane status. The forecast did not specify how many of the hurricanes <b>would</b> <b>reach</b> major hurricane status. However, the predictions proved to be too high, with only four named storms forming {{by the end of the}} season and three of those reaching hurricane status.|$|E

5|$|Bjarne Sortland was {{appointed}} managing director. The first helicopter was delivered in May, {{with a new}} helicopter being delivered each month. They were named Havsulen, Havhesten, Havørn and Havsvale. Owner Bjørn G. Braathen stated that his goal was that the airline <b>would</b> <b>reach</b> a 50% market share. In 1990, another challenger, Mørefly, had also established themselves in the market. For the start of operations, Braathens Helikopter hired 22 pilots, most of them previously working for the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The company had 70 employees in total. Services started on 1 September 1990, where the initial contract involved flying 10,000 passengers per year.|$|E
50|$|The {{terminal}} was outgrown by the mid-1980s, {{and debate}} began about expanding the airport. In 1985, {{the administration of}} Monroe County Executive Lucien A.

5|$|Continual {{growth and}} outside {{investments}} {{during these years}} allowed the company to expand and grow: Odwalla's revenue tripled from 1994 to 1995, and in 1996 they made more than $59million in sales, their highest ever. This constant growth made Odwalla {{one of the largest}} fresh-juice companies in America by 1996, when the company was selling its products to stores in seven states and parts of Canada. It was estimated that they <b>would</b> <b>reach</b> $100million in sales by 1999. Much of this growth resulted from the perception that Odwalla's products were healthier than regular juice because of unpasteurization.|$|E

Although Dyer initially demanded only £200,000, Tesco would have lost an estimated £5million had they complied with Dyer's demand to place cards in every copy of the Bournemouth Echo.|$|E
5|$|Education in Nigeria is {{overseen by}} the Ministry of Education.

The education system is divided into Kindergarten, primary education, secondary education and tertiary education. After the 1970s oil boom, tertiary education was improved so that it <b>would</b> <b>reach</b> every subregion of Nigeria. 68% of the Nigerian population is literate, and the rate for men (75.7%) is higher than that for women (60.6%).|$|E

5|$|Regardless of {{the outcome}} of the {{continental}} migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted.

5|$|The Allies {{soon began}} {{detecting}} signs of preparations {{for a new}} convoy. A Japanese floatplane of the type normally used for anti-submarine patrols in advance of convoys was sighted on 7 February 1943. The Allied Air Forces South West Pacific Area commander – Lieutenant General George Kenney – ordered an increase in reconnaissance patrols over Rabaul. On 14 February, aerial photographs were taken that showed 79 vessels in port, including 45 merchant ships and six transports. It was clear that another convoy was being prepared, but its destination was unknown. On 16 February, naval codebreakers in Melbourne (FRUMEL) and Washington, D.C. finished decrypting and translating a coded message revealing the Japanese intention to land convoys at Wewak, Madang and Lae. Subsequently, codebreakers decrypted {{a message from the}} Japanese 11th Air Fleet to the effect that destroyers and six transports <b>would</b> <b>reach</b> Lae about 5 March. Another report indicated that they <b>would</b> <b>reach</b> Lae by 12 March. On 22 February, reconnaissance aircraft reported 59 merchant vessels in the harbour at Rabaul.|$|E
5|$|The Deep Impact {{mission was}} planned to help answer {{fundamental}} questions about comets, which included what {{makes up the}} composition of the comet's nucleus, what depth the crater <b>would</b> <b>reach</b> from the impact, and where the comet originated in its formation. By observing {{the composition of the}} comet, astronomers hoped to determine how comets form based on the differences between the interior and exterior makeup of the comet. Observations of the impact and its aftermath would allow astronomers to attempt to determine the answers to these questions.|$|E
