25|$|Pits {{found within}} the fortifications {{contained}} late Iron Age pottery, the hub of a chariot wheel, an iron carpenter's saw, a latch-lifter for a hut door, querns, <b>whetstones,</b> sling stones, and animal bones. These all indicate a permanent occupation and date from the 1st century BC. Unfortunately it is suspected that the hills inhabitants came to a violent end, due to the many graves containing men, women and children outside of the northwest entrance. It can only be guessed at whether Roman legions put people to the sword, or {{if this was the}} result of intertribal warfare sometime before the Roman conquest.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is known}} for {{gingerbread}} biscuits which were first made in 1740 by William Eggleston. Eggleston, a baker by trade, was a producer of a biscuit called Grantham <b>Whetstones.</b> Whetsones were a rusk like dry biscuit enjoyed locally and also by coach drivers who used to stop in Grantham to change their horses whilst travelling on the Great North road. According to folklore, Egglestone, whilst baking whetsones in his dimly lit kitchen one morning, mistook one ingredient for another, resulting in a ginger-like biscuit {{to emerge from the}} oven. The mistake was a huge success and the biscuit became established as Grantham gingerbread, known as a white gingerbread because it is not made with molasses or black treacle. This provides a delicate ginger flavour, rich in butter, with a domed top that has a crackled surface. The centre is hollow and resembles a honeycomb.|$|E
500|$|The {{exhibits}} {{include the}} metal [...] "Glastonbury Bowl". It {{was made from}} two sections riveted together and repaired several times over its life. The bottom half has been dated as having been constructed in the Iron Age. The upper half was probably added in the 1st century from one sheet of metal, {{which may have been}} previously used for another purpose, and the two halves riveted together. Other artefacts that form the village include a clay tuy√®re from a pair of bellows, <b>whetstones,</b> iron knives and iron currency bars, which could be used as tokens and exchanged for goods. The glazed jar on display is a 1936 copy of one from the village site; however some of the original storage bowls are included in the displays which were re assembled by Arthur Bulleid, who discovered the site in 1892. In the old kitchen {{at the rear of the}} building is a log boat excavated near the village.|$|E

500|$|... 15 of {{the graves}} {{contained}} beads and items of ironwork {{were found in}} 25 graves. A seax (a type of short sword with a blade on one edge) was found in grave 29 and was the only weapon found in the cemetery. The discovery of such weapons as grave goods is extremely rare, as their value meant that they were typically passed on from father to son rather than being buried with a person. It originally measured about [...] long but had broken into four pieces, {{and part of the}} pommel and handle also survived. Its blade had been decorated with a punched pattern along the top edge. Smaller domestic knives were found in 19 graves as well as other items made of iron such as belt buckles and sets of keys. In grave 81, two <b>whetstones</b> for sharpening knives were discovered along with the knives themselves, one resting on top of each whetstone.|$|E
500|$|By about 710, in {{the middle}} of Ine's reign, the trading {{settlement}} of Hamwic had become established on {{the west bank of the}} river Itchen; the site is now part of the modern city of Southampton. [...] The goods traded at this port included glass vessels, and finds of animal bones suggest an active trade in hides. [...] Further evidence of trade comes from finds of imported goods such as quernstones, <b>whetstones,</b> and pottery; and finds of sceattas from the town include Frisian coins. [...] Specialist trades carried on in the town included cloth-making, smithying, and metalworking. [...] It is not known whether Ine took an interest in Hamwic, but some of the goods he favoured, including luxuries, were imported there, and the merchants would probably have needed royal protection. [...] The total population of Hamwic has been estimated at 5,000, and this high population itself implies Ine's involvement, since no-one but the king would have been able to arrange to feed and house such a large group of people.|$|E

6000|$|OBJECTS OF STONE.--Nine spear-heads, like arrow-points, of slate, six [...] {{of which}} have linear {{patterns}} scratched on them. Some are perforated [...] with round holes, and all were made by grinding and polishing. One [...] object of slate, shaped like a knife, was made by chipping. [...] "This [...] knife," [...] says Mr. Millar, [...] "has a feature common to all these slate [...] weapons--they {{seem to have been}} saturated with oil or fat, as water [...] does not adhere to them, but runs off as from a greasy surface." [...] Another highly ornamental piece of cannel coal {{is in the form of}} a [...] short spear-head with a thickish stem. The stem is adorned with a [...] series of hollows and ridges running across it; radiating lines [...] running from the stem to the margin. Another group of these [...] remarkable objects shows markings of the cup-and-ring order, circles, [...] linear incisions, and perforations. Some of these ornamentations are [...] deeply cut on the naturally rough surfaces of flat pieces of [...] sandstone, whilst others are on smooth stones artificially prepared [...] for the purpose. A small piece of flint was supposed to have been [...] inserted into a partially burnt handle. There are several examples of [...] hammer-stones of the ordinary crannog type, rubbing-stones, [...] <b>whetstones,</b> as well as a large number of water-worn stones which might [...] have been used as hand-missiles or sling-stones.

60|$|It was a {{sight to}} see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, {{opposing}} his filed teeth to the Indian's; crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating-- an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the simple-witted Steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their lances and other weapons; and with which <b>whetstones,</b> at dinner, they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretion. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.|$|E
