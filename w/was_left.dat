40|$|Let G be a {{group and}} H be a {{subgroup}} of G. We say that H <b>is</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex in G if the left G-set G/H {{has at least one}} G-invariant order; when G <b>is</b> <b>left</b> orderable, this holds if and only if H is convex in G under some left ordering of G. We give a criterion for H to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex in G that generalizes a famous theorem of Burns and Hale and has essentially the same proof. We show that all maximal cyclic subgroups <b>are</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex in free groups, in right-angled Artin groups, and in surface groups that are not the Klein-bottle group. The free-group case extends a result of Duncan and Howie. We show that if G <b>is</b> <b>left</b> orderable, then each free factor of G <b>is</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex in G. More generally, for any graph of groups, if each edge group <b>is</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex in each of its vertex groups, then each vertex group <b>is</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex in the fundamental group; this generalizes a result of Chiswell. We show that all maximal cyclic subgroups in locally residually torsion-free nilpotent groups <b>are</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex...|$|R

He died suddenly without male issue in 1564/5, which Mary S. Lovell suggests may have been {{as a result of}} poisoning by his younger brother.
