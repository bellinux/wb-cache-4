500|$|Toyah's image {{eventually}} {{began to}} change and she became {{more aware of the}} <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> when she got a boyfriend and started college. Toyah also took extra English lessons from Ken Barlow (William Roache) in a bid to better herself. Taylor later commented that her character got on her nerves due to her naivety. She also thought that Toyah had a romantic view of love, was too trusting and occasionally needed to be [...] "a bit more clued up". The actress added that Toyah was [...] "a very decent person", who was loyal to her friends. Digital Spy's Kris Green described Toyah as [...] "the more mellow of the Battersbys" [...] and thought that was due to Les (Bruce Jones) not being her biological father. The Daily Mirror's Charlie Catchpole commented that Toyah went [...] "from lumpy, sulky schoolgirl to confident, radiant young woman".|$|E
500|$|Winslet {{received}} her preliminary {{education at the}} St Mary and All Saints' Church of England primary school. Living {{in a family of}} actors inspired her to pursue acting from a young age. She and her sisters participated in amateur stage shows at school and at a local youth theatre, named Foundations. At age five, Winslet made her first stage appearance as Mary in her school's production of the Nativity. She has described herself as [...] "quite stocky as a child"; she was nicknamed [...] "blubber" [...] by her schoolmates and was bullied for they <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked.</b> She said of the experience, [...] "I didn't lock myself away and give up on my dream. I fought back." [...] At age 11, Winslet was accepted into the Redroofs Theatre School in Maidenhead. The school also functioned as an agency and took students to London to audition for acting jobs. She appeared in a Sugar Puffs commercial and dubbed for foreign films. At school, she was made head girl and took part in productions of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and played the lead role of Wendy Darling in Peter Pan. She worked simultaneously with the Starmaker Theatre Company in Reading. She participated in over 20 of their stage productions, but has said that she was rarely selected as the lead due to her weight. Nonetheless, she played key roles as Miss Agatha Hannigan in Annie, the Mother Wolf in The Jungle Book, and Lena Marelli in Bugsy Malone.|$|E
2500|$|In 1953 Maksakova {{received}} the notification of her 'retirement'. This came as an unpleasant surprise for the singer {{felt she was}} in superb shape, both physically and artistically. Rumours had it, some people at the Bolshoi decided to settle some old scores this way, now that Stalin, her much-feared patron, was now dead, {{and the name of}} Vera Davydova, another famous Soviet soprano, has been mentioned in this context. Lyudmila Maksakova refused to believe this, remembering the times when Davydova, who lived in a neighbouring dacha, helped her mother in difficult times. Davydova herself remembered her great rival with warmth. [...] "Maria Petrovna paid great attention to the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked.</b> She was beautiful and had excellent figure. Yet she kept herself perfectly fit, with strict diet and regular gymnastics ... Our relations were pure and friendly, each respected and valued what the other was doing on stage," [...] Davydova maintained.|$|E

6000|$|His {{mother was}} washing the breakfast dishes in a dreary, {{listless}} sort of <b>way.</b> <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> tired and broken-spirited. Ted's enthusiasm seemed to grate on her, for she answered sharply: ...|$|E

5000|$|... "She's {{from a very}} {{traditional}} small town where everyone seems to think and act differently from her. ... She's {{been through a lot}} in her life so far, a lot of personal tragedy, and it's certainly done a great deal to shape the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> at the people around her." ...|$|R
60|$|Her pale lips curled {{a little}} bitterly, and suddenly, as a change {{seemed to come}} over her, they set that <b>way.</b> <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> up at Lane with a {{different}} light in her eyes. Then she turned {{her face to the}} wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Drop in again," [...] he said, as he {{took her}} {{trembling}} hand.... When she had walked a little <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> {{back over her shoulder}} to see him leaning idly against the post, gazing after her, and waving his hammer in friendly fashion.|$|E
60|$|I {{said that}} Mr. Storer had {{included}} me. I am sure, from the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at me, {{that she did}} not heed my answer. She appeared to hesitate {{on the verge of a}} speech, and glanced once or twice at the doors.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are rather}} a puzzle," [...] I admitted. [...] "I suppose they {{might very well}} be father and daughter. It is certain that she is fresh from some convent boarding-school.

6000|$|... "Ground? Why {{the ground}} that she is fond of you. Any man with half an eye could see that, by the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> at and speaks to you. Of course you have not {{observed}} that. I trust, my boy, you are too honourable to have encouraged it.

60|$|Philippa shrugged her {{shoulders}} and made a determined move towards the bell.

60|$|He {{went down}} to dinner rather early and found Alice in the hall. There was nobody else about, and by the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up as he {{advanced}} he thought she {{had been waiting for}} him. Alice had beauty, but it was her proud reserve he felt most. She did not give her friendship lightly, but he believed it was worth winning.|$|E
60|$|Nevada plunged like a wind-driven {{storm-petrel}} on her <b>way.</b> <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> up at {{the ragged}} sierras of cloud-capped buildings that rose above the streets, shaded by the night lights and the congealed vapors to gray, drab, ashen, lavender, dun, and cerulean tints. They were so like the wintry mountains of her Western home that she felt a satisfaction such as the hundred-thousand-dollar house had seldom brought her.|$|E
5000|$|This term is {{also used}} in the novel The Color Purple by Alice Walker. There, the main {{character}} Celie describes that patting Harpo feels [...] "like patting another piece of wood.

[...] Later in the book, Celie is not happy about the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks,</b> and in that context she contemplates: [...] "Nothing but churchgoing clothes in my chifferobe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I should stay where I was, and make myself very dear to Seti, taking {{the chance that}} the curse may pass her by, since it was not {{lawfully}} decreed upon her. Whichever <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks,</b> trouble waits, and at the worst, a woman might wish to satisfy her heart before it falls, especially if that heart should happen to turn to one who will be Pharaoh." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he responded, [...] "I guess {{quite a few}} done no {{more than}} make their folks {{on the other side}} tired of them, and that's why they sent them out to you. Some of them get paid so much on {{condition}} that they don't come back again.

6000|$|... "If I had {{a sister}} who persisted in talking in that aggravatingly edifying fashion, I should feel tempted to shake her," [...] he said. [...] "Still, one could forgive {{her a good}} deal if only for the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at the West-coast boat. It {{suggested}} that she has as much humanity in her {{as there is in}} the rest of us, after all." ...|$|E
60|$|Then the {{daughter}} said to Elsa, 'Fear nothing, my mother {{will be your}} friend.

Elsa meanwhile was tossed about between hope and fear, and {{felt as if the}} girl would never come.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{recognize}} that!" [...] said Miss Willoughby, evidently pleased. [...] "You {{see that}} light-colored {{spot in the}} portico? That's Mrs. Chester; she stood there when I was making the drawing. It is nothing but two or three little dabs, {{but that is the}} <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at a distance. Around on this side is the corner of the yard where the bear tried to eat up the tire of your bicycle." ...|$|E

60|$|She gazed despairingly before her, a numb {{feeling at}} her heart, as though hope and {{happiness}} had died. She watched the sun flickering {{down through the}} warm-trunked redwoods.

60|$|He {{managed to}} watch her leaving that afternoon, and he was aware {{for the first time}} that she was well-formed, and that her manner of dress was satisfying. He knew none of the details of women's dress, and he saw none of the details of her neat shirt-waist and well-cut tailor suit. He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy <b>way.</b> <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> right. This was in the absence of {{anything}} wrong or out of the way.|$|E
60|$|I {{know that}} sort of friend. D'you think I didn't see the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at you, and how she {{followed}} you with her eyes? She simply hung on every word you said. When you smiled, she smiled. When you laughed, she laughed. Oh, I should think {{she was in love}} with you; I know what love is, and I felt it. And when she looked at me I know she hated me because I'd robbed her of you.|$|E
