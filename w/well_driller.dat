In the late 1850s Seneca Oil Company (formerly the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company) sent its manager, Colonel Edwin L.

2500|$|Roy Kelton Orbison {{was born}} in Vernon, Texas, the middle son of Orbie Lee Orbison (1913–1984), an oil <b>well</b> <b>driller</b> and car mechanic, and Nadine Vesta Shults (July 25, 1913 – May 28, 1992), a nurse. Both of his parents were {{unemployed}} during the Great Depression and, searching for work, moved the family to Fort Worth, when Roy was a child. He attended Denver Avenue Elementary School until a polio scare prompted the family to return to Vernon. Later, they moved to Wink, Texas. Orbison later described life in Wink as [...] "football, oil fields, oil, grease and sand" [...] and expressed relief {{that he was able}} to leave the desolate town. All the Orbison children were afflicted with poor eyesight; Roy used thick corrective lenses from an early age. He was not confident about his appearance and began dyeing his nearly-white hair black when he was still young. He was quiet, self-effacing, and remarkably polite and obliging—a product, biographer Alan Clayson wrote, of his Southern upbringing. He was readily available to sing, however, and often became the focus of attention when he did. He considered his voice memorable, if not great.|$|E

40|$|Water <b>well</b> <b>drillers</b> {{are exposed}} {{to high levels of}} noise while working. NIOSH {{researchers}} have found that water <b>well</b> <b>drillers</b> {{are exposed to}} levels above 85 dB(A) while performing certain tasks during a typical drilling job. Noise levels consistently over 85 dB(A) during an 8 -hour work shift are hazardous and lead to hearing loss in workers. Finding ways to reduce noise exposure is difficult because of many factors. The work environment is constantly changing because of the location of jobs and environmental factors. Drillers and owners can work together to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, and measures can be taken to reduce exposure to hazardous noise. A water well drilling site is full of potential hazards. Most common among these hazards is electricity, which was the cause of 21 fatalities among water <b>well</b> <b>drillers</b> during 1992 - 2000. Nineteen of these fatalities occurred while workers were drilling and/or servicing a water pump or when the rig contacted overhead power lines. Owners and employees should work together to create jobsite and task-specific electrical safety guidelines. The water well industry has a workforce with many years of experience. Members of the "Baby Boomer" generation have filled drillers' ranks over the past 20 years. As these Boomers start to retire, company owners need to pass on these workers' experiences to inexperienced workers. Today's younger workers learn and think about their jobs differently than their parents or grandparents. To help train younger workers, companies need to know more about these workers and their preferred learning styles. NIOSHTIC no. 2005090...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{parameters}} of aquifers in Cache Valley were compiled from existing but largely unpublished data, from specific capacity data reported in <b>well</b> <b>drillers</b> 2 ̆ 7 records, and from aquifer tests conducted for this study. A GIS database was also created to organize this information. A complete and thorough literature review was performed, which included obtaining unpublished aquifer test data {{from state and}} federal agencies, as well as reviewing Drinking Water Source Protection plans for each municipality in the valley. <b>Well</b> <b>drillers</b> 2 ̆ 7 records {{were obtained from the}} Utah Division of Water Rights website and examined for pertinent information. Screened unit intervals from 1, 314 <b>well</b> <b>drillers</b> 2 ̆ 7 logs were databased and mapped. Transmissivity was estimated from specific capacity values obtained from 378 <b>well</b> <b>drillers</b> 2 ̆ 7 records and keyed into a spatial database. Five pumping tests were also performed. Four of the tests were single-well tests using private domestic wells, and one was a multiple-well test using high-yield municipal wells owned and operated by Logan City. The sites selected for conducting the aquifer tests were the Stevenson well in Weston, Idaho in an unconfined alluvial aquifer; the Tomkinson well south of Newton, Utah in the confined gravels of western Cache Valley; the Henningsen well east of Paradise, Utah in the Salt Lake Formation; the Luthy well east of Cove, Utah in the Salt Lake Formation; and three Logan City, Utah wells in the principal aquifer. Drawdown data collected for each test provide clues regarding the surrounding geology, including the existence of a low permeability barrier and the possible presence of fractured material. The transmissivity and storativity of the principal aquifer, into which the Logan City wells are screened, have been estimated to be 300, 000 square feet per day (ft 2 /day) and 0. 000275, respectively. Drawdown curves from wells penetrating close to the East Cache fault display boundary effects. The GIS database shows that the principal aquifer underlies {{the east side of the}} valley between Smithfield and Hyrum, and has the highest density of wells, most of which are screened into confined unconsolidated gravels. The transmissivity is highest in the principal aquifer and decreases to the west, north and south of it...|$|R

Drillers and owners can work together to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, and measures can be taken to reduce exposure to hazardous noise. [] Preventing hearing loss occurs through three stages. The first stage is removing noise from the source (i. e., drill rig). Various parts of a drill rig create noise besides the drilling rod. NIOSH researchers have examined noise levels of drill rigs. Some of the loudest parts of the drill rig include the compressor, engine, and cooling fan (Fig. 1). While removing the noise source from a worksite is ideal, the process would be expensive and difficult. [...|$|R
