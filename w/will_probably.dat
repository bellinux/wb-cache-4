5|$|As of 2008, {{only five}} {{objects in the}} Solar System (Ceres, Eris, and the KBOs Pluto, Makemake and Haumea) are listed as dwarf planets by the IAU. 90482 Orcus, 28978 Ixion and many other Kuiper-belt objects are {{large enough to be}} in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium; most of them <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> qualify when more is known about them.|$|E
5|$|Extremists <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> deplore {{the fact}} that the {{composer}} is still a respecter of form, still a devotee of beauty, still a believer in the potency of melody; but this is rather a matter for congratulation than regret... Mr. Sibelius is a fine musical constructionist, an eloquent harmonist and a fine colorist despite his fondness for dark tints.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{official}} guidelines {{yet on the}} use of disease-modifying oral treatments due to their recent development. While some believe that they <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> reduce the usage of first-line treatments the long-term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> slow this trend. It has been recommended that at the moment oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not use existing treatments due to needle phobia or other reasons such as perceived inefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate. They could also be used in patients taking natalizumab who have developed JC virus antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of PML. Dimethyl fumarate is potentially {{one of the most interesting}} oral drugs due to the long term data from use in psoriasis which points towards a very good safety profile.|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll {{give one}} to Griffenbottom, certainly," [...] said Mr. Trigger. [...] "Westmacott <b>'ll</b> <b>probably</b> have the other. I thought perhaps your title {{might have gone}} down with him, but it didn't seem to take." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You 'll {{find her}} easy enough; she <b>'ll</b> <b>probably</b> be {{standing}} round looking for us. I dare say she 'll know you, though I 'm not there, because I 've described you to her." ...|$|R
25|$|William John Wills, the {{official}} {{date of death}} adopted by the Exploration Committee was Wednesday, 28 June 1861, but <b>Wills</b> <b>probably</b> died around Friday, 30 June or Saturday, 1 July 1861 at Breerily Waterhole, Cooper Creek.|$|R
5|$|A 2016 {{study by}} Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) found that {{availability}} of lithium and other finite {{materials used in}} the battery packs {{will not be a}} limiting factor for the adoption of electric vehicles. BNEF estimated that battery packs will require less than 1% of the known reserves of lithium, nickel, manganese, and copper through 2030, and 4% of the world’s cobalt. After 2030, the study states that new battery chemistries <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> shift to other source materials, making packs lighter, smaller, and cheaper.|$|E
5|$|Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) call Angela's husband Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) {{to inform}} {{him that the}} {{documentary}} <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> out him and reveal that Angela slept with Dwight. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) becomes obsessed with online comments regarding his brief appearance in the promo, posting lengthy replies and even uploading his own video in response to negative reactions. The documentary crew discovers that Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) has left {{at least some of}} the negative comments, taking pleasure in Andy's annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Downcutting and canyon {{widening}} continue {{today as}} the process of erosion continues to try to reduce the topography to sea level. In 1998 a flash flood temporarily increased the Virgin River's flow rate from 200 to 4,500ft³/s (6 to 125m³/s). Geologists estimate that the Virgin River can cut another thousand feet (300m) before it loses the ability to transport sediment to the Colorado River to the south. However, additional uplift <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> increase this figure.|$|E
50|$|Currently Diamondog {{is working}} on his first solo album, with no {{predicted}} release date, which <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> call Never Muzzled and <b>will</b> be <b>probably</b> in English.|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} above, tasks 1 to 4 {{are designed}} {{according to the}} degree of brain excitation with/without the existence of motion. It is expected that the spectrum of μ rhythm will decline and the spectrum of β rhythm <b>will</b> change, <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> increase, task by task.|$|R
60|$|THE STATUE. And never <b>will</b> be, <b>probably.</b> Let us proceed: the red fire {{will make}} me sneeze. [They descend].|$|R
5|$|General Tilney {{returns home}} from a trip away and orders Eleanor to send Catherine home to Fullerton that night. Catherine endures the trip alone and {{believes}} that Henry told the General about her suspicions. A few days later, Henry comes to Fullerton and explains that the General discovered that Catherine's family were not as rich as John led him to believe. He apologises for his father's actions and explains that even though he <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> be disinherited, he loves Catherine and proposes. Catherine accepts and the couple marry.|$|E
5|$|It is {{very obvious}} to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E
5|$|Mutations are {{changes in}} the DNA {{sequence}} of a cell's genome. When mutations occur, they may alter {{the product of a}} gene, or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect. Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, {{it has been suggested that}} if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.|$|E
3000|$|If the new {{signal is}} more powerful, then the GLRT (with the old signal estimate) <b>will</b> most <b>probably</b> decide on [...]...|$|R

50|$|The National Authority in Communications (ANCOM), <b>will</b> most <b>probably</b> award the {{transmission}} network contract {{for this to}} the national transmission company Radiocommunicatii.|$|R
5|$|Promotion: A {{communication}} with the market should put stress on environmental aspects, for example that the company possesses a CP certificate or is ISO 14000 certified. This may be publicized to improve a firm’s image. Furthermore, {{the fact that a}} company spends expenditures on environmental protection should be advertised. Third, sponsoring the natural environment is also very important. And last but not least, ecological products <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> require special sales promotions.|$|E
5|$|Scientists <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> {{never be}} certain {{of the largest and}} {{smallest}} dinosaurs to have ever existed. This is because only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last {{for at least five}} million years. It could result in a decline in biodiversity and homogenization of biotas, accompanied by a proliferation of species that are opportunistic, such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular taxa that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. Microbes are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large vertebrates are likely to arise and food chains <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> be shortened.|$|E
50|$|Tapiola {{will have}} its own metro station, the Tapiola metro station, when the Länsimetro project is {{completed}}. The project <b>will</b> be <b>probably</b> completed in 2017.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{sleeping}} still," [...] he said presently, [...] "perhaps without pain, like Yoletta here, and her sleep <b>will</b> now <b>probably</b> last for some hours." ...|$|R
50|$|However, due to {{the robust}} nature of carrier-grade equipment, and the {{widespread}} use of AT&T/Lucent/Avaya PBX systems, Oryx/Pecos <b>will</b> most <b>probably</b> continue to be supported indefinitely.|$|R
5|$|The story flashes back to March 1983 where Homer, Marge and Bart {{originally}} {{lived in}} an apartment {{on the lower east}} side of Springfield. Homer and Marge had to cope with Bart, who was two years old at the time. Marge reveals to her husband and their son that she is pregnant again, and points out to Homer that they <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> need a bigger place. After viewing several unsuitable properties, they buy a house on Evergreen Terrace with a $15,000 down payment from the sale of Grampa's house.|$|E
5|$|This little work, if Mary {{had never}} {{produced}} any thing else, would serve, with persons of true taste and sensibility, {{to establish the}} eminence of her genius. The story is nothing. He that looks into the book only for incident, <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> lay it down with disgust. But the feelings are of the truest and most exquisite class; every circumstance is adorned with that species of imagination, which enlists itself under the banners of delicacy and sentiment.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{computer}} models, {{the presence of}} the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes. This stability is achieved because the Moon increases the precession rate of the Earth's spin axis (that is, the precession motion of the ecliptic), thereby avoiding resonances between the precession of the spin and precession of the planet's orbital plane relative to that of Jupiter. However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> cause chaotic variations in the obliquity of the Earth, and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° from the plane of the orbit. This is expected to occur between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{segments}} of the line (colloquially called [...] "metro to Troieshchyna") are planned to be finished by 2025, while further construction <b>will</b> most <b>probably</b> end after 2030.|$|R

5|$|Dementia, and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's disease, may {{be among the}} most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their costs in other countries such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising. These costs <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100billion each year.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have {{control over their own}} health and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Leaving the building, Jeff finds all {{the pages}} in the {{envelope}} to be blank. He returns {{to the office of}} Dr. Duncan who tells him that he wanted to teach him a lesson although Jeff gets his car keys back. As he is about to leave campus, Jeff runs into Pierce and Troy, and shows his ability to make people feel better about themselves through advice and encouragement. The others join, and Jeff admits to being a fraud. He says that he does not have the test answers, and that he <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> flunk next day's test. The group has now taken a liking to him, and they invite him back in. The episode ends with a dedication to the recently deceased John Hughes, whose film The Breakfast Club had been repeatedly referenced throughout the episode.|$|E

50|$|If the {{increase}} overall pressure ratio is obtained aerodynamically (i.e. without adding stage/s), {{an increase in}} shaft speed <b>will</b> still <b>probably</b> be required, which affects blade/disc stresses and component lives/material.|$|R
30|$|To {{validate}} these performances, {{the best}} way is to illustrate some of them through a particular example, in this case quite complex, a situation which <b>will</b> be <b>probably</b> never encountered in reality.|$|R
