500|$|Most of {{the album}} was {{recorded}} at Brian's home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. Since the recording of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: [...] "He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'" [...] When asked if Brian was [...] "still the producer of Smiley Smile," [...] Carl answered, [...] "Most definitely." [...] Brian acknowledged: [...] "We had done about six months work on another thing, but <b>we</b> <b>jumped</b> and ended up doing the entire thing here at the house with an entirely different mood and approach than what we originally started out with." [...] When questioned on why the band took the approach they did, he stated, [...] "We just had a particular atmosphere that we were working in that inspired the particular {{kind of things that}} were on the album." [...] Author Domenic Priore notes that when the Beach Boys were taken out of professional studios, [...] "the discipline of the clock, rates and overtime disappeared".|$|E

[...] "The thing that precipitated people really {{starting}} to freak out and break the glass and open the door was {{there was a loud}} 'bam,' explosion-type thing," [...] said Fred Buonocore, who was in the fourth car. [...] "And once <b>we</b> <b>jumped</b> off the side, there was another explosion to a lesser degree." [...] At the very rear, passengers said they felt only a small jolt. [...] "It felt not even like a short stop, and then the train just completely stopped," [...] said Neil Rader, who was sitting in the middle-back of the train.|$|E

Here’s the answers for you." [...] Sgt. Chad Bianco of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department in California said, [...] "We were approached by Perverted-Justice to do this large sting and {{they told us that}} 'Dateline' would be following along. <b>We</b> <b>jumped</b> at the chance."

But the policemen pulled us off and threw us back in the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us. We were {{screaming}} in the back of that car. When we got to Broome they put me and my cousin in the Broome lock-up. We were only ten years old. We were in the lock-up for two days waiting for the boat to Perth.|$|E
2500|$|Barry Corbin portrays Brian [...] "Whitey" [...] Durham, the Ravens' {{coach for}} over 35 years, who retires in season 4. Schwahn said, [...] "Whitey was often good counsel to Lucas and his world, but when <b>we</b> <b>jumped</b> the show ahead, {{it was time}} for Lucas and his world to find their own way." [...] Over the course of the series, the show {{emphasizes}} how Whitey and Dan never saw eye-to-eye and often bickered over differences of opinion when Dan was one of Whitey's players. Whitey often laments the death of his wife Camilla {{and the fact that he}} did not spend more time with her while she was alive. The show also delves into Whitey's long history with the Ravens and basketball. He shares the story of how he got the name Whitey to teach the players about how basketball helped him to understand integration. He retires after the Ravens win the much-coveted North Carolina state championship title for him, but later takes a coaching position in a college near Tree Hill, giving Nathan the chance to play college basketball.|$|E

I used {{to get up in the}} morning and the other side of the street always had a layer of fine dust with footmarks on it from the early morning workers." [...] Of the conditions in the nearby school one said: [...] "The dust was always there while I was at school, lying on walls or window ledges if it had been damp. It was like snow fall." [...] Describing the loading bay, to which local children had easy access, one witness recalled: [...] "Sometimes sacks were left out overnight. They were hessian sacks and they were full of a sort of fluffy dust. We could jump on the sacks when they were left out... I remember seeing grey-blue coloured dust come out of them. If <b>we</b> <b>jumped</b> hard enough the sacks burst open. After sitting or bouncing on the sacks I remember being covered in dust." [...] During the summer doors and windows of both the factory and the houses were left open for cooling, and during the winter children often congregated around the factory's street-level ventilation outlets for warmth.|$|E

[...] I was nearly out of breath. I started to rise out of the water, and when I came out I was born by my mother. When I was born I could know and see and understand for a time, but afterwards went back to it as a baby. [...] Then I grew up naturally. [...] At the age of seven I began to learn, and when twelve began to fight enemies. That was the reason I always refused to wear any war-dress. [...] Only a bit of grass in the hair. [...] That was why I always was successful in battles. The first fight was with the Shoshones. The Shoshones were chasing the Sioux. [...] I, with my younger brother riding double. [...] Two of the Shoshones came for us. [...] We started to meet them. [...] I killed one of them and took his horse.

5000|$|The {{episode is}} written by Donald P. Bellisario & Don McGill and {{directed}} by Donald P. Bellisario. According to the DVD commentary, the episode was written as an homage to the 1997 film Air Force One. According to Bellisario, the NCIS pilot episode was easy to sell to CBS because of its low costs compared to the JAG pilot. Together with Billy Webb (Editor of Photography), Bellisario wanted to give NCIS a different look than other shows, starting with the first episode of the series.
