25|$|The paste is kept covered {{after it}} has been used, in its {{original}} container (be it plastic or ceramic). It is kept in an environment away from direct sunlight and away from intense heat to prevent it from drying out. The paste for silk based pastes need to be stirred <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula</b> every month or so to avoid the oil sinking down and drying out the paste as well as to prepare it for use. A good paste would produce a clear impression in one go; if the impression is not clear requiring further impressions then it indicates that the paste is either too dry or the cinnabar has been depleted.|$|E
2500|$|First the wok {{is heated}} {{to a high}} temperature, and just as or before it smokes, {{a small amount of}} cooking oil is added {{down the side of the}} wok (a {{traditional}} expression is [...] "hot wok, cold oil"), followed by dry seasonings such as ginger, garlic, scallions, or shallots. The seasonings are tossed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula</b> until they are fragrant, then other ingredients are added, beginning with the ones taking the longest to cook, such as meat or tofu. When the meat and vegetables are nearly cooked, combinations of soy sauce, vinegar, wine, salt, or sugar may be added, along with thickeners such as cornstarch, water chestnut flour, or arrowroot.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{liquid limit}} test of Atterberg's involved mixing a pat of clay in a round-bottomed porcelain bowl of 10–12cm diameter. A groove was {{cut through the}} pat of clay <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula,</b> and the bowl was then struck many times against the palm of one hand. Casagrande subsequently standardized the apparatus and the procedures to make the measurement more repeatable. Soil is placed into the metal cup portion of the device and a groove is made down its center with a standardized tool of [...] width. The cup is repeatedly dropped 10mm onto a hard rubber base {{at a rate of}} 120 blows per minute, during which the groove closes up gradually {{as a result of the}} impact. The number of blows for the groove to close is recorded. The moisture content at which it takes 25 drops of the cup to cause the groove to close over a distance of [...] is defined as the liquid limit. The test is normally run at several moisture contents, and the moisture content which requires 25 blows to close the groove is interpolated from the test results. The Liquid Limit test is defined by ASTM standard test method D4318. [...] The test method also allows running the test at one moisture content where 20 to 30 blows are required to close the groove; then a correction factor is applied to obtain the liquid limit from the moisture content.|$|E

50|$|When {{the plaster}} has been sprayed {{on the wall}} or ceiling, it is laid off <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wide <b>spatula,</b> {{typically}} 40 cm wide. This can be mounted on a pole for finishing the ceiling.|$|R
5000|$|The manual {{production}} {{method is to}} crystallise (granulate) massecuite by cooling it in pans and continuously shearing it by stirring <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large <b>spatula</b> (typically used in India) or by pressing it with the feet (typically used in Africa).|$|R
60|$|The Blue Light scorns the labour-saving arts {{of modern}} pharmacy. It macerates its opium and percolates its own {{laudanum}} and paregoric. To this day pills are made behind its tall prescription desk--pills rolled out {{on its own}} pill-tile, divided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula,</b> rolled with the finger and thumb, dusted with calcined magnesia and delivered in little round pasteboard pill-boxes. The store is on a corner about which coveys of ragged-plumed, hilarious children play and become candidates for the cough drops and soothing syrups that wait for them inside.|$|E

50|$|One {{method of}} {{removing}} particularly tough incrustations {{off of a}} sculpture is by mechanical cleaning done by an individual. Such methods could include heating or potentially applying a solvent to a specific location to weaken the incrustation, followed by removal <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scalpel, <b>spatula,</b> or other such device.|$|R
5000|$|Scraping or swiping. In a Pap test, {{cells are}} scraped off <b>a</b> uterine cervix <b>with</b> <b>a</b> special <b>spatula</b> and brush or a special broom device that is {{inserted}} through a vagina {{without having to}} puncture any tissue. Epithelial cells for DNA testing {{can be obtained by}} swiping the inside of a cheek in <b>a</b> mouth <b>with</b> <b>a</b> swab.|$|R

5000|$|A scraper is {{a kitchen}} {{implement}} made of metal, plastics (such as polyethylene, nylon, or polypropylene), wood, rubber or silicone rubber. In practice, {{one type of}} scraper is often interchanged with another or <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula</b> (thus scrapers are often called spatulas) {{for some of the}} various uses.|$|E
30|$|The mycelia of the {{selected}} strains were harvested from each plate by scratching {{the surface of the}} membranes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sterilized <b>spatula</b> and placing them in 1.5 -ml tubes. The mycelia were frozen at − 80 °C for more than 30  min and lyophilized. The freeze-dried mycelia were then ground to a fine powder using a sterile pipette tip.|$|R
50|$|In the {{imperial}} period, the Romans adopted the original Greek term, spáthē (σπάθη), as spatha, which still carried the general meaning of any object considered long and flat. Spatha appears first in Pliny and then Seneca <b>with</b> different meanings: <b>a</b> <b>spatula,</b> <b>a</b> metal-working implement, a palm-leaf and so on. There is {{no hint of}} any native Roman sword called a spatha.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{the batter}} should be cooked in a {{specific}} device called billig in Breton, galetiere in the local French dialect (galettoire or tuile in Upper Brittany). The batter is spread out onto <b>a</b> disc <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small <b>spatula</b> called <b>a</b> rozell (Breton), rouable or raclette in the local French dialect. Crêpes based on the Breton recipes are usually made <b>with</b> <b>a</b> simple crêpière (or frying pan).|$|R
50|$|René Francisco's {{studio is}} filled with {{extremely}} interesting paintings. Paint has been layered on canvas <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula,</b> using a painstaking, pointillist technique. Most of the paintings have sociological and political themes. One of them shows masses of indistinguishable faces in black-and-white. Another shows seamstresses sewing flags in a mass of red, blue and white.|$|E
50|$|The {{first story}} {{is one in}} which a many shoots himself in the head, but misses his brain completely, blowing part of his skull off and exposing his brain. He went to the doctor, who in turn pressed the man's brain <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula</b> to get a {{reaction}} out of him, which he did.|$|E
50|$|Hot sand frying is {{a common}} cooking {{technique}} for street-side food vendors in China and India to cook chestnuts and peanuts. A large wok is filled with black sand and heated to high temperature. Nuts are buried in the hot sand and occasionally turned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula,</b> then the sand and nuts are separated through a wire-mesh screen.|$|E

30|$|A {{bacterial}} suspension was mixed 1 : 1 <b>with</b> either <b>a</b> free-gentamicin solution or a gentamicin–NP mixture and was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. For each treatment, six 10 -fold serial dilutions were made. A 200 -μL {{volume of the}} resultant suspension was uniformly spread onto overnight-dried solid LB medium <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sterile <b>spatula.</b> After cultivation at 37 °C for 24 h, all the colonies grown were enumerated, and the mean values and maximal scatter in CFUs were determined.|$|R
25|$|The {{health care}} worker begins by {{inserting}} a speculum into the woman's vagina, which spreads the vagina open and allows {{access to the}} cervix. The health care provider then collects a sample of cells from the outer opening or os of the cervix by scraping it <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Aylesbury <b>spatula.</b> An endocervical brush is rotated in the central opening of the cervix. The cells are placed on a glass slide and taken to the laboratory to be checked for abnormalities.|$|R
50|$|At {{some point}} {{irregularities}} {{began to be}} made intentionally. Clay typically has a low-iron content and is formed into a shape gradually by hand on a wheel. Once curves are added using fingers, the surface is carved dynamically <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula.</b> Pieces may be taken out by boldly scraping away at the vessel's surface, and can create powerful visual effects.|$|E
50|$|To {{take the}} sample of cells, the health care {{clinician}} inserts an instrument, called a speculum, inside the vagina. The speculum has two arms that spread {{the walls of the}} vagina apart in order to see the cervix. Then, they scrape the surface of the cervix <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula</b> or small brush. This collects a sample of cells from the outer layer of the cervix.|$|E
50|$|It {{is common}} to apply an {{antiseptic}} cleaner and powder to the area prior to waxing. Wax is applied <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula</b> {{in the direction of}} hair growth the size of a strip about 2 in wide and 4 in long. When the wax is set but still pliable, the wax strips are pulled away against the direction of hair growth while keeping the skin taut. The strip is ideally pulled off as swiftly as possible.|$|E
50|$|Riopelle's {{style in}} the 1940s changed quickly from Surrealism to Lyrical Abstraction (related to {{abstract}} expressionism), in which he used myriad tumultuous cubes and triangles of multicolored elements, facetted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> palette knife, <b>spatula,</b> or trowel, on often large canvases to create powerful atmospheres.|$|R
50|$|Illustrative of {{the highly}} {{sensitive}} nature of some organic nitrates is Si(CH2ONO2)4. A single crystal of this compound detonates even upon contact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> teflon <b>spatula</b> and in fact made full characterization impossible. Another contributor to its exothermic decomposition (inferred from much safer in silico experimentation) {{is the ability of}} silicon in its crystal phase to coordinate to two oxygen nitrito groups in addition to regular coordination to the four carbon atoms. This additional coordination would make formation of silicon dioxide (one of the decomposition products) more facile.|$|R
5000|$|Crêpes {{are made}} by pouring a wheat batter onto a frying pan or flat {{circular}} hot plate, often <b>with</b> <b>a</b> trace of butter or vegetable oil on the pan's surface. The batter is spread evenly over the cooking surface of the pan or plate either by [...] the pan or by distributing the batter <b>with</b> <b>an</b> offset <b>spatula</b> or trowel. Cooking may take 30 to 60 seconds until the cooked side looks like {{the surface of the}} moon, then it is turned over to cook the other side; one can flip it in the air by swinging the pan.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect is}} {{produced}} by drizzling melted chocolate into plain milk ice cream {{towards the end of}} the churning process; chocolate solidifies immediately coming in contact with the cold ice cream, and is then broken up and incorporated into the ice cream <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula.</b> This process creates the shreds of chocolate that give stracciatella its name. While traditionally flavoured with milk ice cream and milk chocolate, modern variations can also be made with vanilla and dark chocolate.|$|E
50|$|Venetian plaster is a {{wall and}} ceiling finish {{consisting}} of plaster mixed with marble dust, applied <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula</b> or trowel in thin, multiple layers, which are then burnished to create a smooth surface with the illusion of depth and texture. Venetian plaster techniques include marmorino, scagliola, and sgraffito. When left un-burnished, Venetian plaster has a matte finish that is rough and stone-like to the touch. Un-burnished Venetian plaster is also very brittle and damages rather easily.|$|E
50|$|Nabo Gass paints {{with glass}} - he mixes glue with glass powder into a paste, applies it thickly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>spatula</b> or brush, {{creating}} structures with relief, enabling a multilevel construction. In the burning process the colors melt {{with the support}} glass but not into one another, so that their composition, color nuances, shading and contrasts are preserved {{as well as individual}} brush strokes and spatula distributions.Placing his colorful motifs {{in the middle of the}} picture on different levels of the sandblasted support glass is characteristic.|$|E
50|$|Ayre <b>spatula</b> is <b>a</b> device used {{to collect}} Pap smear. It is <b>a</b> wooden <b>spatula</b> <b>with</b> U shaped {{openings}} {{on one side and}} a flat surface on another. The broad end is for vaginal sample collection and the narrow end is for cervical sample collection. It is rotated 360 degrees in the vagina to obtain the cells to be sent for Pap smear examination. Recent studies have shown that long-tipped spatulas (Aylesbury device) or <b>a</b> cytobrush along <b>with</b> <b>an</b> extended-tip <b>spatula</b> are better than Ayre spatula in collecting endocervical cells. However, Ayre spatula continues to be used for cervical sample collection in less-income countries. Ayre spatula is introduced into the cervix after visualizing the os using a speculum. The cytology specimens are obtained by rotating the spatula firmly over the ectocervix and quickly transferring the cells to a slide or jar.|$|R
50|$|It {{has several}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages compared to other glues. The glue is applied hot, typically <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brush or <b>spatula.</b> Glue is kept hot in a glue pot, which may be an electric unit built for the purpose, a double boiler, or simply a saucepan or crock pot to provide a warm water bath for the container of glue.|$|R
30|$|These {{pelleted}} {{cells were}} washed with 100  µl AddH 2 O at same conditions as above and again re-suspended for further experimentation. This cleaning {{was enough for}} the treatments with essential oils only; but an additional step was required to clean the cells after treatment with essential oils as the oil became adhered to the walls of micro tubes during discarding the oil containing supernatant. Therefore, before preceding ahead the walls of micro tubes were cleaned manually <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small <b>spatula</b> having pointed tip and wrapped with autoclaved thin paper of blotting capability to maintain {{the quality of the}} experiment. The concentration of the cell suspension was maintained using Neubauer Improved MARIENFELD Heamocyto meter which was attached to OLYMPUS CKX 41 microscope.|$|R
