500|$|Richmond {{fell ill}} {{the day after}} the 1986 NASCAR annual banquet during a promotional trip to New York City. He was not well enough to begin the 1987 NASCAR season despite lengthy {{hospitalization}} in Cleveland and further rest at home; when Richmond missed the Daytona 500, his condition was reported as double pneumonia. Media later reported that he had tested positive for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). He returned to Pocono for the Miller High Life 500 {{during the middle of the}} year. Starting third, he led by the fifth lap and ultimately led 82 laps, including the final 46, to win the race by eight car-lengths over Bill Elliott. In the middle of the race, Richmond's car suffered gearbox problems. Because he could use only fourth (high) gear, he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits. Richmond was emotional after the victory, saying, [...] "I had tears in my eyes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> checkered flag. Then every time anyone congratulated me, I started bawling again." [...] Richmond earned a victory in the next race at Riverside, and made his final 1987 start at Michigan International Speedway's Champion Spark Plug 400 that August, finishing 29th with a blown engine. He resigned from Hendrick Motorsports in September 1987.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 November 2010, it was {{announced}} that she was to be ennobled to sit in the House of Lords as a Conservative Party peer. [...] "I was completely taken by surprise <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> call from the Prime Minister in September," [...] Heyhoe Flint said. [...] "Obviously I am really thrilled at my appointment but still very humbled at the thought of joining such a historic institution ... My background in sport, journalism, charity and community work will I hope stand me in good stead, and I hope I can make a positive contribution as a working peer. I will certainly look forward to the commute from one Lord's to another Lords." [...] She was subsequently invested as a life peer on 21 January 2011 taking the title Baroness Heyhoe Flint, of Wolverhampton in the County of West Midlands. The formal designation of her title without a hyphen broke a rule that peerage titles could only have one word, previously observed by the likes of Lord Lloyd-George, Lord Alanbrooke and Lord Lloyd-Webber.|$|E

Lina, you will haunt me." ...|$|R
5000|$|The way etching is both {{critical}} and kind, I came to love. It has a digging, critical, biting quality. Yet {{it can also}} make for effects of the gentlest lights and shadows. Etching is at once gentle and sharp [...] - [...] and I wanted to put these opposites together in myself. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> etching needle in my hand the shifting becomes fixed, the in-between definite, the dim clear, the hidden seen, the teasing full-throated.

40|$|No judge, and {{certainly}} no Black judge, can help but be distressed and depressed on sentencing day. I conduct sentencing on Monday afternoon. These are afternoons spent sitting in a courtroom filled with mostly young Black males, waiting to be sentenced. Unfortunately, Monday afternoons are the one time during <b>the</b> week <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> bench in my courtroom and look out not upon the customary sea of white faces, but instead upon {{a room full of}} many faces not unlike my own...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is. If I {{knew how}} much to mark off for leeway in that last breeze I'd feel a good deal easier," [...] said Jimmy, who turned to fling a disgusted glance at the chart, upon which little arrows, that {{indicated}} the general drifts of the currents, had apparently been scattered promiscuously. Then he raised his voice. [...] "Forward there! See {{you have a good}} arming on your lead, and stand by to let go <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> way off her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I should guess I have," [...] {{returned}} the pilot. [...] "I'm Captain Dobbs, <b>I</b> am; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> charge, <b>the</b> captain of that ship can go below and shave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lor, {{but little}} Jarge {{was a rare}} un!" [...] he continued. [...] "Eh, by Jimini, there was no chousing Jarge. He's got a bull pup o' mine that I gave him <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> bounty. You've heard him speak of it, likely?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, I daresay the wrongness {{has been}} on my part,” {{admitted}} Laura dispassionately; “he has merely been the extenuating circumstance. He made a thin, peevish kind of fuss, for instance, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> collie puppies from the farm out for a run the other day.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so, sir," [...] Wyndham agreed. [...] "Well, I know I'm asking {{much and}} I'm handicapped. I'm poor; <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> family {{business}} I took {{a load of}} debt and some distrust. We're not a conventional lot; we have long been reckless and adventurous." ...|$|E

6000|$|Breckenridge smiled feebly. [...] "The fact is, I {{have never}} {{travelled}} on a locomotive before, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> on <b>the</b> contract <b>I</b> didn't quite know all I was letting myself in for," [...] he said.|$|R
50|$|After {{more than}} 100 years, I brought Racoviţă back in Antarctic regions. The {{greatest}} achievement {{of my career}} was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> from <b>the</b> base from the Australians. I got so emotional, that I couldn’t even sign.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nicholas," [...] he said, [...] "don't let me lose a good friend--you to whom I owe my kingdom. Remember that I {{am a man}} {{as well as a}} King.

6000|$|... "Oh, don't {{think of}} that!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "Pitch into Enderton {{as much as}} you please, and you may be sure that I shall not object. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> {{daughter}} to wife, I did not marry the father. But, of course, for my wife's sake I hope this matter will not be made the subject of public comment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{country is}} the country of my adoption," [...] said Westerman. [...] "I {{ceased to be a}} German <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> up <b>the</b> arms of France; but my {{soldiers}} are my children, and an insult to them is an injury to myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{but nothing}} can prevent me from doing a thing <b>when</b> once <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> bit in my teeth," [...] said the father, with the {{pleasure}} which men of weak will sometimes take in recognising their weakness. [...] "How does their new house get on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That, general, is a {{point that}} I would rather not say {{anything}} about.

6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of a little quarrel we once had. He found out that I had been an actress; for I basely did not mention that fact <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> place, and so got properly punished for my deceit. I thought he'd tell his sister of course, so I did it myself, and retired from the situation as much disgusted with Christie Devon as you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is none for me, madam," [...] he said, with {{a curious}} writhed smile. [...] "Did you {{not know that}} {{they thought they were}} rid of me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> disease at seven years old, and lay in the loft over the {{hen-house}} with Molly Owens to tend me? and I believe it was thought to be fairy work that I came out of it no more unsightly than before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that I could see, sir. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> deck {{again at}} eight, I asked that serang {{whether there was}} {{anything}} about; and I understood him to say {{there was no more}} as when I went below at six.

50|$|On {{his return}} to England <b>when</b> Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> throne, he became {{involved}} in the vestments controversy, and remained a dissident and polemicist.
