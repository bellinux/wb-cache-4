Writing samples were collected over a twoyear period from a small class sample. Children were given opportunities to discuss their stories with partners or the teacher. It was hypothesized that students, {{given an opportunity to}} orally talk about their writing, would be able to <b>write</b> a paragraph <b>with</b> more clarity, focus, and detail. Oral language was combined <b>with</b> <b>written</b> language for <b>writing</b> <b>with</b> visual aids, <b>writing</b> <b>with</b> a kinesthetic experience, <b>writing</b> <b>with</b> graphic organizers, <b>writing</b> <b>with</b> opinion, and journal writing without using oral language. The results indicate children's learning style and motivation had more influence over written language than anyone strategy...|$|R

5|$|Despite Spielberg's rejection, {{the studio}} {{went ahead with}} plans to make the sequel, leading to an arduous 18-month {{pre-production}} process.
