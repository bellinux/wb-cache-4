5|$|Glee club {{director}} Will Schuester {{is informed}} that the school budget will not cover a handicap-accessible bus to transport the glee club to sectionals, which means that Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) will have to travel separately {{from the rest of}} the club. Will encourages the other club members to support Artie, not only by holding a bake sale to raise funds for a handicap bus, but also by spending time in wheelchairs to experience <b>what</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for him. Meanwhile, Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) is struggling to cover the medical expenses of her pregnancy, and threatens to break up with Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) if he cannot pay her ultrasound bill. Puck (Mark Salling) fights with Finn, whom he feels is not doing enough to support Quinn. By including cannabis in the cupcakes, Puck ensures the bake sale is a success and offers Quinn the money raised. She apologizes for previously calling him a loser, but refuses to accept the money, and is relieved when Finn is able to find a job.|$|E

500|$|Madlax is {{set against}} the {{backdrop}} of Gazth-Sonikan war and the first episodes contrast the tranquil Nafrece with the war-torn Gazth-Sonika; later, the story moves completely to the combat zone, focusing on the central characters, such as Limelda Jorg, and their suffering. In an interview, the director Mashimo stated that [...] "he story is about portraying inner struggles of people, while showing <b>what</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> in this place of madness and this other place of peace". Accordingly, the series' title is a portmanteau of two English words, [...] "" [...] and [...] "", mirroring the authors' intention to portray the two extremes of human being.|$|E

500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Minnesota's Department for Families and Children's Services shows that men consider child care {{to be far more}} important than a paycheck. Of 600 dads surveyed, a majority said their most important role was to [...] "show love and affection" [...] to kids. [...] "Safety and protection" [...] came next, followed by [...] "moral guidance," [...] "taking time to play," [...] and [...] "teaching and encouraging." [...] "Financial care" [...] finished last. [...] Many men are now becoming more involved in their children's lives, and because of that many men now {{have a better understanding of}} <b>what</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for their child growing up in modern society. [...] Because fathers are immersed in their children's lives, many of the stereotypically [...] "manly" [...] attitudes and activities historically prescribed for children may be circumscribed due to a more gender-neutral parenting approach that focuses on promoting independence and emotional well being. This allows children, especially male children, to grow up with a greater capacity for empathy and less rigidity in attitudes pertaining to gender roles than would perhaps be the case in more traditionally-structured households.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for The Boys from Baghdad High were {{generally}} favourable. The Huffington Post said that giving the video cameras {{to the students}} was an excellent idea because the depiction of their school-life versus the increasing danger was captured [...] "with neutral equality [...] that the film is able to capture the interiority of its subjects more acutely than a straight-forward examination of violence would". Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent said, [...] "its storyline was governed not by a tick-list of stock narrative dilemmas and secrets but the cruel uncertainties that occupation and insurgency have brought to Baghdad." [...] Time Out New York gave the film five out of five stars, and PopMatters rated it 8 out of 10. The Washington Posts Paul Farhi said, [...] "HBO has carved a niche as the TV home {{of some of the}} most compelling programs about the Iraq war ... Baghdad High does no harm to HBO's burgeoning war cred." [...] Variety, The Christian Science Monitor, LA Weekly, and the Los Angeles Times also praised the film. At the Question-and-Answer session following a screening at the Tribeca Film Festival, one audience member, a new recruit to the United States Marine Corps, told Ali, who had also attended, [...] "I finally know <b>what</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> behind those walls and what you guys are like, and it's been really, really fantastic." ...|$|E
