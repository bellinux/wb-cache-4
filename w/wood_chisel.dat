25|$|The bird is shiny blue-black {{with white}} {{markings}} on its neck {{and back and}} extensive white on {{the trailing edge of}} both the upper- and underwing. The underwing is also white along its forward edge, resulting in a black line running along the middle of the underwing, expanding to more extensive black at the wingtip. In adults, the bill is ivory in color, and chalky white in juveniles. Ivory-bills have a prominent crest, although in juveniles it is ragged. The crest is black in juveniles and females. In males, the crest is black along its forward edge, changing abruptly to red on the side and rear. The chin of an ivory-billed woodpecker is black. When perched with the wings folded, birds of both sexes present a large patch of white on the lower back, roughly triangular in shape. These characteristics distinguish them from the smaller and darker-billed pileated woodpecker. The pileated woodpecker normally is brownish-black, smoky, or slaty black in color. It also has a white neck stripe, but the back is normally black. Pileated woodpecker juveniles and adults have a red crest and a white chin. Pileated woodpeckers normally have no white on the trailing edges of their wings and when perched, normally show only a small patch of white {{on each side of the}} body near the edge of the wing. However, pileated woodpeckers, apparently aberrant individuals, have been reported with white trailing edges on the wings, forming a white triangular patch on the lower back when perched. Like all woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker has a strong and straight bill and a long, mobile, hard-tipped, barbed tongue. Among North American woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker is unique in having a bill whose tip is quite flattened laterally, shaped much like a beveled <b>wood</b> <b>chisel.</b>|$|E

50|$|The ivory-billed {{woodpecker}} {{ranks among}} the largest woodpeckers {{in the world and}} is the largest in the United States. The closely related and likewise possibly extinct imperial woodpecker (C. imperialis) of western Mexico is, or was, the largest woodpecker. The ivory-billed has a total length of 48 to 53 cm, and based on very scant information, weighs about 450 to 570 g. It has a typical 76 cm wingspan. Standard measurements attained included a wing chord length of 23.5 - 26.5 cm, a tail length of 14 - 17 cm, a bill length of 5.8 - 7.3 cm, and a tarsus length of 4 - 4.6 cm.The bird is shiny blue-black with white markings on its neck and back and extensive white on the trailing edge of both the upper- and underwing.

50|$|A chisel {{is a tool}} with a {{characteristically}} shaped {{cutting edge}} (such that <b>wood</b> <b>chisels</b> have lent part of their name to a particular grind) of blade on its end, for carving or cutting a hard material such as wood, stone, or metal by hand, struck with a mallet, or mechanical power. The handle and blade of some types of chisel are made of metal or of wood with a sharp edge in it.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 Bahco {{started to}} develop and {{manufacture}} ergonomic hand tools. The first products that were developed according to ergonomic principles were the screwdrivers (1983), the adjustable wrenches (1984), <b>wood</b> <b>chisels</b> (1985) and slip-joint pliers (1986). In 1996, the Bahco ERGOTM concept was presented and scientifically approved {{as a way of}} preventing repetitive strain injuries and to increase productivity. All Bahco tools that carry the ERGOTM trade mark have undergone a scientific 11-point development program with regard to ergonomics and function.|$|R
2500|$|On each bearing tree, two blazes were {{typically}} required, one about chest height and easily visible, {{and one at}} ground level (in case the tree were illegally cut, the stump remaining). [...] On the exposed wood of the blaze, surveyors were required to inscribe, with <b>wood</b> <b>chisels,</b> township, range and section information, on typically either two or four bearing trees, if they were within some reasonable distance of the corner (unspecified early on but later set at a maximum of 3 chains (178 feet, 60 meters) away). Bearing trees are of vital importance not just for these land boundary purposes, but also for their use by ecologists in the estimation of historic forest vegetation conditions before settlement, and large scale human disturbance, of the land. [...] No other data set comes close to providing this estimate of original forest composition and structure, and the data have accordingly been used very heavily.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{most artists}} in woodcut he only {{designed}} the woodcuts, leaving the block-cutting to a specialist [...] "formschneider" [...] (sometimes Jost de Negker in his Augsburg period) who pasted the design to the <b>wood</b> and <b>chiselled</b> the white areas away. The {{quality of the}} final woodcuts, which varies considerably, depended on the skill of the cutter {{as well as the}} artist. Weiditz was unfortunate in that his publishers went bankrupt part way through the production of his two longest series of woodcuts, and the cutting was later completed by cutters of lower skill.|$|R
50|$|Elms, hickory and ash {{all have}} remarkably hard, tough wood {{that has made}} them popular for things like tool handles, bows and {{baseball}} bats. Chinese elm is considered the hardest of the elms. Owing to its superior hardness, toughness and resistance to splitting, Chinese elm {{is said to be}} the best of all <b>woods</b> for <b>chisel</b> handles and similar uses. Chinese elm lumber is used most for furniture, cabinets, veneer and hardwood flooring, as well as specialty uses such as long bow construction and tool handles. Most of the commercially milled lumber goes directly to manufacturers rather than to retail lumber outlets.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two basic}} {{processes}} used by the model maker to create models: additive and subtractive. Additive {{can be as simple}} as adding clay to create a form, sculpting and smoothing to the final shape. Body fillers, foam and resins are also used in the same manner. Most rapid prototyping technologies are based on the additive process, solidifying thin layered sections or slices one on top of each other. Subtractive is like whittling a solid block of <b>wood</b> or <b>chiseling</b> stone to the desired form. Most milling and other machining methods are subtractive, progressively using smaller and finer tools to remove material from the rough shape to get to the level of detail needed in the final model.|$|R
50|$|David Newton {{began his}} art {{career as a}} skilled {{traditional}} realist painter/printmaker/draftsman and over time gradually transitioned to abstraction in his sculpture and painting. Newton's preferred sculptural media were wood, metal and found objects which he used to create objects with whimsical and spiritual themes. Newton modeled <b>wood</b> with <b>chisels</b> and saws, blackened it with torches, and stained it with oils and pigments; welded and smithed metal; and in his last series of sculptures, he constructed objects based on architectural motifs. Many of his sculptural works resemble utilitarian objects, albeit functional, they are not actually utilitarian. Newton also drew and painted both figurative and landscape imagery based on observation and imagination. During {{the final year of}} his life David Newton worked on photography and drawing when he was no longer able to work on his physically demanding sculptures.|$|R
5000|$|He left {{nineteen}} single-leaf wood-cuts (i.e. prints {{rather than}} book illustrations), apparently {{made in the}} period 1505-15, and is mainly remembered for his twelve chiaroscuro woodcuts, which are all extremely rare. The dating of these has been much discussed by art-historians, {{as part of the}} very tangled issue of the development of the German chiaroscuro woodcut. Bartrum assigns them [...] "towards the end" [...] of the 16th century. No surviving paintings are attributed to him, although a few drawings have been, tentatively. As with most artists in woodcut, art historians now consider that Wechtlin probably just designed the woodcuts, leaving the block-cutting to a specialist [...] "formschneider" [...] who pasted the design to the <b>wood</b> and <b>chiselled</b> the white areas away. The quality of the final woodcuts, which varies considerably, depended on the skill of the cutter as well as the artist.|$|R
30|$|For pre-assessments of {{nematode}} populations, {{the control}} sections were processed {{on the day}} of or the day after the large sample block was treated. The proportion of sapwood (on a wet weight basis) was calculated as described previously [7] and the nematode population expressed as the number of nematodes per gram of sapwood. Four 5 – 10  g of wood were removed from the sapwood (Fig.  3 b), chiseled into small pieces, weighed, and processed using the Baermann funnel method. The mean number of nematodes per gram of sapwood (green) was calculated for each sample block. In addition, two pieces of <b>wood</b> were <b>chiseled</b> from the control section for MC determination. The heartwood was also dried and the MC calculated. The total weight of each sample was converted to dry weight, and the mean number of nematodes per gram of oven dried wood was also calculated.|$|R
5000|$|Rubber mallets {{are used}} when a softer blow {{is called for}} than that {{delivered}} by a metal hammer. They are typically used to form sheet metal, since they do not leave marks and {{are less likely to}} dent the workpiece. Rubber mallets are also used for forcing tight-fitting parts together, for shifting plasterboard into place, in upholstery work, {{and a variety of other}} general purposes. It is a tool of preference for <b>wood</b> workers using <b>chisels</b> with plastic, metal, or wooden handles, as they give a softened strike with a positive drive. It is the most commonly used mallet.|$|R
50|$|The blade's {{first known}} use by humans was the sharp {{edge of a}} flint stone {{that was used to}} cleave or split animal tissue, e.g. cutting meat. The use of iron or other metals led to the {{development}} of knives for those kinds of tasks. The blade of the knife allowed humans to cut meat, fibers, and other plant and animal materials with much less force than it would take to tear them apart by simply pulling with their hands. Other examples are plows, which separate soil particles, scissors which separate fabric, axes which separate <b>wood</b> fibers, and <b>chisels</b> and planes which separate wood.|$|R
5000|$|Song Yingxing {{wrote that}} ancient rulers of early China cast {{inscriptions}} of writing onto bronze tripods {{since this was}} a much more durable method of preserving the written record than using the perishable materials found in books and scrolls. He noted that musical and announcing bells of higher quality were made of different copper alloys, while those of lesser quality were made of iron. He also provided weighted formulas of different metal compositions for certain bells, for example, the casting a large bell in an audience hall or pavilion that required 47,000 catties of copper, 4,000 catties of tin, 50 oz. of gold, and 120 oz. of silver in its composition. In the smelting process, long pits for the liquid metal flow had to be dug, having a drymold construction of lime and mortar that was dried and covered in ox fat and beeswax. Then he noted the following process of pounded earth and charcoal powder that was screened and mixed into a mud paste that would be gradually spread {{on the surface of}} the wax several inches thick. When dried and heated so that the melted fat and wax could flow out entirely by means of apertures at the base, the bell or tripod could be cast in the vacated cavity between the core and the mold. With the individual casting process for bells and tripods, Song Yingxing also described the intricate individual casting processes for making cooking pots and pans, metal statues, metal barrels of cannons, metallic mirrors, and different metallic coins of copper or iron. He described the processes of hammer forging with the initial casting of an anvil, and noted that in the heating process of forging, coal accounted for 70% of the fuel, charcoal taking the rest at 30%. He also outlined the quench-hardening process of rapid cooling in clear water immediately after iron and steel products were forged. He outlined the different types of knives, axes, hoes, file tools, awls, saws, <b>wood</b> <b>chisels,</b> anchors, and metal needles that could be forged and produced. For the making of the finest swords, he said, they are coated with steel after [...] "a hundred smeltings," [...] but the core of the sword was still made of wrought iron; this was because a sword made entirely of steel would easily break when making hard strikes.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{species of the}} Hypostomus cochliodon group (formerly the genus Cochliodon), {{it has been argued}} that Panaque are the only fish that can eat and digest wood. Possible adaptations to {{consuming}} wood include spoon-shaped, scraper-like teeth and highly angled jaws to <b>chisel</b> <b>wood.</b> Researchers have also identified symbiotic gut bacteria that may allow the fish to digest the wood they consume. However, others have argued that Panaque do not in fact digest wood, and in fact take up very little energy from the wood they consume and actually lose weight when fed just wood. Furthermore, their digestive tracts are no different from those of related catfish and they do not hold wood particles in the gut longer than other catfish, suggesting Panaque are not physically adapted to eating wood, and are in fact detritivores much like other Loricariidae. In September 2010 scientists from the US National Science Foundation claimed to have discovered a new species of wood-eating catfish in the Alto Purús National Park, Peru.|$|R
40|$|How {{might we}} {{understand}} the biblical injunctions against idolatry? On the surface it all seems rather simple: we shouldn’t, the text says, worship animals, stars, found objects or things made with our hands in the sweat of our brows. Or as Isaiah puts {{it in one of}} the best polemics against idolatry still to be found. That critique gives the impression, on the surface at least, that idol-worshippers are simply deluded, for they worship an oddly shaped block of <b>wood,</b> a <b>chiselled</b> piece of stone or perhaps a polished metal icon that can never be more than the material out of which it is made. The worshipper may claim that it is a god, or that it bestows blessings and curses, but it is nothing of the sort. The passage from Isaiah plays up the sheer ordinariness of the idol with a good dose of satire. Indeed, it stresses the everyday materiality of the idol, one that punctures the exorbitant claims made for it. But this text also points to the need for an analysis of the material object in question and not the vapid claims made on its behalf. However, such an analysis also needs to go behind the text a little in order to uncover its deeper workings. To begin with, we need to shift perspective from the polemicist to the so-called worshipper of the idol. Then the idol itself becomes a mere symbol or pointer to the deity, a tangible, earthly marker of the god’s connection to this world...|$|R
500|$|Insects and spiders {{were taken}} from {{decaying}} wood, from under bark, mosses and lichens, and from the ground. Huia foraged either alone, in pairs, or in small flocks of up to five, which were probably family groups. The sexual dimorphism of the bill structure gave rise to feeding strategies that differed radically between the sexes. The male used its adze-like bill to chisel and rip into the outer layers of decaying wood, while the female probed areas inaccessible to the male, such as the burrows of insect larvae in living wood. The male had well-developed cranial musculature allowing rotten <b>wood</b> to be <b>chiselled</b> and pried apart by [...] "gaping" [...] motions. There are corresponding differences in the structure and musculature {{of the head and}} neck between males and females. Huia had very well developed depressor jaw muscles, and an occipital crest that provided extra surface for muscle attachment, allowing the jaw to be opened with considerable force. Once the bird had secured a meal, it flew to a perch with the insect in its feet. The huia stripped its meal of any hard parts, then tossed the remainder up, caught, and swallowed it.|$|R

5000|$|The text or {{image was}} first drawn onto thin washi (Japanese paper), then glued face-down onto a plank of {{close-grained}} wood, usually cherry. An incision was made along {{both sides of}} each line or area. <b>Wood</b> was then <b>chiseled</b> away, based on the drawing outlines. The block was inked using a brush or brushes. A flat hand-held tool called a baren was used to press the paper against the inked woodblock to apply the ink to the paper. The traditional baren is made in three parts, it consists of an inner core made from bamboo leaves twisted into a rope of varying thicknesses, the nodules thus created are what ultimately applies the pressure to the print. This coil is contained in a disk called an [...] "ategawa" [...] made from layers of very thin paper which is glued together and wrapped in a dampened bamboo leaf, the ends of which are then tied to create a handle. Modern printmakers have adapted this tool, and today barens are made of aluminum with ball bearings to apply the pressure are used; as well as less expensive plastic versions. Although the first prints were simply one-color, with additional colors applied by hand, the development of two registration marks carved into the blocks called [...] "kento" [...] were added. The sheet of washi to be printed {{is placed in the}} kento, then lowered onto the woodblock. This was especially helpful with the introduction of multiple colors that had to be applied with precision over previous ink layers.|$|R
40|$|This thesis started {{life as a}} short, {{illustrated}} {{dissertation on}} early Christian inscriptions in Wales for a lettering and graphics course at Newport College of Art in 1965. In 1995 I returned to research on the subject for an M. Phil. {{under the supervision of}} Miranda Aldhouse Green at the University of Wales, Newport, into which the Art College had been absorbed, and of John Higgitt at the University of Edinburgh. I was very grateful to UWCN to be awarded a bursary to enable me to undertake my M. Phil. Both my supervisors helped me to formulate and improve the ideas that had absorbed me since I was an art student. In the early sixties as a pre-diploma student at Cardiff College of Art I was fortunate to come {{under the influence of the}} lettering historian J. C. Tarr and went on to specialise in lettering at Newport under Harry Meadows who had been a pupil of M. C. Oliver -a pupil of Edward Johnston's. I was again fortunate, working as a book designer in Ireland, to be befriended by Rene Hague, the son-in-law of Eric Gill, with whom I learned brush lettering on fabric and cut lettering in <b>wood,</b> using Gill's <b>chisels.</b> Rene Hague was at that time writing his memoir of David Jones and encouraged me to look closely at his inscriptional work. Both David Jones and J. C. Tarr were fascinated by the fate of the Roman alphabet in the Dark Ages. With Thomas Charles-Edwards from 1975 a shared interest has been the early Christian inscriptions of Britain and Ireland. Very aware of the fact that there might be bonds between young apprentices and old masters, this thesis operates chronologically within the Group I and II time spans used by V. E. Nash-Williams. It is convenient that these spans are loosely defined; unless some new find with a specific dating fix appears, closer dating would seem speculative. The scribe of the manuscript known as the Cathach was of some age, with failing sight, but greatly venerated as a scribe. We know that apprentice scribes were youths with sharp sight. The scribe of the Cathach, who is writing in a primitive, prototype `half-uncial', with many features unstabilised that would be stabilised later in canonical half-uncial, would have trained up young scribes in a version of his own hand. There might have been half a century discrepancy in their ages. In any ll craft, this discrepancy in age between master and apprentice clearly blurs the edges of any layering of chronology based on stylistic features; in Britain and Ireland during the Group I period, additionally, there is the problem that for a period of time scripts could have fossilised or deteriorated in the event of a decrease in literacy and the circulation of books. Therefore it seemed prudent to remain within the looser chronology of Nash-Williams...|$|R
