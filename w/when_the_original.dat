5|$|After the Stoke line opened, {{the station}} was rebuilt {{north-east}} at the junction so it could serve both lines. The new station opened on 9June 1845; at first, southbound services ran to Crewe and Poynton. By November the line had been extended to Macclesfield, and by 1849, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> station closed, it had reached Stoke-on-Trent. The new station had four platforms, and was served by trains running between Manchester and Crewe or Stoke-on-Trent. It was renamed Cheadle Hulme in 1866, to avoid confusion with Cheadle LNW railway station which opened the same year.|$|E

5|$|The Glidden Barn, located to {{the rear}} and east of the home, was {{thought to have been}} added to the National Register of Historic Places <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> {{nomination}} for the house was approved in 1973. However, in the late 1990s, the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency revealed that the nomination included only the house.

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> state {{trunklines}} were designated, an M-11 ran {{the length}} of the Lake Michigan shoreline from the Indiana state line to Mackinaw City. That highway was replaced in 1926 by two of the then-newly created US Highways. A second highway was given the M-11 designation at that time in the Saline area. This highway was removed from the highway system and the designation decommissioned in 1954. The current M-11 was designated in 1961 along a set of roads in the Grand Rapids area that includes portions of a former route of US Highway 16 (US16) in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|As a {{security}} measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured {{a replica of}} the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on subsequent occasions up until 1970 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> trophy had to be handed back to FIFA. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica also had to disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was eventually sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, ten times the reserve price of £20,000–£30,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Subsequent testing by FIFA, however, confirmed the auctioned trophy was indeed a replica and FIFA soon afterwards arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.|$|E

5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the Carrossier Normand was considered the best carriage horses available. The arrival of automobiles, and corresponding decline in demand for carriage horses, coincided with a split in the breed. A distinction was made between the lighter, faster horses in the breed, used for sport, and larger horses, used for agricultural work. The lighter horses eventually became the French Trotter (for driving) and Anglo-Norman (for riding and cavalry), while the heavier horses became the Norman Cob. In 1912, when French horse populations were at their highest, there were 422 stallions at the Saint-Lo stud, mainly cobs and trotters. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> Carrossier Normand became extinct in the 1920s, breeding focused on the two remaining types, with the Norman Cob continuing to be used for farming and the Anglo-Norman being used to create the Selle Francais, the national French sport horse.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater was {{incorporated}} by charter of Edward IV (1468), confirmed in 1554, 1586, 1629 and 1684. Parliamentary representation as a borough constituency began in 1295 and continued until the Reform Act of 1870, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> borough constituency was disenfranchised for corruption. From 4 July 1870 the town {{was incorporated}} within the county constituency of West Somerset. When Parliamentary seats were redistributed for the 1885 general election, a new county division of Bridgwater was created. A variety of markets were granted to the town during the Middle Ages including a Midsummer fair (on 24 June), one {{at the beginning of}} Lent was added in 1468, and one at Michaelmas. The importance of these markets and fairs for the sale of wool and wine, and later of cloth, declined after medieval times. The shipping trade of the port revived after the construction of the new dock in 1841, and corn and timber have been imported for centuries.|$|E
5|$|In Polistes exclamans, equal {{sex ratio}} is {{obtained}} when only 46.3% of investment {{is devoted to}} females as female wasps are 1.16 times larger than male wasps. In a study done by Strassmann, {{it was found that}} sexual investment is female biased, especially during years of high predation and when nests are generally less successful. It has been seen that in Polistes exclamans, females are produced before males. This female investment bias may result from the ability of females to become either a worker or a reproductive (this is more adaptive for the nest as it gives the nest increased flexibility compared to that of males and may be important for overall nest success) or because females provide the colony with greater nest defense. Furthermore, even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> queen is no longer present, the sexual investment is still biased towards females, which is not expected given the genetic implications of a new queen.|$|E

5|$|In {{the age of}} {{the auto}} trail, the roads that later formed US2 through the UP were given a few {{different}} highway names. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> roadways between Ironwood and Iron River were completed in late 1915, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau (UPDB) named the area Cloverland and the highway the Cloverland Trail. Later the name was extended over the highway to Escanaba, and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s; the name was phased out by the UPDB completely in 1927. The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. Through the UP, the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US2, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|NY32 {{has been}} realigned in several {{locations}} {{since its inception}} in 1930. When the route was initially assigned, it passed through Palenville instead of bypassing it to the east as it does today. In the early 1940s, NY32 was rerouted to follow a new highway east of the hamlet. NY32's former routing into Palenville was redesignated as NY32A. The original NY32A in Saratoga County—which was redundant to US4—was supplanted at this time by a rerouted NY32. The Bemis Heights–Schuylerville portion of the overlap between US4 and NY32 was eliminated in the 1950s <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> routing of NY32 between the two locations was upgraded. Construction on the highway began in the mid-1950s and was completed by 1958, at which time US4 was rerouted to follow the riverside roadway.|$|E

5|$|The {{last name}} applied to M-53 is the Earle Memorial Highway, {{named in honor}} of Horatio Earle, Michigan's first State Highway Commissioner. Earle was {{instrumental}} in the early Good Roads Movement in the state and the creation of the Michigan State Highway Department, which is now MDOT. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> legislation creating a highway agency was declared unconstitutional in 1903, he kept the job in an unofficial capacity until the Legislature could rectify the situation. Earle designated that the first mile of state reward road in The Thumb, and residents formed a group to lobby to have the road named in his honor. The State Highway Commissioner Murray Van Wagoner designated M-53 in Earle's memory in April 1939, and the Legislature legislation two years later honoring him, but not officially naming the road. That was corrected in 2001 when the statutes naming various highways in the state were consolidated, and M-53 was officially designated the Earle Memorial Highway.|$|E
5|$|Two English-language dubs of Danger: Diabolik were produced, both {{featuring}} {{the voices of}} Law, Mell and Terry-Thomas. The original English version, used for the film's theatrical and DVD release, presented the remaining cast dubbed with predominantly British accents. The second version, used for the film's VHS and LaserDisc release (as well as its showing on Mystery Science Theater 3000), was created <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> sound elements for the dubbed version (aside {{from those of the}} three aforementioned performers) were believed to be lost; the non-English-speaking actors were dubbed with American accents. This version also greatly remixed the audio levels for the sound effects and music, and dropped the Danger: from the original English version's title due to using an Italian print. The audio masters for the original English version were eventually recovered by Kim Aubry of American Zoetrope, who produced Paramount's DVD release.|$|E
