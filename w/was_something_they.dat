5|$|Despite {{the success}} of Moo, You Bloody Choir, much of Augie March's post-album touring {{involved}} supporting other bands. They played shows supporting The Aliens and Andrew Bird in the United States, before returning to Australia to open for Crowded House. Richards said the band's status as an opening act, rather than headlining their own shows, <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>they</b> saw as a challenge—their intention was to win over fans who {{came to see the}} main act. However, he called the tour with The Aliens depressing; the bands played very different types of music, and the attendance at shows was small. Augie March later earned a prime slot at the 2008 Big Day Out.|$|E
5|$|The {{assault was}} under the direct command of Major-General Essad Pasha. The plan was to gather the assault force {{secretly}} behind the Turkish lines on 18 May. Then at 03:30 19 May, {{while it was still}} dark, the Turkish forces would simultaneously attack all along the ANZAC perimeter. The aim was to force the defenders out of their trenches and back into the sea. To maintain surprise the attack would not be preceded by an artillery bombardment; but the previous day all the available Turkish artillery bombarded the ANZAC lines between 17:00 and midnight. This <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>they</b> had done twice before that month. The signal to start the attack {{was supposed to have been}} the detonation of a large mine at Quinn's Post, in the centre of the ANZAC lines, but by 19 May the tunnel for the mine had not been completed. The attacking force, from north to south, comprised the 19th Division (now made up of the 27th, 57th and 72nd Infantry Regiments), 5th Division (13th and 14th Infantry Regiments), 2nd Division (1st, 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments), 16th Division (33rd, 47th, 48th and 125th Infantry Regiments) and the now independent 77th Infantry Regiment. In total this was around 42,000 men. The 2nd and 16th Divisions were fresh, having just arrived on the peninsula, while the other two had taken part in some of the previous counter-attacks at Anzac Cove.|$|E
25|$|Before {{recording}} By the Way (2002), the Chili Peppers {{decided that}} they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album. In the past, Rubin had given the band creative freedom on their recording material; this <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>they</b> thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return. Originally the album was headed in a much different direction than the final production. The album {{started out as a}} group of fast, hardcore punk songs, which Rubin rejected. Frusciante also wanted a darker, 1980s UK pop/new wave sound mixed in with 1980s hardcore. The recording process was tough for Flea, who felt like an outsider in the band and that his role was being diminished due to a musical power struggle with Frusciante. Flea wanted to create more funk-inspired songs, while Frusciante felt that the band had overused their funk side. Flea considered quitting the band after the album, but the two eventually worked out all their problems.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Walter and Beneatha's father has recently died, and Mama is waiting for a life insurance check for $10,000. Walter has a sense of entitlement to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol and Beneatha has to remind him it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually Mama puts some of the money down on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the practical reason that it happens to be much cheaper. Later she relents and gives {{the rest of the money}} to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter passes the money on to Willy's naive sidekick Bobo, who gives it to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena says that while money <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>they</b> try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as them.|$|E
500|$|Neil Strauss from The New York Times {{explained}} {{many of the}} album's origins. [...] "213" [...] {{was described}} as a [...] "love song" [...] by Araya, which <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>they</b> had never done before. The song was named after serial killer and sex offender Jeffrey Dahmer's old apartment number. [...] "Dittohead", a partial tribute to Rush Limbaugh, begins by criticizing the legal system for [...] "being too lenient on killers". The song [...] "ended up not denouncing the system but advocating its permissiveness". [...] "Sex, Murder, Art" [...] was said by TheState.com to feature [...] "roars about a maddening relationship and his 'pleasure in inflicting pain.'" ...|$|E

Although she said she was not retracting anything in the song, calling her response a [...] "blanket statement" [...] she said {{she was not going to}} feel some sort of way about how other people interpret, and that blatantly dissing anyone was not the energy behind the record. Hilson commented she wanted to address the haters, and all the media speculation about the remarks <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>they</b> did not intend to accomplish with the song. She also addressed that the release of the song was not an intentional leak, stating most remixes are meant to be done when a record is hot, and although admitting that while [...] "Turnin Me On" [...] was not [...] "a number one record", the remix was done three months prior.|$|E

500|$|The game's fictional city, New Marais, was {{inspired}} by New Orleans, though many other southern influences were mixed and matched. It was thought New Orleans was architecturally the [...] "coolest city in America" [...] and well suited to a superhero who climbs and also allowed Sucker Punch to have environmental variety. New Marais was designed to have distinct neighborhoods with tonal as well as architectural shifts between them. Parkour elements, such as the game's grind rails, were integrated more into the environment to improve the flow of it, while powers such as the vertical grind, were incorporated into the parkour. The goal {{of the city was}} to have a [...] "big old jungle gym". Street musicians were added to the city because they were considered {{an integral part of the}} New Orleans vibe.

500|$|The {{writing and}} {{formation}} of By the Way began {{immediately following the}} culmination of Californication's world tour, {{in the spring of}} 2001. As with Californication, much of the creation took place in the band members' homes and other practice locations, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it." [...] Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, [...] "writing By the Way...was a whole different experience from Californication. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence." [...] Prior to recording By the Way, the Chili Peppers decided that they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album.

500|$|The writers {{had written}} {{a scene in which}} Willa Ford's {{character}} Chelsea is stranded on the lake for hours after she sees Jason standing on the shore. Eventually, the girl would tire and drown. Shannon and Swift felt this <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>they</b> had not seen in slasher films, but later decided to make the death quicker and more visceral. A similar incident occurred with Danielle Panabaker's character Jenna. Panabaker said Jenna was scripted to survive longer than she did in {{the final version of the}} film; Jenna was supposed to escape Jason's lair and recite a [...] "cute line" [...] about a second date with Clay before an elaborate fight sequence that ends in her death. The writers wanted to strike a balance between finding new and interesting ways to kill characters and paying homage to popular death scenes that appeared in previous installments of the series. To accomplish this, Shannon and Swift included the presence of a wheelchair and a sweater in Jason's tunnels; the character Mark (Tom McBride) was a paraplegic who was killed by Jason in Friday the 13th Part 2 and Mrs. Voorhees wore the sweater in the original version of Friday the 13th.|$|E

500|$|Rick Rubin had {{produced}} their two previous albums. However, the Chili Peppers {{decided to look}} for other producers for Californication.

Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>they</b> thought necessary for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return.

In early 1999, following the recording process, the band played [...] "Scar Tissue", [...] "Otherside", and [...] "Californication" [...] to their managers, and {{it was decided that}} [...] "Scar Tissue" [...] would be the lead single for the album. To support their reunited line-up, the band played various proms across the country to promote Californication.

2500|$|Greenwood was {{centered}} on a street known as Greenwood Avenue.

Greenwood Avenue was home to the black American commercial district with many red brick buildings. These buildings belonged to black Americans and they were thriving businesses, including grocery stores, banks, libraries, and much more. Greenwood was one of the most affluent communities and it became known as [...] "Black Wall Street." ...|$|E

In December 2000 Balzac released their next full-length album, Zennou-Naru Musuu-No Me Ha Shi Wo Yubi Sasu. It was a concept album and sold extremely well.
