5|$|Finney {{disagreed}} with the accidental voyaging portion of Sharp's hypothesis. To investigate the problem, he founded the Polynesian Voyaging Society with Herb Kane and Tommy Holmes in 1973, intent on building a voyaging canoe to sail from Hawaii to Tahiti to test whether intentional two-way voyaging throughout Oceania could be replicated. With the help of Mau's navigational knowledge guiding Hōkūle‘a, the Polynesian Voyaging Society demonstrated that intentional voyaging was not only possible, but also the ancestors of the Polynesians could have settled the Pacific on similar voyages using non-instrument <b>wayfinding</b> techniques such as Mau's. Finally, linguistic and archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} history of the Polynesian people does not originate in the East Pacific but in the West. Recent developments in the field of DNA analysis have unequivocally settled the debate of Polynesian origin. They prove Polynesians share common ancestry with indigenous Taiwanese and East Asians.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments (SCCOG) began a {{study of}} how to improve the Regional Intermodal Transportation Center (RITC), {{including}} Union Station. The study analyzed problems with the RITC – including poor pedestrian connections, minimal bus facilities, {{and a lack of}} food vendors – and considered but rejected a move to a Fort Trumbull site. The proposed alternative released in 2010, which would cost around $20 million, would relocate Water Street slightly to the west. The bus terminal would be expanded, with a new building adding onto the existing former baggage office. A pedestrian bridge was to be constructed connecting the Water Street Garage, the main station area, the northbound Amtrak platform, and the ferry terminal – a design that served station passengers as well as the ferries. Other pedestrian improvements were to include <b>wayfinding</b> signs, pedestrian-scale lighting, and expanded sidewalks.|$|E

25|$|Several stops along Select Bus Service routes, {{such as the}} B44, B46, M34/M34A, M60, M79, M86, and Q44 employ {{different}} countdown clocks {{that are}} separate from bus stop signage.

As of 2016, a total of 32 bus stops currently have one of the two countdown clocks installed. The current countdown clocks are successors to a pilot program on the M15 in 2007, and another on the M34 and M16 buses between 2009 and 2012.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Polynesian {{navigation}} {{was used}} {{for thousands of years}} to make long voyages across thousands of miles of the open Pacific Ocean. Navigators travelled to small inhabited islands using <b>wayfinding</b> techniques and knowledge passed by oral tradition from master to apprentice, often in the form of song. Generally each island maintained a guild of navigators who had very high status; in times of famine or difficulty they could trade for aid or evacuate people to neighboring islands. As of 2014, these traditional navigation methods are still taught in the Polynesian outlier of Taumako Island in the Solomons.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} on spatial memory and <b>wayfinding</b> {{in an article}} by Ishikawa et al. in 2008 revealed that using a GPS moving map device reduces an individual's navigation abilities {{when compared to other}} participants who were using maps or had previous experience on the route with a guide. GPS moving map devices are frequently set up to allow the user to only see a small detailed close-up of a particular segment of the map which is constantly updated. In comparison, maps usually allow the user to see the same view of the entire route from departure to arrival. Other research has shown that individuals who use GPS travel more slowly overall compared to map users who are faster. GPS users stop more frequently and {{for a longer period of}} time whereas map users and individuals using past experience as a guide travel on more direct routes to reach their goal.|$|E
500|$|In July 2012, the New York City {{government}} {{released a}} public request for information, asking for {{comments about the}} future uses for these payphones. The RFI presented questions such as [...] "What alternative communications amenities would fill a need?"; [...] "If retained, should the current designs of sidewalk payphone enclosures be substantially revised?"; and [...] "Should the current number of payphones on City sidewalks change, and if so, how?". Through the RFI, the New York City government sought new uses for the payphones, including a combination of [...] "public wireless hotspots, touch-screen <b>wayfinding</b> panels, information kiosks, charging stations for mobile communications devices, [...] electronic community bulletin boards," [...] all of which eventually became {{the features of the}} kiosks that were included in the LinkNYC proposal.|$|E
500|$|On March 18, 2007 Mau {{presided over}} the first pwo {{ceremony}} for navigators in 56 years {{on the island of}} Satawal. Five Native Hawaiians and eleven other people were inducted into pwo as master navigators, including Nainoa Thompson and Mau's son, Sesario Sewralur. The Polynesian Voyaging Society, as part of the 2007 Hōkūle‘a [...] "One Ocean, One People" [...] voyage named [...] "Kū Holo Mau," [...] presented Mau with a canoe named the Alingano Maisu, a gift for his key role in reviving traditional <b>wayfinding</b> navigation in Hawaii. The canoe was built in Kawaihae, Hawaii under the nonprofit organization Nā Kalai Wa‘a Moku O Hawai‘i. The commitment to build this [...] "gift" [...] for Mau was made by Clay Bertelmann, captain of Makali‘i and Hōkūle‘a. Maisu was given to Mau on behalf of all the voyaging families and organizations that actively continue to sail and practice the traditions taught by Mau Piailug.|$|E
500|$|The successful, non-instrument sailing of Hōkūle‘a to Tahiti in 1976, {{proved the}} {{efficacy}} of Mau's navigational system to the world. To academia, Mau's achievement provided evidence for intentional two-way voyaging throughout Oceania, supporting a hypothesis that explained the Asiatic origin of Polynesians. The success of the Micronesian-Polynesian cultural exchange, symbolized by Hōkūle‘a, had an impact throughout the Pacific. It contributed {{to the emergence of}} the second Hawaiian cultural renaissance and to a revival of Polynesian navigation and canoe building in Hawaii, New Zealand, Rarotonga and Tahiti. It also sparked interest in traditional <b>wayfinding</b> on Mau's home island of Satawal. Later in life, Mau was respectfully known as a grandmaster navigator, and he was called [...] "Papa Mau" [...] by his friends with great reverence and affection. He received an honorary degree from the University of Hawaii, and he was honored by the Smithsonian Institution and the Bishop Museum for his contributions to maritime history. Mau's life and work was explored in several books and documentary films, and his legacy continues to be remembered and celebrated by the indigenous peoples of Oceania.|$|E
500|$|Pius [...] "Mau" [...] Piailug (pronounced 1932 [...] July 12, 2010) was a Micronesian {{navigator}} {{from the}} Carolinian island of Satawal, {{best known as}} a teacher of traditional, non-instrument <b>wayfinding</b> methods for open-ocean voyaging. Mau's Carolinian navigation system, which relies on navigational clues using the Sun and stars, winds and clouds, seas and swells, and birds and fish, was acquired through rote learning passed down through teachings in the oral tradition. He earned the title of master navigator (palu) by the age of eighteen, around the time the first American missionaries arrived in Satawal. As he neared middle age, Mau grew concerned that the practice of navigation in Satawal would disappear as his people became acculturated to Western values. In the hope that the navigational tradition would be preserved for future generations, Mau shared his knowledge with the Polynesian Voyaging Society (PVS). With Mau's help, PVS used experimental archaeology to recreate and test lost Hawaiian navigational techniques on the Hōkūle‘a, a modern reconstruction of a double-hulled Hawaiian voyaging canoe.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there are}} a number of common {{obstacles}} to acoustic <b>wayfinding</b> techniques: noisy outdoor environments can challenge an individual's ability to identify useful sounds, while indoors, the architecture may not provide an acoustic response which is useful for orientation and destination. [...] Among the most difficult environments to navigate for individuals who rely on acoustic <b>wayfinding</b> are crowded places like department stores, transit stations, and hotel lobbies, or open spaces like parking lots and parks, where distinct sound cues are lacking. [...] This means that, in practice, individuals who navigate primarily by acoustic <b>wayfinding</b> must also rely on a number of other senses – including touch, smell, and residual sight – to supplement auditory cues. [...] These different methods can be used in tandem. [...] For example, visually impaired individuals often use a white cane, not only to physically locate obstacles in front of them, but also to acoustically get a sense of what those obstacles may be. [...] By tapping the cane, they also create sound waves that help them to gauge the location and size of nearby objects.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, {{architects and}} acousticians {{have begun to}} address the {{problems}} faced by people who rely primarily on acoustic <b>wayfinding</b> to navigate urban spaces. [...] The primary work on the architectural implications of acoustic <b>wayfinding</b> comes from a collaboration between Christopher Downey, an architect who went blind in 2008 and has since worked to improve architectural design for the visually impaired, and Joshua Cushner, who leads the Acoustic consulting practice for engineering design firm Arup in San Francisco. [...] Their work focuses on how to plan new facilities to include sensible systems of sound markers and architectural spaces which provide orientation through acoustic cues. [...] On 20 September 2011, the San Francisco chapter of the American Institute of Architects organized an acoustic <b>wayfinding</b> discussion and walking tour, led by Chris Downey and Joshua Cushner. [...] The purpose of the tour was to highlight the ways that visual impaired people associate sounds with particular buildings and locations, creating [...] "sound markers" [...] that help them find their way on the street or indoors, and to discuss implementing more unique sound markers into urban design projects.|$|E
2500|$|Acoustic <b>wayfinding</b> is the {{practice}} of using the auditory system to orient oneself and navigate physical space. [...] It is commonly used by the visually impaired, allowing them to retain their mobility without relying on visual cues from their environment.|$|E
2500|$|Costs for streets depend {{largely on}} four variables: street width, street length, block width and {{pavement}} width. Two inherent {{characteristics of the}} grid plan, frequent intersections and orthogonal geometry, assist pedestrian movement. The geometry helps with orientation and <b>wayfinding</b> and its frequent intersections with the choice and directness of route to desired destinations.|$|E
2500|$|Acoustic <b>wayfinding</b> {{involves}} using {{a variety}} of auditory cues to create a mental map of the surrounding environment. [...] This can include a number of techniques: navigating by sounds from the natural environment, such as pedestrian crossing signals; echolocation, or creating sound waves (by tapping a cane or making clicking noises) to determine the location and size of surrounding objects; and memorizing the unique sounds in a given space to recognize it again later. [...] For the visually impaired, these auditory cues become the primary substitute for visual information about the direction and distance of people and objects in their environment.|$|E
2500|$|Between the 1976 voyage and 2009, Hōkūle‘a {{completed}} [...] additional voyages to Micronesia, Polynesia, Japan, Canada and {{the mainland}} United States, all using ancient <b>wayfinding</b> techniques of celestial navigation. On 19 January2007, Hōkūle‘a left Hawaii with the voyaging canoe Alingano Maisu on a voyage through Micronesia (...) and ports in southern Japan. The voyage {{was expected to}} take five months. On 9 June2007, Hōkūle‘a completed the [...] "One Ocean, One People" [...] voyage to Yokohama, Japan. On April 5, 2009, Hōkūle‘a returned to Honolulu following a roundtrip training sail to Palmyra Atoll, undertaken to develop skills of potential crewmembers for Hōkūle‘a's eventual circumnavigation of the earth.|$|E
2500|$|The market area, {{concession}} stands, and {{the remainder}} of Park Avenue in the Plaza (used only for bus turnarounds and layovers, {{as well as local}} deliveries to Fordham Place) were demolished as part of the [...] "Fordham Plaza Reconstruction Project" [...] from 2013 to 2016. The renovation, designed by Grimshaw Architects, constructed a bus loop on Third Avenue (used to turn [...] buses) and closed the street to all traffic except buses. It also replaced the concession stand with a cafe and canopy over the Metro-North stairs. A second canopy with food kiosks was constructed {{at the south end of}} the plaza. Several PlaNYC <b>wayfinding</b> signs were also installed.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{settlers}} of the Hawaiian Islands {{are thought}} to have sailed from the Marquesas Islands using Polynesian navigation methods. [...] To test this theory, the Hawaiian Polynesian Voyaging Society was established in 1973. [...] The group built a replica of an ancient double-hulled canoe called the Hōkūle‘a, whose crew successfully navigated the Pacific Ocean from Hawaii to Tahiti in 1976 without instruments. [...] In 1980, a Hawaiian named Nainoa Thompson invented a new method of non instrument navigation (called the [...] "modern Hawaiian <b>wayfinding</b> system"), enabling him to complete the voyage from Hawaii to Tahiti and back. In 1987, a Māori named Matahi Whakataka (Greg Brightwell) and his mentor Francis Cowan sailed from Tahiti to Aotearoa without instruments.|$|E
2500|$|From 1904 to 1967, subway routes on the {{official}} subway map were drawn either in a single color or in three colors, which corresponded to the company that the route operated on — the IRT, BMT, or IND. Still, after the 1940 unification of the three companies' routes {{under the umbrella of}} a Board of Transportation—later the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA)—the three networks continued to operate separately and were generally referred to by their old names. Both maps and the station signage continued to refer to the historical IRT, BMT, and IND. [...] In 1964, a major review of <b>wayfinding</b> was triggered by the combination of two things: the large influx of visitors for the 1964 New York World's Fair, which made the subway and bus maps confusing to some visitors; and the connection of the BMT and IND networks through the 60th Street Tunnel Connection and the soon-to-be-opened Chrystie Street Connection, which rendered the three-color scheme unworkable.|$|E
2500|$|These <b>wayfinding</b> techniques, {{along with}} {{outrigger}} canoe construction methods, were kept as guild secrets. Generally each island maintained a guild of navigators who had very high status; {{in times of}} famine or difficulty these navigators could trade for aid or evacuate people to neighboring islands. On his first voyage of Pacific exploration Cook had {{the services of a}} Polynesian navigator, Tupaia, who drew a hand-drawn chart of the islands within [...] radius (to the north and west) of his home island of Ra'iatea. Tupaia had knowledge of 130 islands and named 74 on his chart. Tupaia had navigated from Ra'iatea in short voyages to 13 islands. He had not visited western Polynesia, as since his grandfather's time the extent of voyaging by Raiateans has diminished to the islands of eastern Polynesia. [...] His grandfather and father had passed to Tupaia the knowledge as to the location of the major islands of western Polynesia and the navigation information necessary to voyage to Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. As the Admiralty orders directed Cook to search for the “Great Southern Continent”, Cook ignored Tupaia's chart and his skills as a navigator. To this day, original traditional methods of Polynesian Navigation are still taught in the Polynesian outlier of Taumako Island in the Solomon Islands.|$|E
