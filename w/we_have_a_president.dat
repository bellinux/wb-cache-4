40|$|On {{the growth}} {{prospects}} for the world economy little remains to be said after the summing up of the most likely global scenario pronounced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the spring World Economic Outlook (WEO) : “Improved activity in the United States {{during the second half}} of 2011 and better policies in the euro area in response to its deepening economic crisis have reduced the threat of a sharp global slowdown. Accordingly, weak recovery will likely resume in the major advanced economies, and activity is expected to remain relatively solid in most emerging and developing economies. However, the recent improvements are very fragile. Policymakers need to continue to implement the fundamental changes required to achieve healthy growth over the medium term. With large output gaps in advanced economies, they must also calibrate policies with a view to supporting still-weak growth over the near term. ” 1 In autumn the IMF explicitly said that uncertainty weighs heavily on the outlook, as policies in the major advanced economies failed to rebuild confidence for the medium term. The viability of the Eurozone and the looming “fiscal cliff ” in the USA are still worrying investors. It is hardly likely that anyone would care to question the IMF succinct diagnosis, apart from possibly probing into the details of the forecast and/or the underlying modelling. As for the remedy, it is very easy to spell it out, while the strategy to implement it, at least in Italy, is economically challenging, given the difficulty of reconciling the short-term and medium-term aims and actions, and, politically speaking, it remains something of <b>a</b> mystery: <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>President's</b> government supported in Parliament by a “strange majority ” of parties that are gearin...|$|R

Now, President Bush does this because he knows first-hand that power of faith to change lives—from the inside out. And the reason he knows this isbecause faith changed his life... He grew up in church, but like most of us, he didn’t always walk the walk. Many years ago, at a particularly low point in his life, he realized thatsomething was missing.

To date <b>we</b> <b>have</b> only reached <b>a</b> fragile stalemate between the insurgency, composed of the Taliban and supported by al Qaeda, and the ISAF and U. S. forces within the country. Many argue we should give up in Afghanistan, believing our problems can be attributed to a poor strategy, a lack of resources, a lack of focus, or simply an unwinnable war. However, <b>we</b> now <b>have</b> <b>a</b> new <b>President,</b> <b>a</b> new commander in Afghanistan, and a new strategy that many <b>have</b> touted as <b>a</b> first step toward victory. This thesis examines the history of the battle for stability in Afghanistan, the history of insurgencies in the country, and other major issues challenging the rebuilding and stability of the failed state. The intent of this thesis is to contribute a further understanding of the conflict and challenges present in Afghanistan and its surrounding region. The effectiveness of the Obama administration's new strategy and direction in Afghanistan is also examined. While the new strategy is a step forward in Afghanistan, it is far from a silver bullet. Any victory still requires a true long-term commitment to the fight for stability in Afghanistan, the proper resources for the security of the Afghan people and an effective effort to eliminate the safe haven that now exists in Pakistan. Significant progress is achievable within the region. However, even if the Obama plan works as outlined true stability and success will not occur unless the U.
