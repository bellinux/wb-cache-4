It can involve the examination of particular visions or approaches by researchers and policy-makers in education that often address contemporary debates and assumptions about innovations and practices in teaching and learning by considering the profession within broader philosophical or sociocultural contexts. As an academic field, study involves [...] "the philosophical study of education and its problems...its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of philosophy". [...] "The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline." [...] As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of applied philosophy, drawing from fields of metaphysics, epistemology, axiology and the philosophical approaches (speculative, prescriptive, or analytic) to address questions in and about pedagogy, education policy, and curriculum, as well as the process of learning, to name a few. [...] For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between educational theory and practice. One application is Transactionalism <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the risks of simplifying complexity in teaching and learning any subject.|$|E

Specifically, studies conducted in Hong Kong produced greater correlations than those conducted in the US and Canada {{in the areas of}} phonological awareness and decoding. Consistent with the societal prestige and the economic advantage assoicated with English competence, most children in Hong Kong start learning English at a fairly early age (Kan & Adamson, 2010). Moreover, under the guidance of Hong Kong government collaborative language policies, <b>which</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> instead of exacerbate tensions between one language versus the other, students are getting greater exposure to English at schools while still maintaining their first language. In other words, the collaborative language policy promotes an additive bilingual environment in Hong Kong, which may have enabled students to maintain their first language while adding a second one and such additive environment is also facilitating the transfer between the two langauges (Lambert, 1975). By contrast, studies of Mandarin-English bilingual children in the United States indicated an early stagnation of these children’s Mandarin skills as these children were focusing on learning English and becoming English-dominant (Sheng, 2014). L 1, or heritage language attribution has been found in other bilingual groups in the North America context.

Inspection does not assure the quality of the product, only a robust and repeatable manufacturing process can achieve this. Therefore, inspection is often considered as an overhead although an extremely important one. Similar to Design for Manufacture (DFM) and Design for Assembly (DFA) (<b>which</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> designs <b>which</b> are difficult to make), the concept of DFI considers measurement capabilities at an early stage in the product development life cycle and uses knowledge of the fundamental principles of metrology to achieve cost reduction. If the inspection method and instruments are considered and selected at the design stage, the likelihood that a tolerance feature cannot be inspected or requires a specialised instrument is substantially reduced. High precision features require specialised manufacturing and metrology, these can have limited availability in the supply chain and therefore often have increased cost. The concept of DFI should complement and work in collaboration with DFM and DFA. There are three key areas when considering DFI, datum selection, tolerances and accessibility, plus general metrology considerations. Getting the most from inspection techniques will help improve quality. [...] It is still difficult for systems designers to build machines that allow finished products to be inspected easily. To do so requires an understanding of the product being manufactured and how inspection tasks can improve the quality control process.|$|R

It provides a short history of IUU fishing, locating the phenomenon in the global expansion of marine capture fisheries and the changes to the regulation of fishing industries and control over maritime space and marine living resources that took place during the twentieth century. Three case-studies of IUU fishing from the Indo-Pacific are examined in detail: the Southern Ocean fishery for Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides); the presence of Indonesian fishers in the Australian Fishing Zone; and Japanese under-reporting of Southern Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) catches.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of September 11, 2001, issues related to religion and violence has been actualized in the media. Do Islamic texts and sources legitimate violent actions? In response to these questions, some professional scholars of Islam argued that the 11 September terrorists were not really Muslims, but hijackers of Islam. According to other scholars, such arguments reflect a common sui-generis discourse in religious studies which stresses the autonomy of religious phenomena, the priority of faith over cultural production, interior experiences and beliefs over social practice. The scholars in favor for a naturalistic approach in religious studies argues that, in order to approach religion in a naturalistic way, {{we have to be}} critical of representations of religion – and in this case representations of Islam – drawing on a suigeneris discourse. The aim of this paper is two-fold: on the one hand, it investigates, through discourse analysis, how Islam is represented in textbooks used in religious studies introductory courses in Sweden. The paper shows how the textbooks draw on both sui-generis discourses and naturalistic discourses, although the sui-generis discourse is arguably the dominant one.

Geodata typically comes from different and unrelated sources, whereas users expect a seamless view which respects their specific needs. A modern geo portrayal service therefore has to deliver information from heterogeneous data sources adapted to specific applications. Each data model introduces limitations that might {{make it harder to}} fulfil user requirements. Since in practise user requirements constantly change and data sets are updated, the complexity of configuring and administering such a process increases disproportionately to both the number of requirements and data model limitations. To overcome this situation, we outline an approach <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> what we call the explosion of interdependencies between formalized requirements and geodata features. Our goal is to keep original data virtually untouched while delivering adapted data to multiple users with specific portrayal requirements.

40|$|Persistent {{scatterer}} (PS) interferometry (PSI) {{techniques are}} designed to measure ground deformations using satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. They rely on the identification of pixels not severely affected by spatial or temporal decorrelation, which, in general, correspond to pointlike PSs commonly found in urban areas. However, in urban areas, we can find not only PSs but also distributed scatterers (DSs) whose phase information may be exploited for PSI applications. Estimation of DS parameters requires speckle filtering {{to be applied to}} the complex SAR data, but conventional speckle filtering approaches tend to mask PS information due to spatial averaging. In the context of single-polarization PSI, adaptive speckle filtering strategies based on the exploitation of amplitude temporal statistics have been proposed, <b>which</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> spatial filtering on nonhomogeneous areas. Given the growing interest on polarimetric PSI techniques, i. e., those using polarimetric diversity to increase performance over conventional single-polarization PSI, in this paper, we propose an adaptive spatial filter driven by polarimetric temporal statistics, rather than single-polarization amplitudes. The proposed approach is able to filter DS while preserving PS information. In addition, a new methodology for the joint processing of PS and DS in the context of PSI is introduced. The technique has been tested for two different urban data sets: 41 dual-polarization TerraSAR-X images of Murcia (Spain) and 31 full-polarization Radarsat- 2 images of Barcelona (Spain). Results show an important improvement in terms of number of pixels with valid deformation information, hence denser area coverage.

40|$|Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) is a pyridoxal- 5 ‘-dependent {{enzyme that}} catalyzes the {{condensation}} of homocysteine and serine to form cystathionine. Human CBS {{is unique in}} that heme is also required for maximal activity, although the function of heme in this enzyme is presently unclear. The study presented herein reveals that the heme of human CBS undergoes a coordination change upon reduction at elevated temperatures. We have termed this new species “CBS 424 ” and demonstrate that its formation is likely irreversible when pH 9 FeIII CBS is reduced at moderately elevated temperatures (40 °C and higher) or when pH 9 FeII CBS is heated to similar temperatures. Spectroscopic techniques, including resonance Raman, electronic absorption, and variable temperature/variable field magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, provide strong evidence that CBS 424 is coordinated by two neutral donor ligands. It appears likely that the native cysteine(thiolate) heme ligand is displaced by an endogenous neutral donor upon conversion to CBS 424. This behavior is consistent with other six-coordinate, cysteine(thiolate) -ligated heme centers, <b>which</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> this coordination structure in the FeII state. Functional assays show that CBS 424 is inactive and suggest that the ligand switch is responsible for eliminating enzyme activity. When this investigation is taken together with other functional studies of CBS, it provides strong evidence that coordination of Cys 52 to the heme iron is crucial for full activity in this enzyme. We hypothesize that cysteine displacement {{may serve as a}} mechanism for CBS inactivation and that second-sphere interactions of the Cys 52 thiolate with surrounding residues are responsible for communicating the heme ligand displacement to the CBS active site...|$|R

Particle tracking seeks {{to identify and}} characterize the motion of individual particles entrained in a fluid or air experiment. We analyze a cylindrical chamber filled with water and seeded with density-matched particles. In every four-frame sequence, we identify a particle track by assigning a unique track label for each camera image. The conventional approach to particle tracking is to use an exhaustive tree-search method utilizing greedy algorithms to reduce search times. However, these types of algorithms are not optimal due to a cascade effect of incorrect decisions upon adjacent tracks. We examine {{the use of a}} guided evolutionary neural net with simulated annealing to arrive at a globally optimal assignment of tracks. The net is guided both by the minimization of the search space through the use of prior limiting assumptions about valid tracks and by a strategy <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> high-energy intermediate states which can trap the net in a local minimum. A stochastic search algorithm is used in place of back-propagation of error to further reduce the chance of being trapped in an energy well. Global optimization is achieved by minimizing an objective function, which includes both track smoothness and particle-image utilization parameters. In this paper we describe our model and present our experimental results.

The {{objective of this}} study was to examine the features of elderly cases and assess factors determining survival and the behaviour of this disease with advancing age. A retrospective review of all cases and prospective assessment in survivors was conducted at The Sickle Cell Clinic at the University of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica previously operated by the MRC Laboratories. All patients with SS disease born prior to December 31, 1943 who would, by January 2004, have passed their 60 th birthday were traced and their current status ascertained. The molecular and clinical features were assessed and observations on the clinical behaviour of the disease and of haematology and biochemistry are presented. Of the 102 patients, 58 had died, four had emigrated and 40 were alive, resident in Jamaica and aged 60 - 87 years. Survival was associated with female gender and higher foetal haemoglobin but not with alpha-thalassaemia or beta-globin haplotype. A tendency to familial clustering among elderly survivors did not reach statistical significance. Painful crises ameliorated with age and there was a benign course in pregnancy. Mean haemoglobin levels fell with age and were generally associated with rising creatinine levels indicating the importance of renal failure.

40|$|Shared-memory multi-threaded {{programming}} is inherently {{more difficult than}} single-threaded programming. The main source of complexity is that, the threads of an application can interleave {{in so many different}} ways. To ensure correctness, a programmer has to test all possible thread interleavings, which, however, is impractical. Many rare thread interleavings remain untested in production systems, and they are the major cause for a majority of concurrency bugs. Given that untested interleavings are the major cause of a majority of the concurrency bugs, this dissertation explores two possible ways to tackle concurrency bugs in this dissertation. One is to expose untested interleavings during testing to find concurrency bugs. The other is <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> untested interleavings during production runs to tolerate concurrency bugs. The key is an efficient and effective way to encode and remember tested interleavings. This dissertation first discusses two hypotheses about concurrency bugs: the small scope hypothesis and the value independent hypothesis. Based on these two hypotheses, this dissertation defines a set of interleaving patterns, called interleaving idioms, which are used to encode tested interleavings. The empirical analysis shows that the idiom based interleaving encoding scheme is able to represent most of the concurrency bugs that are used in the study. Then, this dissertation discusses an open source testing tool called Maple. It memoizes tested interleavings and actively <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> expose untested interleavings. The results show that Maple is able to expose concurrency bugs and expose interleavings faster than other conventional testing techniques. Finally, this dissertation discusses two parallel runtime system designs <b>which</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> untested interleavings during production runs to tolerate concurrency bugs. Avoiding untested interleavings significantly improve correctness because most of the concurrency bugs are caused by untested interleavings. Also, the performance overhead for disallowing untested interleavings is low as commonly occuring interleavings should have been tested in a well-tested program...|$|R

However, analysis of trade union responses to DM in continental Europe is strikingly underdeveloped, although {{there is good reason}} to suspect that unions may play some role in shaping DM due to their institutionalised roles in issues of equality. This thesis has shown that unions’ influence over DM and their responses to it vary by country, but in ways that are not generally expected. Using a qualitative research design based on documentary data analysis and semistructured interviews and a discursive institutionalism (DI) approach, the study compares how DM has been presented in France, Germany and Sweden, and how this affects the extent of social dialogue on DM and union responses to it. It examines unions’ influence on diversity discourses and the implications of these responses for equality agendas. The research has contributed to knowledge and theory of DM and to the field of industrial relations by: applying the recursive DI approach to analysing how national contexts shape DM and vice versa; by combining theories of institutionalisation with Gumbrell-McCormick and Hyman’s (2013) conceptualisation of types of trade union power to reveal models of underlying mechanisms for when, where and why a social dialogue approach to DM is more likely; by analysing the impact of a social dialogue approach on DM; by providing empirical evidence for Gumbrell-McCormick and Hyman’s (2013) proposition that moral and discursive power, rather than structural, associational, organisational and institutional strength, are more important for unions in the ‘battle of ideas’. The research also demonstrates the value of the DI concepts of actors’ ‘background ideational’ and ‘foreground discursive’ abilities for critically evaluating unions’ responses to diversity management in a manner <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> both ethnocentrism and cultural relativism...|$|E
40|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} is {{an extremely}} successful and accurate physical theory, yet since its inception, it has been afflicted with numerous conceptual difficulties. The primary subject of this thesis is the theory of entropic quantum dynamics (EQD), <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> these conceptual problems by interpreting quantum theory from an informational perspective. We begin by reviewing probability theory {{as a means of}} rationally quantifying uncertainties. We then discuss how probabilities can be updated with the method of maximum entropy (ME). We then review some motivating difficulties in quantum mechanics before discussing Caticha's work in deriving quantum theory from the approach of entropic dynamics. After entropic dynamics is introduced, we develop the concepts of symmetries and transformations from an informational perspective. The primary result is the formulation of a symmetry condition that any transformation must satisfy in order to qualify as a symmetry in EQD. We then proceed to apply this condition to the extended Galilean transformation. This transformation is of interest as it exhibits features of both special and general relativity. The transformation yields a gravitational potential that arises from an equivalence of information. We conclude the thesis with a discussion of the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. We discuss the difficulties that arise in the standard quantum mechanical approach to measurement before developing our theory of entropic measurement. In entropic dynamics, position is the only observable. We show how a theory built on this one observable can account for the multitude of measurements present in quantum theory. Furthermore, we show that the Born rule need not be postulated, but can be derived in EQD. Finally, we show how the wave function can be updated by the ME method as the phase is constructed purely in terms of probabilities. Comment: Doctoral Thesi...|$|E
40|$|Following {{the attacks}} of 11 September 2001, the United Kingdom (UK) Government was the only state party to {{introduce}} new anti-terrorism legislation which required a formal derogation from its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). It then subsequently proposed further anti-terrorism measures. These either necessitate derogation once more or raise issues of compatibility with the ECHR. For derogation from human rights obligations, as outlined by Article 15, to be deemed justified, not only should a ‘war or other public emergency threatening {{the life of the}} nation’ exist but the measures taken should also be ‘strictly required by the exigencies of the situation’. This article analyses whether such justification existed and the affect on the right to liberty and security of the new legislation. Throughout, the comparative legal response taken in Spain is examined, on the basis that Spain’s geographical position and experience of terrorism is analogous to that of the UK. While the European Court affords a margin of appreciation to states when assessing potential human rights abuses, this similarity affords a chance to assess whether the UK’s situation was in any way unique, while also illustrating whether other options of dealing with the terrorist threat exist, which are less in conflict with the country’s human rights obligations. The measures introduced before 11 September 2001 (9 / 11) to deal with Basque separatism and the conflict in Northern Ireland, and then the approach taken afterwards, relating to pre-charge detention and the right to an effective defence, are scrutinized. Allowing that threats might differ in scale and immediacy, in a climate where anti-terrorism is very much at the forefront of states’ priorities it is essential to ensure that human rights continue to be respected, rather than sacrificed. The question throughout this article is whether the UK’s legislation is justified and proportionate, or whether certain measures stem less from the existence of an actual emergency and more from a politicised construal of risk <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> international obligations to allay public fears. While Spain’s treatment of suspected terrorists is in no way free from criticism, it is perhaps its attitude and outward dedication to full respect for internationally acknowledged human rights that forms a stark contrast to those of the UK...|$|E

The wine is put down in a whole bottleful, and it is strange and painful to observe the greed with which the gentleman in question <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> secure the last drop of his allotted half, and the scrupulousness with <b>which</b> he <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> taking the first drop of the other. This is partly {{explained by the fact}} that if he were to go over the mark - bang would go a tenpence. He is again armed with a book, but his best friends will learn with pain that he seems at this hour to have deserted the more serious studies of the morning. When last observed, he was studying with apparent zest the exploits of one Rocambole by the late Viscomte Ponson du Terrail. This work, originally of prodigious dimensions, he had cut into liths or thicknesses apparently for convenience of carriage.|$|R
40|$|Peer reviewedIn an {{interesting}} text that has survived {{as the result}} of one of their regular Friday meetings (congrégations), the pastors of Geneva officially declared their position on the sensitive issue of the community of goods. After close examination it is clear that Calvin’s own position on this matter is completely in line with the pastors’ declaration. In this article Calvin’s commentary and sermons on Acts 2 : 43 – 45, 4 : 32 – 37 and 5 : 1 – 6, in which he elaborates on his position, are investigated. During the Reformation these passages were deemed key texts regarding this issue. In his discussion of these passages, Calvin positions himself against the attitudes and actions of four groups, namely the Anabaptists, the rich (of Geneva), the poor, and the monks. These four groups, drawn from his own context, represent the extreme positions <b>which</b> Calvin <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid.</b> In order <b>to</b> find the via media between these extremes, Calvin identifies four important concepts in Scripture that shape his own view on this matter. These are love, order, ability and need. They are intricately connected and give Calvin’s position the balance he strived for...|$|R
40|$|The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo {{method is}} a {{computational}} tool for modelling rarefied flows. The Macroscopic Chemistry Method {{was developed to}} simplify the modelling of dissociation and recombination reactions in DSMC. The ability to understand and predict the behaviour of chemically reacting, rarefied flows is a critical aspect {{in the development of}} high altitude, high speed bodies such as re-entry craft, high altitude aircraft, space transport vehicles and missiles. Computational methods are an invaluable source of information when experimental techniques are difficult, costly or time-consuming. However, traditional methods of modelling chemical kinetics using DSMC suffer from a number of drawbacks. The Macroscopic Chemistry Method overcomes a number of these problems, but has previously only been applied to simulations of a single diatomic gas. The Macroscopic Chemistry Method (MCM) is extended to consider multiple species and multiple reaction sets, thermal non-equilibrium effects, trace species modelling, unsteady flows, vibrational state specific chemistry, electronic excitation, relaxation and ionization and coupled nonequilibrium radiation emission. The Macroscopic Method is described as a general DSMC modelling philosophy rather than as a single formulated method. That is, the flexibility and utility of the method are shown through examples of applying a macroscopic approach to a number of problems, and by highlighting instances where a macroscopic approach is useful or even necessary. The problems investigated include reservoir relaxation calculations, 1 -D shock, expansion and shock-expansion calculations, two-dimensional flows over a vertical step and through a cavity, and axis-symmetric flow about a sphere. The studies demonstrate that although MCM may often present a simplified approach as compared to traditional 2 ̆ 7 non-macroscopic 2 ̆ 7 methods, it does not necessarily lead to more approximate solutions. On the contrary, the ability of macroscopic methods to combine different models of physical processes with the most recent (verified) data means that they are particularly suited to simulate high altitude, rarefied flows. It is also shown that, like any model approach, the validity of the approximations employed must be justified for a particular problem. In general, macroscopic methods of varying complexity and accuracy may be implemented to model a specific physical process. Adoption of the Macroscopic Chemistry Method in DSMC has the potential to enhance the modelling of chemical kinetics, charged-particle effects and radiation in rarefied hypersonic flows. This capability may be attributed to the simplicity and flexibility which the macroscopic approach affords over methods <b>which</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the use of collective information. Macroscopic methods have already been employed to model weakly ionized flows. Their further application to model chemical kinetics and other processes would be useful for modelling and understanding the behaviour of objects in rarefied hypersonic flow-fields...|$|R
