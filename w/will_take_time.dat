25|$|Founder of Independent Fashion Blogger (IFB), Jennine Jacob, stated how thrilled {{she was to}} get the {{validation}} from high-end {{fashion designers}} (such as Proenza Schouler) that fashion blogging has an incredible impact on the fashion world. Imran Amed stated that there will always be designers and editors that will never fully wrap their head on the huge impact fashion blogging and social media has on the industry, but {{on the other side of}} the spectrum, there are numerous designers, editors, branders and writers that do understand and are “coming on board”.

25|$|Miralles, {{like many}} other postmodern architects, has a {{preference}} for piling on the motifs and ideas: upturned boats, keel shapes, deep window reveals like a castle, crow-steps, prow shapes, diagonal gutters, 'bamboo bundles' and above all the dark granite gun-shape that repeats as an ornamental motif at a huge scale. Everywhere broken silhouettes compete for attention, just like the alleyways next door. That's fine, and contextual, but it's quite a meal. As {{a result of the}} complexity, the parliament is really a kind of small city, with much too much to digest in one short three-hour sitting. The Scottish parliament <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> to judge: maybe not 50 years but three or four visits, long enough to absorb all the richness and get used to those jumpy black granite guns, the most arbitrary of several questionable ornaments.|$|E
25|$|Beyond {{this point}} the area is at present geologically less stable. This {{instability}} is presently {{in the course of}} being corrected with a circa £100M project co-ordinated by Telford & Wrekin District Council, repairs intended to safeguard the Ironbridge Gorge World Heritage site for the next 100 years, although these repairs are not designed to cope with the extra loads imposed by the reinstatement of the railway through the Gorge civil engineering consultants opine that these additional loads are insignificant in relation to those to be carried by the present design. At present a road occupies the route of the railway formation for a distance at Jackfield built to replace the original road damaged {{as a result of the}} 1954 land instability. At this point utility services for the area are carried on runners beside the road as the instability makes it impossible to maintain them underground. For all these reasons, reopening is not being actively pursued by the SVR itself, particularly since recovery from the effects of the 2007 floods damage <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>time.</b> The promoters recognise that investment for any extension will need to come from outside sources since the SVR feels any funds it has are required for improvements to existing visitor and staff facilities in order to achieve the standards expected nowadays.|$|E

500|$|While one set {{of critics}} and bloggers used the UCLA study to dismiss the {{argument}} raised in Carr's essay, another set took {{a closer look at}} the conclusions that could be drawn from the study concerning the effects of Internet usage. Among the reflections concerning the possible interpretations of the UCLA study were whether greater breadth of brain activity while using the Internet in comparison with reading a book improved or impaired the quality of a reading session; and whether the decision-making and complex reasoning skills that are apparently involved in Internet search, according to the study, suggest a high quality of thought or simply the use of puzzle solving skills. Thomas Claburn, in InformationWeek, observed that the study's findings regarding the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage were inconclusive and stated that [...] "it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> before it's clear whether we should mourn the old ways, celebrate the new, or learn to stop worrying and love the Net".|$|E
