25|$|Michael Schumacher {{started to}} {{maintain}} a 0.2-second lead over Häkkinen who began a challenge for the lead. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race so far on the third lap–a 1:25.861–to close the gap to Michael Schumacher to be one tenth of a second behind. Coulthard suffered a rear-suspension failure and spun off into the gravel trap at Priory corner causing him to retire on the same lap. Verstappen got ahead of Villeneuve and Alesi to take over ninth position on the fourth lap, whilst Fisichella went off the race track and drove through the gravel trap at Copse corner and rejoined behind Alonso on the same lap. Michael Schumacher lost control of his car at the entry to Copse corner allowing Häkkinen to take advantage and moved into the lead {{at the start of}} lap five. Häkkinen started to pull away from Michael Schumacher. Burti became the third retirement of the race when smoke billowed from his engine on lap six and oil was dropped on the track, causing the marshals to display a oil on track <b>warning</b> <b>flag.</b> As Häkkinen continued to extend his lead, Montoya had closed the gap to Michael Schumacher to be 1.6 seconds behind the Ferrari driver on lap ten. Villeneuve overtook Alesi at Stowe corner and moved into tenth position on lap eleven. By lap 15, Montoya had further closed the gap to Michael Schumacher and passed the Ferrari driver to take over second position as he drove down the start/finish straight heading towards Stowe corner. By lap 20, Häkkinen had a lead of 25.2 seconds over Montoya, who in turn was 4.5 seconds in front of Michael Schumacher and was drawing ahead of the Ferrari driver. Barrichello was a further 10.9 seconds behind his team-mate and was being caught by Ralf Schumacher in fifth.|$|E
500|$|The {{control box}} for the {{automatic}} pilot was {{recovered from the}} wreckage. [...] The control knob for its gyroscope was in the caged position and the CAGED <b>warning</b> <b>flag</b> was in view even though the control box carried a placard stating the gyro must be uncaged before takeoff. [...] The automatic pilot's speed valve unit was also recovered; it showed that the three valves were open in positions indicating the unit was operating {{at the time of}} the crash. [...] The investigation panel proposed that the automatic pilot might have been engaged at a height of about 400ft (120m) causing the aircraft to descend swiftly into the sea. Engagement could have occurred inadvertently when one of the pilots intended to select fuel cross-feed ON. The operating levers for fuel cross-feed and automatic pilot were the same shape, the same height above the cockpit floor, and about 12 inches (305mm) apart on the cockpit control console.|$|E
500|$|The first {{hurricane}} warning service {{was set up}} in the early 1870s from Cuba with the work of Father Benito Viñes, who served as director of the Meteorological Observatory of the Royal College of Belén. [...] He established a network of observation sites and developed the first method to forecast tropical cyclone movement, with the oldest known forecast made for a hurricane in late August 1873. He would give track details days in advance, based upon clouds which progress well in advance of hurricanes. His {{hurricane warning}} service in Cuba continued until his death on July 23, 1893. Within the United States, the public was dissatisfied with the Signal Corp forecasts after the Hurricane of 1875. The immediate response by the Signal Corp was the creation of the hurricane <b>warning</b> <b>flag,</b> a pair of red flags ten by eight feet each in size, inset with black rectangles. Beginning on October 1, 1875, hurricane warning flags were hoisted in areas where hurricane warnings were in effect, and illuminated at night.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel rule-based expert system application that automatically runs a set of theoretical models used to simulate test procedures for ultrasonic testing methods in nondestructive evaluation and interprets their results. Theoretical modeling is an essential tool in verifying that the test procedures are fit for their intended purpose of defect detection. Four validated models are available to simulate theoretical ultrasonic flaw modeling scenarios. Under certain conditions, the models may break down and produce <b>warning</b> <b>flags</b> indicating that results may not be considered accurate. A considerable level of expertise in the theoretical background of the models is required to interpret these flags. The expert system addresses any <b>warning</b> <b>flags</b> encountered by adjusting the original simulation parameters and rerunning the test in order to produce a valid simulation. Warning flags are addressed by a rule file, which contains formal rules developed from knowledge-elicitation sessions with suitably qualified engineers. The rule file represents the action an engineer would adopt to counter highlighted <b>warning</b> <b>flags.</b> A description of the system and rule-base design is given as well as how the system and its performance were validated...|$|R
40|$|An Expert System is {{currently}} under development, which will assist an NDE engineer to obtain valid solutions of the ultrasonic response from a flaw, utilising {{one of four}} theoretical modelling programs. Warning flags are highlighted when the model is used in a manner which may result in invalid results. A level of expertise in the theoretical background of the models is required to interpret these flags. It is possible to develop a series of coded rules which represent the processes a suitably qualified engineer would adopt to address highlighted <b>warning</b> <b>flags.</b> These coded rules can then be embedded within an expert system. This paper describes {{the architecture of the}} expert system and how various rules are activated to address <b>warning</b> <b>flags...</b>|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, Blücher {{had been}} heavily damaged; her speed {{had dropped to}} , and her {{steering}} gear was jammed. Beatty ordered Indomitable to attack her at 10:48 a.m. Six minutes later, he spotted {{what he thought was}} a submarine periscope on the starboard bow and ordered an immediate 90° turn to port to avoid the submarine, although the submarine <b>warning</b> <b>flag</b> was not raised because most of Lions signal halyards had been shot away. Soon afterwards Lion lost her remaining dynamo to the rising water, which knocked out all remaining light and power. At 11:02, Beatty had flags hoisted signalling [...] "course north-east", to bring his ships back to their pursuit of Hipper, and [...] "attack the rear of the enemy". Rear-Admiral Sir Gordon Moore, temporarily commanding the squadron from , thought that the signals meant to attack Blücher, which was about [...] to the north-east, and ordered the four other battlecruisers away from the pursuit of Hipper's main force to engage. Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read in the smoke and haze.|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte {{remained}} in the same division after an American Hockey League realignment {{in the summer of}} 2013, but it was renamed from the South Division to the West Division. The Checkers unveiled new uniforms for the 2013–14 season, preserving the team's logo and its red, black and white colors, but making several design changes including the removal of a hurricane <b>warning</b> <b>flag</b> strip, new fonts for the letters and numbers, and a greater distinction between the home red and away white uniforms. Mark Binetti, who had been Charlotte's assistant broadcaster, departed from the team to work for the Central Hockey League's Rapid City Rush. The Checkers underwent several roster changes in the off season, retaining only two skaters who finished in the team's top ten in scoring from the previous year: forwards Chris Terry and Zach Boychuk. As a result, coach Jeff Daniels said the team would have to focus more on crashing the net and scoring [...] "dirty goals".|$|E
60|$|Euphorion himself, if a {{particular}} omission of acknowledgment were {{brought home to}} him, would probably take a narrower ground of explanation. It was a lapse of memory; or it did not occur to him as necessary in this case to mention a name, the source being well known--or (since this seems usually {{to act as a}} strong reason for mention) he rather abstained from adducing the name because it might injure the excellent matter advanced, just as an obscure trade-mark casts discredit on a good commodity, and even on the retailer who has furnished himself from a quarter not likely to be esteemed first-rate. No doubt this last is a genuine and frequent reason for the non-acknowledgment of indebtedness to what one may call impersonal as well as personal sources: even an American editor of school classics whose own English could not pass for more than a syntactical shoddy of the cheapest sort, felt it unfavourable to his reputation for sound learning that he should be obliged to the Penny Cyclopaedia, and disguised his references to it under contractions in which Us. Knowl.. took the place of the low word Penny. Works of this convenient stamp, easily obtained and well nourished with matter, are felt to be like rich but unfashionable relations who are visited and received in privacy, and whose capital is used or inherited without any ostentatious insistance on their names and places of abode. As to memory, it is known that this frail faculty naturally lets drop the facts which are less flattering to our self-love--when it does not retain them carefully as subjects not to be approached, marshy spots with a <b>warning</b> <b>flag</b> over them. But it is always interesting to bring forward eminent names, such as Patricius or Scaliger, Euler or Lagrange, Bopp or Humboldt. To know exactly what has been drawn from them is erudition and heightens our own influence, which seems advantageous to mankind; whereas to cite an author whose ideas may pass as higher currency under our own signature can have no object except the contradictory one of throwing the illumination over his figure when {{it is important to be}} seen oneself. All these reasons must weigh considerably with those speculative persons who have to ask themselves whether or not Universal Utilitarianism requires that in the particular instance before them they should injure a man who has been of service to them, and rob a fellow-workman of the credit which is due to him.|$|E

The ABIA system&# 039;s architecture was developed to allow real-time avoidance of safety-critical flight conditions and fast recovery of the required navigation performance in case of GNSS data losses. In more detail, our novel ABIA system addresses all four cornerstones of GNSS integrity augmentation in mission- and safety-critical avionics applications: prediction (caution flags), avoidance (optimal flight path guidance), reaction (<b>warning</b> <b>flags)</b> and correction (recovery flight path guidance). Part 1 (Sabatini et al., 2012) presented the ABIA concept, architecture and key mathematical models used to describe GNSS integrity issues in aircraft applications.

However, during Friday practice, the race stewards encountered a technical glitch in the telemetry system that controlled the availability of DRS, meaning that the system would be completely unrestricted. This forced the stewards to rely on drivers to use the system honestly, threatening penalties to any driver caught using DRS outside the designated areas.

40|$|White sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are apex predators {{that play}} an {{important}} role in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. However, despite both their ecological importance and threatened conservation status this species is still subject to lethal control to reduce the risks of predation for recreational water users. The Shark Spotter program, pioneered in False Bay, South Africa, proposes a non-lethal alternative to reducing predation risk. This program aims to balance the needs of people with white shark conservation by actively reducing conflict between recreational water users and sharks. In this study I establish the extent of spatial overlap between white sharks and water users at two popular recreational beaches in False Bay (Fish Hoek and Muizenberg), and investigate how shark sightings (accompanied by <b>warning</b> <b>flags</b> and/or a siren) as well as attacks influence water use patterns amongst bathers, surfers and paddlers. In the period from 2006 to 2012, the total number of shark sightings recorded was 531 at Muizenberg and 322 at Fish Hoek, with a notable increase in sightings at both beaches in recent years. Shark sightings were rare in winter increasing into the spring and summer months when recreational use of the inshore was highest. Daily shark sightings peaked at midday to late afternoon at both beaches, coinciding with peak numbers of water users. The response of water users to warnings of shark presence by the Shark Spotters was only found to be significant in cases where the siren was sounded by the shark spotters, and in the absence of a siren <b>warning</b> <b>flags</b> had little impact on average numbers of water users. The occurrence of a fatal shark attack was found to a) increase response of water users to auditory warnings (when the siren is sounded) but not visual <b>warnings</b> (<b>warning</b> <b>flags</b> unaccompanied by a siren); and b) reduce the average number of water users present at both beaches for at least three months following the fatal incident. Annual averages of water users at Muizenberg beach also reflected this pattern, with a general reduction in water use in years with attacks compared to those without. These findings indicate that the Shark Spotter program is effective in mitigating conflict between water users and white sharks through auditory warnings and subsequent beach clearing in the event of a shark sighting; however the lack of response by water users in the absence of a siren and after long periods without an attack remains a challenge to the effectiveness of the program. The large spatial overlap between white sharks and water users, as well as the increasing number of shark sightings at both beaches, emphasises the need for continuous revision and improvement of mitigation strategies to prevent conflict between white sharks and water users in False Bay...|$|R
