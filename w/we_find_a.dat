If we heat up the system without introducing any preference for quarks over antiquarks, this corresponds to moving vertically upwards along the T axis.

Then around T=150MeV there is a crossover to the quark gluon plasma: thermal fluctuations break up the pions, and <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> gas of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, as well as lighter particles such as photons, electrons, positrons, etc. Following this path corresponds to travelling far back in time (so to say), {{to the state of}} the universe shortly after the big bang (where there was a very tiny preference for quarks over antiquarks).|$|E

This obvious absurdity has been interpreted by Neville Barker Cryer as a coded reference to Alcuin of York, possibly from a misunderstanding of one of his poems. In Carmen XXVI is the line, [...] "Et Nemias Greco infundat sua poculo Baccho", expressing the wish that Nemias should fill Alcuin's cup with Greek wine. Nemias, or Nehemias, was Alcuin's code name for Eberhard, Charlemagne's cupbearer.
