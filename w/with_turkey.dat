5|$|Russia saw the Black Sea {{coast and}} the border <b>with</b> <b>Turkey</b> as {{invaluable}} strategic attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military {{presence on the}} Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea. Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended {{as a tool to}} retain a grip on Georgia.|$|E

5|$|The throne {{remained}} vacant and {{the legislative}} elections of 1920 {{turned into an}} open conflict between the Venizelists, who favored republicanism, and the supporters of the ex-King Constantine. On 14 November 1920, with the war <b>with</b> <b>Turkey</b> dragging on, the monarchists won, and Dimitrios Rallis became prime minister; Venizelos (who lost his own parliamentary seat) chose to leave Greece in self-exile. Rallis asked Queen Olga to become regent until Constantine's return.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, World War I {{began when}} {{alliance}} obligations {{arising from the}} war between Serbia and Austria-Hungary brought Germany and Russia to war, while Germany's invasion of Belgium directly triggered Britain's entry. After a series of military events and political intrigues, Russia declared war on Turkey in November. Turkey then joined the Central Powers in fighting the Entente Powers. In response to the war with Russia and Britain, and further motivated by its alliance <b>with</b> <b>Turkey,</b> Germany accelerated its plans to weaken its enemies by targeting their colonial empires, including Russia in Turkestan and Britain in India, using political agitation.|$|E

5|$|Nolan {{returned}} to the British forces to join the Light Division at Devna as aide-de-camp to Airey. The Royal Navy had control over the Black Sea, and with a Russian treaty <b>with</b> <b>Turkey</b> and Austria, the enemy forces were withdrawing from Eastern Europe. Despite this favourable outcome, the British government wished {{to negotiate with the}} Russians from a strong position. The decision was taken to invade the Crimea itself, with the objective of destroying or capturing the Russian naval base at Sevastopol. Raglan personally considered this unrealistic – British forces knew little about the region, the port's defences, or the strength of the Russian military, with estimates of troop numbers varying between 45,000 and 140,000. It was also quite a distance away, causing logistical difficulties.|$|E

Ark Royal was transferred to Piraeus in October and was still there when the Armistice of Mudros <b>with</b> <b>Turkey</b> was signed on 31 October. The ship joined the Allied fleet that occupied Constantinople after the surrender.|$|E
5|$|A year later, he {{was elected}} to the Netherlands' {{national}} parliament, but his first four years in parliament drew little attention. However, his appointment in 2002 as a public spokesman for the VVD led Wilders to become more well known for his outspoken criticism of Islamic extremism. Tensions immediately developed within the party, as Wilders found himself to be to the right of most members, and challenged the party line in his public statements. He was expelled from the VVD parliamentary party, and in September 2004, Wilders left the VVD, having been a member since 1989, to form his own political party, Groep Wilders, later renamed the Party for Freedom. The crunch issue with the VVD party line was about his refusal to endorse the party's position that European Union accession negotiations must be started <b>with</b> <b>Turkey.</b>|$|E

5|$|Almost {{two years}} after the Republic of Armenia was established, on 23 April 1920, the United States officially {{recognized}} it. Its frontiers were to be determined later. On 26 April 1920, the Supreme Council of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers in Paris (British Prime Minister Lloyd George, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and Italian Prime Minister Francesco Saverio Nitti) requested that the United States accept the mandate over Armenia and to make an Arbitral Decision to determine the boundaries of Armenia <b>with</b> <b>Turkey.</b> President Woodrow Wilson agreed to act as arbitrator and draw a mutually acceptable border between the two nations. In July 1920, the US State Department founded the Committee upon the Arbitration of the Boundary between Turkey and Armenia, headed by William Westermann. The Treaty of Sèvres was signed on 10 August 1920. On 28 September 1920, the Committee submitted a report that defined the border between Armenia and Turkey. It guaranteed access to the Mediterranean sea for Armenia via Trebizond and proclaimed Turkey's border regions demilitarization frontier line.|$|E
5|$|From late February to mid-March, the 2nd New Zealand Division was {{transferred}} to Syria. The Allied high command was concerned that the Middle East was at risk from an invasion by the Germans and the New Zealanders {{were part of the}} force tasked with blocking their likely route from the Caucasus. The 25th Battalion was stationed close to the border <b>with</b> <b>Turkey,</b> near the town of Idlib, and its platoons manned frontier posts for several weeks. The battalion later shifted to the Djedeide fortress area where it would prepare defences. However, following the attack on the 8th Army's Gazala Line by Panzer Army Africa, the 2nd New Zealand Division was recalled to Egypt. By the end of June, the 25th Battalion, {{along with the rest of}} the 6th Brigade, was setting up camp in the Alamein area.|$|E
5|$|In Turkey and Persia, {{nationalist}} {{work had}} begun by 1909, {{under the leadership}} of Sardar Ajit Singh and Sufi Amba Prasad. Reports from 1910 indicate that Germany was already contemplating efforts to threaten India through Turkey, Persia, and Afghanistan. Germany had built close diplomatic and economic relationships <b>with</b> <b>Turkey</b> and Persia from the late 19th century. Von Oppenheim had mapped Turkey and Persia while working as a secret agent. The Kaiser toured Constantinople, Damascus, and Jerusalem in 1898 to bolster the Turkish relationship and to portray solidarity with Islam, a religion professed by millions of subjects of the British Empire in India and elsewhere. Referring to the Kaiser as Haji Wilhelm, the Intelligence Bureau for the East spread propaganda throughout the region, fostering rumours that the Kaiser had converted to Islam following a secret trip to Mecca and portraying him as a saviour of Islam.|$|E

5|$|The ship saw limited action during World War I. Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I {{opted to}} remain neutral until October 1916, when {{pressure}} from the Triple Entente forced him to abdicate {{in favor of a}} pro-Entente government. For the remainder of the war, Lemnos operated solely as a harbor defense ship. In the aftermath of World War I, she saw service during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and the Greco-Turkish War of 19191922. During the war <b>with</b> <b>Turkey,</b> Lemnos supported Greek landings in Turkey and participated in the final Greek sea-borne withdrawal in 1922. She remained in service until 1932, when she was used as a barracks ship and subsequently disarmed. During the German invasion of Greece in 1941, she and her sister were sunk in Salamis by German Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers. The two ships were ultimately raised and broken up for scrap {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
