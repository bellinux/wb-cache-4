5|$|Delichon is an Old World genus {{with all}} three species {{breeding}} only in the Northern Hemisphere. The common house martin is a widespread migrant breeder across Europe, north Africa and all northern temperate Asia to Kamchatka. Its western subspecies D.u.urbicum <b>winters</b> <b>in</b> tropical Africa, and eastern D.u.lagopodum moves to southern China and Southeast Asia. The Asian house martin breeds further south than common house martin {{in the mountains of}} central and eastern Asia; its nominate subspecies <b>winters</b> <b>in</b> Southeast Asia, but the races breeding in the Himalayan and Taiwan may just move from the high mountains to lower altitudes. The Nepal house martin is resident in the mountains of southern Asia.|$|E

5|$|The species breeds in North America and <b>winters</b> <b>in</b> the Caribbean. Some {{studies have}} {{observed}} {{significant differences in}} terms of migratory behavior and plumage color between northern and southern populations within the breeding range. The northern population mainly <b>winters</b> <b>in</b> the western Caribbean (Cuba and Jamaica) while the southern population usually spends the winter on eastern islands (Hispaniola and Puerto Rico). Moreover, males in the southern population have darker plumage {{than those in the}} northern population. These differences have led biologists to consider them as separate subspecies. However, a recent study in the United States reveals no significant genetic differentiation between northern (samples from Michigan, New Hampshire and New York states) and southern populations (sample from North Carolina). The study results actually show a recent population expansion from a single glacial refugium, therefore the current populations are homogeneous in terms of genetics. The differentiation that is observed between the northern and southern populations should have occurred quite recently.|$|E

The creek's main tributaries include Hemlock Creek, Little Fishing Creek, Green Creek, Huntington Creek, West Branch Fishing Creek, and East Branch Fishing Creek.|$|E

5|$|Rùm is {{also noted}} for its bird life. The {{population}} of 70,000 Manx shearwaters {{is one of the}} largest breeding colonies in the world. These migrating birds spend their <b>winters</b> <b>in</b> the South Atlantic off Brazil, and return to Rùm every summer to breed in underground burrows high in the Cuillin Hills. White-tailed sea eagles were exterminated on the island by 1912 and later became extinct in Scotland.

5|$|The Swiss {{climate is}} {{generally}} temperate, but can vary greatly between the localities, from glacial {{conditions on the}} mountaintops to the often pleasant near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. There are some valley areas {{in the southern part}} of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing. The less humid <b>winters</b> <b>in</b> the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion, during these periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake winters {{mainly in}} Africa, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and central Tanzania south to eastern South Africa.

Most of the South African population of about 2,000 birds occurs in KwaZulu-Natal and the former Transvaal Province, and numbers elsewhere in Africa are uncertain. There are several nineteenth-century records, when populations were much higher than now, of birds being seen in western Europe, mainly Britain and Ireland, between December and February.|$|E
