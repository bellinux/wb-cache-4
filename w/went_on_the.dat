50|$|A few signs always <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{first or}} last {{consonant}} of a word. This {{may have been}} for musical reasons, {{or it may be}} to distinguish them from other accents of similar shape. For example, pashta, which <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last consonant, otherwise looks like qadma, which <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stressed syllable.|$|R
50|$|The {{stress in}} this tense <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{syllable}} before the ending, e.g. kárdam, geréftam 'I took'. But in a compound verb, <b>the</b> stress <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> word before <b>the</b> verb, e.g. <b>on</b> kār in kār kardam 'I worked'.|$|R

5|$|After the World Series championship, Smith and the Cardinals {{agreed on}} a new {{contract}} in January 1983 that paid Smith $1 million per year. Smith was voted in as the National League's starting shortstop in the All-Star Game {{for the first time}} in 1983, and at season's end won a fourth consecutive Gold Glove Award. During July of the 1984 season, Smith <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> disabled list with a broken wrist after being hit by a pitch during a game against the Padres.

5|$|Although {{they had}} {{initially}} {{been told that}} they would be withdrawn from the front within 48 hours, the strategic situation called that they remained at the front holding the ground on the eastern flank. In late July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. Nevertheless, little progress was made, and, after a brief move which saw No. 6 Commando advance to Bavent, they <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defensive again.|$|E
5|$|As David Halberstam {{put it in}} {{his book}} Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made,Michael Jordan and David Falk helped make each other, and each profited to a {{remarkable}} degree from their special collaboration. It is true that Michael Jordan was the person who in the end actually did the deeds, <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> court and hit the final jump shot again and again, but {{it is also true that}} David Falk helped revolutionize the process of representing a basketball player, going into a team sport and creating the idea of the individual player as a commercial superstar.|$|E
5|$|As time <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> North Korean {{government}} {{became more}} aggressive, and skirmishes between {{troops of the}} North and South became common. UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and prevent it from escalating. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293, passed October 21, 1949, recognized only South Korea's government as legal. For its part, North Korea issued inflammatory responses to the UN denying the legality of UN activities in Korea and saying it would drive the UN out of the country.|$|E

5|$|By contrast, the Byzantine {{position}} in Southern Italy was gradually consolidated {{so that by}} 873 Bari was once again under Byzantine rule, and most of Southern Italy would remain in the Empire for the next 200 years. On the more important eastern front, the Empire rebuilt its defences and <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> offensive. The Paulicians were defeated and their capital of Tephrike (Divrigi) taken, while the offensive against the Abbasid Caliphate began with the recapture of Samosata.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{then began}} to plan to {{completely}} conquer Greece, but died in 486 BC and responsibility for the conquest passed to his son Xerxes. In 480 BC, Xerxes personally led the second Persian invasion of Greece {{with one of the}} largest ancient armies ever assembled. Victory over the allied Greek states at the famous Battle of Thermopylae allowed the Persians to torch an evacuated Athens and overrun most of Greece. However, while seeking to destroy the combined Greek fleet, the Persians suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of Salamis. The following year, the confederated Greeks <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> offensive, defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea, and ending the invasion of Greece.|$|E

5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E
