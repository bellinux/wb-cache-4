500|$|Cooney {{proposed}} that public television, {{even though it}} had a poor track record in attracting inner-city audiences, could be used {{to improve the quality of}} children's programming. [...] She suggested using the television medium's [...] "most engaging traits", including high production values, sophisticated writing, and quality film and animation, to reach the largest audience possible. [...] In the words of critic Peter Hellman, [...] "If [...] could recite Budweiser jingles from TV, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> them a program that would teach the ABCs and simple number concepts?" [...] Cooney wanted to create a program that would spread values favoring education to nonviewers—including their parents and older siblings, who tended to control the television set. [...] To this end, she suggested that humor directed toward adults be included, which, as Lesser reported, [...] "may turn out to be a pretty good system in forcing the young child to stretch to understand programs designed for older audiences". [...] Cooney also believed cultural references and guest appearances by celebrities would encourage parents and older siblings to watch the show together.|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street, {{from its}} {{earliest}} {{planning and development}} stages before its debut on PBS in 1969, has used music as a teaching tool. [...] The show's creators recognized that children responded to commercial jingles, so they wanted to use their characteristics, which included repetition, clever visuals, brevity, and clarity, in what they presented to young viewers. [...] For {{the first time in}} children's television, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum. The show's creators understood that music and sound effects provided a direct means of teaching children basic skills, and that children learned more effectively when new material was accompanied by a song. [...] Co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney observed in her proposal for the new show, written in 1967, that children had an [...] "affinity for commercial jingles", so many of the show's songs were constructed like television ads. [...] Critic Peter Hellman put it this way: [...] "If [...] could recite Budweiser jingles from TV, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> them a program that would teach the ABCs and simple number concepts?" ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{used to be}} {{only one}} RS model in {{production}} at a time, but recently Audi has revised its policies and decided to make more than one RS model at a time, claiming that [...] "customers want them, then <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> it to them". However, RS models are not available in all markets; for instance the North American market only has the RS7 available and not the RS6 Avant.|$|E
5000|$|We {{learn that}} she's [...] "so tired and borred of masterbating". <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> just <b>give</b> it a break, Tray? ... This {{exhibition}} is an exhausting bender, careening from highs to lows. The lows are bad. Somehow Emin wouldn't be any good if they weren't.|$|R
6000|$|He made no {{movement}} to arrest my departure. Suddenly I turned towards him. <b>Why</b> should I <b>not</b> <b>give</b> him {{the benefit of}} this one chance! ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{variation}} {{of this story}} is that Kallu Kumhar was given the task of carving the deities in a dream, but instead of carving images of all the gods, he carved one last image of himself, making it one short of a crore — a lesson, the locals say, on <b>why</b> <b>not</b> to <b>give</b> in to ahankara, or pride.|$|R
2500|$|In the San Francisco Chronicle, Walter Addiego stated, [...] "I {{fought hard}} against the emotionalism of In America [...] [...] [...] but I lost. There's no {{questioning}} the director's ability to wring moving moments from potentially sentimental and decidedly familiar material: the story of penniless immigrants {{trying to make it}} in Manhattan. It got to me. I'm still trying to decide whether I was won over or worn down— but <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> Sheridan the benefit of the doubt? [...] [...] [...] [...] is clearly drawing on deep personal reserves for this picture, and despite a few sequences when the creative hand seems intrusive, does well by his subject. When you see a director going for that lump-in-the-throat mood, instinct takes over and you want to dig in your heels. Sometimes it's best just to let yourself be swept away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes--I {{meant it}} as a citation," [...] blandly replied Fitzpiers. [...] "Well, then, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> me a very {{little bit of}} your heart again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on a bit! What is {{the sense}} of sending us into your camp when we are like to die? <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> us a show for our lives?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But before I go," [...] I said, [...] "tell me this: <b>Why</b> did she <b>not</b> send me some {{word from}} Lisbon? <b>Why</b> did she <b>not</b> <b>give</b> Captain Stearns {{a line on}} a piece of paper or some message?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> {{would you}} <b>not</b> <b>give</b> me the {{information}} I {{want in the}} house. The people you saw there are as much interested in it as I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I murdered her," [...] screamed {{the miserable}} woman, [...] "I killed her with fright. <b>Why</b> did she <b>not</b> <b>give</b> me the money? ’Twas {{no use to}} her. Ah! Look there!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Anxious glances {{meet one}} another in consultation. More than one kindly heart beats beneath these ragged doublets. Bah! the man is to hang to-morrow, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> {{pleasure}} to a dying man? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{promised me}} nothing but good," [...] said Benita {{with a little}} smile. [...] "Though I don't see how it can happen. But if you dislike the thing, father, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> it up and try to escape?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{could there}} be a better time," [...] he argued. [...] "You have {{naturally}} a gathering of clergy--people ought to be liberal on such an occasion, and, as Cocksmoor is provided for, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> the benefit to the missions, in their crying need!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The soundtrack for {{the film}} was {{released}} on August 22, 2006. Allmusic gave the album three out of five, stating [...] "What is here is imaginative, creative, and head-scratchingly cool. While it's a very tacky and overly obvious thing indeed to end with the Jefferson Starship tune [...] "Miracles" [...] (<b>why</b> <b>not</b> just <b>give</b> away the ending, huh?), this set is pretty much unassailable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{she went}} on, waving him back, [...] "now I know <b>why</b> I would <b>not</b> <b>give</b> in {{to you when}} you wanted me to be Stroke's wife. I was afraid you were masterful!" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Why</b> was {{evidence}} <b>not</b> <b>given</b> by the source itself? Reasons could include {{the death of}} the witness, a missing witness, poor health of the witness, or other unavailability. This factor is less vague than the others.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have! I tell you, Sigsbee, you've {{solved the}} whole thing. Archie's such a bully good fellow, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> him a benefit? Why {{not let him}} win this championship? You aren't {{going to tell me}} that you care whether you win a tin medal or not?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{aim at the}} Church, I believe?" [...] said Uncle Joe. [...] "If you {{are such}} a scholar as to pitch yer hopes so high as that, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> us a {{specimen}} of your scholarship? Canst say the Creed in Latin, man? That was how they once put it to a chap down in my country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't seem to me," [...] I said, [...] "to be {{anything}} else. You talk like a tadpole. Haven't you any other interest in life? What about home, and patriotism, and Shakespeare--all {{those sort of}} things? <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> it a square meal, and silence it {{for an hour or}} two; leave yourself free to think of something else." ...|$|E
50|$|As a reputed part of Pakistani Media, under immense President Ship of Sultana Siddiqui, on 12 February 2013 here at Hum Network head office, General Manager Public {{relations}} and publications Shanaz Ramzi virtuously announced First Hum Awards {{in a press}} consultation consisted of selected journalists of Pakistani media industry. Shanaz Ramzi started her words in a very enthusiastic tone and blissful mood, giving crispy comments to late comers. For a very elongated time Hum TV has been noticing that Pakistani talent is getting international sustain so <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>giving</b> it acknowledgment and glory all around the globe because Hum believes that awards work like energy drinks for an artist. The sole motive of Hum Awards is to give tribute to artists with them for eight years and especially to hearten and motivate those projects that were on aired from January 2012 to December 2012.|$|R

6000|$|... "So far I understand," [...] said I. [...] "The corpse I {{have just}} seen in the {{outhouse}} is the corpse of the man whom you found dead outside your gate. Now tell me <b>why</b> you have <b>not</b> <b>given</b> the remains decent burial." ...|$|R
6000|$|She had {{leaned back}} with closed eyes. A wave of {{exhaustion}} had swept over her. She listened in a dull dream. She felt beaten. They were {{too strong for}} her. There were too many of them. What did it matter? <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> in, and end it all and win peace? That was all she wanted--peace now. What did it all matter? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my {{dear old}} soul," [...] said Freddie, {{clutching}} the railing for moral support, [...] "it is something. It must be! You might not think it, {{to look at}} me, but I'm really rather a dashed shrewd chap, and I can see there's something up. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> me the jolly old scenario {{and see if we}} can't do something?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody {{objects to}} your having it all your own way," [...] {{retorted}} Victor, somewhat testily, [...] "but {{why should you}} be so secret about it? <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> a fellow some sort of idea what your plan is, so that, if we can't have the pleasure of helping you, we may at least enjoy the comfort of thinking about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ans. Deep reproof! but <b>why</b> did you <b>not</b> shew me my evil in thus calling it, when {{opposed to}} the substance, and the thing signified?

6000|$|Seth laughed heartily at this conceit, {{and then}} bethinking himself {{that there was}} no reason <b>why</b> he should <b>not</b> <b>give</b> the men's boots an extra polish, brought his outfit from the chamber above, {{although}} Jerry Walters insisted strongly that he should sit still [...] "and visit with 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘A very {{fortunate}} circumstance for me!’ said I. ‘At this rate {{we shall see}} {{a good deal of}} each other, going the same way; and, now I come to think of it, <b>why</b> should you <b>not</b> <b>give</b> me a cast? There is room beside you on the bench.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|Last of October.--Now mellow, crisp, Autumn days, bright {{moonlight}} nights, {{and gathering}} the corn--"cutting up," [...] as the farmers call it.

6000|$|He had {{stretched}} his legs like compasses,--and {{the way he}} grasped his gown-wings seemed to turn him {{to a pair of}} scales. His lowering smile embraced the room, deprecating strong expressions. [...] "After all," [...] he seemed to say, [...] "we are men of the world; we know there 's not very much in anything. This is the modern spirit; <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> it a look in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, when Twing, {{a week or}} two later, {{suggested}} that he might sing the same song as a solo at a certain performance to be given by the school children in aid of a local charity, she drily intimated that it was hardly of a character to suit the entertainment. [...] "But," [...] she added, more gently, [...] "you recite so well; <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> a recitation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{matter is}} {{one which is}} being dealt with by our secret service department," [...] Fenn replied, [...] "but I see no reason <b>why</b> I should <b>not</b> <b>give</b> you all {{reasonable}} information.

6000|$|... "Well, for the rest. If {{they like}} to offer their money, well and good, the better for them; but <b>why</b> must they <b>not</b> <b>give</b> it to Cocksmoor--but for that unnatural {{butterfly}} of Blanche's, with black pins for horns, that they will go and sell at an extortionate rate." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Painter laughed. [...] "I cannot soar to your heights," [...] he said. [...] "Frankly speaking, it is {{myself that}} chiefly appeals to me. <b>Why</b> <b>not?</b> I <b>give</b> the world Beauty, {{and in return}} what does it give me? This dingy restaurant, where I eat ill-flavoured food off hideous platters, a foul garret giving on to chimney-pots. After long years of ill-requited labour I may--as others have before me--come into my kingdom: possess my studio in the Champs Elysees, my fine house at Neuilly; but the {{prospect}} of the intervening period, I confess, appals me." ...|$|R
