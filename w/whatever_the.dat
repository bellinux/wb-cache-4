5|$|<b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> {{nature of}} their relationship, Domitian seems to have {{displayed}} little sympathy when his brother lay dying, instead making for the Praetorian camp where he was proclaimed emperor.

5|$|As King of the Isles, Lǫgmaðr faced {{significant}} {{opposition from}} factions supporting his younger brothers, Haraldr and Óláfr. At some point, the Islesmen {{are reported to}} have petitioned Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster to select a temporary ruler in the region. This act may have been initiated {{on behalf of a}} faction supporting Óláfr. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> case, Ua Briain responded by placing an Uí Briain relative upon the throne. The Uí Briain interlopers, however, do not appear to have been well received; and were evidently ejected by the Islesmen, perhaps led by supporters of Lǫgmaðr himself.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, streams flowed from {{highlands}} in central Arizona north and across what is today the western Grand Canyon, possibly feeding a larger river. The {{mechanism by which}} the ancestral Lower Colorado River captured this drainage and the drainage from {{much of the rest}} of the Colorado Plateau is not known. Possible explanations include headward erosion or a broken natural dam of a lake or river. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> cause, the Lower Colorado probably captured the landlocked Upper Colorado somewhere west of the Kaibab Uplift. The much larger drainage area and yet steeper stream gradient helped to further accelerate downcutting.|$|E

The circumstances surrounding Domnall's accession are uncertain.

5|$|During the Palladian revival {{period in}} Ireland, even quite modest mansions were {{cast in a}} neo-Palladian mould. Palladian {{architecture}} in Ireland subtly differs from that in England. While adhering as in other countries to the basic ideals of Palladio, it is often truer to them – perhaps because it was often designed by architects who had come directly from mainland Europe, and therefore were not influenced by the evolution that Palladianism was undergoing in Britain. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> reason, Palladianism still had to be adapted for the wetter, colder weather.|$|E
5|$|Faulty {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly {{responsible for the}} failure of Adlertag. While the gap between the British and Germans was not yet wide in this regard, the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence.

The impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain is a matter of dispute, with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly accurate picture of German order of battle deployments.|$|E

5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only says {{that he has}} {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> case, the wording of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance.

5|$|Lochlann, {{originally}} Laithlinn or Lothlend, {{the land}} where Amlaíb's father was king, is often identified with Norway, {{but it is not}} universally accepted that it had such a meaning in early times.
