5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the {{resolution}} of independence, Congress turned its attention to the committee's draft of the declaration. Over several days of debate, they made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text and, on July 4, 1776, the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Declaration of Independence was approved and sent to the printer for publication.|$|E

5|$|George {{objected to}} the anti-Catholic <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Accession Declaration {{that he would be}} {{required}} to make at the opening of his first parliament. He made it known that he would refuse to open parliament unless it was changed. As a result, the Accession Declaration Act 1910 shortened the declaration and removed the most offensive phrases.|$|E
5|$|The <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{declaration}} {{was thus}} {{incorporated into the}} British Mandate for Palestine, a legal instrument that created Mandatory Palestine with an explicit purpose of putting the declaration into effect and was finally formalized in September,1923. Unlike the declaration itself, the Mandate was legally binding on the British government.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} {{consistency}} in Freemasonry. Because each Masonic jurisdiction is independent, each sets its own procedures.

50|$|Aircraft {{and ground}} radios that employ HAVE QUICK must be {{initialized}} with accurate Time Of Day (TOD) (usually from a GPS receiver), a <b>Word</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> Day (WOD), and a NET number (providing mode selection and multiple networks to use <b>the</b> same <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day). A <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{day is a}} transmission security variable that consists of six segments of six digits each. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day is loaded into the radio or its control unit to key the HAVE QUICK system to the proper hopping pattern, rate, and dwell time. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, time <b>of</b> day and net number are input to a cryptographic pseudorandom number generator that controls the frequency changes.|$|R

5|$|Various patents {{have existed}} {{on the game}} of Monopoly and its predecessors, such as The Landlord's Game, but all have now expired. The {{specific}} graphics of the game board, cards, and pieces are protected by copyright law and trademark law, as is the specific <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's rules.|$|E
5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only says {{that he has}} {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, actor James Garner claimed {{responsibility}} for the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slogan during an interview with Playboy magazine. Garner, who narrated the original commercial, stated that his first action ever to be captured on film was to misread the line that had been provided to him. However, as noted above, the advertisements first appeared in print before their debut on television, which cast doubt on Garner's claim.|$|E

50|$|Oxford University Press, {{which publishes}} the Oxford English Dictionary {{and many other}} dictionaries, announces an Oxford Dictionaries UK <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year and an Oxford Dictionaries US <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year; {{sometimes}} {{these are the same}} <b>word.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year need not have been coined within the past twelve months but it does need to have become prominent or notable during that time.

40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many {{questions}} concerning <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Qur'an is whether their content and meaning were truly a divine revelation {{or they were}} revealed to the Prophet from God and then transferred into <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>words.</b> In this regard, there are two perspectives. First, as all Muslims believe, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> a divine revelation, where­as the second viewpoint is that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are written by a human and not God. According to this latter perspective, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are sayings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet <b>of</b> which only <b>the</b> contents {{are based on a}} divine revelation. <b>The</b> theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an not being a divine revelation has been an abandoned and rejected one throughout the Islamic history. This is the reason it has not been <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> any pertinent discussions. How can <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an be created by Muhammad or Gabriel even though it is believed that the Qur'an is a miracle? This article first defines <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> revelation and then analyzes various viewpoints and opinions regarding this topic in order to conclude (with evidence) that the Qur'an is <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God and not <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet. If he had composed <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an and expressed <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revelation in his own words, then the Qur'an would not be <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God. In this case, <b>the</b> term 'word <b>of</b> God' indicates that <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'word' should be considered. Thus, it is clear that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are divine and they can be referred and attributed to God...|$|R
5|$|In 2004, the 1963 statute {{came under}} {{criticism}} because it states {{the sun in}} the state seal is setting rather than rising. A thorough investigation by the Indiana Historical Bureau {{into the history of}} the seal led to the discovery that original seal was created with the intention that the sun should, in fact, be depicted as rising. In both 2004 and 2005 legislation was introduced to change the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statute, but as of 2008 no action had been taken to correct the error.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, the Department of Justice and Equality {{published}} the general scheme of a Marriage Bill 2015. The bill {{set out the}} changes {{to be made to}} legislation if the proposed amendment was approved. These changes included removing the existing legislative bar on same-sex couples marrying (though the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amendment is self-executing and designed to invalidate it irrespective of legislative delay), addressing the situation of civil partnership, and updating terminology of existing legislation to reflect the new provision.|$|E

5|$|Under the Royal Assent Act 1967, {{royal assent}} can be {{granted by the}} {{sovereign}} in writing, by means of letters patent, that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament. Then, the presiding officer makes a formal, but simple statement to the house, acquainting each house that royal assent has been granted to the acts mentioned. Thus, unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by Royal Commissioners, the method created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly {{for the purpose of}} receiving the notice of royal assent. The standard text of the letters patent is set out in The Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992, with minor amendments in 2000. In practice this remains the standard method, a fact that is belied by the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> letters patent for the appointment of the Royal Commissioners and by the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 Act ("... And forasmuch as We cannot at this time be present in the Higher House of Our said Parliament being the accustomed place for giving Our Royal Assent...").|$|E
5|$|After Congress {{approved}} the final <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Declaration on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent {{a few blocks}} away to the printing shop of John Dunlap. Through the night, Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides for distribution. Before long, the Declaration was read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers throughout the thirteen states. The first official public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8; public readings also took place on that day in Trenton, New Jersey and Easton, Pennsylvania. A German translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conviction}} for manslaughter in 1967 of the Christian Scientist mother of five-year-old Lisa Sheridan, who died without medical care in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the church lobbied the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) {{to add a}} religious exemption to the Code of Federal Regulations. Added in 1974, this stated that parents who did not provide medical treatment for a child for religious reasons would not be considered negligent. States were thereafter obliged to include exemptions or lose funding; the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exemptions made clear that they referred to Christian Science.|$|E

5|$|Each June, on Garter Day, {{the members}} of the Order, wearing their habits and garter insignia, meet at Windsor Castle. When any new Knights of the Garter are due for installation, an {{investiture}} ceremony is held in the Throne Room of Windsor Castle on the morning of Garter Day. This ceremony is attended by all Knights Companions of the order, wearing the ceremonial habits and garter insignia, and also by their wives. The <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oath sworn by the new knights at this ceremony and of the Admonitions addressed to them in turn by the prelate and chancellor of the order when the several items of insignia are placed upon them are extremely similar to the traditions of the past.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{countered that}} he did not believe the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1957 {{document}} gave Rhodesia the right to devise its own representation overseas without first gaining assent from Britain. The Reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in Rhodesian diplomatic profile, he said, and might damage Britain's reputation, which would in turn make the ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides. He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, adding that the official would not have to be physically located within the embassy, and could set up his own office elsewhere so long as he remained nominally affiliated to it.|$|E
5|$|It is {{seen that}} Justinian regards {{this as a}} novel {{enactment}} of an old law, and that he includes not only the symbolic interpretations of the punishment as found in for example Cicero, but also Constantine's extension of the penalty to fathers who murder their own children. In Justinian, relative to Constantine, we see the inclusion in the sack of the dog, cock and monkey, not just the serpent(s) in Constantine. Some modern historians, such as O.F. Robinson, suspects that the precise <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text in the Institutes 4.18.6 suggests that the claimed reference in Digest 48.9.9 from Modestinus is actually a sixth CE interpolation into the third century CE law text, rather than being a faithful citation of Modestinus.|$|E
