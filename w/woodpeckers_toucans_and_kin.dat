5000|$|Scaly foot, {{otherwise}} known as knemidocoptiasis, is caused by burrowing mites in the genus Knemidocoptes. The condition can be compared with sarcoptic mange in mammals, but {{does not seem to}} cause the same level of itching. The birds chiefly affected are galliformes (chickens and turkeys), passerines (finches, canaries, sparrows, robins, wrens), and psittacine birds (parrots, macaws, parakeets, budgerigars). The condition sometimes additionally affects piciformes (<b>woodpeckers,</b> <b>toucans)</b> <b>and</b> anseriformes ducks, geese, swans), raptors and other birds. The two species of mite most often implicated are K. jamaicensis and K. intermedius. Other related species of mite affect feather follicles and cause depluming. The mites are mostly transmitted by prolonged direct contact, particularly from parent bird to unfledged nestling.|$|R

5000|$|Nine-primaried oscines make up much {{of almost}} every Neotropical mixed-species feeding flock. Namely, these birds are from {{families}} such as the cardinals, Parulidae (New World [...] "warblers"), and in particular Emberizidae (American [...] "sparrows") and Thraupidae (tanagers). Other members of a Neotropic mixed feeding flock may come {{from most of the}} local families of smaller diurnal insectivorous birds, and can also include <b>woodpecker,</b> <b>toucans,</b> <b>and</b> trogons. Most Furnariidae do not participate in mixed flocks, though there are exceptions such as Synallaxis spinetails and some species of the woodcreeper subfamily - e.g. those mentioned above or the lesser woodcreeper - are common or even [...] "core" [...] members. Among the tyrant flycatchers there are also some species joining mixed flocks on a somewhat regular basis, including the sepia-capped flycatcher, eared pygmy tyrant, white-throated spadebill, and Oustalet's tyrannulet.|$|R
500|$|The Picidae {{are just}} one of eight living {{families}} in the order Piciformes. Other members of this group, such as the jacamars, puffbirds, barbets, <b>toucans,</b> <b>and</b> honeyguides, have traditionally been thought to be {{closely related to the}} woodpecker family (woodpeckers, piculets, wrynecks and sapsuckers). The clade Pici (<b>woodpeckers,</b> barbets, <b>toucans,</b> <b>and</b> honeyguides) is well supported and shares a zygodactyl foot with the Galbuli (puffbirds and jacamars). More recently, several DNA sequence analyses have confirmed that Pici and Galbuli are sister groups.|$|R

There are many species of bats as well, like the {{spectral}} bat, Honduran white bat, and the thumbless bat. Many species of insects, including butterflies and moths are native to Alajuela. Because of this, The Butterfly Farm in La Garita was established to further scientific research into the different species.|$|R
50|$|Picocoraciae is a clade that {{contains}} the order Bucerotiformes (hornbills and hoopoes) and the clade Picodynastornithes (containing birds like kingfishers and rollers, <b>and</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toucans)</b> supported by various genetic analysis and morphological studies. While these studies supported a sister grouping of Coraciiformes and Piciformes, a large scale, sparse supermatrix has suggested alternative sister relationship between Bucerotiformes and Piciformes instead.|$|R
5000|$|Neanis is an extinct genus of bird {{probably}} {{related to}} <b>woodpeckers</b> <b>and</b> <b>toucans.</b> It contains {{at least one}} species, N. schucherti; N. kistneri resembles this, but it probably belongs to a distinct genus {{and may not be}} closely related. Both are known from the Late Wasatchian (51-52 MYA) stratum of the Early Eocene Green River Formation of the Western-Central USA. [...] "N." [...] kistneri is known from one fairly complete, but not very well preserved skeleton, whereas of N. schucherti even less material was found.|$|R
5000|$|A tree hollow is {{a cavity}} {{in a living}} tree. Tree holes can be caused when an injury to the tree, such as {{breakage}} of a limb, creates an opening through the bark and exposes the sapwood. The sapwood is attacked by fungi and bacteria, which form a cavity in the bole of the tree. The resulting cavity can fill with water, thus becoming a type of phytotelma. Therefore, there are wet and dry tree holes. Tree holes are important habitats for many animals, such as Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae, antlions, the common merganser, <b>toucans,</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> <b>and</b> bluebirds. Tree holes can be important in the maintenance and spread of some diseases, for example La Crosse encephalitis. [...] Hollows may be an adaptive trait for trees as animals provide the host tree with fertilizer.|$|R
60|$|We may conclude, then, I believe, that touch, as Mr. Herbert Spencer admirably words it, is 'the mother-tongue of the senses;' {{and that}} in {{proportion}} as animals have or have not highly developed and serviceable tactile organs will they rank high or low in the intellectual hierarchy of nature. Now, how does this bear upon the family of parrots? Well, in the first place, everybody who has ever kept a cockatoo or a macaw in domestic slavery is well aware that in no other birds do the claws so closely resemble a human or simian hand, not indeed in outer form or appearance, but in opposability of the thumbs and in perfection of grasping power. The toes on each foot are arranged in opposite pairs--two turning in front and two backward, which gives all parrots their peculiar firmness in clinging on a perch or on the branch of a tree with one foot only, while they extend the other to grasp a fruit or to clutch at any object they desire to take possession of. True, this peculiarity isn't entirely confined to the parrots alone, as such. They share {{the division of the}} foot into two thumbs and two fingers with a whole large group of allied birds, called, in the charmingly concise and poetical language of technical ornithology, the Scansorial Picarians, and more generally, known to the unlearned herd (meaning you and me) by their several names of <b>woodpeckers,</b> cuckoos, <b>toucans,</b> <b>and</b> plantain-eaters. All the members of this great group, of which the parrots proper are only the most advanced and developed family, possess the same arrangement of the digits into front-toes and back-toes. But in none is the arrangement so perfect as in the parrots, and in none is the power of grasping an object all round so completely developed and so pregnant in moral and intellectual consequences.|$|R

40|$|We {{improve the}} taxon {{sampling}} for avian phylogeny by analyzing seven new mitochondrial genomes (a <b>toucan,</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> osprey, forest falcon, American kestrel, heron and a pelican). This improves inference of the avian tree, and it supports three major conclusions. The {{first is that}} some birds (including a parrot, a <b>toucan</b> <b>and</b> the osprey) exhibit a complete duplication of the control region meaning that {{there are at least}} four distinct gene orders within birds. However it appears that there are regions of continued gene conversion between the duplicate control regions, resulting in duplications that can be stable for long evolutionary periods. Because of this stable duplicated state, gene order can eventually either revert to the original order, or change to the new gene order. The existence of this stable duplicate state explains how an apparently unlikely event (finding the same novel gene order) can arise multiple times. Although rare genomic changes have theoretical advantages for tree-reconstruction, they can be compromised if these apparently rare events have a stable intermediate state. Secondly, the <b>toucan</b> <b>and</b> <b>woodpecker</b> improve the resolution of the six-way split within Neoaves that has been called an “explosive radiation”.
