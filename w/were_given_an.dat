5|$|Shaizar {{was seen}} as a {{strategically}} important site and the gateway to enter and control inner Syria. The Arabs initially conquered Shaizar during the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 637. Due to its importance it exchanged hands numerous times between the Arabs and Byzantines, who regained it in 999. In 1025 the Banu Munqid tribe <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> allocation of land beside Shaizar by the ruler of Hama, Saleh al-Murdase. Over time they expanded their lands building fortifications and castles until Usamas grandfather Iz Al-Dawlah Al-Murhif Nasr retook it in 1180.|$|E
5|$|The Wittelsbach class {{represented}} an incremental {{improvement over the}} preceding Kaiser Friedrich III class. They were equipped with the same armament of four 24cm guns, but <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> additional torpedo tube. They had improved defensive capabilities, as they were protected by a more extensive armored belt. They also differed from the preceding ships in their main deck, {{the entire length of}} which was flush. The Kaiser Friedrich III had a cut-down quarterdeck. The ships of the class, which included Wittelsbach, Wettin, Zähringen, Schwaben, and Mecklenburg, were the first battleships built under the first Naval Law of 1898.|$|E

5|$|During the {{build-up}} to the 1978 FIFA World Cup, MacLeod fuelled {{the hopes}} of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home with a medal. As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> enthusiastic send-off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. Scotland's first game was against Peru in Córdoba. Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that {{the result was a}} 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran. The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 1941, Adolf Hitler and Wilhelm Keitel, {{with a large}} entourage, {{arrived to}} view Bismarck and Tirpitz in Gotenhafen. The men <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> {{extensive}} tour of the ships, after which Hitler met with Lütjens to discuss the upcoming mission. On 16 May, Lütjens reported that Bismarck and Prinz Eugen were fully prepared for Operation Rheinübung; he was therefore ordered {{to proceed with the}} mission on the evening of 19 May. As part of the operational plans, a group of eighteen supply ships would be positioned to support Bismarck and Prinz Eugen. Four U-boats would be placed along the convoy routes between Halifax and Britain to scout for the raiders.|$|E
5|$|Through the 1950s {{increased}} funding advanced {{the place of}} sciences within the institution. In 1950, the university had completed the construction of three academic buildings for the sciences, all designed by local architect William Russell Souter. Public funding was eventually necessary to ensure the {{humanities and social sciences}} <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> equal place. Thus, in 1957 the University reorganized once again under The McMaster University Act, 1957, dissolving the two colleges. Its property was vested to McMaster and the university became a nondenominational institution eligible for public funding. The historic Baptist connection was continued through McMaster Divinity College, a separately chartered affiliated college of the university. Also in 1957, PhD programs were consolidated in a new Faculty of Graduate Studies. Construction of the McMaster Nuclear Reactor also began in 1957, and was the first university-based research reactor in the Commonwealth when it began operating in 1959.|$|E

5|$|To {{defend the}} naval base, heavy 15-inch naval guns (381.0mm) were {{stationed}} at Johore battery, Changi, and at Buona Vista {{to deal with}} battleships. Medium BL 9.2 inch guns (233.7mm) were provided for dealing with smaller attackers. Batteries of smaller calibre anti-aircraft guns and guns for dealing with raids were located at Fort Siloso, Fort Canning and Labrador. The five 15-inch guns were all surplus Navy guns, manufactured between 1903 and 1919. Part of their cost was met from a gift of £500,000 from Sultan Ibrahim of Johor for the Silver Jubilee of the coronation King George V. Three of the guns <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> all-round (360°) traverse and subterranean magazines.|$|E
5|$|In the Royal Audiencia, the {{education}} situation worsened after of {{the expulsion of}} the Jesuit priests; too few learned people lived in Quito {{to be able to}} fill the void. The majority of the population neither read nor wrote well. On the other hand, the few who could enter the university <b>were</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> education which was heavily theoretical and used memorization as the primary learning technique. Scholasticism, which was in decline in these times, was still taught; and the students spent their time in metaphysical discussions. As a result, the intellectual people in Quito—most of whom were clerical—had affected manners when expressing themselves, while having no new ideas. Furthermore, in 1793 only two medical doctors were available in Quito, of which one was Espejo; the majority of people who fell ill were helped by curanderos. In Quito at the time, ethnic prejudice was common, and therefore most people considered society to be divided into estates of the realm, which differed by racial origin. Because of this, a person's dignity and honor could be damaged by racial prejudices.|$|E
