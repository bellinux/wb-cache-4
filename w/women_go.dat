5|$|The Cagneys had run-of-the-play contracts, {{which lasted}} {{as long as}} the play did. Vernon was in the chorus line of the show, and with help from the Actors' Equity Association, Cagney understudied Tracy on the Broadway show, {{providing}} them with a desperately needed steady income. Cagney also established a dance school for professionals, then landed a part in the play <b>Women</b> <b>Go</b> On Forever, directed by John Cromwell, which ran for four months. By the end of the run, Cagney was exhausted from acting and running the dance school.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>women</b> <b>go</b> {{back to the}} factory, Micaëla {{returns and}} gives José a letter and a kiss from his mother ("Parle-moi de ma mère!"). He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Micaëla, who retreats in shy embarrassment on {{learning}} this. Just as José declares that {{he is ready to}} heed his mother's wishes, the women stream from the factory in great agitation. Zuniga, the officer of the guard, learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife. When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance ("Tra la la... Coupe-moi, brûle-moi"); Zuniga orders José to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant. Left alone with José, Carmen beguiles him with a seguidilla, in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover—whoever that may be—in Lillas Pastia's tavern. Confused yet mesmerised, José agrees to free her hands; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing. José is arrested for dereliction of duty.|$|E

25|$|Overall, {{on a first}} date, women’s {{goals are}} related more to {{establishing}} friendships and having fun. Mongeau, in his 2004 study found that 60 percent of <b>women</b> <b>go</b> on first dates mainly to have fun and 59 percent go on dates to reduce uncertainty. (Note, however, {{that there are some}} errors in the mathematical calculations done in the study, and the study is statistically invalid as it uses the convenience sampling method.) Women's goals tend to be more relationship-oriented than men’s goals. Also, unlike men, women are usually more reserved {{when it comes to the}} sexual aspect and having sex. Women are more likely to express companionship, friendship, and romantic relationship goals than men and are also more likely to consider the first date in terms of their relational implications than men.|$|E
25|$|Diwali {{is one of}} {{the happiest}} {{holidays}} in India and Nepal with significant preparations. People clean their homes and decorate them for the festivities. Diwali {{is one of the}} biggest shopping seasons in India and Nepal; people buy new clothes for themselves and their families, as well as gifts, appliances, kitchen utensils, even expensive items such as cars and gold jewellery. People also buy gifts for family members and friends which typically include sweets, dry fruits, and seasonal specialties depending on regional harvest and customs. It is also the period when children hear ancient stories, legends about battles between good and evil or light and darkness from their parents and elders. Girls and <b>women</b> <b>go</b> shopping and create rangoli and other creative patterns on floors, near doors and walkways. Youth and adults alike help with lighting and preparing for patakhe (fireworks).|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of bipedalism, human females have narrower birth canals. The construction of the human pelvis differs from other primates, as do the toes. A trade-off for these advantages of the modern human pelvis is that childbirth is more difficult and dangerous than in most mammals, especially given the larger head size of human babies compared to other primates. This means that human babies must turn around as they pass through the birth canal, which other primates do not do, and it makes humans the only species where females usually require help from their conspecifics (other {{members of their own}} species) to reduce the risks of birthing. As a partial evolutionary solution, human fetuses are born less developed and more vulnerable. Chimpanzee babies are cognitively more developed than human babies until the age of six months, when the rapid development of human brains surpasses chimpanzees. Another difference between women and chimpanzee females is that <b>women</b> <b>go</b> through the menopause and become unfertile decades before the end of their lives. All species of non-human apes are capable of giving birth until death. Menopause probably developed as it has provided an evolutionary advantage (more caring time) to young relatives.|$|E

25|$|Practically all {{speakers}} of Nobiin are bilingual in Egyptian Arabic or Sudanese Arabic. For the men, this was noted {{as early as}} 1819 by the traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in his Travels to Nubia. The forced resettlement {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century also brought more Nubians, especially women and children, into daily contact with Arabic. Chief factors in this development include increased mobility (and hence easy access to non-Nubian villages and cities), changes in social patterns such as women going more often to the market to sell their own products, and easy access to Arabic newspapers. In urban areas, many Nubian <b>women</b> <b>go</b> to school and are fluent in Arabic; they usually address their children in Arabic, reserving Nobiin for their husband. In response to concerns about a possible language shift to Arabic, Werner notes a very positive language attitude. Rouchdy (1992a) however notes that use of Nobiin is confined mainly to the domestic circle, as Arabic is the dominant language in trade, education, and public life. Sociolinguistically, the situation may be described as one of stable bilingualism: the dominant language (Arabic in this case), although used widely, does not easily replace the minority language since the latter is tightly connected to the Nubian identity.|$|E

The show received rave reviews and was followed by Grand Street Follies of 1929. These roles led to a part in George Kelly's Maggie the Magnificent, a play the critics disliked, though they liked Cagney's performance. Cagney saw this role (and <b>Women</b> <b>Go</b> on Forever) as significant because of the talented directors he met. He learned [...] "...what a director was for and what a director could do.

2500|$|Cannibalism {{has been}} {{reported}} in several recent African conflicts, including the Second Congo War, and the civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone. A UN human rights expert reported in July 2007 that sexual atrocities against Congolese <b>women</b> <b>go</b> [...] "far beyond rape" [...] and include sexual slavery, forced incest, and cannibalism. This may be done in desperation, as during peacetime cannibalism is much less frequent; at other times, it is consciously directed at certain groups believed to be relatively helpless, such as Congo Pygmies, even considered subhuman by some other Congolese. It is also reported by some that witch doctors sometimes use the body parts of children in their medicine. In the 1970s the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin was reputed to practice cannibalism.|$|E
