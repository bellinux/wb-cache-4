5|$|Severe thunderstorms, {{which can}} spawn tornadoes and hailstorms, require wind shear to {{organize}} the storm {{in such a way}} as to maintain the thunderstorm for a longer period of time. This occurs as the storm's inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow.

5|$|In early September 1940, the Italian 10th Army {{based in}} Libya {{conducted}} the Italian invasion of Egypt {{and three months}} later, the British and Commonwealth troops of the Western Desert Force began a counter-offensive, codenamed Operation Compass. In two months, the British advanced , occupying the Italian province of Cyrenaica and destroying the 10th Army. The advance was halted in February 1941 because of supply shortages and to give priority to the Battle of Greece. Renamed XIII Corps and reorganised under HQ Cyrenaica Command (CYRCOM), the troops of the former Western Desert Force adopted a defensive posture. Over the next few months, HQ Cyrenaica lost its commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, followed by the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 6th Australian Division when they were sent to Greece in Operation Lustre.

5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the thunderstorm {{is dominated}} by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere <b>with</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.|$|E

The village was defended in strength by the Germans, and the weakened battalion could only dig in and wait the arrival of commandos from the 1st Special Service Brigade later that day.

Indicators of social participation and networks did not add to the explanatory power of the model. Among the indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage, hardship was more strongly associated with variation in health status than either employment status or area-level deprivation. Conclusion: As in the general population, self-reported health was associated with indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage, especially hardship.

40|$|Angiotensin II {{is known}} to undergo a {{reversible}} conformational transition and a change in potency in rat uterus in vitro with pK approximately 6. 5.

Isomerization from all-trans at pH 6. 8 to approximately 16 % cis at pH 8. 0 is therefore correlated with a 10 -fold increase in biological activity for [Asp 1,Ile 5]-angiotensin II in rat uterus in vitro. Isomerization from all-trans at pH 6. 8 to approximately 16 % cis at pH 8. 0 in the competitive inhibitor [Phe 4,Tyr 8]angiotensin II is correlated <b>with</b> exhibition of <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> agonist activity at low pH to full agonist activity at high pH.

The condition is aptly known as bronchiolitis obliterans and clinically is diagnosed as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).
