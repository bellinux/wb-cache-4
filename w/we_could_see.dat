25|$|Dennett's {{thesis is}} that our modern {{understanding}} of consciousness is unduly influenced by the ideas of René Descartes. To show why, he starts {{with a description of}} the phi illusion. In this experiment, two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the light change colour before the second light is observed.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{marked a}} change in the {{presentation}} of Black's [...] "flashback" [...] visions, a hallmark of the series. Previously they had been depicted with a series of rapid and vague images; director Wright felt that it would be beneficial to slow these down and linger on imagery for longer, [...] "so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> a little more of what was happening".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Aquaman {{stemmed from a}} fifth season episode of Smallville, [...] "Aqua". The episode {{featured}} Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) coming to Smallville to stop an underwater weapons project being developed by LuthorCorp. [...] "Aqua" [...] became the highest rated episode for Smallville that season, {{but it was never}} meant to be a backdoor pilot for an Aquaman series. However, as work progressed on [...] "Aqua", the character was recognized to have potential for his own series. Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, the creators of Smallville, also considered a series featuring Lois Lane, but felt more confident about Aquaman. Millar said," [...] was the first idea where we really thought we had a franchise where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> 100 episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Just {{after midnight}} on December 5, Cornwallis' vanguard, which {{consisted}} of two British light infantry battalions, skirmished with an American cavalry patrol {{under the command of}} Capt. Allen McLane near Three Mile Run on Skippack Road. McLane sent a messenger to Washington, alerting him of the British movements. [...] While {{the main body of the}} British troops marched through Germantown, Beggarstown, and Flourtown, American alarm cannons were sounded and positions manned. [...] At 3:00am, the British halted on Chestnut Hill, just south of the American defenses, and waited for daybreak. [...] During the night, Washington ordered his troops to build additional campfires to deceive the British. [...] "...t looked as if fifty thousand men were encamped there. By day <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> this was merely a trick...," [...] wrote Hessian Maj. Carl von Bauermeister.|$|E

500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her in prison?" ...|$|E
500|$|No.491 Squadron {{was formed}} in tandem with No.91 Wing on 20October 1950. Headquartered at Iwakuni, it was {{responsible}} for all maintenance of the wing's aircraft except day-to-day servicing. A section was attached to No.77 Squadron in Korea to assist ground staff with daily maintenance. Personnel from Iwakuni were regularly rotated through this section, and augmented by additional No.491 Squadron staff as needed for repair or salvage work. On one occasion, members of No.491 Squadron had to strip components from a Douglas C-47 Dakota of No.30 Communications Unit that had been destroyed when a UN Mustang smashed into its cockpit while landing at Suwon, Korea; {{according to one of}} the Australian ground crew, [...] "There was a fair amount of urgency attached to the job as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Mustangs doing strafing runs not too far away." [...] Normal practice was to fly aircraft to Iwakuni for major repairs or scrapping. The regular hours worked by technicians at Iwakuni contrasted with shifts of up to sixteen hours near the front line in Korea. Korea was one of the coldest climates in which RAAF ground crews had ever worked; the commanding officer of No.77 Squadron from September 1950 to August 1951, Squadron Leader Dick Cresswell, recalled seeing maintenance staff with tools frozen to their hands.|$|E
500|$|From {{the start}} of the {{invasion}} onward, TNI forces engaged in the wholesale massacre of Timorese civilians. At {{the start of}} the occupation, Fretilin radio sent the following broadcast: [...] "The Indonesian forces are killing indiscriminately. Women and children are being shot in the streets. We are all going to be killed.... This is an appeal for international help. Please do something to stop this invasion." [...] One Timorese refugee told later of [...] "rape [...] cold-blooded assassinations of women and children and Chinese shop owners". Dili's bishop at the time, Martinho da Costa Lopes, said later: [...] "The soldiers who landed started killing everyone they could find. There were many dead bodies in the streets – all <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> were the soldiers killing, killing, killing." [...] In one incident, a group of fifty men, women, and children – including Australian freelance reporter Roger East – were lined up on a cliff outside of Dili and shot, their bodies falling into the sea. Many such s took place in Dili, where onlookers were ordered to observe and count aloud as each person was executed. It is estimated that at least 2,000 Timorese were massacred in the first two days of the invasion in Dili alone. In addition to Fretilin supporters, Chinese migrants were also singled out for execution; five hundred were killed in the first day alone.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognisable}} aspects of My Bloody Valentine's music is Shields' guitar sound, which [...] "use texture more than technique to create vivid soundscapes." [...] During the late 1980s, Shields began customising the tremolo systems for his Fender Jaguars and Jazzmasters; extending the tremolo arm and loosening it considerably, {{to allow him to}} manipulate the arm while strumming chords, which resulted in excessive pitch bending. Shields used a number of alternate and open tunings that together with his tremolo manipulation achieved [...] "a strange warping effect that makes the music wander in and out of focus", according to Rolling Stone. Shields' most notable effect is reverse digital reverb, sourced from a Yamaha SPX90 effects unit. Together with the tremolo manipulation and distortion, he created a technique known as [...] "glide guitar". Shields effects rig, which is composed largely of distortion, graphic equalizers and tone controls, consists of at least 30 effects pedals and is connected to a large amount of amplifiers, which are often set to maximum volume to increase sustain. During live performances, and in particular the closing song [...] "You Made Me Realise", My Bloody Valentine perform an interlude of noise and excessive feedback, known as [...] "the holocaust", which would last for half an hour and often reached 130db. Shields later remarked [...] "it was so loud it was like sensory deprivation. We just liked the fact that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> a change in the audience at a certain point." ...|$|E

The CLA also stated that the IDF was returning fire after coming under attack, that its shells did not hit the school compound, and {{that this has been}} acknowledged by the UN.
