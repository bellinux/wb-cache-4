30|$|Previous {{researches}} on {{the evaluation}} of the sustainability of the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> mainly focus on non-karst regions, while rarely evaluate the sustainability of that in karst regions. With large topographic height difference and developed karst channels, karst regions are generally covered with thin overlying soil (Chu et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2004). These characteristics lead to these regions which have more abundant <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> underground than on the ground; moreover, the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> system responds more sensitively to the changes in the surrounding environment. For the sustainability of the <b>water</b> <b>resource,</b> except for the influence of the fixed factors of water, it is also related to the water requirement, ecological environment and social economy in the region. Considering this, studying the sustainability of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> merely from one aspect cannot reflect the whole situation. Therefore, in view of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> system, water requirement system, ecosystem and social economic system, the evaluation index system for the sustainability of the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in the karst region is constructed. Based on the system, the typical karst mountainous area, that is, Zunyi, in Guizhou, China, is served as an example to evaluate the sustainability of <b>water</b> <b>resource.</b>|$|R

30|$|Water is a {{fundamental}} natural <b>resource</b> while agriculture <b>water</b> guarantees the grain output, which shows that the utilization and management of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> have a significant practical meaning. Regional agricultural <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> system features with unpredictable, self-organization, and non-linear which lays a certain difficulty on the evaluation of regional agriculture <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> resilience. The current research on <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> resilience remains to focus on qualitative analysis and the quantitative analysis {{is still in the}} primary stage, thus, according to the above issues, projection pursuit classification model is brought forward. With the help of artificial fish-swarm algorithm (AFSA), it optimizes the projection index function, seeks for the optimal projection direction, and improves AFSA with the application of self-adaptive artificial fish step and crowding factor. Taking Hongxinglong Administration of Heilongjiang as the research base and on the basis of improving AFSA, it established the evaluation of projection pursuit classification model to agriculture <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> system resilience besides the proceeding analysis of projection pursuit classification model on accelerating genetic algorithm. The research shows that the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> resilience of Hongxinglong is the best than Raohe Farm, and the last 597 Farm. And the further analysis shows that the key driving factors influencing agricultural <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> resilience are precipitation and agriculture water consumption.

40|$|While {{urbanization}} brings {{economic and}} social benefits, it also causes water pollution and other environmental ecological problems. This paper provides a theoretical framework to quantitatively analyze the dynamic relationship between <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> utilization {{and the process of}} urbanization. Using data from Jiangsu province, we first construct indices to evaluate urbanization and <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> utilization. We then adopt an entropy model to examine the correlation between urbanization and <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> utilization. In addition, we introduce a dynamic coupling model to analyze and predict the coupling degree between urbanization and <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> utilization. Our analyses show that pairing with rising urbanization during 2002 – 2014, the overall index of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> utilization in Jiangsu province has experienced a “decline -rise-decline” trend. Specifically, after the index of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> utilization reached its lowest point in 2004, it gradually began to rise. <b>Water</b> <b>resource</b> utilization reached its highest value in 2010. The coupling degree between urbanization and <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> utilization was relatively low in 2002 and 2003 varying between − 90 ° and 0 °. It has been rising since then. Out-of-sample forecasts indicate that the coupling degree will reach its highest value of 74. 799 ° in 2016, then will start to gradually decline. Jiangsu province was chosen as our studied area because {{it is one of the}} selected pilot provinces for China’s economic reform and social development. The analysis of the relationship between provincial <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> utilization and urbanization is essential to the understanding of the dynamic relationship between these two systems. It also serves as an important input for developing national policies for sustainable urbanization and <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> management...|$|R
40|$|Service-oriented {{computing}} is {{a software}} engineering paradigm that views complex software systems as an interconnected collection of distributed computational components.

40|$|A novel dynamic computable general {{equilibrium}} model {{based on}} National <b>Water</b> <b>Resource</b> Input Holding Output Table is proposed to calculate the Shadow Price of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in China. Unlike previous approaches, the dynamic Shadow Price of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> is largely based on the scarcity extent and can reflect the marginal long-term value in the balanced growth path of China. Firstly, the basic concepts of dynamic Input Output analysis and Turnpike Theory are reviewed.

Furthermore, Shadow Price of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in China from 1949 to 2050 {{is calculated based on}} the DCGE. Also the sensitivity analysis of the DCGE for Shadow Price of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in China is presented. Dynamic Shadow Price of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> has two meanings for China government: (1) Project evaluation. Every large-scale project in China must have national economic evaluation and the dynamic Shadow Price is prerequisite for national economic evaluation. (2) Market price of <b>water</b> <b>resource.</b> A lesson from this paper is that Shadow Price of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> in domestic market of China should be rewritten according to the dynamic Shadow Price.

30|$|According to the {{evaluation}} {{result from the}} improved AFSA, Raohe Farm and Hongqiling Farm have the strongest <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> resilience than Jiangchuan Farm, Baoshan Farm, 291 Farm, Shuangyashan Farm, Shuguang Farm and 853 Farm, and at last Youyi Farm, 597 Farm, 852 Farm and Beixing Farm. Entirely speaking, the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> resilience of eastern area is the strongest than the northern and western area, and at last the middle area. The evaluation result conforms to the actual situation, and according to Fig.  1, there is Ussuri River in the east, Woken River in the west, and Songhua River {{in the north of}} Hongxinglong Administration, and farms close to rivers have a certain supplementation to the underground water, which promotes the resilience of <b>water</b> <b>resource.</b> From the collected data, the agricultural water consumption covers 90  % that of the overall water consumption, of which Baoshan Farm reaches 99.76  %, so it requires all farms to save agricultural water consumption with introducing water-saving irritation technology. The annual rainfall data present that the rainfall of Raohe Farm reaches 511.2  mm, Hongqiling Farm 456.3  mm, and 597 Farm 261.6  mm, and it is known that the rainfall is the key index influencing <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> resilience, which conforms to the actual information that rainfall directly affects the supplement of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> and has a significant effect on <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> resilience of all regions. And compared with rainfall and agricultural water consumption, average per capita <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> is the least influencing factor: the average per capita <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> of Jiangchuan Farm reaches 11856.65  m 3 while Shuangyashan Farm 495.82  m 3. According to Table  2, the projection value of Jiangchuan Farm is 1.7876 while Shuangashan Farm 1.3725, which belongs to the same II degree. Thus, combining with agricultural water consumption (Jiangchuan Farm is 99.52  % while Shuangyashan Farm 90.03  %), it shows that the influence of average per capita <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> on <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> resilience is very small but still can not be ignored. The evaluation result of 12 farms in Hongxinglong Administration tells that the overall <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> resilience situation needs to be worried. The water consumption of all farms is very large while the supplement is small, which causes the continuous decline of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> with weak resilience capability. Thus, {{it can be seen that}} the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> resilience capability is the result of the combined effects of evaluation indexes instead of the determination of single index on the resilience.|$|R
