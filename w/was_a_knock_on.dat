Lane saw that Blair was whiter, thinner, frailer, a little farther on that road from which there could be no turning.|$|E
60|$|Not being satisfied, I {{began to}} examine this roof and the clay walls, which I forgot to mention were painted over {{in a kind of}} pattern with whorls in it, by the feeble light of the {{primitive}} lamps.

5000|$|Abu Tubar has {{achieved}} the title [...] "hatchet man" [...] in early 1970s. His {{real name is}} حاتم كاظم هضم (Hatem Kazem Hathom); born 1932 {{in the city of}} Babylon, Hilla in Iraq. He is known as the man who brought fear and terror to the civilians of Iraq. He has a reputation of murdering families by chopping them with his hatchet.

60|$|A {{few minutes}} later there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> his door, and in {{response}} to his summons to enter the door opened, and there stood before him the young man of his recent encounter upon the street. The latter entered softly, closing the door behind him. His feet made no sound upon the carpet, and no sound came from the door as he closed it, nor any slightest click from the latch. His utter silence and the stealth of his movements were so pronounced as to attract immediate attention. He did not speak until he had reached {{the center of the room}} and halted on the opposite side of the table at which Jimmy was standing; and then a very slow smile moved his lips, though the expression of his eyes remained unchanged.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are so {{many things}} that she doesn't understand," [...] he reflected, glancing at the letter to Cassandra which he had begun and laid aside. What {{prevented}} him from finishing the letter which he had so much enjoyed beginning? The reason was that Katharine might, at any moment, enter the room. The thought, implying his bondage to her, irritated him acutely. It occurred to him that he would leave the letter lying open for her to see, and he would take the opportunity of telling her that he had sent his play to Cassandra for her to criticize. Possibly, but not by any means certainly, this would annoy her--and as he reached the doubtful comfort of this conclusion, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door and Katharine came in. They kissed each other coldly and she made no apology for being late. Nevertheless, her mere presence moved him strangely; but he was determined that this should not weaken his resolution to make some kind of stand against her; to get at the truth about her. He let her make her own disposition of clothes and busied himself with the plates.|$|E

Back at the office, Dobbs meets with a female officer, who {{the chief of police}} has sent to make sure he is doing his job, and not just seducing secretaries. Dobbs and the officer end up having sex, and afterward there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door. <b>As</b> Dobbs hides, the Zodiac enters, and tries to sexually assault the officer, but she beats him to the floor, and rapes him as Dobbs looks on in awe.|$|R
50|$|Gary and Boris {{eventually}} {{manage to}} escape from Mabel's bedroom when she leaves, and they manage {{to find the right}} slip. While Gary holds the slip in his hand, Jimmy comes into the room, assuming Gary is holding Alicia's slip. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door and the three men all hide under the bed, unaware that it is Arthur knocking. Mabel comes into the room again and discovers the men hiding under her bed. Boris escapes up onto the roof, but Martha fires her gun at him, making him climb back in through the window again. Geraldine faints {{on the floor of the}} same room, and spots her husband hiding under Mabel's bed.|$|R
5000|$|... "My {{grandmother}} {{was one of}} these old women who used to have dreams and visions and messages arriving. She would fall asleep in a chair, there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door, she would go to the door, someone strange would come to the door and deliver a message. And then she would wake up again in her chair. Now my mother and my aunties told me these stories over and over again. But they just lived with it side by side. They didn't fight it as in a fantasy or horror film. They didn't have to overcome it. It didn't get worse and worse and worse. They just accepted this mystery and then they cooked the dinner." ...|$|R

Years later, Joe and Sarah laugh about the story.|$|E

[...] He said {{that they wanted to}} restore the old order, and for this purpose, [...] "the enemies of the people" [...] had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally.

Everyone expected that at any moment there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door {{in the middle of the}} night and that <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door would prove fatal... eople not to Stalin's liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin's leadership. This was utter and complete arbitrariness. And now is all this to be forgiven and forgotten? Never! ...|$|R
