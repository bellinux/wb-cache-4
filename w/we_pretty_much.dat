We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. The thing with the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the fan site NoHomers.net, Weinstein was asked if there had been any stories that he had come up with that did not make it into the show, to which he replied: [...] "The great thing about The Simpsons is that <b>we</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn't do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like 'Two Bad Neighbors' and 'Homer's Enemy' we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us." ...|$|E
500|$|They {{considered}} {{working on}} the show {{to be similar to}} working in a bubble {{due to the lack of}} interference from the Fox network's executives, as is commonplace on other shows. This allowed them to produce any episodes they wanted, as Weinstein commented: [...] "The great thing about The Simpsons is that <b>we</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn't do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like [...] "Two Bad Neighbors" [...] and [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us." [...] Such was the network's limited input, when an executive suggested the staff introduce a new character to live with the Simpsons so as to [...] "liven up the show", the staff rejected the idea and instead created the episode [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show", inserting the one-time character Roy, with no explanation as to who he was, or why he was living with the family, as a reference to the executive's proposal. The episode, which marked the point at which The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones for the number of episodes produced for an animated series, was named by the BBC as one of the ten most memorable episodes of the show. They noted [...] "the writers used the opportunity to pay tribute to the art of animation and rail against network interference in their show." [...] The intrusion of the network censors was limited: the normal procedure is for an episode's script to be sent to the censor and then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should be substituted, causing limited problems as often the offending lines are removed or changed for comedic purposes after animation. The episode [...] "Homer's Phobia" [...] drew the censor's objections. Its script came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word [...] "gay", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph which stated that [...] "the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for broadcast". The censor problems ultimately came to nothing when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: [...] "acceptable for broadcast".|$|E

2500|$|Back when The Simpsons was {{developed}} as a half hour show, co-creator James L. Brooks negotiated an unusual provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content. He {{was able to do}} that, because Fox back then was a minor fledgling network. Former showrunner Bill Oakley considered working on the show to be similar to working in a bubble {{due to the lack of}} interference from the Fox network's executives, as is commonplace on other shows. This allowed them to produce any episodes they wanted, as showrunner Josh Weinstein commented: [...] "The great thing about The Simpsons is that <b>we</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn't do.

It's really important for me to take my time with this record and it's important for the whole team. It's really, really good energy." [...] She has been working on the album with a number of producers and songwriters, including Hit-Boy, Soundz, Diane Warren, Tricky Stewart, and The Underdogs. In {{an interview}}, Ciara said [...] "I worked with some people that are very fresh, which I'm excited about...

2500|$|Twenty-eight years later, in an {{appearance}} on MSNBC television, Falwell {{said he was not}} troubled by reports that the nominee for Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, John G. Roberts (whose appointment was confirmed by the U.S. Senate) had done volunteer legal work for homosexual rights activists on the case of Romer v. Evans. [...] Falwell told MSNBC's Tucker Carlson that if he were a lawyer, he too would argue for civil rights for LGBT people. [...] "I may not agree with the lifestyle, but {{that has nothing to do}} with the civil rights of that part of our constituency," [...] Falwell said. [...] When Carlson countered that conservatives [...] "are always arguing against 'special rights' for gays," [...] Falwell said that equal access to housing and employment are basic rights, not special rights. [...] "Civil rights for all Americans, black, white, red, yellow, the rich, poor, young, old, gay, straight, et cetera, is not a liberal or conservative value. [...] It's an American value that I would think that <b>we</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> all agree on." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{have altered}} the little details of the anecdote somewhat. But this story is, I vow and declare, as true as Mrs Lynx's. Gracious goodness! how do lies begin? What are the averages of lying? Is {{the same amount of}} lies told about every man, and do <b>we</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> all tell the same amount of lies? Is the average greater in Ireland than in Scotland, or vice versa--among women than among men? Is this a lie I am telling now? If I am talking about you, the odds are, perhaps, that it is. I look back at some which have been told about me, and {{speculate}} on them with thanks and wonder. Dear friends have told them of me, have told them to me of myself. Have they not to and of you, dear friend? A friend of mine was dining at a large dinner of clergymen, and a story, as true as the sausage story above given, was told regarding me, by one of those reverend divines, in whose frock sits some anile chatter-boxes, as any man who knows this world knows. They take the privilege of their gown. They cabal, and tattle, and hiss, and cackle comminations under their breath. I say the old women of the other sex are not more talkative or more mischievous than some of these. [...] "Such a man ought not to be spoken to," [...] says Gobemouche, narrating the story--and such a story! [...] "And I am surprised he is admitted into society at all."

5000|$|Although {{the results}} sounded chaotic or {{confusing}} to some ears, {{the music was}} in fact carefully planned. Bass player Laurie Osbourne has commented [...] "every note was very worked out and there wasn’t much repetition." [...] Kavus Torabi asserts [...] "The music was co-written (by me) with Dan Chudley, and although <b>we</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> knew how we wanted the tunes to go before they were presented {{to the rest of}} the group, the songs would always be open to a few arrangement changes when we all worked on them." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} bassist Jon Stockman describes {{the differences between}} the band's two albums. The main difference would be that the bulk of Themata was written by Drew and arranged by a few of us whereas both the writing and arranging for Sound Awake was much more of a collaborative effort from everyone.
