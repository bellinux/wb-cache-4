5|$|The Caio Duilio class <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of ironclad turret ships {{built for}} the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1870s and 1880s. They were fitted with the largest guns available, 17.72in (450mm) rifled muzzle-loading guns, and were the largest, fastest and most {{powerful}} ships of their day. To save weight on such large vessels, the ship's designer, Benedetto Brin adopted a radical solution for the time: he reserved armor only for the central portion of the ship where it protected the ships' engines and ammunition magazines, {{while the rest of}} the hull were extensively sub-divided with watertight compartments.|$|E
5|$|The Karlsruhe {{class of}} light cruisers <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of two ships {{built for the}} German Imperial Navy {{before the start of}} World War I. The ships and were very similar to the {{previous}} s, mounting the same armament and similar armor protection, though they were larger and faster than the earlier ships. Both vessels were laid down in 1911, and launched one day apart, on 11 and 12 November 1912. Karlsruhe joined the fleet in January 1914, but fitting out work lasted slightly longer on her sister; Rostock was commissioned the following month.|$|E

The two ships, , and , were built in Castellammare between 1911 and 1914. They were intended to serve as scouts for the main Italian fleet, and as such required a high top speed. They were overweight as built, which prevented them from reaching their intended maximum speed. They were a disappointment in service, especially compared to the earlierand fastercruiser , which cut their careers short.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Challenge (known as Dueling Dragons from 1999 to 2010) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of intertwined, {{inverted}} {{roller coasters}} in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter area of Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida, United States. The ride was themed to two chasing dragons, one side being Chinese Fireball {{and the other}} Hungarian Horntail. It featured a layout {{in which the two}} trains shared adjacent lift hills but traversed two unique courses. The ride was designed by Bolliger & Mabillard of Switzerland. The Chinese Fireball dragon reached a top speed of 60mph, and the Hungarian Horntail dragon reached a top speed of 55mph. Both versions featured five inversions and a total ride time of two minutes and 25 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1996 {{the games}} {{industry}} was rocked {{by the news}} that TSR had run into insoluble financial problems and had been bought by Wizards of the Coast. While WotC was busy refocussing TSR's products, Christopher Clark of Inner City Games Designs approached Gygax in 1997 {{to suggest that they}} produce some adventures to sell in game stores while TSR was otherwise occupied; the result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of fantasy adventures published by Inner City Games: A Challenge of Arms (1998) and The Ritual of the Golden Eyes (1999). Gygax introduced some investors to Clark's publication setup, and although the investors were not willing to fund publication of Legendary Adventures, Clark and Gygax formed a partnership called Hekaforge Productions. Gygax was thus able to return to publish Lejendary Adventures in 1999. The game was published as a three-volume set: The Lejendary Rules for All Players (1999), Lejend Master's Lore (2000) and Beasts of Lejend (2000).|$|E

5|$|The Boadicea-class cruiser <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of scout cruisers {{built for}} the Royal Navy {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century. They were the first class of this type to be fitted with steam turbine machinery. Upon {{completion}} in 1909–10, the sister ships served as flotilla leaders for destroyer flotillas of the First Fleet until 1913 when they were assigned to battleship squadrons. When the First World War began in August 1914, they remained with their squadrons as the First Fleet was incorporated into the Grand Fleet, although they changed squadrons over the course of the war. Both ships were present during the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916, but neither fired a shot. They were converted into minelayers the following year and both ships laid minefields in early 1918 in addition to other missions. The sisters were reduced to reserve in 1919 and sold for scrap in 1921 and 1926.|$|E
5|$|In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief {{engineer}} Nolan Bushnell, {{designer of the}} first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw {{a demonstration of the}} Odyssey at a dealership. Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game. Alcorn soon developed Pong, which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and Williams Electronics for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a television screen. Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits. The root of the conflict <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of patents by Baer—one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off, specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.|$|E
