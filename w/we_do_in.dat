[...] We must also realize that space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities. What <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> space from here on in must become a normal and regular part of our national life and must therefore be planned in conjunction with all of the other undertakings which are also important to us."

500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so I just try to finish songs and {{get them out of the}} way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> rehearsal and just pick the best ideas and go. It wasn't like I said I wanted to be a producer or anything, it’s just that the demos I was making came closer to the finished product on one or two occasions, so now, I’m a producer.” ...|$|E
500|$|The pop rock album {{opens with}} the curtain call, {{strengthening}} {{the impression of}} a live recording rather than a studio album. Carlile performed [...] "Shadow on the Wall", [...] "Turpentine", and [...] "The Story", which had appeared on Carlile's second studio album The Story (2007). [...] "Looking Out", [...] "Before It Breaks", [...] "I Will", [...] "Dreams", and [...] "Pride and Joy" [...] had all appeared on Give Up the Ghost. Believing in the cultivation of standards, Carlile included six cover versions in the set list, three of which appear on the album. [...] "Sixty Years On", originally written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, was arranged by Paul Buckmaster. Carlile, a fan of the [...] "dark" [...] string arrangements that appear on John's album Tumbleweed Connection (1970), contacted Buckmaster on the advice of her manager. Carlile first heard the Hanseroth brothers singing Paul Simon's [...] "The Sound of Silence" [...] in 2009 and asked them to perform it during the set. She does not contribute vocals to the version that appears on the album. Carlile's cover of Leonard Cohen's [...] "Hallelujah", also arranged by Buckmaster, is followed by a hidden track: a cover of Alphaville's [...] "Forever Young". Carlile said the following of Cohen's song: [...] "Hallelujah" [...] {{is going to be a}} standard that our grandkids, our great-great grandkids will learn to sing in church. It's one of those really, really special songs. The thing that's going to make it that, besides that it's so great, is that everyone knows about it because hundreds of songwriters have been moved by that song and have covered it. And that's just something really important that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> every generation.|$|E

Howard Rheingold (2000) describes these globalised societies as self-defined networks, which resemble what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> real life.

2500|$|In 1936, philosopher Alfred Ayer {{considered}} the standard philosophical question of other minds: {{how do we}} know that other people have the same conscious experiences that <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> <b>In</b> his book, Language, Truth and Logic, Ayer suggested a protocol to distinguish between a conscious man and an unconscious machine: [...] "The only ground I can have for asserting that an object which appears to be conscious is not really a conscious being, but only a dummy or a machine, is that it fails to satisfy one of the empirical tests by which the presence or absence of consciousness is determined." [...] (This suggestion is very similar to the Turing test, but is concerned with consciousness rather than intelligence. Moreover, it is not certain that Ayer's popular philosophical classic was familiar to Turing.) In other words, a thing is not conscious if it fails the consciousness test.|$|E
