5|$|Ionescu-Caion was {{the founder}} of several magazines, most notably Românul Literar. Originally {{conceived}} as a literary supplement for the daily Românul, it became a tribune of Macedonski's Romanian Symbolist movement, and helped discover George Bacovia, the celebrated modern poet. During World War I, when he oscillated between the two opposing camps, Caion put out the journal Cronicarul. This <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> known activity in the Romanian press.|$|E
5|$|The sermon preached by Newton <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last,</b> {{of those}} that William Cowper heard in Olney, since Cowper's mental {{instability}} returned shortly thereafter. Steve Turner, author of Amazing Grace: The Story of America's Most Beloved Song, suggests Newton may have had his friend in mind, employing the themes of assurance and deliverance from despair for Cowper's benefit.|$|E
5|$|After Evans {{sold the}} Klan's former headquarters, it was {{purchased}} by the Catholic Church. The Cathedral of Christ the King was later built on the site. Evans attended the building's dedication and spoke highly of the service, surprising many observers. His attendance at the service <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> significant public appearance as Imperial Wizard: he stepped down soon afterwards, having become deeply unpopular {{with members of the}} Klan, who felt that he had embraced their enemies. He resigned on June10, 1939, and was replaced as Imperial Wizard by Colescott.|$|E

5|$|After an offseason {{contract}} {{dispute between}} Joss, Toledo and Cleveland, he debuted with the Cleveland club in April 1902. Joss {{led the league}} in shutouts that year. By 1905, Joss had completed the first of his four consecutive 20-win seasons. Off the field, Joss worked as a newspaper sportswriter from 1906 until his death. In 1908, he pitched a perfect game during a tight pennant race that saw Cleveland finish a half-game out of first place; it was the closest that Joss came to a World Series berth. The 1910 season <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last,</b> and Joss missed most of the year due to injury.|$|E
5|$|Benítez {{was also}} {{prepared}} {{to break up}} his winning side after the final {{with a number of}} players expected to leave the club to make way for new arrivals. One of those leaving was Vladimír Šmicer, who had scored Liverpool's second goal in Istanbul, and whose contract was known not to be renewed before the final, meaning he entered knowing the final <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> game for the club.|$|E
5|$|Cagney made a rare TV {{appearance}} in the lead role of the movie Terrible Joe Moran in 1984. This <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> role. Cagney's health was fragile and more strokes had confined him to a wheelchair, but the producers worked his real-life mobility problem into the story. They also decided to dub his impaired speech, using the impersonator Rich Little. The film made use of fight clips from Cagney's boxing movie Winner Take All (1932), {{despite the fact that}} the TV movie is about an entirely different character.|$|E

5|$|During the {{northern}} winter of 1926–27, Allen toured Argentina to play first-class cricket with an MCC team. When {{he returned to}} England, he played eight matches {{before the end of}} June, including a game for the MCC against the touring New Zealand team in which he scored a century and took ten wickets. In total, he scored 482 runs at an average of 43.81 and took 19 wickets; this <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> regular cricket until 1929. He declined an invitation to tour South Africa with an MCC team, and work limited him to two first-class games for Middlesex in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Ghosh {{admitted}} {{in an interview}} that after his two preceding directorial ventures—Aladin and Home Delivery (2005)—performed poorly at the box office, Kahaani <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> chance to create a niche as a director. He added that the film's plot twist came somewhat accidentally. Having described the skeleton of the story to a friend during its development, the friend called him back a few days later to enquire about his film. The friend had mistakenly imagined sequences which he assumed to be parts of the plot, from which the twist ending was derived.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Alfonsín {{supported}} a {{faction of the}} UCR that favoured the idea of carrying an independent candidate for the 2007 presidential elections. The UCR, instead of fielding its own candidate, endorsed Roberto Lavagna, a center-left economist {{who presided over the}} dramatic recovery in the Argentine economy from 2002 until he parted ways with President Néstor Kirchner in December 2005. Unable to sway enough disaffected Kirchner supporters, Lavagna garnered third place. Alfonsín was honoured by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner with a bust of his likeness at the Casa Rosada on October 1, 2008. This <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> public appearance.|$|E

After a month there, in which he pitched four games, going 1–3 with a 5.54 ERA, he returned to Newark to finish the season with the Bears, in what <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> professional baseball appearance.|$|E
5|$|The cover art for Amazing {{had been}} largely {{supplied}} by Ed Valigursky during the late fifties, but during the early sixties a much wider variety of artists appeared, including Alex Schomburg, Leo Summers and Ed Emshwiller. Frank Paul, who had painted all the covers {{for the first few}} years of Amazing, contributed a wraparound cover for the April 1961 35th anniversary issue; this <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> cover art for a science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|After Germany was {{eliminated}} in the semi-finals by Italy, Kahn {{was given the}} start for the third place play-off held on 8 July 2006, which Germany won 3–1 against Portugal. In what <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> international appearance for Germany, he also received the captaincy of the team {{in the absence of}} the injured Michael Ballack. Although overshadowed by Bastian Schweinsteiger’s game-winning performance in the match, Kahn played to a high standard, pulling off several saves. Kahn deflected a shot by Portuguese forward Pauleta after he beat the German defence, and later saved Deco's shot made from just inside the penalty area. Following the match, Oliver Kahn announced his retirement from the German National Team. Throughout his international career he earned 86 caps for Germany, including 49 as team captain. He never won a World Cup, but finished as runner-up in 2002 and third in 2006.|$|E

5|$|After {{spending}} the offseason hunting with Smoky Joe Wood, Coveleski {{returned to the}} Indians in 1921, and throughout the season, the Indians battled the Yankees for first in the American League. On September 26, the two teams faced off, but Coveleski failed to make it past the third inning; the Yankees won 8–7 to ensure they won the pennant. Coveleski pitched 315 innings in 1921, matching his career high from the year before, and had a 23–13 record and a 3.37 ERA. The following season, Coveleski married Frances Stivetts, the sister of his late wife. While he did cause the Yankees {{to move out of}} first place after winning an August 23 game against them, 4–1, it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> game of the season. He finished the year with a 17–14 record, the first time since 1917 he did not have 20 wins, and a 3.32 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Rovers {{denied that}} they were {{interested}} in signing Fortune-West in June 2003, before Doncaster Rovers of the Third Division signed him on a two-year contract. His first season with the club, 2003–04, saw him score 12 goals in 43 appearances as they won the Third Division championship, earning promotion to the Second Division. During this season, he formed a strike partnership with Gregg Blundell. Fortune-West suffered a knee injury caused by wear and tear to the knee joint in October 2004, which resulted in him undergoing surgery, before returning to the team in March 2005. He was to be offered a new deal in April 2005 and finished the season with 7 goals in 28 appearances. The 2005–06 season <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> with Doncaster, as he was released after scoring 4 goals in 33 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{during the}} ten-lap Milan criterium {{of the ninth}} stage, when the riders staged a protest over what they viewed as unsafe riding {{conditions}} in that stage and those that preceded it. The most visible cause for the protest was Rabobank rider Pedro Horrillo's accident during the eighth stage; Horrillo sustained numerous fractures and head injuries after tumbling over a barricade on the roadside while descending the Culmine di San Pietro. Horrillo fell more than , and nearly {{died as a result}} of his injuries. After spending five weeks in hospitals in both Italy and his native Spain, Horrillo eventually recovered, though the day on the Culmine di San Pietro <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> as a professional cyclist, as he retired before the 2010 season began.|$|E
