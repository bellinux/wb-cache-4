5|$|The brightly {{coloured}} pile of the bumblebee is an aposematic (warning) signal, {{given that}} females can inflict a painful sting. Depending on the species and morph, the warning colours range from entirely black, to bright yellow, red, orange, white, and pink. Dipteran {{flies in the}} families Syrphidae (hoverflies), Asilidae (robber flies), Tabanidae (horseflies), Oestridae (bot or <b>warble</b> flies) and Bombyliidae (bee flies) all include Batesian mimics of bumblebees, resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators.|$|E
5|$|Within {{its native}} Northern Hemisphere range, the first-year male common {{blackbird}} of the nominate race may start singing {{as early as}} late January in fine weather {{in order to establish}} a territory, followed in late March by the adult male. The male's song is a varied and melodious low-pitched fluted <b>warble,</b> given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches mainly in the period from March to June, sometimes into the beginning of July. It has a number of other calls, including an aggressive seee, a pook-pook-pook alarm for terrestrial predators like cats, and various chink and chook, chook vocalisations. The territorial male invariably gives chink-chink calls in the evening in an (usually unsuccessful) attempt to deter other blackbirds from roosting in its territory overnight. During the northern winter, blackbirds can be heard quietly singing to themselves, so much so that September and October are the only months in which the song cannot be heard. Like other passerine birds, it has a thin high seee alarm call for threats from birds of prey since the sound is rapidly attenuated in vegetation, making the source difficult to locate.|$|E

25|$|A PSK31 {{operator}} typically uses a single-sideband (SSB) transceiver {{connected to}} the sound card of a computer running PSK31 software. When the operator enters a message for transmission, the software produces an audio tone that sounds, to the human ear, like a continuous whistle with a slight <b>warble.</b> This sound is then fed through either a microphone jack (using an intermediate resistive attenuator to reduce the sound card's output power to microphone levels) or an auxiliary connection into the transceiver, from which it is transmitted.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{theories}} say Chile may derive {{its name}} from a Native American word meaning either [...] "ends of the earth" [...] or [...] "sea gulls"; from the Mapuche word chilli, which may mean [...] "where the land ends;" [...] or from the Quechua chiri, [...] "cold", or tchili, meaning either [...] "snow" [...] or [...] "the deepest point of the Earth".

2500|$|The Hungarian name tekerőlant and the {{alternate}} forgólant both mean [...] "turning lute." [...] Another Hungarian {{name for the}} instrument is nyenyere, which {{is thought to be}} an onomatopoeic reference to the repetitive <b>warble</b> produced by a wheel that is not even. This term was considered derogatory in the Hungarian lowlands, but was the normal term for the instrument on Csepel island directly south of Budapest. The equivalent names ninera and niněra are used in Slovakia and the Czech Republic respectively.

2500|$|According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the mid 18th century {{origin of}} the term {{hurdy-gurdy}} is onomatopoeic in origin, after the repetitive <b>warble</b> in pitch that characterizes instruments with solid wooden wheels that have warped due to changes in humidity or after {{the sound of the}} buzzing-bridge. Alternately, the term is thought to come from the Scottish and northern English term for uproar or disorder, hirdy-girdy or from hurly-burly, an old English term for noise or commotion. The instrument is sometimes more descriptively called a wheel fiddle in English, but this term is rarely used among players of the instrument. Another possible derivation is from the Hungarian [...] "hegedűs" [...] (Slovenian variant [...] "hrgadus") meaning a fiddle.|$|E

[...] The Independents Andy Gill wrote that Ys [...] "leaves one in no doubt of her oddball credentials" [...] and [...] "rarely, if ever, has an artist so assiduously cultivated cult status". Among negative assessments, Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard called the album [...] "hard to stomach" [...] and plagued by overlong tracks [...] "with meandering strings-and-things accompaniment and indulgent vocal quirks that make Björk sound like Kelly Clarkson." [...] Robert Christgau, in his [...] "Consumer Guide" [...] column for MSN Music, wrote {{that much of the}} [...] "sprightly" [...] qualities of The Milk-Eyed Mender had been [...] "subsumed here by ambition, to be kind, and privilege, to be brutally accurate", and that the album's songs [...] "reveal only that her taste for the antique is out of control".|$|E

Sullivan then noted that [...] "the long arm of the Knowles family extends into every cranny – dad Mathew produces, sister Solange co-writes, Beyoncé bellows – but their efforts produce surprisingly diluted secular R". On the contrary though, Sullivan wrote that [...] "Williams's strength is a shimmery jazz lilt, put to beguiling use on the sunny Purpose in Your Storm and Never Be the Same". Emily Sogn of PopMatters also praised [...] "Never Be The Same", for its [...] "bouncy synth bass" [...] and [...] "Williams's sweetly plaintive vocals", likening Williams' [...] "pleasingly slow paced" [...] "singing style" [...] on the song [...] "to her pop contemporaries like Ashanti and Janet Jackson". Sogn also described the [...] "radio-friendly head shaker" [...] "The Incident" [...] as a [...] "high point" [...] on the album, praising it for [...] "showcasing Williams's syrupy <b>warble</b> to good effect". Sogn praised [...] "15 Minutes" [...] for its [...] "compelling" [...] "subject matter", commenting that [...] "the song showcases what sounds like a sincere ambivalence to her success, musing about what might have been, perhaps {{in an attempt to}} empathize with former Destiny's Child members LeToya and LaTavia, who were dumped off the roller coaster before the band hit its peak just before she joined in 2000". Sogn also described [...] "No One Like You" [...] as [...] "similarly successful", due to its [...] "gospel feel", [...] "start-stop harmonized vocals and clap-worthy rhythm". Sogn concluded her review by describing the album as [...] "a decent, yet not spectacular sophomore effort", noting that [...] "while it might not enough to ensure her a successful career outside of her contributions to Destiny's Child, it isn’t without its particular merits and shining moments".
