40|$|The construction, {{commissioning}} and hand-over <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> manufacturing {{buildings have}} become increasingly controlled by the requirements of regulatory agencies. Legislation requires {{that the process of}} validation is undertaken to establish that the facility is constructed in-line with the principles <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>Good</b> Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The validation process acts to ensure that the construction and building services systems are designed, installed and operate as intended and do not affect the quality of the manufactured product. A central objective of this thesis is to examine the sequential validation process and influencing factors that contribute to the facility attaining agency approval. A comprehensive review of the available literature indicates that projects regularly fail to meet their regulatory objectives due to the building provider and client's differing understanding and views of the validation process and of GMP. From this literature a validation model is derived and proposes that the design, installation and operation stages of the validation activity are time-series dependant sub-processes controlled through sensing, feedback and comparison. The research was largely qualitative, case-study based and used an interpretivist approach to analysis, which relied on participant observation and grounded theory techniques. Additional, external validation of the model was sought by collecting and analysing empirical data from an industry questionnaire The results of the study demonstrate that significant deviations between the model and the data exist and measures to construct compliant pharmaceutical buildings are often underdeveloped and result in unsuccessful project outcomes. The criteria by which the success of any construction project is judged are normally time, cost and quality. Time and cost are readily measurable, but the meaning of quality, in relation to the validation activity, can be more elusive and this {{is at the root of}} the problem of successful validation <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> buildings.

40|$|Background: In the United Kingdom, {{pharmaceutical}} {{services can}} be delivered by both community pharmacies (CPs) and dispensing doctor practices (DPs). Both must adhere to minimum standards set out in NHS regulations; however, no common framework exists to guide quality improvement. Previous phases of this research had developed a set of characteristics indicative <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> service provision. Objective: To ask key stakeholders to confirm, and rank the importance of, a set <b>of</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> service provision. Methods: A two-round Delphi-type survey was conducted in south-west England and was sent to participants representing three stakeholder groups: DPs, CPs and patients/lay members. Participants were asked to confirm, and rank, {{the importance of these}} characteristics as representing <b>good</b> quality <b>pharmaceutical</b> services.

The purpose of this Master's thesis is to provide a conceptual systematic presentation of the actual global serialization and traceability requirements in pharmacy and therefore show how to introduce a sustainable and efficient IT system meeting all the demands from the perspective <b>of</b> a manufacturing <b>pharmaceutical</b> company using a practical example. To support the complex decision-making of the best fit solution for our implementation from a set of possible traceability solution systems, the computer program designed for multi-attribute decision making DEXI was used. The SAP Aii/OER traceability solution was selected as the most suitable one and therefore all the aspects of the architectural design comprise SAP as a central component and an interface of the architectural installation. To ensure a holistic approach to the analysis and visualization <b>of</b> the <b>pharmaceutical</b> company business process, the Archimate tool was applied as an enterprise architecture modelling language. The Archimate presentation encompassed the enterprise, application and technical levels. The results of the preparation conducted showed the practical implementation of the SAP Aii/ OER system through the use of ASAP methodology considered as a standard approach in the field of the AS systems.

40|$|Orientation: Today, {{knowledge}} is a commodity and thus skilled knowledge workers, particularly in management positions, are vital for organisations’ success; their increased turnover has an {{adverse effect on}} productivity and profitability. High staff turnover is a cause for alarm, {{not only because of}} the costs associated with recruitment, selection and training, but also due to the increasing scarcity of experienced talent. Research purpose: This research investigates the reasons for the turnover of middle and senior managers in the pharmaceutical industry in South Africa in order to identify the possible reasons and formulate solutions to address the issue. Motivation for the study: In South Africa, employment, retention and turnover occur against the backdrop of a history of discrimination and inequality and attempts by government and organisations at redress. The significance of this background cannot be underestimated. Research approach, design and method: This study was qualitative and inductive to allow dominant themes to emerge from the raw data. Data was collected through in-depth, semi-structured one-on-one interviews as well as a review of company turnover reports and employment equity reports. Main findings: The study found that in the sampled organisations, employee turnover averaged almost 22 % per annum between 2007 and 2010. Reasons for the turnover include a range of industry, company and personal factors. Practical/managerial implications: The overall turnover rate remains high, particularly amongst black knowledge workers, the attraction, recruitment and retention of whom is as important for addressing historical inequities in the local industry as it is for ensuring the diversity that companies need to reach a bigger market and gain a competitive edge. Further, as government is a significant purchaser <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>goods</b> and services, companies must ensure that the required Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) rating level is achieved so they can continue to win government business. Contribution: The research found that it is important that the turnover rate of knowledge workers in the South African pharmaceutical industry be reduced through addressing the personal, organisational and industry factors that the workers themselves view as important, rather than giving consideration only to what human resource managers perceive as important. In particular, sufficient significance must be placed on personal factors. </p...|$|R

Yet, too frequently managers fail {{to identify the}} appropriate situations in which collaborations can be efficient, as their dynamics are not fully investigated. We examine multidisciplinary collaborations, their pertinent agents and complementary network capabilities in the context <b>of</b> the <b>pharmaceutical</b> industry. We focus on three research issues: a) how do multidisciplinary partnerships operate in the pharmaceutical industry? b) at what level are they most relevant (e. g. for knowledge external to the company, or internal) ? c) what are the main challenges and benefits of multidisciplinary collaborations? We analysed empirical data from two different innovative pharmaceutical firms: a global top-ten corporation based in UK and an international firm located in a small/medium European economy.
