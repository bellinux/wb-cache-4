5|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} elements of the painting is the ring on the model's ring finger. Resting on the mantle piece, it becomes a {{focal point of the}} composition. The ring was a device of which Whistler was conscious; it had not been present in The <b>White</b> <b>Girl.</b> Though he and Hiffernan were not married, the ring showed a development in how he represented her in his art; from prostitute in Wapping, to mistress in The <b>White</b> <b>Girl,</b> and finally a wife in The Little <b>White</b> <b>Girl.</b> At the same time, this development reflected Whistler's notion of his own position in the English art world: towards greater legitimacy. The ring is also an allusion to the Christian sacrament of marriage, which lends a religious aspect to the aestheticism that he and Swinburne were trying to develop.|$|E
5|$|To Whistler himself, {{however, the}} {{painting}} was not old-fashioned, but rather an expression of something new and innovative. By naming it Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler highlighted his emphasis on composition, rather than subject matter. The use of a musical title was also {{an expression of the}} theory of corresponding arts, which was an idea developed by the French poet Charles Baudelaire. These tendencies became more and more dominant in Whistler's art over time. His two earlier paintings Symphony in White, No. 1 and Symphony in White, No. 2 had originally been titled The <b>White</b> <b>Girl</b> and The Little <b>White</b> <b>Girl</b> respectively, and later been renamed by the artist. Whistler had originally intended to call this work Two Little White Girls, but the development of his artistic philosophy made him change his mind, and from the time of its first exhibition it has been called by its musical title.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship of race and rural/urban setting to physical, behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental factors associated with physical activity. Subjects included 1, 668 eighth-grade girls from 31 middle schools: 933 from urban settings, and 735 from rural settings. Forty-six percent of urban girls and 59 % of rural girls were Black. One-way and two-way ANOVAs with school as a covariate were {{used to analyze the}} data. Results indicated that most differences were associated with race rather than setting. Black girls were less active than <b>White</b> <b>girls,</b> reporting significantly fewer 30 -minute blocks of both vigorous and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Black girls also spent more time watching television, and had higher BMIs and greater prevalence of overweight than <b>White</b> <b>girls.</b> However, enjoyment of physical education and family involvement in physical activity were greater among Black <b>girls</b> titan <b>White</b> <b>girls.</b> Rural <b>White</b> <b>girls</b> and urban Black girls had more favorable attitudes toward physical activity. Access to sports equipment, perceived safety of neighborhood, and physical activity self-efficacy were higher in <b>White</b> <b>girls</b> than Black girls...|$|R

5|$|The 1863 Salon des Refusés was {{the same}} {{exhibition}} where Édouard Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe caused a scandal, yet the attention given to Whistler's <b>White</b> <b>Girl</b> was even greater. The controversy surrounding the paintings was described in Émile Zola's novel L'Œuvre (1886). The reception Whistler's painting received was mostly favourable, however, and largely vindicated him after the rejection he had experienced both in London and in Paris. It was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends Manet, the painter Gustave Courbet and the poet Charles Baudelaire. The art critic Théophile Thoré-Bürger {{saw it in the}} tradition of Goya and Velázquez. There were, however, those who were less favourable; certain French critics saw the English Pre-Raphaelite trend as somewhat eccentric.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} follows Lisa Wilson (Venetta Rogers), an African-American girl, as she visits {{her friend}} Tabitha Stephens (Erin Murphy), a <b>white</b> <b>girl.</b> Meanwhile, Tabitha's father Darrin Stephens (Dick Sargent), {{who works at}} an advertising agency, fails to land a million-dollar account with toy company owner Mr. Brockway (Parley Baer) because Mr. Brockway is racist and incorrectly believes Darrin {{to be married to}} Lisa's mother Dorothy (Janee Michelle). In an attempt to convince Mr. Brockway to overcome his bigotry, Darrin's wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery), who is a witch, casts a spell on Mr. Brockway so he sees everyone, including himself, as having black skin.|$|E
5|$|Whistler {{created the}} {{painting}} {{in the winter of}} 1861–62, though he later returned to it and made alterations. It was rejected both at the Royal Academy and at the Salon in Paris, but eventually accepted at the Salon des Refusés in 1863. This exhibition also featured Édouard Manet's famous Déjeuner sur l'herbe, and together the two works gained a lot of attention. The <b>White</b> <b>Girl</b> shows clearly the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with whom Whistler had recently come in contact. The painting has been interpreted by later art critics both as an allegory of innocence and its loss, and as a religious allusion to the Virgin Mary.|$|E

5|$|Whistler {{submitted}} {{the painting to}} the Academy, but according to Heffernan, he {{expected it to be}} rejected at this point. The previous year, in 1861, another painting had caused a minor scandal. Edwin Henry Landseer's The Shrew Tamed showed a horse with a woman resting on the ground nearby. The model was named as Ann Gilbert, a noted equestrienne of the period: however it was soon rumoured that it was actually Catherine Walters, the notorious London courtesan. Whistler's painting was reminiscent enough of Landseer's that the judges were wary of admitting it. <b>White</b> <b>Girl</b> was submitted to the Academy along with three etchings, all three of which were accepted, while the painting was not.|$|E
5|$|Veronica meets Parker Lee (Julie Gonzalo), who annoys both Veronica and Mac. Veronica, Parker, Mac, Wallace, and Piz go to a concert. Veronica {{talks about}} Piz’s {{problem at the}} concert, and three kids say that they saw a <b>white</b> <b>girl</b> who was faking being fat. Dick shows up at Mac’s door and tells her that Beaver never cared about her. Veronica finds Piz’s guitar, and they visit the seller. The seller’s {{description}} matches that of other people. Veronica talks to Piz about a suspect, {{but he says that}} it doesn’t match the woman he saw. Keith and the bail-jumper’s car gets stranded. Veronica signs up for the mentoring program in criminology class, and she notices that one of the kids at the concert has a criminal record. Dick gets beaten up when he talks to another man’s girlfriend, but Logan tases the man. Veronica finds the Welcome Wagon girl, the seller’s husband.|$|E
5|$|Irataba {{assisted}} Captain Lorenzo Sitgreaves {{during his}} 1851 {{exploration of the}} Colorado. On March 19, 1851, a family of Mormon settlers, the Oatmans, who were traveling by wagon train {{in what is now}} Arizona, were attacked by a band of Western Yavapai, probably the Tolkepaya. They captured two survivors of the attack: the 14-year-old Olive Oatman and her 7-year-old sister, Mary Ann. After a year with the Yavapai, the girls were sold to the Mohave, and adopted into the Oach clan where they lived with the family of a Mohave man called Tokwatha (Musk Melon) a friend of Irataba. Olive remained with the Mohave until February 22, 1856, when Tokwatha, having been warned that having a <b>white</b> <b>girl</b> among them might be seen as an offense by whites, brought her to Fort Yuma carpenter Henry Grinnell, releasing her in return for two horses and some blankets and beads. Irataba may have learned about Anglo-Americans and their society from Oatman, and knowing her may have contributed to his generally favourable disposition towards Whites.|$|E

25|$|Sergeant Rutledge (Ford Productions-Warner Bros, 1960) was Ford's last cavalry film.

During 1960, Ford made his third TV production, The Colter Craven Story, a one-hour episode of the network TV show Wagon Train, which included footage from Ford's Wagon Master (on which the series was based). He also visited the set of The Alamo, produced, directed by, and starring John Wayne, where his interference caused Wayne to send him out to film second-unit scenes which were never used (nor intended to be used) in the film.|$|E
500|$|Symphony in White, No. 1, {{also known}} as The <b>White</b> <b>Girl,</b> is a {{painting}} by James Abbott McNeill Whistler.

The model is Joanna Hiffernan, the artist's mistress. Though the painting was originally called The <b>White</b> <b>Girl,</b> Whistler later started calling it Symphony in White, No. 1. By referring to his work in such abstract terms, he intended to emphasise his [...] "art for art's sake" [...] philosophy.|$|E

By referring to his work in such abstract terms, he intended to emphasize his [...] "art for art's sake" [...] philosophy.

500|$|The {{facts of}} {{what took place}} in the store are still disputed. [...] According to what Jones said at the time, the other boys {{reported}} that Till had a photograph of an integrated class at the school he attended in Chicago, and Till bragged to the boys that the white children in the picture were his friends. He pointed to a <b>white</b> <b>girl</b> in the picture, or referred to a picture of a <b>white</b> <b>girl</b> that had come with his new wallet, and said she was his girlfriend and {{one or more of the}} local boys dared Till to speak to Bryant. However, writing a personal account of the incident in a book released in 2009, Till's cousin Simeon Wright, who was also present, disputed Jones' version of what happened on that day. According to Wright, Till did not have a photo of a <b>white</b> <b>girl</b> in his wallet and no one dared him to flirt with Bryant. Speaking in 2015, Wright said, [...] "We didn't dare him to go to the store — the white folk said that. They said that he had pictures of his white girlfriend. There were no pictures. They never talked to me. They never interviewed me." [...] The FBI report completed in 2006 notes [...] "...Jones recanted his 1955 statements prior to his death and apologized to Mamie Till-Mobley".|$|E
500|$|Whistler painted The Little <b>White</b> <b>Girl</b> in 1864, with Hiffernan as his model. In 1865 it was {{exhibited}} at the summer exhibition of the Royal Academy; Whistler had offered The <b>White</b> <b>Girl</b> for the 1862 exhibition, {{but it had been}} rejected. English critics were not too impressed by the painting; one in particular called it [...] "bizarre", while another called it [...] "generally grimy grey". In 1900, however, {{it was one of the}} pictures Whistler submitted to the Universal Exhibition in Paris, where he won a grand prix for paintings. The first owner of the painting was the wallpaper manufacturer John Gerald Potter, a friend and patron of Whistler. In 1893 it came into the possession of Arthur Studd, who gave it to the National Gallery in 1919. In 1951 it was transferred to the Tate Gallery.|$|E
