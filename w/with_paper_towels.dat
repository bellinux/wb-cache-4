She was being held because her abdomen was noticeably swollen (she claimed to be pregnant), and a search of her body had revealed that she was wearing two pairs of elastic underpants and had lined her crotch area <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels.</b> This is done because balloon swallowing makes bowel movements difficult to control.

50|$|In 1907, the Scott Paper Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{introduced}} paper tissues to {{help prevent}} the spread of colds from cloth towels in restrooms. Popular belief is that this was partly accidental and was the solution to a railroad car full of long paper rolls meant for toilet paper that were unsuitable to cut into rolls of toilet paper. In 1919, William E. Corbin, Henry Chase, and Harold Titus began experimenting <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> in the Research and Development building of the Brown Company in Berlin, New Hampshire. By 1922, Corbin perfected their product and began mass-producing it at the Cascade Mill on the Berlin/Gorham line. This product was called Nibroc Paper Towels (Corbin spelled backwards). In 1931, the Scott Paper Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, introduced their paper towel rolls for kitchens; they are now the leading manufacturer of paper towels.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{reduction}} in litter and waste in comparison <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels,</b> which cannot be recycled, hand dryers are claimed to {{be better for the}} environment. Another study shows that whereas the majority of the environmental impact of a hand dryer occurs during its use, the environmental impact of paper towels is predominantly in the material production and manufacturing stages. It is estimated that hand dryers use 5% less energy than paper towels in the first year, and 20% less over five years. A World Dryer study of 102 hand dryers installed in public schools in Topeka, Kansas, claimed an annual savings of 34.5 tons of solid waste, 690,000 gallons of water,and 587 trees; another World Dryer study of 153 hand dryers in the Iowa state capitol showed an annual savings of 10.5 tons of solid waste and 176 trees. However, a Dutch study published in March 1995 indicated that there was environmental parity between hand dryers and paper towels as hand drying methods when all factors were taken into consideration.|$|E

Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes.

40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an {{automatic}} identification technology, relying on storing and remotely retrieving data using devices called RFID tags. This technology {{is being used}} in enterprise supply chain management-related applications to improve the efficiency of inventory tracking and management. However, this technology {{has not been able}} to realize its promised potential because of several factors, such as lack of congruous worldwide standards, privacy issues and less than perfect read rates in supply chain applications. This research aimed to evaluate the readability issues commonly faced by tagged cases of palletized consumer products. The variables studied in this research were product-package type, tag type, tag location on cases, pallet pattern and forklift speed through a RFID portal representative of a dock door in a warehouse. To determine which variables were the most significant, a binary logistic regression was run. The number of tags read was inputted for the number of events and total number of products per pallet as the number of trials. The variables product content, pallet pattern, and speed, and all interactions were then included in the model. It was observed that readability greatly varies for different product-package systems, <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> producing near-perfect reads, followed by bottled water and carbonated soda cans. The slower the forklift truck speed, the better the readability across the board, and the best pallet patterns were dependent on the product-package type.

Materials and methods. Molecules FR- 72, FR- 121 and FR- 154 were synthesized de novo according to described synthetic protocols. Clean and healthy bulbs of Allium cepa (2 n = 16), previously immersed in distilled water, were dried <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> and placed directly into test tubes filled with the test substance. The experiments were carried out at room temperature 20 ± 2 °C and were kept in darkness. The period of exposure of bulbs was 120 hours; the roots used for the genotoxicity evaluation were on average of 2 to 2. 5 cm in length. The evaluation {{of the effect of}} the three quinolinic molecules on the growth of onion roots of Allium cepa bulbs was achieved using different concentrations of the three growth parameters (EC 50, IM, ACs) The evaluated substances performed aneugenic actions, operating at cellular and molecular structure level and preventing the fixing of mitotic spindle fibers, causing the movement of chromosomes in the anaphase or loss of chromosomes, even inducing apoptosis by exceeding the homeostatic capacity of the cell. Conclusions. The preliminary analysis indicated that molecule FR- 121 at 10 - 6 M concentration and molecule FR- 154 at 10 - 3 M concentration, proved to be potent phytotoxic agents causing various claustogenic and aneugenic aberrations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the present}} study was to report the {{occurrence}} of members of the Mollicutesclass in the reproductive system of dairy cattle in Brazil. Five farms containing dairy cattle were visited in January of 2012. In total, 100 cows of different ages, breeds and stages of lactation were examined in the present study. The cows were part of intensive or semi-intensive management systems and were submitted to mechanical milking or hand milking. The samples were collected after washing the vulvar region with water and soap, and then drying it <b>with</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> and disinfecting the area with alcohol (70 °GL). Vaginal mucous was collected using a sterile alginate cotton swab, which was rubbed on the vagina, as well as the lateral and internal walls. Vulvovaginal mucous samples were cultured in both liquid and solid modified Hayflick´s medium, for mycoplasmas, and UB medium, for ureaplasmas. The PCR assays for Mollicutesand Ureaplasmaspp. were performed according to the standard protocols described in the current literature. During isolation, the frequency of Mycoplasmaspp. was of 13. 0 % (13 / 100) and for Ureaplasmaspp. was of 6. 0 % (6 / 100). In the PCR assays the frequency of Mollicuteswas of 26. 0 % (26 / 100) and for Ureaplasmaspp. was of 13. 0 % (13 / 100) in the dairy cattle studied. This is the first report of these agents in reproductive system of bovine of the Pernambuco state.
