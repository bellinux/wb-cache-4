40|$|Let P be {{a set of}} n {{points in}} the plane. A crossing-free {{structure}} on P is a plane graph with vertex set P. Examples of crossing-free structures include triangulations of P, spanning cycles of P, also known as polygonalizations of P, among others. There has been {{a large amount of}} research trying to bound the number of such structures. In particular, bounding the number of (straight-edge) triangulations spanned by P has received considerable attention. It is currently known that every set of n points has at most O(30 n) and at least Ω(2. 43 n) triangulations. However, much less is known about the algorithmic problem of counting crossing-free structures of a given set P. For example, no algorithm for counting triangulations is known that, on all instances, performs faster than enumerating all triangulations. In this paper we develop a general technique for computing the number of crossing-free structures of an input set P. We apply the technique to obtain algorithms for computing the number of triangulations, matchings, and spanning cycles of P. The running time of our algorithms is upper bounded by n O(k), <b>where</b> <b>k</b> <b>i...</b>|$|E

By the mean of this formulation we prove first that the homothetie map between the standard 3 Sphere of radius R, S 3 R ae R 4, and S 3 1, is the unique minimizer, modulo isometries, of the Skyrme energy, in it's homotopy class, for any R less than some critical value R 0 2 (p 3 = 2; p 2]. We establish some stability result for this Skyrme-form problem from which we can recover the result of M. Loss [3] and N. S.

40|$|We {{deal with}} n-player AT {{stochastic}} games, where AT stands for additive transitions. These are stochastic {{games in which}} the transition probability vector ps(as), for action combination as ða 1 s; [...] .; an s Þ in state s, can be decomposed into player-dependent components as: psðasÞ Xn k i s pi sðai sÞ; i 1 <b>where</b> <b>k</b> <b>i</b> s 20; 1 Š for all players i, andP n i 1 ki s 1, and where pi sðai sÞ is a probability distribution on the finite set of states S. Here, k i s reflects the influence of player i on the transitions in state s. As such the class of AT stochastic games covers several other well-known classes such as perfect information stochastic games, stochastic games with switching control, and socalled ARAT stochastic games. With respect to the average reward {{it is not clear}} whether e-equilibria always exist in general n-player stochastic games. For the class of n-player AT games we establish the existence of 0 -equilibria, although the strategies involved may be history dependent. In addition we have the following results for the two-player case: (1) for zero-sum AT games, stationary 0 -optimal strategies always exist; (2) for two-player general-sum AT absorbing games, there always exist stationary e-equilibria, for all e> 0. Several examples are provided to clarify the issues and to demonstrate the sharpness of the results...|$|E
