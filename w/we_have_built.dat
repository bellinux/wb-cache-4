According to Narain, [...] "our urban sprawls such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Srinagar, etc., have not paid adequate attention to the natural water bodies that exist in them. In Chennai, each of its lakes has a natural flood discharge channel which drains the spillover. But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>built</b> over many of these water bodies, blocking the smooth flow of water. We have forgotten the art of drainage. We only see land for buildings, not for water." [...] According to research conducted by CSE, Chennai had over 600 lakes in the 1980s, but a master plan published in 2008 showed only a fraction of them to be in a healthy condition. State records have shown the total area of 19 major lakes shrank from 1,130 hectares in the 1980s to around 645 hectares in the early 2000s, reducing their storage capacity.|$|E

2500|$|Within the Crypt is Gutzon Borglum's massive Abraham Lincoln Bust. The {{sculptor}} had {{a fascination}} with large-scale art and themes of heroic nationalism, and carved the piece from a six-ton block of marble. Borglum carved the bust in 1908, and it was donated to the Congress by Eugene Meyer, Jr., and accepted by the Joint Committee on the Library, in the same year. The pedestal was specially designed by the sculptor and installed in 1911. The bust and pedestal were {{on display in the}} Rotunda for many years until 1979 when, after a rearrangement of all sculpture in the Rotunda, they were placed in the Crypt. Borglum was a patriot; believing that the [...] "monuments <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>built</b> are not our own," [...] he looked to create art that was [...] "American, drawn from American sources, memorializing American achievement", according to a 1908 interview article. Borglum's depiction of Lincoln was so accurate, that Robert Todd Lincoln, the president's son, praised the bust as [...] "the most extraordinarily good portrait of my father I have ever seen." [...] Supposedly, according to legend, the marble head remains unfinished (missing a left ear) to symbolize Lincoln's unfinished life.|$|E

2500|$|He noted {{further that}} Hamas had removed {{significant}} sections of their constitution {{which called for}} Israel's destruction, though the basic idea remains the same: Israel cannot be allowed to remain as a Jewish state in the Middle East.

Now we are proving that we also understand politics better than the others." [...] Abu Tir's final thought on Israeli negotiation was to leave it to the new parliament [...] "as with every matter, to be discussed and decided upon in a rational manner". After Hamas's landslide victory in January 2006 many countries decided to back Israel's decision to cut foreign aid to The Palestinian Authority. After being asked what Hamas planned to do in light of this Abu Tir stated that Hamas [...] "would not go to foreign donors on [...] bended knee". In a 6 February 2006 open letter to Newsweek International Tir stated that [...] "The European Union and America should cooperate with us. We have ways of creating understanding among our people. We are facilitators, helpers, aides. The presence of Hamas is a guarantee of safety and stability in the region. Any money that is given to us will be channelled to the correct path." [...] As he tried to address Western fears that donations would go to buy arms Tir told the West to [...] "... be afraid...we can always find arms on the black market. It is obvious that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>built</b> our military infrastructure in that way. Our weapons are the only guarantee of our existence. If a proper Palestinian state were established, then all the militias would melt inside the Palestinian Army." [...] Summing up his letter Tir attempted to ease western anxiety about Hamas by stating that [...] "The West has nothing to fear from Hamas. We're not going to force people to do anything. We will not impose Sharia. Hamas is contained. Hamas deals only with the Israeli occupation. We are not Al Qaeda." ...|$|E
