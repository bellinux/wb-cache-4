[...] While the process doesn't produce smoke, {{the brightness of}} the arc in GTAW can break down surrounding air to form ozone and nitric oxides. The ozone and nitric oxides react with lung tissue and moisture to create nitric acid and ozone burn. Ozone and nitric oxide levels are moderate, but exposure duration, repeated exposure, and {{the quality and quantity of}} fume extraction, and air change in the room must be monitored. Welders who do not <b>work</b> <b>safely</b> can contract emphysema and oedema of the lungs, which can lead to early death. Similarly, the heat from the arc can cause poisonous fumes to form from cleaning and degreasing materials. Cleaning operations using these agents should not be performed near the site of welding, and proper ventilation is necessary to protect the welder.|$|E

Examples include the Lipizzan stallions of the Spanish Riding School in Vienna, Austria, where the entire group of stallions live {{part-time}} in a bachelor herd as young colts, then are stabled, train, perform, and travel worldwide as adults with few if any management problems. [...] However, even stallions who are unfamiliar with each other can <b>work</b> <b>safely</b> in reasonable proximity if properly trained; {{the vast majority of}} Thoroughbred horses on the racetrack are stallions, as are many equine athletes in other forms of competition. [...] Stallions are often shown together in the same ring at horse shows, particularly in halter classes where their conformation is evaluated. [...] In horse show performance competition, stallions and mares often compete in the same arena with one another, particularly in Western and English [...] "pleasure"-type classes where horses are worked as a group. Overall, stallions can be trained to keep focused on work and may be brilliant performers if properly handled.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Working</b> <b>safely</b> and {{successfully}} in highly automated human-machine interfaces of future aviation {{is not only}} a matter of performance, but also of personality. This study examines which personality aspects correlate with safety-critical performance in human-machine teams. The research tools HTQ (Hybrid Team Questionnaire) and HINT (Hybrid Interaction Scenario) were combined for a comprehensive exploratory study. The HTQ includes personality scales measuring broad factors of personality (Big Five) as well as more specific scales and was added with objective personality assessments to measure risk taking. The simulation tool HINT simulates relevant processes in future human-machine team interaction in aviation. In a study with 156 applicants for aviation careers, safety-critical relations of some facets of general personality as well as risk taking were found. Especially personality aspects concerning disinhibiting, spontaneous behaviour and sensation seeking show correlations with poorer performance in the HINT simulation...|$|R

As the FA class locos aged they were themselves replaced by WW class 4-6-4Ts and BB class 4-8-0 locomotives. Finally in 1952 AB class 4-6-2 Pacifics were introduced.

The software component includes the closed loop vehicle control as well as environment perception. As this is a safety-critical software component, it is important that this software <b>works</b> <b>safely</b> and within projected performance boundaries. This paper discusses the verification and validation approach for the sampling-based mission planner of an unmanned rotorcraft. A layered test strategy is presented, which utilizes different testing methods that complement and build upon each other. Its strengths as well as the possible improvement directions of this approach are discussed. An emphasis is given on automated software-in-the-loop simulations. The approach additionally utilizes benchmarks to assess the implementation performance and real time properties. Finally, to be able to assess the overall test quality, a set of different scalable test abstractions (SUT size, test effort, level of automation, coverage, test complexity and feedback time) is used to analyze the presented strategy...|$|R
