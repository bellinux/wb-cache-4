500|$|By February 1969, Redding {{had grown}} weary of Hendrix's {{unpredictable}} {{work ethic and}} his creative control over the Experience's music. During the previous month's European tour, interpersonal relations within the group had deteriorated, particularly between Hendrix and Redding. In his diary, Redding documented the building frustration during early 1969 recording sessions: [...] "On the first day, as I nearly expected, there was nothing doing... On the second it was no show at all. I went to the pub for three hours, came back, {{and it was still}} ages before Jimi ambled in. Then <b>we</b> <b>argued...</b> On the last day, I just watched it happen for a while, and then went back to my flat." [...] The last Experience sessions that included Redding—a re-recording of [...] "Stone Free" [...] for use as a possible single release—took place on April 14 at Olmstead and the Record Plant in New York. Hendrix then flew bassist Billy Cox to New York; they started recording and rehearsing together on April 21.|$|E
500|$|In his written {{confession}} {{released by}} Peruvian police, Van der Sloot recounted that he briefly left {{the hotel to}} get some coffee and bread, and returned to find Flores using his laptop computer without his permission. A police source stated {{that she may have}} found information linking him to the disappearance of Holloway. An altercation allegedly began, and she attempted to escape. According to the aforementioned written confession released by Peruvian authorities, Van der Sloot stated, [...] "I did not want to do it. The girl intruded into my private life [...] [...] [...] she didn't have any right. I went to her and I hit her. She was scared, <b>we</b> <b>argued</b> and she tried to escape. I grabbed her by the neck and hit her." [...] Van der Sloot reportedly stated that he was stoned on marijuana at the time. A detective linked to the case said that Van der Sloot considered getting rid of the body in a suitcase, but decided against it because he would have been stopped at the front desk. He then reportedly drank espresso and took amphetamines to counter fatigue before fleeing.|$|E

His arguments appeal to syntactic constraints and intractability. <b>We</b> <b>argue</b> that arguments based on syntactic constraints are not satisfactory. <b>We</b> then <b>argue</b> that the argument via intractability is not satisfactory either. We also discuss various {{approaches to the}} problem of abduction in a computationalist setting. <b>We</b> <b>argue</b> that the social solution that human everyday cognitive activity is not isotropic and Quinean is correct. Secondly, <b>we</b> <b>argue</b> that the local solution is too preliminary a proposal. We give our objections concerning the calculation of the effect to effort ratio and the claim that memory organization leads one to relevant information. Thirdly, <b>we</b> <b>argue</b> that the natural language approach is circular. Fourthly, we arguedthat the web search approach provides a partial account of finding relevant information but leaves out the key problem of evaluating the search results. Fifthly, <b>we</b> <b>argue</b> that the global workspace approach relegates {{the most important part of}} the solution to consciousness. In the end, we give a framework sketching mechanisms that could solve the problem of abduction. published_or_final_versionPhilosophyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

[...] Despite the disagreements, Grant proceeded to publish his views in the Militant. Looking back in 1992 Taaffe argues that Grant should have been challenged in writing. Such a challenge would have meant the formation of factions in 1987.|$|E

Specifically, <b>we</b> <b>argue</b> for the following hierarchy: AdvP> SuperP> AdvP> CompP> AdvP> DegP> AdjP. Evidence for the variety of projections hosting the adverbial markers comes from the variety of adverbial constructions in Cantonese.

40|$|<b>We</b> <b>argue</b> {{that the}} main {{objections}} against two central tenets of a Jamesian account of the emotions, i. e. that (1) different types of emotions are associated with specific types of bodily feelings (Specificity), and that (2) emotions are constituted by patterns of bodily feeling (Constitution), do not succeed. In the first part, <b>we</b> <b>argue</b> that several reasons adduced against Specifity, including one inspired by Schachter and Singer’s work, are unconvincing. In the second part, <b>we</b> <b>argue</b> that Constitution, too, can withstand most of the objections raised against it, including the objection that bodily feelings cannot account for the outward-looking and evaluative nature of emotions. In both sections, <b>we</b> <b>argue</b> that the kinds of felt bodily changes posited by a Jamesian account of emotions are best {{understood in terms of}} felt states of action-readiness...|$|R

Finally, we re-evaluate Cummins' interpretation of differences in children's performance on deontic and indicative versions of Wason's selection task. ...|$|R
