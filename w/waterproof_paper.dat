5000|$|After {{graduation}} he {{was hired}} by Dr. Robert Marchesseault, the Head of the Department of Chemistry, to work on a special project for Domtar Inc. Using Ziegler-Natta catalysts, Diallo was to determine how to make <b>waterproof</b> <b>paper</b> from rolls of paper in movement. There was nothing new. It was easier to make <b>waterproof</b> <b>paper</b> in a stable position rather than on the rolls of paper that are produced in factories. The team had built a mechanical system for the purpose of conducting this experiment. At one side, the paper unrolled, went in the solvent, and then entered in the catalysts in which it was injected with a gas, ethylene. Ziegler-Natta catalysts controlled the size of the polymers (polyethylene) inside and outside the paper at the movement. The paper went out of the products, travelled a distance of two feet, the time needed to be dried. Then the dried paper wound around a bar to make a roll of <b>waterproof</b> <b>paper.</b> Several tests were then performed. Diallo put one piece of paper in water for one day and another for one week to find out if they absorbed water. The final product was sent to Domtar at Pointe-Claire. There, paper was submitted to a pressure of 1,000 pounds in order to homogenize the surface of the paper.|$|E

5000|$|One common item {{made in the}} 19th {{century in}} America was the paper canoe, most famously made by Waters & Sons of Troy, New York. The {{invention}} of the continuous sheet paper machine allows paper sheets {{to be made of}} any length, and this made an ideal material for building a seamless boat hull. The paper of the time was significantly stretchier than modern paper, especially when damp, and this was used to good effect in the manufacture of paper boats. A layer of thick, dampened paper was placed over a hull mold and tacked down at the edges. A layer of glue was added, allowed to dry, and sanded down. Additional layers of paper and glue could be added to achieve the desired thickness, and cloth could be added as well to provide additional strength and stiffness. The final product was trimmed, reinforced with wooden strips at the keel and gunwales to provide stiffness, and <b>waterproofed.</b> <b>Paper</b> racing shells were highly competitive during the late 19th century. Few examples of paper boats survived. One of the best known paper boats was the canoe, the [...] "Maria Theresa," [...] used by Nathaniel Holmes Bishop to travel from New York to Florida in 1874-75.

50|$|The {{artificial}} ice {{was constructed}} by laying {{several layers of}} <b>waterproof</b> <b>paper</b> and wool. On top of this was built a 4-inch tall watertight pan, which held the water. In the pan were three and one-half miles of {{one and a half}} inch pipe which held ammonia, cooled below the freezing point of water. The cold pipes then caused the ice to freeze. The construction of the rink had been opposed by local churches in the area that were concerned about the noise made by the crowds enjoying the facility.|$|E

50|$|A paceband is a wristband, {{sometimes}} {{made of a}} {{strip of}} <b>waterproof</b> <b>paper,</b> that lists expected split times for a running race.

This is the most efficient racing pace from a cardiovascular and muscle energy perspective. Erratic running speeds, particularly the urge to sprint early in a race while feeling fresh, consume energy inefficiently. A glance at the paceband and stopwatch as each distance marker is passed allows the athlete to quickly determine if they are running too fast for their targeted finishing time or too slowly and adjust accordingly.|$|E

5000|$|The {{choice of}} paint {{color on the}} walls in Victorian homes {{was said to be}} based on the use of the room. Hallways that were in the entry hall and the stair halls were painted a somber gray so as not to compete with the {{surrounding}} rooms. Most people marbleized the walls or the woodwork. Also on walls it was common to score into wet plaster to make it resemble blocks of stone. Finishes that were either marbleized or grained were frequently found on doors and woodwork. [...] "Graining" [...] was meant to imitate woods of higher quality that were more difficult to work. There were specific rules for interior color choice and placement. The theory of “harmony by analogy” was to use the colors that lay next to each other on the color wheel. And the second was the “harmony by contrast” that was to use the colors that were opposite of one another on the color wheel. There was a favored tripartite wall that included a dado or wainscoting at the bottom, a field in the middle and a frieze or cornice at the top. This was popular into the 20th century. Frederick Walton who created linoleum in 1863 created the process for embossing semi-liquid linseed oil, backed with <b>waterproofed</b> <b>paper</b> or canvas. It was called Lincrusta and was applied much like wallpaper. This process made it easy to then go over the oil and make it resemble wood, leather or different types of leather. On the ceilings that were 8-14 feet the color was tinted three shades lighter than the color that was on the walls and usually had a high quality of ornamentation because decorated ceilings were favored.|$|R
50|$|Since then, the {{umbrella}} {{has come into}} general use, in consequence of numerous improvements. In China people learned how to <b>waterproof</b> their <b>paper</b> umbrellas with wax and lacquer. The transition to the present portable form is due, partly, to the substitution of silk and gingham for the heavy and troublesome oiled silk, which admitted of the ribs and frames being made much lighter, and also to many ingenious mechanical improvements in the framework. Victorian era umbrellas had frames of wood or baleen, but these devices were expensive and hard to fold when wet. Samuel Fox invented the steel-ribbed umbrella in 1852; however, the Encyclopédie Méthodique mentions metal ribs {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century, and they were also on sale in London during the 1780s. Modern designs usually employ a telescoping steel trunk; new materials such as cotton, plastic film and nylon often replace the original silk.|$|R

50|$|Before {{the forming}} of the ARL, the United States Army had {{research}} facilities {{dating back to}} 1820 when the laboratory at Watertown Arsenal, Massachusetts, studied pyrotechnics and <b>waterproof</b> <b>paper</b> cartridges. This facility would evolve into the Materials Technology Laboratory. Most pre-WWII military research occurred within the military by military personnel, but in 1945, the Army published a policy affirming the need for civilian scientific contributions in military planning and weapons production. Non-military involvement before this time was frequent; however, methods for contribution to warfare technology was on limited and incidental basis. On June 11, 1946, a new research and development division of the War Department General Staff was created; however, due to internal forces within the military which supported the traditional technical service structure the division was closed. A variety of reorganizations took place {{over the next four}} decades, which put many organizations in command of Army research and development. Often commanders of these organizations were advocates of the reorganization, while some middle level management was opposed to the change.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} of compressing a color between two {{sheets of paper}} or two other materials gave rise to unexpected fantastic images. The artist analyzed the causality of phenomena that may be considered accidental. In other words, it is to introduce {{the power of the}} will in the creation of such phenomena, by developing a technique and practice. This process expresses the reflection, change, succession, and the fact of going beyond, beside, and between etc. Obtained by a non-reproducible process, the métagraphie implies that the artist makes the slide watercolor on <b>waterproof</b> <b>paper,</b> then lets it have the chance to act on the matter. His own response is to find the right balance between the fluidity of watercolor and the exposure time. There are similar techniques, such as pressed oil, starch-pressed, and the decal. But the manner and the choice of material of Mizui are different. An international critic of Fine Arts, Sakae Hasegawa, said in 1984: [...] "When I saw this painting for the first time, I thought this was a picture of a snowy mountain. But looking closer, it was not a picture and this picture had a strong resonance in me, it perceives cold silence. I find this painting conveys a philosophical and meditative opening, as if he could let the silence of the heart.".|$|E

Rectangular platinum shapes were used as the counter electrode and a saturated copper sulfate electrode as reference. The working electrode was a cuboid, and its material was Q 235 steel. The steel electrode was embedded in epoxy resin so that only a 1 -cm 2 area of the cuboid was exposed to the soil. Before the experiment, the working electrode was polished gradually using 600 – 1200 grid, <b>waterproof</b> abrasive <b>paper.</b> It was then washed with distilled water, degreased with acetone, and washed with ethanol.

40|$|Background: Many {{studies on}} surface {{modifications}} of titanium {{have been performed}} {{in an attempt to}} accelerate osseointegration. Recently, anatase titanium dioxide has been found to act as a photocatalyst that expresses antibiotic properties and exhibits hydrophilicity after ultraviolet exposure.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of exposure to this BV-LD on surface modifications of titanium with the goal of enhancing osteoconductive and antibacterial properties. Methods: The surfaces of pure commercial titanium were polished with # 800 <b>waterproof</b> polishing <b>papers</b> and were treated with anatase titania solution. Specimens were exposed using BV-LD (λ = 405 nm) or an ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV-LED, λ = 365 nm) at 6 mW/cm 2 for 3 h. The surface modification was evaluated physically and biologically using the following parameters or tests: surface roughness, surface temperature during exposure, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, contact angle, methylene blue degradation tests, adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, osteoblast and fibroblast proliferation, and histological examination after implantation in rats. Results: No significant changes were found in the surface roughness or XRD profiles after exposure. BV-LD exposure did not raise the surface temperature of titanium.

30|$|To {{determine}} the breeding system, pollination experiments {{were performed on}} randomly chosen from 10 trees in the population. On each plant, 4 to 10 inflorescences (depending on availability on each plant) were randomly tagged and {{only one of the}} treatments assigned to each inflorescence (i.e. to every single flower on that inflorescence). Inflorescences (n[*]=[*] 6 for each treatment) subjected to hand-pollination were bagged with thick <b>waterproof</b> <b>paper</b> bags before anthesis and bagged again after hand-pollination. The pollination bags were partly opened 5  days after each treatment to monitor fruit set. When required, the flowers were emasculated on the day of anthesis, before the anthers dehisced. The following treatments were conducted (Saunders and Sedonia, 2006): (1) Control: the flowers were tagged and left to open pollination; (2) Geitonogamy: emasculated and bagged flowers were hand-pollinated using pollen from the same plant but from another flower (to test for self-compatibility); (3) Xenogamy: emasculated and bagged flowers were hand-pollinated using pollen from different plants (to test for outcrossing ability); (4) Cross-pollination under natural conditions: uncovered and emasculated flowers were pollinated freely (to test for pollen limitation); (5) Autogamy: flower buds were bagged and isolated from visitors (to test for autonomous self-pollination within a single flower); (6) Apomixis: flowers were bagged and emasculated before anthesis (to test for the agamospermy).|$|E
40|$|The {{problem with}} a tent {{is that when you}} use it you throw it away, so it’s money that melts. ”–Alejandro Aravena The social project of {{architecture}} has long been fascinated with emergency and refugee housing as a primary unit of architectural and urban development. For decades, architects have proposed alternatives to the United Nations’ blue tent cities that are the principal image associated with humanitarian aid and its resulting urbanism. During the 2016 Venice Biennale Reporting from the Front, curator Alejandro Aravena challenges architects to reconsider the discipline’s relationship to society’s most urgent challenges. The ongoing European refugee crisis is one such ‘Front’ and this research examines the viability of an alternative to the polyvinylchloride (PVC) tarp as the default condition of emergency and refugee housing.

40|$|Leaf litter {{can be an}} {{important}} food resource in small forest streams, but its availability to detritivorous macroinvertebrates depends on stream retentiveness. Previous work in Hong Kong streams revealed a scarcity of large detritivores, and it is possible that this reflects the availability or instability of litter resources. Using leaf analogues made from <b>waterproof</b> <b>paper,</b> we undertook short-term experiments to measure the retentiveness of eight Hong Kong streams under baseflow conditions during the dry season; four streams had coarse bed sediments (boulder dominated) and four had relatively fine sediments (cobble-gravel dominated). Initially we compared the transport properties of soaked and unsoaked leaf analogues with the leaves of four native trees in one of the streams. Soaked and unsoaked analogues were used to mimic waterlogged and newly-fallen leaves. Mean travel distances (Sp) of leaves and analogues in the study streams ranged from 1 - 22 m. These are comparable to values recorded from similar-sized streams in temperate latitudes. Unsoaked analogues traveled further (mean Sp = 10. 2 m versus 3. 1 m) than soaked analogues in all study streams, but retention behaviour of analogues generally matched that of real leaves. Mean travel distances of both analogue types were unrelated to streambed sediment size or sediment heterogeneity, but travel distance of soaked analogues was positively related to stream discharge. Litter retention remained high over a six-day period in one of the streams, suggesting that litter would be readily available to detritivores during periods with stable discharge, and that the scarcity of shredders must be caused by other factors. © 2011 E.

5000|$|Åkerlund & Rausing {{produced}} {{all sorts}} of paper packaging for dry staple groceries, but Rausing was determined {{to find a way}} to pre-package liquids like milk and cream, and spent large sums on developing a viable package. The goal was to provide optimal food safety, hygiene and distribution efficiency using a minimum amount of material, according to the subsequently famous credo that a package should [...] "save more than it costs". The new package had to be sufficiently cheap to be able to compete with loose milk, meaning that a minimum of material waste and a maximum of production efficiency needed to be obtained.In 1943, the Åkerlund & Rausing lab started to work on developing the milk carton, and, in 1944, came up with the idea of constructing a tetrahedron-shaped package out of a tube of paper. The idea was simple but efficient, making optimal use of the material involved. After some initial hesitation, Rausing understood the potential of the package and filed for a patent on 27 March 1944. The rest of the 1940s were spent developing viable packaging materials and solving the technical problems of filling, sealing, and distribution. It was reportedly Rausing’s wife Elisabeth who came up with the idea of continuously sealing the packages through the milk while filling the tube in the manner of stuffing sausages, to prevent oxygen from entering the package. In 1946, a model for a packaging machine was presented by engineer Harry Järund, and in collaboration with Swedish paper mills and foreign chemical companies a viable paper for packaging was finally produced when coating carton paper with polyethylene, which made the <b>paper</b> <b>waterproof</b> and allowing for heat-sealing during filling.|$|R
