5|$|Chopra {{said in an}} {{interview}} that Saif Ali Khan and Vidya Balan were not the first choices for the lead roles in Parineeta. In fact Abhishek Bachchan was being cast as Shekhar and Saif Ali Khan as Girish. However Abhishek walked out of the project and Saif readily was accepted as a replacement. This fact was corroborated by Saif in {{an interview}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that even though Sarkar had faith in his abilities, Chopra was not too keen on having him.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{was interviewed}} by police in November 1985, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> Winston Silcott had led the attack with a machete; he told the court in 2014 that {{that had been a}} mistake. The court heard that, during Nove's 1992–1994 investigation, police offered Levin {{immunity}} from prosecution, gave him £5,000 and paid for a flight from Spain when he missed his flight home from a holiday. They approached him again in January 2008 for his testimony and helped him with expenses and a deposit for accommodation.|$|E

5|$|After pushing Max away, Donna finally invites him to {{the club}} to see her perform. When he arrives she {{performs}} a set, speaking about how she is pregnant and planning to have an abortion. Max leaves, but {{on the day of}} Donna's abortion, he arrives at her home with flowers and asks if he can accompany her to her procedure. While at the clinic he tells her he supports her, and that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{that he wanted to be}} a grandfather, he meant sometime far in the future. The two agree that this is one of the nicest Valentine's Days they have ever had. After the abortion, Max takes Donna to his home where he makes her tea, and then they watch Gone with the Wind together.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January, Marsden arrests Ian after Janine {{told her}} that Ian took {{advantage}} of her, stole Archie's laptop, which had a recording of them having sex on it, and dumped it in the canal. Ian refuses to talk, but when Marsden shows him CCTV footage of him dumping the laptop, and then shows him the recovered laptop, he admits visiting Archie on Christmas Day, claiming that Archie was threatening him. He wanted to delete the recording and denies murdering Archie, but Marsden charges him. Days later, Janine tells Marsden she saw Ian leave the Queen Victoria on Christmas Day but the bust of Queen Victoria was on the bar after he left. Marsden places Janine at the scene, but she also denies murdering Archie. Marsden tells Ian that although the murder charge will be dropped, he will still be charged with burglary and theft of Archie's laptop. She and DC Wayne Hughes (Jamie Treacher) attend Archie's funeral, watching people's reactions {{in the hope of}} a new lead. Peggy returns to Archie's grave; when Marsden asks why, she explains that she didn't believe him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> his cancer had returned.|$|E
5|$|Tomorrow Never Dies was {{the first}} of three Bond films to be adapted into books by then-current Bond novelist Raymond Benson. Benson's version is {{expanded}} from the screenplay including additional scenes with Wai Lin and other supporting characters not in the film. The novel traces Carver's background as the son of media mogul Lord Roverman, whom Carver blackmails into suicide, later taking over his business. The novel also attempts to merge Benson's series with the films, particularly by continuing a middle-of-the-road approach to John Gardner's continuity. Notably it includes a reference to the film version of You Only Live Twice where he states that Bond was lying to Miss Moneypenny <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he had taken a course in Asian languages. Tomorrow Never Dies also mentions Felix Leiter, although it states that Felix had worked for Pinkertons Detective Agency, which is thus exclusive to the literary series. Subsequent Bond novels by Benson were affected by Tomorrow Never Dies, specifically Bond's weapon of choice being changed from the Walther PPK to the Walther P99. Benson {{said in an interview that}} he felt Tomorrow Never Dies was the best of the three novelisations he wrote.|$|E

It was only this. [...] "Boys of the black flag, {{this is to be}} quickly done. Take all the prisoners you can. If they don't yield, kill the children to make them. Forward!"

25|$|January 1996: A {{listener}} from Penang {{called in}} {{during one of}} Patrick's show to relate his recent experience {{with a member of}} the police force. At a roadblock, a policeman had stopped him for allegedly drinking and driving, and asked for a bribe from the listener. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{that he did not have}} money with him, the policeman allegedly told him that he could call someone to bring him the money. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that he did not have a phone, the policeman allegedly offered him the use of his mobile phone. After the show, SAC Supian Amat lodged a police report against Patrick under the instruction of Rahim Noor, then the IGP of Malaysia, resulting in Patrick being called to the police station for interviews. The media went to town with this issue; famous local cartoonist Lat drew a satirical cartoon on the incident which was published in the New Straits Times.|$|E
25|$|Dange's magnum opus was {{severely}} criticised by historian D.D. Kosambi, {{who said that}} in order to defend Engels, he had to deny Dange.

Kosambi was especially severe <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> ‘Marxism is not a substitute for thinking, but a tool of analysis which must be used, with a certain minimum of skill and understanding, upon the proper material.|$|E

25|$|The stage from Luchon to Carcassonne in 1962 set off 10 {{minutes later}} than {{scheduled}} because the German rider, Hans Junkermann, had been ill {{most of the}} night.

25|$|On July 23, 2007, Dahle became {{subject to}} media {{attention}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that the Taliban and other Afghan rebels had the full right to fight Norwegian soldiers stationed in Afghanistan.

Dahle later replied to the criticism, saying that he did not support the death of Norwegian military personnel.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{intricate}} details of Einem's alibi and {{his version of}} events, his story had two huge problems. It completely contradicted his initial statement of his whereabouts on 5 June 1983, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{he had been in}} bed with the flu. Furthermore, the quantity of fibres on Kelvin's clothes was far too large to suggest that Kelvin was in his company for only two hours. Given these facts, on 25 May 1984, Magistrate Nick Manos ordered Einem to stand trial for the murder of Richard Kelvin.|$|E

25|$|After the Scarman Report on {{the riots}} was published, Powell {{gave a speech}} on 10 December in the Commons. Powell {{disagreed}} with Scarman <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that the black community was alienated because it was economically disadvantaged: the black community was alienated because it was alien. He claimed tensions would worsen because the nonwhite population was growing: whereas in Lambeth it was 25%, of those of secondary school age it was 40%. Powell said {{that the government should}} be honest to the people by telling them in thirty years' time, the black population of Lambeth would have doubled in size.|$|E
25|$|Kramarsky's family put the {{painting}} up for auction at Christie's New York on May 15, 1990, where it became famous for Ryoei Saito, honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co., paying US$82.5 million for it, making it then the world's most expensive painting. Two days later Saito bought Renoir's Bal du moulin de la Galette for nearly as much: $78.1 million at Sotheby's. The 75-year-old Japanese businessman briefly caused a scandal <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{he would have}} the Van Gogh painting cremated with him after his death, though his aides later said Saito's threatening to burn the masterpiece was just an expression of intense affection for it.|$|E
25|$|The second Remington {{trial began}} in January 1953 with Judge Vincent L. Leibell presiding. It lasted only eight days. The jury found Remington guilty of two counts, for lying <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{he had not}} given secret {{information}} to Elizabeth Bentley {{and that he did}} not know of the existence of the Young Communist League, which had a chapter at Dartmouth while Remington was a student there. Leibell sentenced Remington to three years in prison. While his attorneys prepared another appeal, Remington began his sentence at Danbury Federal Correctional Institution where he became friends with fellow prisoner, nonviolent action theorist Gene Sharp, before being transferred to Lewisburg. The appeals court upheld the original verdict, and in February 1954, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.|$|E
