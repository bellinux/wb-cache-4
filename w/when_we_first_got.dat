[...] Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Tom Hamilton had {{performed}} the song prior to joining Aerosmith.

[...] Steven's band had played 'Train' and Tom and I played it in our band... It's a blues song, if you follow its roots all the way back... I always thought if I could just play one song, {{it would be that}} one because of what it does to me".

5000|$|The Adolescents' Blue Album lineup reunited in 2001 {{to play a}} {{birthday}} party for Reflex's wife. Over {{the next few years}} the band played sporadically, including opening for Bad Religion at a benefit for Flipside and a headlining slot at Los Angeles' Galaxy Theater, but always as a revival act. Royer soon left and was replaced by Derek O'Brien, formerly of Social Distortion, D.I., and Agent Orange. Encouraged by the response to their reunion shows, Reflex suggested that the band start writing new material. Frank Agnew remarked that [...] "When we were in Soto's apartment, it reminded me a lot of <b>when</b> <b>we</b> very <b>first</b> <b>got</b> together. The three of us—the three original members who were putting songs together in Tony's garage—it almost had the same nostalgic vibe, sitting around and throwing out ideas." [...] The Adolescents issued an EP titled Unwrap and Blow Me! in 2003, limited to 100 copies and consisting of six new songs: [...] "Hawks and Doves", [...] "Where the Children Play", [...] "California Son", [...] "OC Confidential", [...] "Pointless Teenage Anthem", and [...] "Within These Walls". A live album and concert film, Live at the House of Blues, was recorded that October and featured performances of [...] "OC Confidential", [...] "California Son", [...] "Hawks and Doves", [...] "Within These Walls", and another new song, [...] "Lockdown America".|$|R

60|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{occasion}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> on speaking terms on the road by the quarry, I {{had to admit that}} she presented some points of a problematic appearance. I don't know why I imagined Captain Anthony as the sort of man who would not be likely to take the initiative; not perhaps from indifference but from that peculiar timidity before women which often enough is found in conjunction with chivalrous instincts, with a great need for affection and great stability of feelings. Such men are easily moved. At the least encouragement they go forward with the eagerness, with the recklessness of starvation. This accounted for the suddenness of the affair. No! With all her inexperience this girl could not have found any great difficulty in her conquering enterprise. She must have begun it. And yet there she was, patient, almost unmoved, almost pitiful, waiting outside like a beggar, without a right to anything but compassion, for a promised dole.|$|E

5000|$|Man, we {{was only}} 18-19 <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> started. When We broke up {{we were still}} like 28. Now we are 35-36. It'd be real {{different}} being in the studio.

50|$|Crook&Flail, a {{production}} duo consisting of Andrew Broder of Fog and Adam Drucker aka Doseone, wrote the score. They worked {{with several other}} musicians on the score, including Mike Patton, Stuart Braithwaite, Zach Hill, Justin Broadrick, George Cartwright, Matt Darling and Paul Metzger. In an interview with Pitchfork Media in August 2009, Adam Drucker described the process of collaborating with Alan Moore, Mitch Jenkins and Andrew Broder:We get to score Unearthing, so it's now become this big, organic sort of collaboration between the four of us. We basically did two hours of reading <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> it, and it's extremely dense. I {{remember the first time}} I read it... I didn't {{know what to do with}} myself. But as we listened to it, it's full of recurring themes, and all this recurring writing breaks and reconstructs its phrasings over and over again throughout. So we kinda found those motifs, brought them all in and out, and then made holes in it, where we made things recur and then patched the holes...|$|E

In Westport their supporting gig on October 22, 1966 we found out that Jeff had left the band and Jimmy was playing lead guitar by himself. I watched him {{from the edge of the}} stage and all I can say is that he knocked my tits off. They did 'Train Kept A-Rollin' and it was just so heavy. They were just an un-fuckin'-believable band.|$|E
5000|$|Dirty Penny {{formed in}} Santa Cruz, California. They gained {{popularity}} by winning a [...] "Battle of the Bands" [...] run by jpotmusic.com. Their {{music has been}} described as [...] "glittery-glam", [...] "sex-fueled", and [...] "leather-encased". It is reminiscent of 80's glam metal made popular by the likes of Mötley Crüe, Poison, Guns N' Roses, RATT, and Skid Row. Dirty Penny was originally a Poison cover band, ironically called Antidote. They later had to drop Antidote due to a Dutch band of the same name.Dirty Penny has since played at all 3 Rocklahoma Festivals, and is working on playing 2010.Bassist Tyno Molinaro (Tyno Vincent) said this about the band: [...] "We were into old-school punk, like The Misfits, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> into music, then got into glam as a fuck-you to our hometown...But punk's got a lot of rules, and that's not very punk. Rock'n'roll doesn't have any rules -- everybody can do drugs or not do drugs or dress however they want. A lot of people are tired of the screamo/I'm-not-okay thing. It's like, everyone's not okay, you know? Forget about it. Have fun. That's what you do with music -- you forget about your shit."“Antidote was like our training wheels when we were learning how to play, but I consider the start of our band as being when we became Dirty Penny and recorded our album...There are a lot of haters...We’re labeled a cover band in Santa Cruz and that’ll probably never change, but it’s cool to go out and experience respect for what we’re doing now from older metal bands.” ...|$|E
