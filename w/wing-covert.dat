50|$|The {{subspecies}} {{found in}} the Western Ghats is sometimes separated as tehminae (named after the wife of Salim Ali) and is more olive above, has fine spots on the black throat and the <b>wing-covert</b> spots are not distinct.|$|E
5000|$|An adult spotted nightjar's head is {{speckled}} grey, {{with black}} central crown feathers and rufous to buff edges, while {{the sides of}} the head are blackish with tawny spots. The hind-neck is a rufous or buff collar often flecked with black marks. Upper parts are mid-grey with tawny or rufous and black streaks. Wing-coverts are speckled grey to blackish, often with pronounced buff to rufous spots. Four outermost primary <b>wing-covert</b> feathers feature white patches forming a distinctive speculum. The mid-throat has a pair of large oval white patches, while the upper throat is blackish with buff spots. The tawny lower throat and breast feature blackish-brown bars often flecked with grey, while underparts are tawny to ochre. [...] Although the species is generally considered monotypic, adult females may tend to be a slightly lighter and paler tawny colour around the back, under-parts and collar, while also having slightly less prominent white markings on the outer wing-coverts. Juveniles have finely patterned upper parts and are redder overall than adults, with a single narrow black central stripe along the crown. The white outer <b>wing-covert</b> patterns are smaller and less pronounced, usually surrounded with ochre margins. The juvenile's breast is greyer and more finely mottled with dusky bars extending onto the belly. Downy young hatch with a uniform cover of short, reddish-brown down, shortly after which they moult into their juvenile plumage.|$|E
50|$|The {{passenger}} pigeon was sexually dimorphic {{in size and}} coloration. It weighed between 260 and 340 g (9 and 12 oz). The adult male was about 39 to 41 cm in length. It had a bluish-gray head, nape, and hindneck. On {{the sides of the}} neck and the upper mantle were iridescent display feathers that have variously been described as being a bright bronze, violet or golden-green, depending on the angle of the light. The upper back and wings were a pale or slate gray tinged with olive brown, that turned into grayish-brown on the lower wings. The lower back and rump were a dark blue-gray that became grayish-brown on the upper tail-covert feathers. The greater and median <b>wing-covert</b> feathers were pale gray, with a small number of irregular black spots near the end. The primary and secondary feathers of the wing were a blackish-brown with a narrow white edge on the outer side of the secondaries. The two central tail feathers were brownish gray, and the rest were white. The tail pattern was distinctive as it had white outer edges with blackish spots that were prominently displayed in flight. The lower throat and breast were richly pinkish-rufous, grading into a paler pink further down, and into white on the abdomen and undertail covert feathers. The undertail coverts also had a few black spots. The bill was black, while the feet and legs were a bright coral red. It had a carmine-red iris surrounded by a narrow purplish-red eye-ring. The wing of the male measured 196 - 215 mm, the tail 175-210 mm, the bill 15-18 mm, and the tarsus was 26-28 mm.The adult female {{passenger pigeon}} was slightly smaller than the male at 38 to 40 cm in length. It was duller than the male overall, and was a grayish-brown on the forehead, crown, and nape down to the scapulars, and the feathers {{on the sides of the}} neck had less iridescence than those of the male. The lower throat and breast were a buff-gray that developed into white on the belly and undertail-coverts. It was browner on the upperparts and paler buff brown and less rufous on the underparts than the male. The wings, back, and tail were similar in appearance to those of the male except that the outer edges of the primary feathers were edged in buff or rufous buff. The wings had more spotting than those of the male. The tail was shorter than that of the male, and the legs and feet were a paler red. The iris was orange red, with a grayish blue, naked orbital ring. The wing of the female was 180-210 mm, the tail 150-200 mm, the bill 15-18 mm, and the tarsus was 25-28 mm.The juvenile passenger pigeon was similar in plumage to the adult female, but lacked the spotting on the wings, and was a darker brownish-gray on the head, neck, and breast. The feathers on the wings had pale gray fringes (also described as white tips), giving it a scaled look. The secondaries were brownish-black with pale edges, and the tertial feathers had a rufous wash. The primaries were also edged with a rufous-brown color. The neck feathers had no iridescence. The legs and feet were dull red, and the iris was brownish, and surrounded by a narrow carmine ring. The plumage of the sexes was similar during their first year.|$|E

50|$|The two {{white-fronted goose}} species differ little {{other than in}} size (the lesser, at 53 - 66 cm length and with a 120 - 135 cm wingspan, is {{not much bigger than}} a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) but both may be readily {{distinguished}} from the greylag goose by their bright orange legs and their mouse-coloured upper <b>wing-coverts.</b> The greylag goose has a flesh-coloured bill and legs, and the upper <b>wing-coverts</b> are bluish-grey.|$|R
5000|$|On average, sun parakeets weigh {{approximately}} 110 g (4 oz) and {{are around}} 30 cm (12 in) long. They are sexually monomorphic.Adults have a rich yellow crown, nape, mantle, lesser <b>wing-coverts,</b> {{tips of the}} greater <b>wing-coverts,</b> chest, and underwing-coverts. The face and belly are orange with red around the ears. The base of the greater <b>wing-coverts,</b> tertials, and base of the primaries are green, while the secondaries, tips of the primaries, {{and most of the}} primary coverts are dark blue. The tail is olive-green with a blue tip. From below, all the flight feathers are dark greyish. The bill is black. The legs and the bare eye-ring are grey, but the latter often fades to white in captivity (so using amount of grey or white in the eye-ring for determining [...] "purity" [...] of an individual can be misleading). It is easily confused with the closely related jandaya parakeet and sulphur-breasted parakeet, but the former has entirely green <b>wing-coverts,</b> mantle and vent, while the latter has green mottling to the mantle and less orange to the underparts. The sun parakeet is also superficially similar to the pale-billed golden parakeet.|$|R
50|$|The {{adults of}} both sexes are alike but juveniles have pale spots on the upperparts, a mottled breast and buff tips to the <b>wing-coverts.</b>|$|R

50|$|Common cuckoos {{in their}} first autumn have {{variable}} plumage. Some are have strongly-barred chestnut-brown upperparts, while others are plain grey. Rufous-brown birds have heavily-barred upperparts with some feathers edged with creamy-white. All have whitish edges to the upper <b>wing-coverts</b> and primaries. The secondaries and greater coverts have chestnut bars or spots. In spring, birds hatched {{in the previous year}} may retain some barred secondaries and <b>wing-coverts.</b> The most obvious identification features of juvenile common cuckoos are the white nape patch and white feather fringes.|$|R
50|$|The young {{resemble}} the female, {{but in the}} youngest stage the bright edges to the plumage of the upper parts are absent, and the greater <b>wing-coverts</b> are edged with white.|$|R
50|$|The upper <b>wing-coverts</b> {{are dark}} brown, {{as in the}} white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) and the lesser white-fronted goose (A. erythropus), but differing from these in having narrow white fringes to the feathers.|$|R

The head, neck and lower chest are buffish, the crown and nape are cinnamon, the upperparts and (often incomplete) chest-band are grey, the belly and flight feathers are black, and the <b>wing-coverts</b> are whitish (though not contrasting strongly with the grey upperparts). The bill, throat-wattle and bare skin {{around the eyes}} are blackish and the legs are red. The throat-wattle is smaller, the bill is shorter, the <b>wing-coverts</b> are greyer, the lower chest is paler and the cinnamon on the crown and nape is brighter and more extensive {{when compared to the}} black-faced ibis.|$|R
50|$|The Madeiran {{wood pigeon}} closely resembled the wood pigeon of {{mainland}} Europe, but the plumage was somewhat darker, {{especially on the}} upperparts and under <b>wing-coverts.</b> The vinous-pink of the breast was more extensive.|$|R
50|$|The {{closely related}} pink-footed goose (A. brachyrhynchus) has the bill short, bright pink in the middle, and the feet also pink, the upper <b>wing-coverts</b> being nearly {{of the same}} bluish-grey as in the greylag goose.|$|R

40|$|Amongst {{the last}} birds {{received}} from Mr. Stampfli, {{there was a}} very peculiar new Owl, which I propose to name Bubo lettii, after its discoverer Mr. Lett, our former landlord and huntsman at Schieffelinsville. This Owl shows no affinity to any of the Owls at present known from the old world, but might rather be compared with the West-Indian Bubo cristatus, on account of the exceedingly long ear-tufts and the white alar spots. General color rufous, forehead, superciliary streak, chin and upper throat pearly gray, slightly vermiculated with earthy brown, which latter color predominates on occiput, hind neck and ear-tufts. Eye-lashes and feathers in front of the eye black, cheeks and ear-coverts rufous, with darker vermiculations. Sides of throat white, each feather broadly tipped with black. Mantle, back, rump and upper tail-coverts uniform rufous, tail rufous, with seven broad black bars. Wings rufous, the quills and <b>wing-coverts</b> broadly barred with black. Four of the median <b>wing-coverts</b> have a large white oval spot on the outer web near the tip. Lesser <b>wing-coverts</b> and primary coverts almost black, tipped with rusty brown; scapulars rufous, strongly vermiculated with pearly and dark brown, the outer ones white on the outer web, with a broad black terminal edge, forming together a conspicuous longitudinal white row. Under <b>wing-coverts</b> rufous, with a patch of dark brown {{near the edge of the}} wing. Entire chest rufous, with paler vermiculations, breast and flanks pale fulvous, with very conspicuous dark brown shaft-streaks, abdomen, vent, thighs, tarsi and under tail-coverts uniform fulvous.

50|$|The Jackson's {{hornbill}} (Tockus jacksoni) is {{a species}} of hornbill in the family Bucerotidae. It is only found in North West Kenya and North East Uganda. Except for the dense white spots on the <b>wing-coverts,</b> it resembles, and is often considered a subspecies of, Von der Decken's hornbill.|$|R
50|$|In {{adult males}} the upperparts {{including}} {{head and neck}} are grey-brown and have large spots on <b>wing-coverts.</b> In adult females the light-rufous morph {{is similar to the}} adult male however with the dark rufous morph the hind neck patch extends onto mantle and it has barring on the chest.|$|R
5000|$|The Polynesian ground dove is a small, plump ground dove that {{displays}} sexual dimorphism. The male Polynesian ground doves of the nominate subspecies have white foreheads, cheeks, throats, and breasts. The crown, nape, and auricular stripe are grey. The upperparts are a dark olive grey {{with purple}} or, if the feathers have faded, chestnut red iridescence on the hindneck and <b>wing-coverts.</b> The underparts are blackish. In males of the subspecies albicollis, {{the head is}} completely white. Females of both subspecies look the same; they are a bright reddish brown overall that is tinged strongly with reddish-purple on the crown, neck, and <b>wing-coverts.</b> The mantle, back, rump, and inner <b>wing-coverts</b> are a dark olive, {{and there is a}} pale breast shield. This plumage frequently fades in intensity due to wear. The juvenile Polynesian ground dove is red overall, with many of its feathers fringed with a cinnamon-rufous. The white parts of the face and underparts are suffused with grey. Juvenile males can be differentiated from juvenile females through the absence of a pale breast shield and purple-edged feathers on the scapulars and lesser coverts. The adult Polynesian ground dove is about 23.5 to 26 cm in length, and weighs about 105 to 122 g. The ground dove's iris is brown, while the bill is black. The legs and feet are a purplish black.|$|R

60|$|My friend, Mr. Osbert Salvin, {{has given}} me another {{interesting}} case of bird mimicry. In the neighbourhood of Rio Janeiro is found an insect-eating hawk (Harpagus diodon), {{and in the same}} district a bird-eating hawk (Accipiter pileatus) which closely resembles it. Both are of the same ashy tint beneath, with the thighs and under <b>wing-coverts</b> reddish brown, so that when on the wing and seen from below they are undistinguishable. The curious point, however, is that the Accipiter has a much wider range than the Harpagus, and in the regions where the insect-eating species is not found it no longer resembles it, the under <b>wing-coverts</b> varying to white; thus indicating that the red-brown colour is kept true by its being useful to the Accipiter to be mistaken for the insect-eating species, which birds have learnt not to be afraid of.|$|R
50|$|The Choco tinamou is {{approximately}} 25 to(-) 26.5 cm in length. It is a small, plain dark tinamou. Its upperparts are dark brown, with blackish crown, slate-grey sides of neck, whitish throat and indistinct dusky barring. Its legs are red. The females are darker with coarser barring on <b>wing-coverts</b> and breast, and grey flanks.|$|R
50|$|This bird has {{dark brown}} plumage with white primaries.

The sexes are similar.|$|R
50|$|The group varies {{primarily}} {{in the amount of}} white on the cheeks/ear-coverts, <b>wing-coverts</b> and back. Most taxa have white cheeks and ear-coverts, but these are black in albiventer, purpurascens and melanogenis. Chicks are uniform brownish, and immatures are brownish and white (instead of black and white), have dull facial skin, and lack the orange-yellow nasal knob and blue eye-ring.|$|R
50|$|The logrunner’s {{head and}} back are a reddish-brown colour; the wings are mainly black; and the tail is dark brown.
