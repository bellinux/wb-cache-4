Their diets consist mostly of small fish, squid, shellfish, and crustaceans. Species of seabirds on the Oregon Coast include the common murre, tufted puffin, marbled murrelet, the black oystercatcher, auklets, many {{varieties}} of cormorants, the <b>western</b> <b>gull,</b> and glaucous-winged gull. Many seabird species are endemic and found nowhere else.|$|E

40|$|Birds {{present a}} direct hazard to {{aviation}} safety at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, California. We monitored the bird hazards at NASNI between April 1996 and April 1997, made recommendations {{to resolve the}} bird hazard to aircraft and evaluated WS Operational program at NASNI. We documented 27 bird/aircraft strikes on NASNI from April 1991 to April 1997. Of these, <b>western</b> <b>gulls</b> represented 77 %, mallards 9 %, American coots 4. 5 % and great blue herons 4. 5 %. Most strikes that occurred between March and September were attributed to <b>western</b> <b>gulls,</b> where as waterfowl were struck most often between October and February. The command Navy Safety Center in Norfolk, Virginia reported 102 bird strikes to aircraft at NASNI between 1980 - 1996. We observed 33 species of birds on the airfield, with the greatest activity occurring during May. During May, an average of 1, 600 birds, mostly <b>western</b> <b>gulls</b> used the airfield daily. The peak period of bird runway crossings occurred in May and August, averaging 120 birds daily. Of 650 gulls colored marked on NASNI with blue tags, only 23 were observed {{at any one time}} on the Station. Only 2 of 12 radioed <b>western</b> <b>gulls</b> consistently used NASNI. The greatest distance gulls dispersed from NASNI was 800 km. Following the monitoring program, WS Operations used various control tools to reduce the bird/aircraft hazard at NASNI. The number of birds using the airfield was reduced by 90 % and the number of aircraft strikes was reduced by 92 %...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{patterns}} of phenotypic variation and underlying processes that cause them {{is important to}} the study of adaptations. Phenotypic variation can be studied by looking at both the proximate mechanisms that produce variation and their fitness consequences. In this study, I examined phenotypic variation in <b>Western</b> <b>Gulls</b> (Larus occidentalis) by studying variation as the product of interactions among several hierarchical effects. Gulls are considered ecological generalists; however, within species they exhibit considerable variation in behavior. My field work consisted of three years of monitoring diet, parental care behavior, nest microhabitat, and reproductive success of <b>Western</b> <b>Gulls</b> on Alcatraz Island, California. <b>Western</b> <b>Gulls</b> are monogamous seabirds with biparental care, site and mate fidelity, and maximum lifespan of 25 years. I examined life history effects, such as those due to age, by determining how parental breeding experience influences nest site selection, diet choice and reproductive success. The complex interactions among experience, sex and offspring behavior were studied by determining how each factor influenced parental care behavior and reproductive success. I predicted that pairs with greater experience would have higher quality diets and nesting habitat, which should result in higher fledging success. I also predicted few sex differences in behavior due to the pattern of similarity in investment between the male and female parent for monogamous species. I found that previous breeding experience affected behavior and reproductive success less than predicted, as new and established pairs showed similarity in nest site choice, feeding behavior and reproductive success. Nesting habitat was highly variable, but pairs showed similar nest site selection between years. The sexes differed in their feeding behavior, perhaps due to differential nutritional requirements or mating strategies. Although my study revealed a high degree of variation in diet, nest microhabitat and behavior among <b>Western</b> <b>Gulls</b> on Alcatraz, such variation had little effect on reproductive success. The lack of fitness effects {{may be the result of}} favorable environmental factors on Alcatraz, such as proximity to alternative food sources and low nesting densities, which may allow behavioral and ecological variation without strong reproductive success consequences. ...|$|R
50|$|Anacapa has around 69 {{species of}} birds. The island's steep lava rock cliffs {{incorporate}} numerous caves and crevices that {{are particularly important}} for the increasingly rare seabird Scripps's murrelet (a threatened species known as Xantus's murrelet until 2012). The cliffs are also an important location for the ashy storm-petrel. The largest breeding colony of the California brown pelican in the United States, {{and one of the}} only two in California, also occurs on Anacapa Island. This is where the brown pelican has been able to recover so dramatically from near extinction in the 1970s. The islets of Anacapa also host the largest breeding colony of <b>western</b> <b>gulls</b> in the world. <b>Western</b> <b>gulls</b> begin their nesting efforts at the end of April, sometimes making their shallow nests just inches from trails. Fluffy chicks hatch in May and June and fly away from the nests in July.|$|R

50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>gull</b> {{is a large}} gull {{that can}} measure 55 to 68 cm in total length, spans 130 to 144 cm across the wings, and weighs 800 to 1400 g. The average mass among a survey of 48 gulls of the species was 1011 g. Among {{standard}} measurements, the wing chord is 38 to 44.8 cm, the bill is 4.7 to 6.2 cm and the tarsus is 5.8 to 7.5 cm. The <b>western</b> <b>gull</b> has a white head and body, and gray wings. It has a yellow bill with a red subterminal spot (this is the small spot {{near the end of}} the bill that chicks peck in order to stimulate feeding). It closely resembles the slaty-backed gull (Larus schistisagus). In the north of its range it forms a hybrid zone with its close relative the glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens). Western gulls take approximately four years to reach their full plumage, their layer of feathers and the patterns and colors on the feathers. The <b>western</b> <b>gull</b> typically lives about 15 years, but can live up to 25 years. The largest <b>western</b> <b>gull</b> colony is on the Farallon Islands, located about 26 mi west of San Francisco, California; an estimated 30,000 gulls live in the San Francisco Bay area.|$|E
50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus occidentalis) {{is a large}} white-headed gull {{that lives}} {{on the west coast}} of North America.

5|$|The {{build-up}} {{of toxins}} and pollutants in seabirds {{is also a}} concern. Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from the ravages of DDT until it was banned; among other effects, DDT was implicated in embryo development problems and the skewed sex ratio of <b>western</b> <b>gulls</b> in southern California. Oil spills are also a threat to seabird species, as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated by the oil, causing them to lose their waterproofing. Oil pollution threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations.|$|R
