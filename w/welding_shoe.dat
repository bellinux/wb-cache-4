40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} morphological and mechanical properties of hot gas butt-welds on polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheets for four different procedures, which are single and double V-welds with and without a <b>welding</b> <b>shoe.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Welding energy (Ew), which is transferred onto weld surfaces, was calculated to evaluate weld quality. Morphology of welds was analyzed by polarized light, stereo, and scanning electron microscopy. Findings: Polarized light microscopy studies indicated that the heat-affected zone (HAZ) consists of welding rod core, molten zone, and deformed spherulitic zone. The results of tensile, bending, and impact tests indicated that the weld strengths of PVC sheets are {{lower than those of}} PE and PP sheets. When the <b>welding</b> <b>shoe</b> was used, weld strength increased significantly for each material due to the presence of sufficient welding pressure and the effective heating on surfaces. Practical implications: The best results were attained for the double V-welds with the <b>welding</b> <b>shoe.</b> Originality/value: Morphological and mechanical properties of hot gas welded PE, PP and PVC sheet were evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Evidence {{suggests}} that certain occupations and related exposures {{may increase the}} risk of malignant lymphoma. Farming, printing and paper industry, wood processing, meat handling and processing, <b>welding,</b> <b>shoe</b> and leather manufacturing and teaching profession are among the categories that have been implicated in previous studies. The relationship between occupation and malignant lymphoma has been investigated in a large European prospective study. Methods We investigated occupational risks for lymphomas in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). The mean follow-up time for 348 555 subjects was 9 years (SD: 2 years). The analysis was based on 866 and 48 newly diagnosed cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). These were identified in the EPIC subcohorts with occupational data. Data on 52 occupations were collected through standardised questionnaires. Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore the association between occupation and risk of malignant lymphoma. Results The following occupations were positively associated with malignant NHL after adjustment for study centre, age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), smoking and alcohol: butchers (HR= 1. 53, 95 % CI 1. 05 to 2. 48, including multiple myeloma/plasmacytoma; HR= 1. 30, 95 % CI 1. 00 to 2. 66, excluding multiple myeloma/plasmacytoma) and car repair workers (HR= 1. 50, 95 % CI 1. 01 to 2. 00, including multiple myeloma/plasmacytoma; HR= 1. 51, 95 % CI 1. 01 to 2. 31, excluding multiple myeloma/plasmacytoma). HL was associated with gasoline station occupation (HR= 4. 59, 95 % CI 1. 08 to 19. 6). Conclusion The findings in this current study of a higher risk of NHL among car repair workers and butchers and a higher risk of HL among gasoline station workers suggest a possible role from occupationally related exposures, such as solvents and zoonotic viruses, as risk factors for malignant lymphoma...|$|E
30|$|Strand et al. (2003) at BYU, {{in another}} study in 2003, {{investigated}} the influence of parameters on flexural strength, tensile strength, and microstructure of the <b>weld.</b> Hot <b>shoe</b> was also used in this study. Experimental results showed that lower speed of travel and higher shoe temperature will lead to strength and better microstructure.|$|R
40|$|Welding plays a {{major role}} in the design, manufacture, and {{construction}} of the ground support equipment at the Kennedy Space Center. Three applications of welding are described, i. e., an example of the structural welding of a girder in a mobile launcher (presently designated mobile launcher platform), an example of the repair <b>welding</b> of crawler/transporter <b>shoes,</b> and an example of the welding of the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen storage spheres and vacuum jacketed piping in the propellants system. This welding technology was developed during the Apollo and earlier programs. It is now being applied to the Space Shuttle...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{research}} {{was inspired by}} further studies conducted on remittances indicating that; voluntary migrants worldwide remit generously to their families back home (Adams Jnr. 2006; Mazzucato et al., 2004 a; Pendleton et al., 2006; Shady, 2004; Stark, 1991) with little attention paid to Ghanaians involved in labour migrancy in South Africa. This report explored remittance practices by Ghanaian labour migrants involved in the informal economy in Johannesburg and also investigated factors that motivated migrants from Ghana to send money and/or goods back home. The study objectives included identifying channels used to remit, frequency of remittance, different forms of remittances and also investigated the living conditions and nature of work of migrants. Finally, it established why these migrants chose to come to South Africa. A snowball sample was employed to gather data from 20 Ghanaian migrants involved in labour migrancy in the informal economy in Johannesburg. These respondents work at these various places: Parktown, Berea, Yeoville, and Braamfontein and engaged in such work as hairdressing, waiting, tailoring/clothing designing, hairdressing, Internet café operating, <b>welding,</b> barbering, Carpentry, <b>shoe</b> and bag repairing. It therefore appeared {{that most of these}} respondents got employed through social networks. Even though it was not the focus of the study, of the total population, 5 females were interviewed to explore their remittance practices compared to their male counterparts. Semi-structured interviews were used to address the research objectives. Though the research revealed two motivating factors namely; economic and social that influenced respondents to sent money to family members, economic factor emerged as the common factor among these migrants. Specific reasons for remitting among the migrants were also categorised as altruism, pure self-interest or “enlightened self-interest”. Further, the survey revealed two channels that were used by these migrants to remit family members back home. These were formal and informal channels. Under the formal channels were specialised money transfer institutions (Standard Bank, Rennies) and then sea freight services. The study saw that majority (75...|$|R
