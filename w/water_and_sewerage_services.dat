The Water and Sewerage Corporations Law of 2001 provides {{for the creation of}} regional companies to which local authorities would gradually transfer their <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>services.</b> The 2001 Law aims at, inter alia, full cost recovery and the promotion of private sector investments for infrastructure. The transfer of service provision from municipalities to public service entities (called [...] "Water and Sewerage Corporations") is initially voluntary, but at a later stage it will become compulsory. It had been initially envisaged that by 2010 all municipal <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>services</b> would have been transferred to Water and Sewerage Corporations. The Corporations may serve the area of one or more municipality, although in the latter case all municipalities in the service coverage area have to agree. The Corporations have quality of service obligations and are required to obtain a permit from the Ministry of the Interior. The Corporations may be owned either by the municipality (ies) in whose service area they operate or by private investors. The Government may intervene in the operation of the Corporation, including transferring the provision of the services to another entity in case of failure in service provision, including in case of bankruptcy. The aim was to have only about 15 large regional water and sanitation companies. However, 52 companies had been established as of 2010 because mayors resisted the establishment of larger regional companies.|$|E
2500|$|Tariff {{structure}} and cross subsidies. Metered connections are charged at a volumetric rate, while unmetered connections are charged at a flat rate {{based on the}} rateable value of the property. The rateable value system {{was intended as a}} cross subsidy from wealthier to poorer households. However, since rateable values are often outdated, the subsidy is poorly targeted. Since more and more highly rated households opt for metering, flat rates for the remaining unmetered customers are being increased to compensate for the lost revenue. As a result, the already imperfect cross-subsidy system is unwinding. An Independent Report on Charging for Household <b>Water</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sewerage</b> <b>Services</b> published in 2009 by Anna Walker recommended a package of help to ensure that [...] "the transition to metering is not to cause real problems of affordability to those on low incomes".|$|E
