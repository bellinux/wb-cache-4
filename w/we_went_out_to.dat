500|$|Agincourt {{was stuck}} fast {{and had to}} be lightened; her guns were removed and much of her coal was tossed {{overboard}} before she was towed off by , commanded by Lord Gilford, four days later. Heavy weather set in the night after Agincourt was freed and it would have wrecked her if she had still been aground. Both the fleet commander and his deputy were relieved of their commands {{as a result of the}} incident. The ship was repaired in Devonport and Captain J.O. Hopkins assumed command in September with Commander Charles Penrose-Fitzgerald as his executive officer. Hopkins later commented: [...] "We turned the Agincourt from the noisiest and the worst disciplined ship in the squadron into the quietest and the smartest; and a few months after we commissioned <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the Mediterranean for the Lord Clyde [...] court-martial, and beat the whole Mediterranean fleet in their drills and exercises, which was a great triumph." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vaughan owed {{his guitar}} {{technique}} {{in large part}} to Lonnie Mack. Vaughan said, [...] "I got a lot of my fast stuff from Lonnie" [...] and observed in live performance that Mack was [...] "ahead of his time". In 1987, Vaughan listed Mack first among the guitarists he listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult. Mack recalled his first meeting with Vaughan in 1978: [...] "We was in Texas looking for pickers, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> see the Thunderbirds. Jimmie was saying, 'Man, you gotta hear my little brother. He plays all your [...]' He was playing a little place called the Rome Inn, and we went over there and checked him out. As it would be, when I walked in the door, he was playing 'Wham!' And I said, 'Dadgum.' He was playing it right. I'd been playing it wrong {{for a long time and}} needed to go back and listen to my original record. That was in '78, I believe." [...] Vaughan owed part of his enduring style—especially his use of tremolo picking and vibrato—to Mack. He acknowledged that Mack taught him to [...] "play guitar from the heart". Vaughan's relationship with another Texas blues legend, Johnny Winter, was a little more complex. Although they met several times, and often played sessions with the same musicians or even performed the same material, as in the case of Boot Hill, Vaughan always refrained from acknowledging Winter in any form. In his biography, [...] "Raisin' Cain", Winter says that he was unnerved after reading Vaughan stating in an interview that he never met or knew Johnny Winter. [...] "We even played together over at Tommy Shannon's house one time." [...] Vaughan settled the issue in 1988 on the occasion of a Blues Festival in Europe where both he and Winter were on the bill, explaining that he has been misquoted and that [...] "Every musician in Texas knows Johnny and has learned something from him". [...] Asked to compare their playing styles in an interview in 2010, Winter admitted that [...] "mine's a little bit rawer, I think." ...|$|E

6000|$|He sat in silence--a {{silence that}} at last became a rebuke. She arose. [...] "Well, suppose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> supper; <b>we</b> can talk {{all the better}} there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, it's the truth. The strangest tale {{you ever}} heard. When <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Yellowstone Park we--that is, us boys--are {{going to look}} for the mine." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Saint Catherine's[74] to-day. I am glad of it, for I {{would not}} have these {{recollections}} haunt me, and society will {{put them out of}} my head.|$|R
6000|$|... "We had a boat-hook, and I {{pulled up}} to the island; I did, mother, and I made fast the boat to a little stick, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> explore the island." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> {{breathe the}} freshened air {{just as the}} first touches of the sun quickened to an opal splendour the pallor of that daybreak. All the earth was steaming, and the Bagnanza, {{suddenly}} swollen, went thundering down the gorge.|$|E
6000|$|A day or {{so after}} <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> those {{pleasant}} black-robed, bearded Armenians in their monastery at Saint Lazzaro, and returned towards sundown. We fell into silence. [...] "PIU LENTO," [...] said Margaret to the gondolier, and released my accumulated resolution.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Tarzan, [...] "you {{will not}} all <b>go.</b> <b>We</b> cannot take shes and balus when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> hunt and fight. You must remain to guard them {{or you will}} lose them all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Too late," [...] said Jaffir, [...] "we are ten only, and {{at sunrise}} <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> die." [...] He {{went to the}} cabin door and hesitated there with a puzzled air, being unused to locks and door handles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> them?" [...] said Mrs. Larcher. [...] "We're {{just going}} to have tea, and I'm sure you must be dying for some. If you'd let us know you were coming we should have sent to meet you." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{is a large}} Trappist monastery {{two hours}} from Durban, over the country roads, and in company with Mr. Milligan and Mr. Hunter, {{general manager of the}} Natal {{government}} railways, who knew the heads of it, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> see it.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a levity {{about your}} tone that I do not approve of, Armstrong," [...] Frank Mallett said, reprovingly. [...] "There were no women when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the Crimea, {{at the time}} when you were a good little boy doing Latin exercises." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{motor-brake}} {{had pulled}} {{up at the}} door and a multitude of men and women immediately descended. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> look. They bore rolled banners, a reading-desk in three pieces, and, I specially noticed, a collapsible harmonium, such as is used on ships at sea.|$|E
60|$|But, fortunately, Heaven rewards us {{with many}} {{agreeable}} prospects and adventures by the way; and sometimes, when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> see a petrified forest, prepares {{a far more}} delightful curiosity {{in the form of}} Mr. Evans, whom may all prosperity attend throughout a long and green old age.|$|R
60|$|There are Mr. Murdstone, our {{neighbour}} Mr. Grayper, Mr. Chillip, and I. When <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the door, the Bearers {{and their}} load {{are in the}} garden; and they move before us down the path, and past the elms, and through the gate, and into the churchyard, where I have so often heard the birds sing on a summer morning.|$|R
6000|$|Sometimes I {{let myself}} dream. And in those dreams you love me, [...] and <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> meet life together. I have dreamed that you [...] kissed me--dreamed it so reverently that the dream did your [...] womanhood no wrong. I have dreamed {{that you put}} your hands in [...] mine and said, [...] "I love you." [...] Oh, the rapture of it! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{think what}} they are doing," [...] the rajah, who was now {{standing}} on the wall, close to the gate, said to Harry. [...] "However numerous they may be, they should have moved as noiselessly as we did, when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> attack them." ...|$|E
60|$|A boat {{which left}} for Ternate, {{the day after}} we arrived, was obliged to return the next day, on account of bad weather. On the 31st <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the {{anchorage}} {{at the mouth of}} the harbour, so as to be ready to start at the first favourable opportunity.|$|E
60|$|We had {{exhausted}} the crocodiles, {{and begun}} with the alligators, when the garden-bell rang. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the door; {{and there was}} my mother, looking unusually pretty, I thought, and with her a gentleman with beautiful black hair and whiskers, who had walked home with us from church last Sunday.|$|E
60|$|After {{a little}} more {{conversation}} I proposed to Matteo that <b>we</b> should <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the market-place and see the people.|$|R
60|$|February 17th.--Yesterday {{morning was}} {{perfectly}} sunny, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> betimes <b>to</b> see churches; going {{first to the}} Capuchins', close by the Piazza Barberini.|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE. You're quite right. It's perfect madness. If <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dance {{together}} I {{shall have}} to borrow five shillings from her for a ticket. Gloria: don't be rash: you're throwing yourself away. I'd much better clear straight out of this, and never see any of you again. I shan't commit suicide: I shan't even be unhappy. It'll be a relief to me: I---I'm frightened, I'm positively frightened; and that's the plain truth.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> {{the garden}} in the scented moist air of a {{maritime}} spring evening. Behind the garden was a cloudy pine wood; the house closed it in on the left, while in front and on the right a row of tall Lombardy poplars stood out in stately purple silhouette against the sunset sky.|$|E
60|$|After {{a really}} good meal <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> see the town. It was after three o'clock and {{everywhere}} was shut up like an English Sunday. Cold, stony Cagliari: in summer you must be sizzling hot, Cagliari, like a kiln. The men stood about in groups, but without the intimate Italian watchfulness that never leaves a passer-by alone.|$|E
60|$|Then one day, {{about three}} weeks after Aunt Cynthia's departure, Fatima {{disappeared}}--just simply disappeared {{as if she had}} been dissolved into thin air. We left her one afternoon, curled up asleep in her basket by the fire, under Huldah Jane's eye, while <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> make a call. When we came home Fatima was gone.|$|E
60|$|But {{the women}} were tired, {{they would go to}} bed. Still the two young men would not <b>go</b> away. <b>We</b> all <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> look at the night.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Has it been {{a comfort}} to her? Owen's letters must be, I am sure. He will come home this autumn, {{as soon as}} he has done laying out his railway, and then I shall get him to beg leave for me to make a little visit <b>to</b> Hiltonbury before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Canada. I could not <b>go</b> <b>out</b> without a good word from her. She and Mr. Prendergast are all that remains of the old life. I say, Phoebe, did you hear of those cousins of mine!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, {{in answer}} to her remark, [...] "but it's curious that I can't fix my mind upon the subject here. The night's mild; shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on <b>to</b> the veranda?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Paucis is missing. When we {{came back}} from our walk <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the animals, and {{the door of the}} house is open and the cat has gone. Mysa says will you come at once and help look for it? I was to send all the women who can be spared from the house to join in the search." ...|$|E
60|$|After we had {{explored}} the church <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> walk about the place. We crossed the beautiful {{bridge over the}} Avon, and thought how lovely those fields and meadows would look, if they only had sunshine to set them out. Then {{we went to the}} town hall, where we met the mayor, who had kindly called and offered to show us the place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, it were {{an evening}} in April--a cold bitter day. I was sitting here between light and dark, {{drinking}} my tea with John, who was just come home from work--John is my husband, you see, sir--when we heard a noise outside in the street. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> see what was the matter, and we found a poor young creature, with a baby in her arms, had fallen down in a faint like.|$|E
60|$|Last evening <b>we</b> all <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> see the comet, {{which then}} reached its climax of lustre. It {{was like a}} lofty plume of fire, and grew very {{brilliant}} as the night darkened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, {{while the}} others were taking the trip through Yellowstone Park <b>we</b> could <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> that mining {{district}} and try to locate this missing mine," [...] went on Dave, with a smile.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Did I say I disliked anything?' said Lucy. 'Oh! I {{know what}} it was. I do not like going to a large town, where we can only walk in the streets, and <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{shopping}} every day, and the boys have nothing to amuse them. And it is worst of all {{to go to a}} place where Papa and Mamma have been before, and know all the people; <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> tea half the days we are there, or to dinner, or have company at home, and I never get a quiet evening's reading with Papa, and Allan has a very great dislike to company.' ...|$|R
