40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Ward</b> <b>rounds,</b> a {{keystone}} {{of hospital}} surgical practice, {{have recently been}} under the spotlight. Poor-quality <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> {{can lead to a}} greater number of adverse events, thereby cascading to an increased financial strain on our already burdened healthcare systems. Faced with mounting pressures from both outside and inside health organizations, concerted efforts are required to restore it back into prominence where it can no longer take a backseat to the other duties of a surgeon. METHODS: The nucleus of this narrative review is derived from an extensive literature search on surgical <b>ward</b> <b>rounds.</b> RESULTS: In this review, we focus on the need for reforms, current characteristics of surgical <b>ward</b> <b>rounds,</b> obstacles encountered by competing interests and proposed solutions in delivery of effective <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> that can meet with newly laid guidelines.

40|$|<b>Ward</b> <b>rounds</b> are a {{fundamental}} part and regular feature of a service user's care in most impatient settings. Existing literature indicates that <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> are experienced differently for service users and their carers; the former {{more likely to}} report feeling intimated, particularly in psychiatric settings, whilst the latter expressing reassurance received from the process. The current qualitative study was conducted to explore the experiences of <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> for adolescents and parents attending an impatient mental health unit for adolescents. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with ten participants. A grounded theory approach generated a process model with the core category of 'adaptation'. The main categories were termed: 'anticipating'; 'managing intermediate impact'; 'seeking understanding'; 'readjusting expectations' and 'further consolidation of experiences'. Adaptation permeated all these categories. The model was cyclical in nature as readjusted expectations regarding <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> led to a new form of anticipation, before the process started over again. The model described how participants adapted to both the process and contents of <b>ward</b> <b>rounds.</b> A number of elements identified in the study may be more broadly applicable to clients attending <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> in other settings...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore interprofessional {{collaboration}} during <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> on a Finnish emergency and infection ward from the viewpoint of three central professional groups: physicians, nurses and secretaries. Design/methodology/approach – The authors utilise an ethnographically informed approach, with observations and interviews as the data collection devices. The data comprise ten interviews with staff members and ten hours of observations. The data were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. Findings – The <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> were found to be rather physician- and medicine-centred, and mostly not interprofessional. Nurses and secretaries in particular expressed dissatisfaction with many of the current <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> work practices. <b>Ward</b> <b>rounds</b> are an essential part of collaboration in implementing the emergency-natured operational aim of the ward, yet we found that the <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> are complicated by diverging professional views and expectations, variable work practices and interactional inequality. Originality/value – This study makes a contribution to the research of collaboration in emergency care and <b>ward</b> <b>rounds,</b> both of which are little-studied fields. Further, context-specific studies of collaboration have been called for in order to eventually create a model of shared expertise. The findings of this study can be utilised in studying and developing emergency care contexts...|$|R

We aim to explore medical students’ perceptions regarding medical and surgical <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> within the Faculty of Medicine at Kuwait University, and to evaluate whether this teaching activity is meeting the expectation of learners. Methods: A pretested questionnaire was used to collect data from 141 medical students during the 2012 – 2013 academic year. They were asked to provide their current and expected ratings about competencies that were supposed to be gained during <b>ward</b> <b>rounds,</b> on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Mean scores were calculated, and the Student t-test was used to compare results. P < 0. 05 was the cut-off level for significance. Results: Only 17 students (12. 1 %) declined to participate in the study. The students&# 39; current competency scores (for competencies taught within both disciplines – medical and surgical) were significantly lower than the scores indicating students’ expectations (P < 0. 001). The best-taught competency was bedside examination, in both medical (mean: 3. 45) and surgical (mean: 3. 05) <b>ward</b> <b>rounds.</b> However, medical <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> were better than surgical rounds in covering some competencies, especially the teaching of professional attitude and approach towards patients (P < 0. 001).

The researcher completed an observational checklist of each encounter. We measured: {{the duration of}} speech time, the types of verbal and nonverbal communication, {{the extent to which}} patients and physicians raise intimate subjects. Results: Encounters during <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> in single rooms significantly took up more time than encounters in four-bedded rooms. The patients asked more questions and made more remarks in single rooms compared to four-bedded rooms. Empathic reactions of the physician were scored significantly more often in single rooms than in four-bedded rooms.

40|$|Present {{situation}} Nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> is held at {{presence of}} nurses and other carers. A nurse and a patient are in permanent contact so nurse ward rounds have importance {{both for the}} nurse and for the patient. Nurse ward rounds {{are very important to}} ensure quality nursing work and for satisfaction of biological, psychical, social and spiritual needs of patients. The bachelor thesis "Nurse Ward Rounds and Their Importance" is divided into a theoretical and a practical parts. The theoretical part focuses on nursing and the role of a nurse, a description of the nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> and its types. It also deals with the relations between the nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round,</b> the nursing process, education and important communication. The goals and the research questions The aim of the bachelor thesis was to find out whether nurses know the nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> and whether they hold it at their ward or not. The last but not least aim was to find out the opinions on the nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> among nurses. Three research questions were set to achieve the goals. RQ 1 : What is the importance of nursing <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> for nursing care? RQ 2 : How do nurses perceive the nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> for their work? RQ 3 : What type of nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> is most frequently applied at the ward? Collection of the necessary data was based on the semi structured interview. Methodology The qualitative research form was chosen for elaboration of the thesis and verification of the research questions. The research was performed at wards where nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> is held and at wards where nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> is not held. The anonymous research was performed with the consent of the nursing care manager, the head nurses and with the consent of the respondent nurses. Results The research has shown that the nurses that perform the nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> at their ward are able to explain the term nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round.</b> On the other hand the nurses that do not perform the nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> were convinced that they did perform it and started to describe a nurse report when asked what the nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> is. After being given study materials and after some time they were able to explain the term nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> as well. The research has shown that the nurses that perform the nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> at their ward are very satisfied. Most of them stress better information on patients and coherence of the information. They appreciate the work in a team where each nurse has a sense for something different and they can give advice to one another in the team or plan further patient intervention together. They also like cooperation with the carers during the rounds. The nurses claim that the carers spend more time with the patients than the nurses themselves and thus the participation of the carers in the nurse ward rounds is important. The only see disadvantage in the time stress. The nurses that do not perform the nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> think that it might improve their information on patients. Only one nurse is convinced that the nurse report is sufficient. They also stress that the ward nurse and the head nurse should have better awareness of her ward. Most of them are nevertheless unable to imagine that they could hold nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> at their ward for insufficient time. Another finding was that at the wards where nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> is held the big nurse <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> is used, in which the ward nurse, the shift nurses, in some cases also the carers and the nutrition specialist participate. The nurses also mention patient satisfaction. They claim that patient trust them more and more and they feel their involvement. Patients have also the opportunity to ask nurses questions that they allegedly otherwise would not ask anywhere else.

40|$|Aim: To {{share an}} {{experience}} of introducing a <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> checklist, a bedside nurse verbal summary {{and the development of}} standard operating procedure for Ward Rounds in cardiothoracic critical care unit to improve patient safety and care. Background: Francis (2013) described inconsistent ward rounds and failures to conduct ward rounds properly as contributing factors to the poor care seen at the Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust. He suggested that the absence of a nurse at the bedside had clear consequences for communication, <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> efficiency and patient safety. He recommended that nurses should be actively involved in ward rounds and linked this to high quality patient care. Design and methods: Semi structured interviews of six registered nurses. A questionnaire to 69 registered nurses. An electronic questionnaire sent to 23 members of the MDT. An observational audit of seven ward rounds reviewing 69 patients. Results: 97 % of nurses agreed that verbal summarizing had improved clarity and 90 % felt that it had improved patient care. 87 % of the MDT respondents stated that they had noticed an improvement in the attendance of the bedside nurse at the <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> review. The <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> checklist reduced omissions. Communication with patients during ward rounds was an area which needed to be improved.

40|$|Purpose: Ward {{rounds in}} {{hospitals}} are crucial for decision-making {{in the context}} of patient treatment processes. However, these tasks are not systematically managed and are often extended due to missing information, equipment or staff unavailability. This research assesses whether ward rounds can be structured more efficiently and effectively from the perspective of patients and staff. Methodology/Approach: This mixed method approach examines the ward rounds conducted in three units within a haematology department of a major Danish hospital. Baseline measures were collected to capture the value of the <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> described by patients and staff. The information, patient and equipment flows associated with a typical <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> were mapped with recommendations for improvement. Findings: Staff aspired to deliver a good quality <b>ward</b> <b>round,</b> but what this meant was never articulated and there were no established standards. The duration of the <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> was unpredictable and could take six hours to complete.

The present study aimed to analyse final year students’, nurses’ {{as well as}} physiotherapists’ views on a simulation-based interprofessional <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> training. Methods: In two successive passes a total number of 29 final year students, nursing students and physiotherapy students (16 in the first run, 13 in the second) volunteered to participate in two standardized patient <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> scenarios: (1) patient with myocardial infarction, and (2) patient with poorly controlled diabetes. Views on the interprofessional <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> training were assessed using focus groups.

Regular review of medication charts is recommended {{as a way to}} reduce errors {{but it is not clear}} how often this happens. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency with which specialist physicians reviewed medication charts during <b>ward</b> <b>rounds.</b> Methods An observer noted how often consultant physicians at Auckland City Hospital reviewed medication charts during <b>ward</b> <b>rounds.</b> The physicians were not aware that they were being observed. Results Twenty-one physicians were observed over a 26 week period. The general physicians reviewed the medication charts on 77 % of occasions (range: 45 % – 100 %) during routine <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> and 65 % of the time (range: 41 % – 80 %) on post admission rounds. Subspecialty physicians who did not see more than 8 patients on their rounds reviewed medication charts more frequently (88 %) than those specialties where more than 8 patients were seen on average (61 %). Conclusion The physicians did not review medication charts on all <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> and there was considerable variation in how often they did this. There is some evidence that the frequency with which charts are reviewed decreases as the number of patients seen increases. More efforts should be made to encourage regular review of medication charts. </p...|$|R
