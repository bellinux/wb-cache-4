5|$|Tomorrow Never Dies was {{the first}} of three Bond films to be adapted into books by then-current Bond novelist Raymond Benson. Benson's version is {{expanded}} from the screenplay including additional scenes with Wai Lin and other supporting characters not in the film. The novel traces Carver's background as the son of media mogul Lord Roverman, whom Carver blackmails into suicide, later taking over his business. The novel also attempts to merge Benson's series with the films, particularly by continuing a middle-of-the-road approach to John Gardner's continuity. Notably it includes a reference to the film version of You Only Live Twice where he states that Bond was lying to Miss Moneypenny <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had taken a course in Asian languages. Tomorrow Never Dies also mentions Felix Leiter, although it states that Felix had worked for Pinkertons Detective Agency, which is thus exclusive to the literary series. Subsequent Bond novels by Benson were affected by Tomorrow Never Dies, specifically Bond's weapon of choice being changed from the Walther PPK to the Walther P99. Benson {{said in an interview that}} he felt Tomorrow Never Dies was the best of the three novelisations he wrote.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{intricate}} details of Einem's alibi and {{his version of}} events, his story had two huge problems. It completely contradicted his initial statement of his whereabouts on 5 June 1983, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had been {{in bed with the}} flu. Furthermore, the quantity of fibres on Kelvin's clothes was far too large to suggest that Kelvin was in his company for only two hours. Given these facts, on 25 May 1984, Magistrate Nick Manos ordered Einem to stand trial for the murder of Richard Kelvin.|$|E

25|$|Kramarsky's family put the {{painting}} up for auction at Christie's New York on May 15, 1990, where it became famous for Ryoei Saito, honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co., paying US$82.5 million for it, making it then the world's most expensive painting. Two days later Saito bought Renoir's Bal du moulin de la Galette for nearly as much: $78.1 million at Sotheby's. The 75-year-old Japanese businessman briefly caused a scandal <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{would have the}} Van Gogh painting cremated with him after his death, though his aides later said Saito's threatening to burn the masterpiece was just an expression of intense affection for it.|$|E
25|$|The second Remington {{trial began}} in January 1953 with Judge Vincent L. Leibell presiding. It lasted only eight days. The jury found Remington guilty of two counts, for lying <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{had not given}} secret {{information}} to Elizabeth Bentley {{and that he did}} not know of the existence of the Young Communist League, which had a chapter at Dartmouth while Remington was a student there. Leibell sentenced Remington to three years in prison. While his attorneys prepared another appeal, Remington began his sentence at Danbury Federal Correctional Institution where he became friends with fellow prisoner, nonviolent action theorist Gene Sharp, before being transferred to Lewisburg. The appeals court upheld the original verdict, and in February 1954, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.|$|E
500|$|In June 1890, Harrison's Postmaster General John Wanamaker {{and several}} Philadelphia friends {{purchased}} a large new cottage at Cape May Point for Harrison's wife Caroline. Many believed the cottage gift {{appeared to be}} improper and amounted to a bribe for a cabinet position. [...] Harrison made no comment on the matter until after two weeks <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had always intended to purchase the cottage once Caroline gave approval. On July 2, perhaps a little tardily to avoid suspicion, Harrison gave Wanamaker a check for $10,000 {{to pay for the}} cottage.|$|E

500|$|The inquiry {{heard that}} the number of child {{protection}} police officers in the Metropolitan Police Service was reduced {{to increase the number of}} murder investigation officers because of the Stephen Lawrence case in 1993. A detective inspector supervising six child protection teams in London at the time of Climbié's death wrote a report criticising their competence. His former boss, however, claimed he had been lying <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> only held [...] "purely administrative" [...] responsibility for the teams. The detective inspector was taken to hospital when a woman poured ink over his head while testifying. The new chief executive of Haringey council, David Warwick, Baptiste, the Metropolitan Police, and the NSPCC apologised for their failings in the case.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Tong {{entered the}} house on Day 44, minutes before his girlfriend Karly was evicted. Alongside his fellow new housemates, he had to ensure that both Noirin and Halfwit were {{nominated}} for eviction but the new housemates failed their task so faced the public vote. Tong blamed fellow housemate Bea Hamill for the task's failure as she had refused to participate on [...] "moral grounds". Following an argument between the pair, Tong was warned by Big Brother for language that [...] "could be perceived as threatening" [...] <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would [...] "pay someone to deal with her". On Day 50, Kenneth fled the house via the rooftop with Marcus' assistance. As a result, the eviction for week eight was cancelled.|$|E

500|$|Sometime later, Amy and Rory are {{visited by}} River, {{shortly after the}} events of [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] in River's timeline. When Amy {{explains}} that she had recently witnessed the Doctor's death, River reveals that the Doctor lied <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> told her his name; instead he had said [...] "Look into my eye". The Doctor had asked the Teselecta to masquerade as him at Lake Silencio, and the Doctor and his TARDIS had been miniaturised within it. Elsewhere, the Doctor takes Dorium's head {{back to where it}} was stored and explains that his perceived death will enable him to be forgotten as he had been getting [...] "too big" [...] and drawing too much attention. As the Doctor leaves, Dorium warns of the prophecies that still await him and the question which Dorium calls out after him: [...] "Doctor who?" ...|$|E
500|$|Tensions also {{developed}} between Wilkinson and Lieutenant Governor-Elect Jones {{soon after the}} election. During the campaign, Jones {{was quoted as saying}} that he had talked with Wilkinson about being more open with the press and said that, if elected, he would not be a [...] "yes man" [...] for Wilkinson. At a press conference shortly after the election, Wilkinson {{said he did not know}} what role Jones would play in his administration and that much of it would depend on what Jones had meant <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> did not agree with all of Wilkinson's positions. In late November 1987, Wilkinson announced that Jones would spearhead the promotion of the administration's agricultural agenda. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported that this would not be Jones' primary role in the administration but that no other specifics had been provided.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{never said}} how he {{produced}} the Book of Mormon, saying {{only that he}} translated {{by the power of}} God and implying that he had transcribed the words. The Book of Mormon itself states only that its text will [...] "come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof". As such, considerable disagreement about the actual method used exists. For {{at least some of the}} earliest dictation, Smith is said to have used the [...] "Urim and Thummim", a pair of seer stones he said were buried with the plates. Later, however, he is said to have used a chocolate-colored stone he had found in 1822 that he had used previously for treasure hunting. Joseph Knight said that Smith saw the words of the translation while he gazed at the stone or stones in the bottom of his hat, excluding all light, a process similar to divining the location of treasure. Sometimes, Smith concealed the process by raising a curtain or dictating from another room, while at other times he dictated in full view of witnesses while the plates lay covered on the table. [...] After completing the translation, Smith gave the brown stone to Cowdery, but continued to receive revelations using another stone until about 1833 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> no longer needed it.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "El juego de beisbol" [...] (Know Hitter's in English), Chavo {{pretends to be}} a goalkeeper from several soccer {{national}} teams including the ones from Peru, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Argentina and Mexico. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he's</b> from Mexico, he is referencing {{to the fact that}} the original Mexican version, the vecindad is from Mexico, meaning that the English version's localization is changed to the United States. Although Jesus Guzman (voice actor for Chavo in Spanish dub) says he's the goalkeeper of Mexico in Spanish, it could be a coincidence, the famous football player Cuauhtemoc Blanco is mentioned but in English version is quiet about Mexican football players.|$|R
