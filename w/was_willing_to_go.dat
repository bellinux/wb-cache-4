5|$|A {{legacy of}} the Manhattan Project was the network of {{national}} laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, heard about it, {{he set up a}} rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, who <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the Manhattan Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) came together, and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had replaced the Manhattan Project, that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Trade had an {{important}} weight in the economy, as Bulgaria lay between the Byzantine Empire, Central Europe, the Rus' and the steppes. Trade relations with the Byzantine Empire was regulated on a most favoured nation basis by treaties that included commercial clauses. The first such treaty was signed in 716 and determined that goods could only be imported or exported when provided with a state seal. Goods without documents were to be confiscated for the state treasury. The Bulgarian merchants had a colony in Constantinople and paid favourable taxes. The relevance of international trade for Bulgaria was evident, as the country <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war with the Byzantine Empire when in 894 the latter moved the market of the Bulgarian traders from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where they had to pay larger taxes {{and did not have}} direct access to goods from the east. In 896 the war was won and the status of Bulgaria as a most favoured nation restored and commercial restrictions – abolished. Some Bulgarian towns acquired great prosperity, such as Preslavets on the Danube that was described in the 960s as being more prosperous that the capital of the Rus', Kiev. A contemporary chronicle lists the main trade partners and chief imports to Bulgaria. The country imported gold, silks, wine and fruits from the Byzantine Empire, silver and horses from Hungary and Bohemia, furs, honey, wax and slaves from the Rus'. There were commercial ties with Italy and the Middle East as well.|$|E
25|$|Haig {{inspected}} the Loos area (24 June) and expressed {{dissatisfaction with the}} ground; slag heaps and pit head towers which made good observation points for the Germans. French later did the same and agreed. French and Haig {{would have preferred to}} renew the attack at Aubers Ridge. Joffre was not pleased and called another conference (11 July) to urge a British attack on Loos. Haig pushed for Aubers Ridge again (22 July) – French at first agreed until dissuaded by Foch (29 July), who felt that only a British attack at Loos would pull in enough German reserves to allow the French to take Vimy Ridge. French wrote to Joffre saying he <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with these plans for the sake of Anglo-French cooperation, but then wrote to Joffre again (10 August) suggesting an artillery bombardment with only limited British infantry attacks. This was not what Joffre wanted. Kitchener, who had been invited to tour the French Army (16–19 August) listened sympathetically to Joffre's suggestion that in future Joffre should set the size, dates and objectives of British offensives, although he only agreed for the Loos attack for the moment. Kitchener met with Haig first and then with French. It is unclear exactly why Kitchener and then Haig agreed to go along with Joffre's wishes – possibly the disastrous plight of the Russians, but it may be that a promise that poison gas could be used may have persuaded Haig. Having got their own way, the French then postponed the attack as they picked new attacking ground in Champagne and arranged for extra shelling at Vimy, in both cases because of the very reasons – German-held villages and other obstructions – to which the British generals had objected.|$|E

500|$|The second {{scene of}} the episode has Captain Gault beating two of his men, who had {{attempted}} to leave the freighter. Gault's actor Grant Bowler explained that [...] "it was a scene about how far and fast things were spiralling out of control [...] the freighter … It was also {{about his ability to}} run the ship and that he <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to such great lengths to keep order.

500|$|Rockville Records {{refused to}} pay Uncle Tupelo any royalties, even though the band's first two albums, No Depression and Still Feel Gone, sold a {{combined}} 40,000 copies. Consequently, Margherita {{was trying to find}} a new recording deal for the band. On a recommendation by singer Gary Louris of The Jayhawks, talent scout Joe McEwen pursued the band for a contract with Sire Records. McEwen was impressed by how the band <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> against trends, calling the band [...] "an alternative to the alternative". Executing an out-clause in their contract with Rockville, Uncle Tupelo signed a seven-record deal with Sire in 1992. The deal guaranteed the release of at least two albums, with a $150,000 budget for the first.|$|E
500|$|While in negotiations, Douglas' staff {{approached}} the show's producers about a guest spot for Douglas and the sitcom's executives sought {{to work against}} Douglas' image. His management team wanted him to stretch beyond his usual roles, and believed a successful comedy show like Will & Grace {{would be a good}} way to do so. The show's producers said that Douglas <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with any story line the writers could come up with. Executive producer and co-creator of the show, David Kohan said: [...] "There's something great about playing on a person's iconic status. [...] Michael Douglas often plays these virile men, and the idea of making him a gay cop too shy to ask Will out was funny." ...|$|E
50|$|The mesolimbic pathway is {{involved}} in motivation cognition. Depletion of dopamine in this pathway, or lesions at its site of origin, decrease {{the extent to which}} an animal <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> obtain a reward (e.g., the number of lever presses for nicotine or time searching for food). Dopaminergic drugs are also able to increase the extent an animal <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> get a reward, and the firing rate of neurons in the mesolimbic pathway increases during anticipation of reward. Mesolimbic dopamine release was once thought to be the primary mediator of pleasure, but is now believed to have only a minor role in pleasure perception.|$|R

500|$|Fram reached Funchal on 6September. Three {{days later}} Amundsen {{informed}} {{the crew of}} the revised plan. He told them he intended to make [...] "a detour" [...] to the South Pole {{on the way to the}} North Pole, which was still his ultimate destination, but would have to wait for a while. After Amundsen outlined his new proposals, each man was asked whether he <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on, and all responded positively. Amundsen wrote a lengthy letter of explanation to Nansen, stressing how the North Pole claims of Cook and Peary had dealt a [...] "death blow" [...] to his original plans. He felt he had been forced into this action by necessity, asked for forgiveness and expressed the hope that his achievements would ultimately atone for any offence.|$|E
500|$|Icke and {{his family}} moved in 1982 to Ryde on the Isle of Wight. His {{relationship}} with Grandstand was shortlived–he wrote that a new editor arrived in 1983 who appeared not to like him–but he continued working for BBC Sport until 1990, often on bowls and snooker programmes, and at the 1988 Summer Olympics. He was by then a household name, but a career in television began to lose its appeal; he wrote that he found television workers insecure, shallow and sometimes vicious. In August 1990, his contract with the BBC was terminated when he initially refused to pay the Community Charge (also known as the [...] "poll tax"), a local tax introduced that year by Margaret Thatcher's government. He ultimately paid it, but his announcement that he <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to prison rather than pay prompted the BBC, by charter an impartial public-service broadcaster, to distance itself from him.|$|E
500|$|Moore, in {{a letter}} to McLane, noted that sending an agent to Europe to gather {{technology}} had been discussed in the past, but proposals had foundered over the difficulty of finding a person both competent enough to undertake the trip successfully and not too busy to spend a year or more in Europe. At the recommendation of the director's first cousin, Robert M. Patterson, Moore hired Peale for the position. According to Patterson, [...] "I do not know any man more likely to succeed in such a mission. [...] His skill, his perseverance, his address all fit him for the errand." [...] Peale <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> writing, [...] "a variety of circumstances render me very desirous of vacating the situation that I have held for many years as Manager of the Phila Museum, it will therefore be agreeable to change even at a pecuniary sacrifice." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1903, {{at the age}} of 27, Rupert {{took over}} his late father's role as {{chairman}} of the Savoy group, which included the Savoy Hotel, Claridge's, The Berkeley Hotel, Simpson's-in-the-Strand and the Grand Hotel in Rome. [...] At this time, the whole group was officially valued at £2,221,708. [...] He immediately issued £300,000 of debentures to raise capital for a large extension to the Savoy (the [...] "East Block"). [...] Like his father, Carte <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to great lengths to secure the best employees for his hotels. [...] When Claridge's needed a new chef in 1904, he secured the services of François Bonnaure, formerly chef at the Élysée Palace in Paris. [...] The press speculated on how much Carte must have paid to persuade Bonnaure to join him, and compared the younger Carte's audacity with his father's coup in securing Paris's most famous maître d'hôtel, M. Joseph, a few years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Friedman {{defended his}} {{activity}} in Chile {{on the grounds}} that, in his opinion, the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but {{also contributed to the}} amelioration of Pinochet's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990. That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom, in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom. In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose, he said the following: [...] "Chile is not a politically free system, and I do not condone the system. But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role. ...The conditions {{of the people in the}} past few years has been getting better and not worse. They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system." [...] In 1984, Friedman stated that he has [...] "never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile." [...] In 1991 he said: [...] "I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed. It was a terrible political regime. The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market. [...] In Chile, the drive for political freedom, that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success, ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy. Now, at long last, Chile has all three things: political freedom, human freedom and economic freedom. Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether, now that it has political freedom, that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom." [...] He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states.|$|E

Her apartment was originally to be in the process of redecorating, and the player was able to repaint the walls and change its layout, giving the player a chance for personalisation.
