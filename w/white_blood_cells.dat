5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E

40|$|Background High <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count at {{presentation}} is an unfavorable prognostic factor for treatment outcome in intermediate cytogenetic risk acute myeloid leukemia. Since {{the impact of}} <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count on outcome of subgroups defined by the molecular markers NPMc(+) and FLT 3 -internal tandem duplication (ITD) is unknown, we addressed this issue. Design and Methods We studied the effect of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count on outcome in a clinically and molecularly well-defined cohort of 525 patients with acute myeloid leukemia using these molecular markers. In addition, since an increased <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count {{has been associated with}} an increased FLT 3 -ITD/FLT 3 (wild-type) ratio, we investigated whether the effect of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count on outcome could be explained by the FLT 3 -ITD/FLT 3 ratio. Results This analysis revealed that <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count had no impact on outcome in patients with the genotypic combinations 'NPMc(+) without FLT 3 -ITD' and 'NPM 1 wild-type with or without FLT 3 -ITD'. In contrast, <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count {{had a significant impact on}} complete remission rate (P= 0. 034), event-free survival (P= 0. 009) and overall survival (P Conclusions Our results demonstrate that both high <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count and FLT 3 -ITD/FLT 3 ratio are prognostic factors in patients with acute myeloid leukemia with the genotypic combination 'NPMc(+) with FLT 3 -ITD'...|$|R

5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal {{that can be}} examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> of mammals and discovered that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E
40|$|Dogs {{were exposed}} to either trichloroethylene(TCL) or 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane(TCE) in order to {{investigate}} {{the effects of these}} solvents on hematologic parameters. Further-more, because of unusual changes in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> counts following exposure of pregnant dogs to these solvents, investigation of the effects of several hormones given prior to exposure to the solvents was pursued. The results obtained were as follows. 1. <b>White</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> counts showed a marked decrease immediately after starting exposure to TCL or 1, 1, 1 -TCE, though the decrease was temporary. On the other hand red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> counts, hematocrit values and blood platelet counts showed no changes. 2. While each kind of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> decreased in number, the degree was greatest in neutrophils. 3. TCL caused a greater decrease in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> counts than 1, 1, 1 -TCE. 4. A dose-response relationship was seen between the concentrations of 1, 1, 1 -TCE from 200 to 700 ppm and the decrease in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> counts. 5. No change in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> counts was observed following the exposure of pregnant dogs to 1, 1, 1 -TCE. 6.

5|$|Inflammation is {{a normal}} part of the human immune response, whereby leukocytes (<b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells),</b> {{including}} neutrophils (<b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> that specialize in causing inflammation), gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the inflammation continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in the walls of the bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB.|$|E
5|$|Leukocytes (<b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells)</b> {{act like}} independent, {{single-celled}} organisms {{and are the}} second arm of the innate immune system.

These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive immune system.|$|E

5|$|When a {{mosquito}} carrying dengue virus bites a person, the virus enters the skin {{together with the}} mosquito's saliva. It binds to and enters <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> and reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body. The <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> respond by producing a number of signaling proteins, such as cytokines and interferons, which are responsible {{for many of the}} symptoms, such as the fever, the flu-like symptoms, and the severe pains. In severe infection, the virus production inside the body is greatly increased, and many more organs (such as the liver and the bone marrow) can be affected. Fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body cavities due to capillary permeability. As a result, less blood circulates in the blood vessels, and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. Furthermore, dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the stromal cells leads to reduced numbers of platelets, which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever.|$|E

5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid envelops {{the brain}} and the spine, and lumbar {{puncture}} or spinal tap is the removal of {{a small amount of}} fluid using a needle inserted between the lumbar vertebrae. Characteristic findings in Guillain–Barré syndrome are an elevated protein level, usually greater than 0.55g/L, and fewer than 10 <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> per cubic millimeter of fluid ("albuminocytological dissociation"). This combination distinguishes Guillain–Barré syndrome from other conditions (such as lymphoma and poliomyelitis) in which both the protein and the cell count are elevated.

5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout.

Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why {{secondary}} infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.
