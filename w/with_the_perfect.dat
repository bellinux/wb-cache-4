His son, Curt Mast, born in 1897, was passionate about the production of spirits and liqueurs, always keen to help his father in the business even at an early age.

25|$|The end {{of medieval}} drama came about {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} the weakening power of the Catholic Church, the Protestant Reformation and the banning of religious plays in many countries. Elizabeth I forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the Netherlands in 1539, the Papal States in 1547 and in Paris in 1548. The abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama. It also allowed dramatists to turn to secular subjects and the reviving interest in Greek and Roman theatre provided them <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> opportunity.|$|E

25|$|Determinacy {{refers to}} the fact that, under {{appropriate}} assumptions, certain two-player games of perfect information are determined from the start {{in the sense that}} one player must have a winning strategy. The existence of these strategies has important consequences in descriptive set theory, as the assumption that a broader class of games is determined often implies that a broader class of sets will have a topological property. The axiom of determinacy (AD) is an important object of study; although incompatible with the axiom of choice, AD implies that all subsets of the real line are well behaved (in particular, measurable and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> set property). AD can be used to prove that the Wadge degrees have an elegant structure.|$|E
25|$|Father Sandoz, {{a talented}} Puerto Rican linguist, is {{described}} as of mixed Taíno and Conquistador heritage and character. Born in a San Juan slum, he initially believed the mission to Rakhat was divinely inspired. Several of his close friends and co-workers, people {{with a variety of}} unique skills and talents, had seemingly coincidental connections to Arecibo; one of them, a gifted young technician, was the first to hear the transmissions.

25|$|In recent years, the {{popularity}} {{and interest in}} food and wine pairings have increased and taken on new connotations.

In the restaurant industry, {{there is often a}} dedicated individual or staff of sommeliers who are trained to recommend wine pairings with the restaurant's fare. The origins of this recent phenomenon {{can be traced to the}} United States in the 1980s when the wine industry began to advertise wine-drinking as a component of dining rather than as just an alcoholic beverage meant for consumption and intoxication. Winemakers started to emphasize the kind of food dishes that their wines would go well with, some even printing pairing suggestions on back wine labels. Food magazines began to suggest particular wines with recipes and restaurants would offer multi-course dinners matched with a specific wine for each course.|$|E

500|$|Riddles had {{frequently}} {{argued the}} case for the inclusion of a Standard Class 8 Pacific into the standard range of locomotives being introduced by British Railways. However, these proposals were rejected by the Railway Executive on the grounds of cost in attempting to develop a form of steam motive power that was not necessarily required for use on Britain's railways, as there were enough class 8 locomotives already available for use. However, opportunity came out of adversity when the short-lived rebuild of The Turbomotive, 46202 Princess Anne, was destroyed in the Harrow and Wealdstone rail disaster of 1952. A gap now existed in the roster for locomotives with 8P power classification, of which the demand was high for the efficient operation of heavy expresses on the West Coast Main Line between London Euston and Scotland.

Baffled by his ability to survive, he realizes through a flashback that he has been under [...] "Buddha Mode", a cheat code which prevents his health points from dropping below one throughout the comic's duration.

500|$|When {{production}} first started, Clement and {{his crew}} would spend six hours applying Haley's make-up; eventually, the crew was able to streamline their process. According to Haley, the make-up crew would apply individual prosthetics to him, from his head {{all the way down}} his back, which were glued to his body. The appliances were then blended together to create a seamless appearance. Haley spent approximately three hours and twenty minutes in the make-up chair to apply the prosthetics, each day; on occasion, it would take almost four and a half hours when the crew needed to apply the prosthetic skull cap, which Haley did not need to worry about most days as he was able to wear the fedora hat on top of his head. Haley also had to wear contact lenses, one that was bloody and another that was cloudy, with the latter one making it difficult for the actor to see out of. Haley also had to work on developing Freddy's [...] "voice" [...] for the film. According to Haley, the process of coming up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> voice for Freddy is [...] "this organic process of embodying the character", and not about just [...] "sitting around the table and going, 'Let me try this voice and this voice'".

40|$|Perfect predicates {{have usually}} {{been defined as}} stative. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explain why.
