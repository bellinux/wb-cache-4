5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you {{had never thought of}} before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing.</b> Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E
25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E

500|$|The Allied fleet {{sailed to}} Salamis, {{off the coast}} of Attica, to assist with the {{evacuation}} of the remaining Athenians. En route, Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the Ionian Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause:"Men of Ionia, that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> is not proper, campaigning against your fathers and wishing to enslave Greece. It would be best if you came on our side. But if this is not possible, at least during the battle stand aside and also beg the Carians to do the same with you. But if you can not do either the one or the other, if you are chained by higher force and you can not defect during the operations, when we come at hand, act purposely as cowards remembering that we are of the same blood and that the first cause of animosity with the barbarians came from you." ...|$|E
500|$|To ensure {{accuracy}} in scriptwriting, the serial employs {{a team of}} researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics. One medical advisor was given a cameo role in the series as an orthopaedic surgeon, and another, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in Holby City as a scrub nurse. Another adviser, a heart surgeon, has occasionally left open-heart surgery to advise Holby City writers over the telephone. The programme utilises surgeons from different disciplines, who check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is particularly important in case viewers copy procedures they have seen in the show, such as CPR. Series star Amanda Mealing commented: [...] "We pride ourselves on being realistic. You need to know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> and why. It is a complex and foreign thing to act out an operation. For training, I watched a number of real ones." [...] Cast members are taught how to give realistic injections, monitor blood pressure and check a pulse, and some are given the opportunity to observe procedures in real hospitals. Original cast member George Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital in preparation for his role as Anton Meyer, while Edward MacLiam observed laparoscopic surgery being performed before joining the cast as Greg Douglas in series twelve.|$|E

2500|$|Termination: If {{you don't}} want your subject to know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> you simply {{distract}} their attention, usually by some appropriate remark, and casually terminate. Sometimes they remark, [...] "What did you say? I got absentminded {{there for a}} moment and wasn't paying attention to anything." [...] This is slightly distressing to the subjects and indicative of the fact that their attention was so focused and fixated on the peculiar hand stimuli that they were momentarily entranced so they did not hear what was said.|$|E

He said that, during this period, {{he was a}} particular fan of Ernest Hemingway's writing and {{came to believe that}} [...] "the hardest thing to do is write clearly and simply, and make your point in an elegant way". Upon graduation, Hill was called up for the army in 1964 but childhood asthma saw him ruled ineligible. This forced him to think about {{what he wanted to do}} for a career. [...] "When you are that age, you think you are going to be in the army two years, it's a huge amount of time.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} on Sydney radio {{a decade after the}} publication of Program for a Puppet, Perry spoke about learning more from the negative reviews for his first fiction book than the good reviews: ‘Some were a bit cranky; some were patronising,’ he said, ‘but they were all in some way instructive. One thought the writing was [...] "too high mileage." [...] Another spoke of a [...] "staccato" [...] style. I recall another mentioning that it was, at times, like a film script. One reviewer thought I had two good thrillers in one, which had merit. I did meld two big themes that may have been better separated. But you don’t really know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> on a first fiction. I did all the heavy research, [...] "forty ways to pick a lock," [...] that sort of thing.’ ...|$|E

2500|$|Figg once said, “I don’t go to work, I come to have fun.” (Wilson 2000) [...] These {{are words}} any {{aspiring}} engineer should take to heart. [...] If you truly enjoy <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> {{it will show}} in your work. [...] Figg has received over 130 design awards for his work over the years, highlighting his passion for bridges. [...] Following his death in 2002, “The Eugene C. Figg, Jr. Medal for Signature Bridges” was created to commemorate Figg’s spirit and vision. [...] The award will recognize outstanding achievement in bridge engineering that provides an icon to the community {{for which it was}} designed (Bridge Design & Engineering 2002). Over all the Figg Engineering Group has designed more segmental concrete bridges in America than all other firms combined, and has won more than 140 design awards (ASCE 2002). Despite all of his success and accomplishments, Figg remained well grounded throughout his career, a characteristic that every engineer, young and old, should strive to attain.|$|E
2500|$|Cicero's {{last words}} {{are said to}} have been, [...] "There is nothing proper about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> soldier, but do try to kill me properly." [...] He bowed to his captors, leaning his head out of the litter in a gladiatorial gesture to ease the task. By baring his neck and throat to the soldiers, he was {{indicating}} that he wouldn't resist. According to Plutarch, Herennius first slew him, then cut off his head. On Antony's instructions his hands, which had penned the Philippics against Antony, were cut off as well; these were nailed along with his head on the Rostra in the Forum Romanum according to the tradition of Marius and Sulla, both of whom had displayed the heads of their enemies in the Forum. Cicero was the only victim of the proscriptions who was displayed in that manner. According to Cassius Dio (in a story often mistakenly attributed to Plutarch), Antony's wife Fulvia took Cicero's head, pulled out his tongue, and jabbed it repeatedly with her hairpin in final revenge against Cicero's power of speech.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Ray Hyman {{wrote about}} {{the way in which}} palm readers and other such hucksters exploit the Forer effect to take {{advantage}} of victims (or 'marks'). He provided a list of factors that help these tricksters to dupe their prey. For example, hucksters {{are more likely to be}} successful if they exude an air of confidence ("If you look and act as if you believe in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> you will be able to sell even a bad reading to most of your subjects"), if they [...] "ake creative use of the latest statistical abstracts, polls, and surveys" [...] showing [...] "what various subclasses of our society believe, do, want, worry about, and so on", if they employ [...] "a gimmick, such as a crystal ball, tarot cards, or palm reading", if they are alert to the clues provided about their clients by such details as their [...] "clothing, jewelry, mannerisms and speech", if they are not afraid of [...] "hamming it up", and if they use flattery.|$|E

2500|$|The album's lyrics, {{written by}} both Accardi and Lacey, are more {{abstract}} compared {{to many of}} those featured on previous album, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me. While Accardi had previously had some involvement in writing lyrics, Daisy saw him contribute far more compared to previous albums. Accardi and Lacey both affirmed {{that there had been}} no conscious decision made by the band on Accardi writing more. Lacey worked with Accardi to help refine his lyrics, as well as filling in any blanks. During writing, both Lacey and Accardi had unintentionally begun to reuse certain themes and imagery, such as nature and forests, as well as lyrics relating to an absence of love. Lacey also used his writing as a means of venting anxieties, comparing it to therapy proclaiming [...] "Daisy was just the venting of anxiety, of letting go and doing the right thing for us personally and as a band. It’s a very hard way to do something but it is the best way. There’s a lot of pent up emotion that goes into owning up to who you are, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> and the choices you are making so Daisy was us rejoicing in that".|$|E
