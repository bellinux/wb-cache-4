Now that he's a pop-culture juggernaut, he has the platform to achieve just that. He's not afraid of being judged or ridiculed in the process.

500|$|The writer Friedrich Schiller (four {{of whose}} plays were adapted as operas by Verdi) {{distinguished}} {{two types of}} artist in his 1795 essay On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin ranked Verdi in the 'naïve' category—"They are not...self-conscious. They do not...stand aside to contemplate their creations and express their own feelings....They are able...if they have genius, to embody their vision fully." [...] (The 'sentimentals' seek to recreate nature and natural feelings on their own terms—Berlin instances Wagner—"offering not peace, but a sword.") Verdi's operas are not written according to an aesthetic theory, or <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>purpose</b> to change the tastes of their audiences. In conversation with a German visitor in 1887 he is recorded as saying that, whilst [...] "there was much to be admired in [...] Tannhäuser and Lohengrin...in his recent operas [...] seemed to be overstepping the bounds {{of what can be}} expressed in [...] music. For him [...] "philosophical" [...] music was incomprehensible." [...] Although Verdi's works belong, as Rosselli admits [...] "to the most artificial of genres... ring emotionally true: truth and directness make them exciting, often hugely so." ...|$|E

500|$|Each of the torches {{contained}} a solid fuel tablet made of hexamine and 6% naphthalene (following torch running tests in May 1947) that fuelled the flame itself. [...] The solid fuel increased the distance each runner could run to [...] over flat terrain, decreasing {{the number of}} torches needed to be produced, which in turn reduced {{the cost of the}} relay. There were eight tablets loaded into each torch, with the bottom tablets pushed up by the use of a spring. The design increased the burning time of each torch up to around fifteen minutes, an increase from the four-minute torches of the 1936 Olympics. The torch itself was designed by Ralph Lavers, with the brief that it should be [...] "inexpensive and easy to make, of pleasing appearance and a good example of British craftmanship". The torches were made from aluminium, with a long shaft holding a cup that contained the burner. [...] "With thanks to the bearer" [...] was written on the cup of the torch itself, along with the Olympic rings. The torches for the Greek leg of the relay were shipped to the Mediterranean aboard HMS Liverpool, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>purpose</b> built torch for the leg aboard a Royal Navy vessel from Corfu to Italy.|$|E
500|$|After a {{visit to}} Birmingham, Bache moved to Rome in 1863 and lived there the next two years. While there he {{received}} private lessons from Liszt, {{one of the few}} pupils thus privileged; most of Liszt's students attended only his master classes. He also heard Liszt play his own music on many occasions in private homes, including a then-rare performance of the Piano Sonata in B minor. Liszt helped him prepare for several public concerts in Rome and encouraged him to learn some difficult pieces that Bache initially felt unable to play; these pieces included Liszt's transcriptions of Gounod's Faust Waltz and Meyerbeer's [...] "Patineurs" [...] Waltz from his opera Le prophète. These lessons, the kindness that Liszt continually showed, and Bache's exposure to Liszt in general, became a life-defining experience. Liszt expected him to work hard and Bache applied himself <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>purpose</b> to his keyboard studies. The same [...] "musician of high standing" [...] that Constance quotes about Bache's years in Leipzig also states that [...] "there {{can be no doubt that}} it was his friendship with Liszt that he owed that enthusiasm and power of sustained hard work which distinguished him during his career in London, and which was often the astonishment of those who had known him in earlier years." ...|$|E
500|$|ED Denson, the {{co-publisher}} of Rag Baby, introduced McDonald to Chris Strachwitz, {{who owned}} Arhoolie Recording Studios, to self-produce the EP. Sensing the band's potential, Denson assumed management control, and {{was responsible for}} coining the group's name—a reference to Josef Stalin and to Mao Zedong's description of revolutionaries as [...] "the fish who swim {{in the sea of}} the people". McDonald, who had recording experience, began utilizing Arhoolie Recording Studios to record four songs split equally between the band and a local folk musician, Peter Krug. It was during this time at Arhoolie Records that Country Joe and the Fish's folk sound and political protest prowess—an amalgam of their own Guthrie-influenced material and their folk music roots—began to emerge. The band's side of the EP featured two originals by McDonald, an acoustic version of [...] "I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die Rag" [...] (also known as [...] "The Fish Cheer"), and [...] "Superbird". According to McDonald, [...] "The Fish Cheer" [...] was written in 30 minutes, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>purpose</b> of expressing satiric and dark commentary on the US's involvement in the Vietnam conflict. In October 1965, 100 copies of the EP, titled Rag Baby Talking Issue No. 1, were distributed on McDonald's independent label at a Teach-in in UC Berkeley and underground shops selling Rag Baby magazine.|$|E
