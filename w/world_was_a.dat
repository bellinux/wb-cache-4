5|$|The medieval <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{much less}} urban society {{than either the}} Roman Empire or the modern world. The fall of the Roman Empire had caused a catastrophic de-population of the towns and cities that had existed within the Empire. Between the 10th and 12th centuries, however, {{a revival of the}} European city occurred, with an {{increase}} in the urbanisation of society.|$|E
5|$|Didsbury has two rugby union clubs, Toc H R.F.C. and Old Bedians. Toc H, {{founded in}} 1924, plays at Simons Fields, on Ford Lane. Its first team {{plays in the}} North Lancashire and Cumbria league. The club runs four senior teams and a youth section, and has run a 10-a-side {{competition}} every May since 1951, as a charity fund raiser for local hospices. Old Bedians is based in East Didbury, and was founded in 1954. It regularly fields three senior teams {{as well as a}} junior section. Desmond Pastore, believed to be the oldest rugby player in the <b>world,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> founder member of the club, and later became its president. Formerly a player for Sale and Cheshire, Desmond played his last game for Manchester club Egor on his 91st birthday. Bedians AFC (an amateur football club founded in 1928) share the Underbank Farm ground with Old Bedians RUFC.|$|E
5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E

5|$|It rained. The {{procession}} of weary soldiers became a bedraggled train, despondent and muttering, marching with churning effort in a trough of liquid brown mud under a low, wretched sky. Yet the youth smiled, for {{he saw that}} the <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> world for him, though many discovered it to be made of oaths and walking sticks. He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war. He turned now with a lover's thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh meadows, cool brooks, an existence of soft and eternal peace.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario <b>World</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{critical}} and commercial success, hailed {{as one of}} the greatest video games of all time. It sold over 20 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling game on the SNES. It has been re-released multiple times, first as part of the 1994 compilation release Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World on the SNES, and on the Game Boy Advance as Super Mario Advance 2 in 2002. It was later re-released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii, Wii U and New Nintendo 3DS consoles. The popularity of the game also inspired a short-lived animated television series and a direct sequel, Yoshi's Island, which was released in 1995.|$|E
5|$|After being {{admitted}} to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part of the 2008 Games. The elimination of baseball, along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion. While the sport's lack of a following {{in much of the}} <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> factor, more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate, as the National Hockey League now does during the Winter Olympic Games. Such a break is more difficult for MLB to accommodate because it would force the playoffs deeper into cold weather. Seeking reinstatement for the 2016 Summer Olympics, the IBAF proposed an abbreviated competition designed to facilitate the participation of top players, but the effort failed. Major League Baseball initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede the major league season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.|$|E

25|$|After India {{achieved}} {{its independence}} in 1947, {{the country has}} moved to support Palestinian self-determination following the partition of British India. In {{the light of a}} religious partition between India and Pakistan, the impetus to boost ties with Muslim states around the <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> further tie to India's support for the Palestinian cause. Though it started to waver in the late 1980s and 1990s as the recognition of Israel led to diplomatic exchanges, the ultimate support for the Palestinian cause was still an underlying concern.|$|E
25|$|Fallen man's {{inability}} {{fully to}} comprehend haunting reminders of another, supernatural realm that yet {{seemed not to}} exist, the constant perplexity of inexplicable and vastly metaphysical phenomena, a propensity for seemingly perverse or evil moral choices that had no firm or fixed measure or rule, {{and a sense of}} nameless guilt combined with a suspicion the external <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> delusive projection of the mind—these were major elements in the vision of man the Dark Romantics opposed to the mainstream of Romantic thought.|$|E

Artemus eventually leaves the area of safety he created, causing it to vanish as he departs. Pink <b>World</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> success among the critics, though sales were initially modest.

25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Roman Empire, the focus of alchemical {{development}} moved to the Islamic World. Much more is known about Islamic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations. The word alchemy itself was derived from the Arabic word al-kīmiyā’ (الكيمياء). The early Islamic <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> melting pot for alchemy. Platonic and Aristotelian thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through Syriac translations and scholarship.|$|E
25|$|The {{one man who}} {{was most}} {{important}} in assisting Morin in spreading the degrees in the New <b>World</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> naturalized French subject of Dutch origin named Henry Andrew Francken. Morin appointed him Deputy Grand Inspector General {{as one of his}} first acts after returning to the West Indies. Francken worked closely with Morin and, in 1771, produced a manuscript book giving the rituals for the 15th through the 25th degrees. Francken produced at least two more similar manuscripts, one in 1783 and another about 1786. The second and third of these manuscripts included all the degrees from the 4th through the 25th.|$|E

Developed by restaurateur Joe Baum and designed initially by Warren Platner, Windows on the World occupied 50,000 square feet (4,600 m²) of space in the North Tower.
