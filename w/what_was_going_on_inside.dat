5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E

25|$|On 20 July 656, {{finding the}} gate of Uthman's house {{strongly}} guarded by his supporters, the Egyptian rebels climbed the back wall and crept inside, leaving the guards on the gate unaware of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside.</b> The rebels entered his room and struck blows at his head. Naila, the wife of Uthman, threw herself on his body to protect him and raised her hand to deflect a sword. She had her fingers chopped off and was pushed aside. The next blow killed Uthman. Some of Uthman's slaves counter-attacked, one of whom killed the assassin and was in turn killed by the rebels.|$|E
2500|$|Blaming {{herself for}} the album's {{commercial}} results, Norwood dismissed the album as [...] "too pop." [...] With her team wanting to produce a crossover album, Norwood had felt pressured {{to come up with}} different songs. Commenting on this decision, she later elaborated: [...] "I was listening to the voice of my team more so than <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> of me. With Human, I felt like I wanted to do more R music and thatâ€™s not what we decided to do on that album." [...] The debut season of her 2010 VH1 reality series [...] further revealed that the album's underperformance resulted in another argument between her and executive producer Rodney Jerkins, whose commitment to the project Norwood felt not as [...] "creative and forthcoming" [...] as on previous albums and that he purposefully did not put his best work in the album. Jerkins had distanced himself from the project following its official release, declaring his dissatisfaction with the involvement of other producers on the album.|$|E
2500|$|Discussion of the {{literary}} genre includes whether what is represented is a history, a parable, a myth, or compound of various genres. This relates {{to the reality of}} the encounter. Sometimes the temptation narrative is taken as a parable, reading that Jesus in his ministry told this narrative to audiences relating his inner experience {{in the form of a}} parable. Or it is autobiographical, regarding what sort of Messiah Jesus intended to be. Writers including William Barclay have pointed to the fact that there is [...] "no mountain high enough in all the world to see the whole world" [...] as indication of the non-literal nature of the event, and that the narrative portrays <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> Jesus' mind. Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas explained, [...] "In regard to the words, 'He showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,' we are not to understand that He saw the very kingdoms, with the cities and inhabitants, their gold and silver: but that the devil pointed out the quarters in which each kingdom or city lay, and set forth to Him in words their glory and estate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite a {{temporary}} cooling of {{tensions in the}} Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took {{a turn for the}} worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved to know <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> the camp. He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: [...] "Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks." [...] Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that [...] "Roy Keane's 10-minute oration ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society." [...] But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, [...] " [...] left us in Saipan, not the other way round. And he punished himself more than any of us by not coming back." ...|$|E

60|$|After {{this the}} old man {{appeared}} to be pondering; indeed, his thoughts could hardly {{be said to be}} present when he uttered the words.

60|$|The Government {{of the new}} Territory of Nevada was an {{interesting}} menagerie. Governor Nye was an old and seasoned politician from New York--politician, not statesman. He had white hair; he was in fine physical condition; he had a winningly friendly face and deep lustrous brown eyes that could talk as a native language the tongue of every feeling, every passion, every emotion. His eyes could outtalk his tongue, and this is saying a good deal, for {{he was a very}} remarkable talker, both in private and on the stump. He was a shrewd man; he generally saw through surfaces and perceived <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> without being suspected of having an eye on the matter.|$|E

We took him at his word; a merry scene it was inside. The English officers' dunnage had been broken into, and there was a party of the corps strutting about in uniform coats and feathers. We thought it best to give these dare-devils a berth, and so we left them. One was never safe with them on the field of battle, friend or enemy.|$|E
