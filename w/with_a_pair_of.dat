5|$|As in all insects, {{the body}} {{is divided into three}} sections: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The thorax is {{composed}} of three segments, each <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> legs. In most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed, unlike those of moths which may be threadlike or feathery. The long proboscis can be coiled when not in use for sipping nectar from flowers.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the head}} and thorax is the {{membranous}} neck or cervix. It comprises a pair of lateral cervical sclerites and is composed of both cephalic and thoracic elements. Between {{the head and}} the thorax is a tufted scale called the pronotum. On either side is a shield-like scale called a scapula. In the Noctuoidea, the metathorax is modified <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> tympanal organs.|$|E

5|$|Northampton's is a {{comparatively}} elaborate war memorial, {{especially for a}} town rather than a city. It consists of a Stone of Remembrance flanked by tall twin obelisks, each adorned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> painted stone flags. Its use of obelisks, a Stone of Remembrance, and painted flags—all features characteristic of Lutyens' war memorials—make it particularly significant among his works.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty's {{decision}} saddled the Royal Navy <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> {{ships that}} could not operate with the Warriors in a tactical squadron and were inferior to the French ironclads then under construction. The naval architect Sir Nathaniel Barnaby, a future Constructor of the Navy, considered that a Defence-class ship was worth one quarter of a Warrior in terms of combat, although they cost about two-thirds as much.|$|E

5|$|As intended, the Comanche {{was to be}} {{equipped}} with sophisticated avionics, including navigation and detection systems, which would have to enabled operations during nighttime and within challenging weather conditions. Its primary mission was to scout around using its advanced sensors, attempting to find and designate targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike. The Comanche was furnished with a digital fly-by-wire flight control system. Each of the two crew members were to be provided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> LCD multi-functional displays which would have functioned {{in addition to the}} Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS) worn by the crew.|$|E
5|$|First {{appearing}} in Dead 'Ard and Warrior, The Black Currant returned {{in a series}} of White Dwarf Thrud strips titled Thrud the Destroyer. In this story, The Black Currant is the leader of a horde of warriors who attack a small village, looting the homes, burning the women, raping the livestock and eating the babies. The Black Currant returned again in issue 3 of Critchlow's self-published Thrud the Barbarian comic as the leader of a group of bandits laying siege to a small town.

5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for {{piercing and sucking}} (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
5|$|His first {{exposure}} to musical training {{came in the}} form of piano lessons, which he later said in his instructional video A Work in Progress did not have much impact on him. He had a penchant for drumming on various objects around the house <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> chopsticks, so for his thirteenth birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum and some lessons, with the promise that if he stuck with it for a year they would buy him a kit.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Henderson {{graduated}} from Oakland Technical High School, {{where he played}} baseball, basketball and football, and was an All-American running back <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He also ran track, but did not stay with the team as the schedule conflicted with baseball. Henderson received over a dozen scholarship offers to play football. Despite a childhood dream {{to play for the}} Oakland Raiders, he turned down the scholarships on the advice of his mother, who argued that football players had shorter careers. In 1983, Henderson married his high-school sweetheart, Pamela. They have three children: Angela, Alexis, and Adrianna.|$|E
