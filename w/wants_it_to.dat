Indeed, {{in an interview with}} Fighters Only Magazine, Silva reiterated his desire to fight Jackson for a fourth time, and added that he <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be the final fight of his career. He also said that he no longer has problems with Jackson outside of the cage. Silva ended by saying that he spoke with Jackson at UFC 95 in London, England, and the two shook hands.|$|E
5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E

The duo head for Isla Cruces and find Will, who escaped Jones's ship and has stolen the key to the Chest.

[...] Following the tampering, Rhimes said she believes that Grey and Shepherd are meant to be together and that it in the end, they will end up with each other.

[...] Greaney said that everyone in the writing room recognized these traits from people they knew and therefore everyone contributed to the episode by suggesting lines for Bart to say and things for him to do.|$|E
500|$|According to Rolling Stone, {{the album}} {{contains}} [...] "raspy braggadocio and sexy rhymes" [...] which complement Queen's raspy vocals. It alternates between reggaetón and hip hop as Queen experiments with Caribbean music, R, pop, electronica, funk, dancehall and acoustic ballads: [...] "I really think this album {{is for people}} to really just sit down and listen to it". She explained that [...] "there are times that the songs will {{make you want to}} dance", but their lyrics are more meaningful. Although Queen said the album has its share of [...] "battles against men", she <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate that she is a well–rounded artist.

500|$|Joseph R. Atilano of Inquirer Entertainment praised [...] "Circles" [...] {{as one of}} the catchiest {{songs of}} the album and {{compared}} the track to songs by Rihanna and Nicki Minaj.

Montreal Gazette editor T'cha Dunlevy simply described it as [...] "a raunchy flip of the bird to haters". HitFix writer Melinda Newman called it a [...] "shape-shifting" [...] and compared Aguilera to Gwen Stefani [...] "as she adopts a patois". Annie Zaleschi of The A.V. Club was mixed, naming it a [...] "bitter '90s alt-rock crossed with M.I.A.'s antagonistic attitude; it should be an angry kiss-off. Instead, cringe-inducing lyrics sap its ire". For Michael Gallucci of PopCrush, the song [...] "dips back to the bubblegum pop of Aguilera's debut for the verses, but pumps a ton of distortion into her voice during the refrains. 'Circles' doesn't seem to know what kind of song it <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be, so it settles for two not very good ones".|$|E

Kevin Fitzpatrick of ScreenCrush said the series [...] "deserves some credit for venturing into" [...] the prison breakout trope, and thought the action sequences were impressive, but felt that Johnson's storyline was [...] "nowhere near as compelling as the series <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be" [...] and contrived, and said that the Mace/Simmons subplot was [...] "consistently dashing any energy or momentum built up from the prison scenes". Fitzpatrick also criticized the ghost effects. Collider's Evan Valentine gave the episode four stars out of five, indicating a [...] "very good" [...] episode, saying, [...] "When Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is at its best, it manages to find something interesting and worthwhile for each of its cast to dig their teeth into, and this episode {{is one of the most}} on-point examples of that we’ve seen this season."

500|$|Another {{issue is}} the extent to which Kahn {{deliberately}} introduced elements into some of his buildings that give them the ageless atmosphere of ruins. [...] Kahn himself spoke of [...] "wrapping ruins around buildings", although in the context of another project. In his essay [...] "Louis I. Kahn and the Ruins of Rome," [...] Vincent Scully argues that Kahn followed this practice in several of his buildings, including this library, saying, [...] "And in his library at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, Kahn won't even let it become a building; he <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> remain a ruin. [...] The walls don't connect at the top. [...] They remain like a hollow shell". [...] Romaldo Giurgola, on the other hand, avoids this interpretation in the entry he wrote for Louis Kahn in the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects. In it, while discussing the arrangement of exterior components of Kahn's National Assembly Building of Bangladesh, Giurgola wrote, [...] "This relationship with daylight was the determining element behind this solution, rather than the formal desire to 'create ruins,' as some critics have suggested." [...] In the very next paragraph Guirgola describes the chamfered corners of the library at Phillips Exeter by saying only that Kahn used this device to show that the structural importance of the corner is greatly reduced in buildings like the Exeter library that are constructed with reinforced concrete and other modern materials.|$|E

Eventually Doyle's got to write a new album; I've got to write a new album; Glenn's got to write a new album. Why don't we work together and make the greatest album ever?
