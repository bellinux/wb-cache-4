500|$|Final Fantasy X-2 (2003), was {{the first}} direct video game sequel to any Final Fantasy game. Despite having {{composed}} {{the majority of the}} soundtrack for Final Fantasy X, Nobuo Uematsu did not contribute any music to the project. No tracks from X or other games in the series were used in the game. In an attempt to make a different style of music for the game than previous franchise titles, Square brought Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi on board to compose the music for X-2, as the developers felt they were the [...] "perfect fit" [...] to incorporate a [...] "pop" [...] style into the music. The game includes two songs with vocalized elements, one of which, the J-Pop song [...] "real Emotion", was written by Ken Kato and composed by Kazuhiro Hara. The other, J-Pop ballad [...] "1000 Words", was written by scenario writers Kazushige Nojima and Daisuke Watanabe. Matsueda and Eguchi composed and arranged the track. Both songs were sung by Jade Villalon from Sweetbox in the English version of the game, and are available as bonus tracks on the Japanese release of her album Adagio. In the Japanese version of the game both the songs were sung by Kumi Koda and were released as a single entitled real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba. Koda also released her own English versions of the songs on her CD single Come with Me, with slightly different versions of the lyrics than Jade. In addition to Come <b>with</b> <b>Me,</b> <b>the</b> collection of music for Final Fantasy X-2 includes the two-disc soundtrack album, a piano album, a soundtrack album for the Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission version of the game, a single for the song [...] "Eternity ~ Memory of Lightwaves", and a set of three singles themed around the three main characters of the game.|$|E

[...] Colonel Nicolas Condell, his small force of 50men from the Morelos and Tamaulipas units, and two cannon remained as the rear guard at the plaza. Years later, however, Sanchez Navarro maintained that Cos was not planning to abandon the town but wished to move the wounded to the relative safety of the Alamo.|$|E
2500|$|However {{often this}} tale has been reiterated, {{it is not}} beyond doubt. Dale himself {{said that it was}} handed down in University College, and showed some {{surprise}} that the constriction of the radial artery was measurable. Of Oliver’s descendants, none recalled experiments on his son. [...] Dale’s report of subcutaneous injections contradicts the concerned parties. Oliver: “During the winter of 1893–4, while prosecuting an inquiry as to … agents that vary the calibre of … arteries … I found that the administration by the mouth of a glycerine extract of the adrenals of the sheep and calf produced a marked constrictive action on the arteries.” Schäfer: “In the autumn of 1893 there called upon me in my laboratory in University College a gentleman who was personally unknown to me. … I found that my visitor was Dr. George Oliver, [...] was desirous of discussing <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> results which he had been obtaining from the exhibition by the mouth of extracts from certain animal tissues, and the effects which these had in his hands produced upon the blood vessels of man.” Systemic effects of orally given adrenaline are highly unlikely.

So {{that it would}} sound like our world had these handed down, traditional songs that were to do with real random vanishings and kidnappings. That {{is a big part}} of Latin culture. People get kidnapped all the time. I wanted to cover everything. Right from the exhilarating feeling you get when you put the ransom note down, the adrenaline rush when you realise a loved one has been taken from you, followed by that bleak, dismal area of not knowing what to do. Especially if you don't come from money. We had two friends that we knew from Texas who just randomly vanished. We've never known whether they just took off or if they met foul play. I found it an interesting subject matter to tackle. I wanted the lyrics to instil that bleak feeling you can get from living somewhere like El Paso.
