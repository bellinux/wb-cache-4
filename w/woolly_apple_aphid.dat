40|$|Abstract Background Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are a {{class of}} small, non-coding RNAs that play an {{important}} role in development and environmental responses. Hundreds of plant miRNAs have been identified to date, mainly from the model species for which there are available genome sequences. The current challenge is to characterise miRNAs from plant species with agricultural and horticultural importance, to aid our understanding of important regulatory mechanisms in crop species and enable improvement of crops and rootstocks. Results Based on the knowledge that many miRNAs occur in large gene families and are highly conserved among distantly related species, we analysed expression of twenty-one miRNA sequences in different tissues of apple (Malus x domestica 'Royal Gala'). We identified eighteen sequences that are expressed in at least one of the tissues tested. Some, but not all, miRNAs expressed in apple tissues including the phloem tissue were also detected in the phloem sap sample derived from the stylets of <b>woolly</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphids.</b> Most of the miRNAs detected in apple phloem sap were also abundant in the phloem sap of herbaceous species. Potential targets for apple miRNAs were identified that encode putative proteins shown to be targets of corresponding miRNAs in a number of plant species. Expression patterns of potential targets were analysed and correlated with expression of corresponding miRNAs. Conclusions This study validated tissue-specific expression of apple miRNAs that target genes responsible for plant growth, development, and stress response. A subset of characterised miRNAs was also present in the apple phloem translocation stream. A comparative analysis of phloem miRNAs in herbaceous species and woody perennials will aid our understanding of non-cell autonomous roles of miRNAs in plants. </p...|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of apples, in which {{research}} is being carried out {{in order to develop}} resistance to diseases such as apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha), orchard fireblight (Erwinia amylovora), <b>woolly</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> (Eriosoma lanigerum) and collar rot (Phytophthora cactorum), the main sources of resistant material used in breeding programmes such as those being run by East Malling Research Station in England or Hortresearch in New Zealand are major gene resistances derived from crab-apples. The Vf gene for black spot resistance is derived from the ornamental crab-apple species Malus floribunda. Most black spot resistant cultivars developed around the world carry this gene, but there are some selections that carry the Vr (from M. pumila) or Vm (from M. micromalus) gene. Major gene resistances to powdery mildew are derived from M. robusta (Pl1) and M. zumi (Pl2), and the apple cultivar Northern Spy has a long-standing reputation for its major gene resistance to <b>woolly</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid.</b> Since early this century this resistance has been used to develop woolly aphid resistant rootstocks such as MM.106 and M.793.

40|$|Winged morphs of aphids are {{essential}} for their dispersal and survival. We discovered that {{the production of the}} winged morph in asexual clones of the rosy <b>apple</b> <b>aphid,</b> Dysaphis plantaginea, is dependent on their infection with a DNA virus, Dysaphis plantaginea densovirus (DplDNV). Virus-free clones of the rosy <b>apple</b> <b>aphid,</b> or clones infected singly with an RNA virus, rosy <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> virus (RAAV), did not produce the winged morph in response to crowding and poor plant quality. DplDNV infection results in a significant reduction in aphid reproduction rate, but such aphids can produce the winged morph, even at low insect density, which can fly and colonize neighboring plants. Aphids infected with DplDNV produce a proportion of virus-free aphids, which enables production of virus-free clonal lines after colonization of a new plant. Our data suggest that a mutualistic relationship exists between the rosy <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> and its viruses. Despite the negative impact of DplDNV on rosy <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> reproduction, this virus contributes to their survival by inducing wing development and promoting dispersal...|$|R

5000|$|Eriosoma lanigerum infestations have {{increased}} in the North-western United States as apple growers have reduced the use of organophosphate pesticides, it is though {{that the use of}} these chemicals to control the codling moth in orchards also repressed the infestation by the aphids. The chalcid wasp Aphelinus mali is used as a biological control and this wasp has been deliberately or accidentally introduced into most regions where the <b>woolly</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> occurs. When they have been parasitised by the wasps the aphids cease wax production and turn black in colour. Sometimes it is possible to see a circular hole on the upper surface of the aphid which the adult wasp created when it emerged from the body of its host. [...] Rootstocks have been developed which convey resistance to the aphids to the roots but they {{do not appear to be}} effective against aerial infestation. Growers have also tried to prevent nfestation by preventing the crawler stage of the nymph from climbing into the crown but these have proven ineffective as aphids can colonise the crown from neighbouring trees. As well as the parasitoid, Alphelinus mali, these aphids are preyed on by the bug Anthocoris nemoralis, ladybirds, hoverfly larvae and lacewings. The presence of earwigs Forficula auricularia on the tress can reduce the levels of aphid infestation, so encouraging these insects by providing shelters may be another means of biological control. Exclsuion experiments in Poland showed that the earwigs, and to a lesser extent the seven-spot ladybird Coccinella septempunctata were important in controlling the numbers of aphids later in the season while in the early Spring the pine ladybird Exochomus quadripustulatus was the main predator on the aphids. The hoverflies, Heringia calcarata and Eupeodes americana, have also been used as effective biological control organisms. Areopraon lepelleyi is another species of wasp which is a parasitoid of the <b>woolly</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid.</b> In addition, entomopathogenic nematodes have been used to control root-dwelling populations of E. lanigerum.|$|E
50|$|The {{adults of}} Eriosoma lanigerum are small to medium sized aphids, up to 2mm long, {{and have an}} {{elliptical}} shape, are reddish brown to purple in colour but the colour is normally hidden by the white cotton-like secretion from the specialised glands in the aphid's abdomen which gives it the common name of <b>woolly</b> <b>apple</b> <b>aphid.</b> The wax is produced after each moult so newly moulted individuals lack the wax coating, {{the main purpose of}} which is thought to be to prevent the honeydew secreted by the aphids to contaminate them but it may also produce a shelter from the weather and from parasites and predators. It has sooty-brown antennae has six segments and the colour of the tibias varies from dark brown to yellowish. When the adults are crushed they leave a blood red stain. The presence of this wooly substance distinguishes E. lanigerum from any other aphid occurring on apple trees. In many populations reproduction is wholly asexual and nymphs are produced by parthenogenesis. The nymphs are salmon pink in colour with dark eyes and circular cornicles which are slightly raised {{from the surface of the}} abdomen. The nymphs go through four instar moults before becoming an imago. The earliest stages are known as crawlers and they do not produce the waxy filaments until they settle to feed. The hibernating nymphs are very dark green, almost black, although they may be paler and can be dingy yellowish-brown and lack the secreted white waxy covering.|$|E

The monophagous parasitoid Aphelinus mali (Hald.) has been introduced into most of apple growing areas to control WAA, but success is variable and depends on climatological conditions. In the Netherlands the level of parasitization is often too low, especially after warm winters.

Both the WAA and parasitoid indices were integrated in a selectivity index that was used to determine the IPM compatibility of the tested insecticides. Selectivity index indicated that pirimicarb is the most suitable insecticide for controlling WAA as its application resulted in valuable suppression of WAA and very low negative impact to its parasitoid.

40|$|The rosy <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini) (Homoptera: Aphididae) is {{the most}} serious pest <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> in view of the scale of damages inflicted to the fruits by a small number of individuals. Although {{numerous}} natural enemies have been associated with D. plantaginea, they are unable to halt infestations soon enough in most commercial apple orchards obliging fruit growers to control it chemically to prevent severe economic losses. In order to reinforce the contribution of indigenous aphidophaga in regulating rosy <b>apple</b> <b>aphids,</b> the use of insectary plants selected to support two groups of specialist aphid antagonists, notably aphid parasitoids and aphidophagous monovoltine syrphids, was investigated. 1. A first step consisted in selecting appropriate plant species. The rowan tree Sorbus aucuparia L. and the common elder Sambucus nigra L. were selected for their ability to support substitute aphids for the rosy <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> parasitoid E. persicae Froggatt (Hymenoptera: Braconidae, Aphidiinae) and monovotine syrphids (Diptera: Syrphidae) respectively. 2. Next, trials were conducted to induce substitute aphid infestations on their host plants by introducing eggs of Dysaphis sorbi Kaltenbach on rowan and small colonies of Aphis sambuci L. on elder. The resulting aphid populations which developed on their respective host plants in spring proved to be exploited by the natural enemies expected, i. e. E. persicae and monovoltine syrphids of the genus Epistrophe. Besides, diapause mummies of E. persicae and diapausing last-instar Epistrophe larvac were recorded on rowan and in the elder litter respectively, indicating the successful settlement of the antagonists in the orchard environment. A complementary investigation devoted to syrphid adults indicated that females of all species recorded ovipositing on the eider shrubs, including Epistrophe spp. had consumed a large majority of apple pollen grains as a protein source required for egg maturation. 3. To comfort our choice in the two groups of aphidophaga considered, a study dedicated to their respective phenology versus the one of D. plantaginea showed that they could both potentially halt rosy <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> infestations by attacking the aphids while the latter still occupied the primary, fundatrix-induced rosette leaf colonies, i. e. a critical moment in rosy <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> control. 4. Finally, marking methods were tested to label E. persicae internally and the egg load of gravid syrphids. These trials were intended to pave the way towards future mark-release-recapture experiments aimed to evaluate the antagonists’ activity range and thus strategically position the insectary plants for optimal aphid biological control in the whole orchard. The first step of new approach in the biological control of D. plantaginea has been set with this study. Its originality lies in the induction of economically indifferent aphid infestations on selected plants introduced in the orchard to encourage well-targeted groups of specialist aphid antagonists. Further trials are still needed to validate the field efficacy of the insectary plant systems developed and evaluate their possible integration within the whole array of pest management tools in both organic and integrated apple production.
