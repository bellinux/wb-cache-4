5|$|Impossible {{to ignore}} was Day's {{disparity}} to his rival, Paige. Historians {{have noted that}} Paige had a boisterous approach compared to Day's reserved demeanor; Paige was tall and Day was short and slender; and Paige <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> promote his name while Day shied away from attention. The pitchers' infrequent head-to-head matchups led to remarkable pitching duels, three of which Day won.|$|E
5|$|However, Peckham <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> reorganise the estates of the diocese, {{and held}} an inquiry in 1283 through 1285 into the {{revenues}} of the see. He set up administrative {{structures in the}} manors that divided them into seven administrative groups. Peckham, though, was almost continually in debt, {{and because he was}} a Franciscan, he had no personal property to help with his living expenses. He had inherited the diocesan debts that his predecessor had allowed to accumulate, and never managed to clear them.|$|E
5|$|Marcus went {{to great}} lengths to {{sanitize}} her own and Wyatt's history. For example, she <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> keep both her name and the name of Wyatt's second wife Mattie out of Stuart Lake's 1931 book, , and Marcus threatened litigation to keep it that way. Marcus also told Earp's biographers and others that Earp never drank, did not own gambling saloons, and that he never provided prostitutes to customers, although strong evidence to the contrary exists.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge began reforms {{immediately}} and zealously. He secured the General Assembly's {{passage of a}} two-cent property tax for education. The tax was subject to voter approval, and Breckinridge <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> publicize the issue. His efforts paid off, as the tax passed by almost a two-to-one margin. Continuing to publicize needs and push legislators to action, Breckinridge enjoyed the support of {{five of the six}} governors under whom he served. Only John L. Helm, who opposed a state-funded school system, challenged him, but Helm's veto of a Breckinridge educational bill was overridden in the General Assembly. Breckinridge's reforms manifested tangible results. From 1847 to 1850, educational spending increased from $6,000 to $144,000. By 1850, only one out of every ten school age children did not attend school.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} during her North American debut in 2011, Kurosaki mentioned {{that it had}} been her long-time dream to perform theme songs for anime series, and that anime {{is a big part of}} her life. She related her experiences working at Dear Stage, where originally worked as a waitress and performer. She said that she <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> meet customer expectations, and that performing at the venue's stage would prove to be a valuable experience as it would allow her to perform at larger stages with more imagination and inspiration. She mentioned that while writing lyrics for anime series, she wants the tone and mood of her songs to match the anime's setting.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, other European powers {{had decided}} that it was not in their {{interest}} that any one power should dominate the Baltic Sea. After long negotiations, known as the first Concert of the Hague, England sent a large fleet of 43 ships with more than 2,000 cannons. The force did not directly participate in fighting but nevertheless sent a clear message to the Dutch fleet patrolling the Danish waters. England <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> broker a peace, aided by France which also declared its willingness to help the Swedes if the Danes refused to negotiate.|$|E

5|$|Operation Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project in aerial warfare, initiated in 1966 by the United States Air Force {{to increase the}} ability to accurately strike at night or in adverse weather. During the 1960s the United States military <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> interdict the movement of men and materiel along the Ho Chi Minh trail. The North Vietnamese were experts {{in the use of}} weather and darkness to conceal their movement, and understanding the superiority of American air power put their skills immediately to good use. US forces seeking to impede the steady flow of supplies attempted to locate largely static targets during the day with poor results.|$|E
5|$|Pat Moran, {{the foreman}} of a {{construction}} gang, <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> save up {{enough money to}} pay for the passage of his wife and daughter to their new home in America. On the day of their arrival, he heads to the pier to greet them and becomes involved in a serious accident. He is injured and taken unconscious to the hospital as an unidentified patient. His wife and daughter know nothing of what has befallen him and struggle to live in the city. The daughter gets a position in a sweatshop, and her eyesight deteriorates until she is unable to work anymore. Now blind, she resorts to playing the violin for money while her mother becomes a beggar.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Battleship Division Nine's {{time with}} the Grand Fleet, combating boredom was a {{constant}} difficulty. Located at the northeastern tip of Scotland, the islands surrounding Scapa Flow {{were little more than}} barren, cold, windswept specks of land devoid of the trappings of civilization. Due to the efforts of the officers to keep their men entertained, however, morale remained high throughout the war. The British <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> turn the anchorage into a more inviting place. Central to these efforts were sporting events. The Fleet held numerous inter-ship competitions, including soccer, rugby, rowing, track, and boxing, which were followed with intense interest by the men of the respective ships.|$|E

5|$|While in Lagos, Achebe {{started work}} on a novel. This was challenging, since very little African fiction had been written in English, {{although}} Amos Tutuola's Palm-Wine Drinkard (1952) and Cyprian Ekwensi's People of the City (1954) were notable exceptions. While appreciating Ekwensi's work, Achebe <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> develop his own style, even as he pioneered {{the creation of the}} Nigerian novel itself. A visit to Nigeria by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956 brought issues of colonialism and politics to the surface, and was a significant moment for Achebe.|$|E
5|$|As Allen's {{first-class}} career {{came to a}} close, {{he moved}} into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He {{was instrumental in the}} creation of a MCC coaching manual, and <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> eliminate illegal bowling actions. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the D'Oliveira affair, a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to Lord's Cricket Ground, where he died, aged 87, in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Beardmore was {{sufficiently}} impressed with Shackleton to offer financial support, but other donations proved {{hard to come}} by. Nevertheless, in February 1907, Shackleton presented to the Royal Geographical Society his plans for an Antarctic expedition, the details of which, under the name British Antarctic Expedition, {{were published in the}} Royal Society's newsletter, Geographic Journal. The aim was the conquest of both the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. Shackleton then <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> persuade others of his wealthy friends and acquaintances to contribute, including Sir Philip Lee Brocklehurst, who subscribed £2,000 (2011 equivalent £157,000) to secure a place on the expedition; author Campbell Mackellar; and Guinness baron Lord Iveagh, whose contribution was secured less than two weeks before the departure of the expedition ship Nimrod. On 4 August 1907, Shackleton was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, 4th Class (MVO; the present-day grade of Lieutenant).|$|E

5|$|Before Crisis was {{the first}} {{original}} video game developed by Square Enix exclusively for mobile phones, originally released on NTT DoCoMo's FOMA mobile devices, and the first action role-playing game exclusive to the platform. The company's first major mobile title, also in collaboration with NTT DoCoMo, was a remake of the original Final Fantasy. Using {{lessons learned from the}} development of the Final Fantasy port, the team <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> make Before Crisis a uniquely mobile experience, with gameplay features built to exploit mobile functions such as the camera and network capacity. The camera function used to generate Materia was based on a simple image recognition that specifies the Materia generated based on the picture's general color. One of the challenges during development was to keep the framerate smooth during moments of high action, especially as no two mobiles would have identical components. In addition to these problems were issues with integrating the multiplayer functions, balancing the gameplay for different playstyles, creating a comfortable button layout, and adjusting the amount of content they could include for mobiles while maintaining the desired product quality.|$|E
5|$|Henry was an intellectual. The first English king with {{a modern}} humanist education, he read and wrote English, French and Latin, and was {{thoroughly}} {{at home in}} his well-stocked library. He personally annotated many books and wrote and published one of his own. To promote the {{public support for the}} reformation of the church, Henry had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared. For example, Richard Sampson's Oratio (1534) was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent from Rome. At the popular level, theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices: the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while the glorious king was hailed as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith. Henry <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Kheda {{was hit by}} {{floods and}} famine and the {{peasantry}} was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> win {{public support for the}} agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused but finally in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.|$|E

5|$|In Washington, Landis <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> protect Gresham's {{interests}} in the State Department, making friends with {{many members of the}} press. He was less popular among many of the Department's senior career officials, who saw him as brash. When word leaked concerning President Cleveland's Hawaiian policy, the President was convinced Landis was the source of the information and demanded his dismissal. Gresham defended Landis, stating that Cleveland would have to fire both of them, and the President relented, later finding out that he was mistaken in accusing Landis. President Cleveland grew to like Landis, and when Gresham died in 1895, offered Landis the post of United States Ambassador to Venezuela. Landis declined the diplomatic post, preferring to return to Chicago to begin a law practice and to marry Winifred Reed, daughter of the Ottawa, Illinois postmaster. The two married July 25, 1895; they had two surviving children, a boy, Reed, and a girl, Susanne—a third child, Winifred, died almost immediately after being born.|$|E
5|$|In fall 1820, Pierce entered Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, one of {{nineteen}} freshmen. He {{joined the}} Athenian Society, a progressive literary society, alongside Jonathan Cilley (later elected to Congress) and Nathaniel Hawthorne (the author), {{with whom he}} formed lasting friendships. Last in his class after two years, he <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> improve his grades and in 1824 graduated in fifth place in a graduating class of fourteen. In Pierce's junior year, John P. Hale, a later political ally and then rival of Pierce's, also enrolled at Bowdoin. That year, Pierce organized and led an unofficial militia company, the Bowdoin Cadets, which included Cilley and Hawthorne. The unit performed drill on campus near the president's house until the noise caused him to demand it halt. The students rebelled and went on strike, an event Pierce was suspected of leading. During his final year at Bowdoin, he spent several months teaching at a school in rural Hebron, Maine, where his students included future Congressman John J. Perry, and he earned his first salary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the end the}} Māoris {{remained}} in position until 17 April. Throughout the previous two days the battalion <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> repel repeated attempts by elements of the German 2nd Infantry Regiment to infiltrate their lines, before they finally received the order to fall back. With isolated platoons still {{in contact with the}} Germans and amidst high winds and a heavy downpour of rain, the New Zealanders had difficulty disengaging. Withdrawing over difficult terrain towards the pass, the manoeuvre continued into the night as the Germans continued to harass their rearguard units. The move was carried out with considerable urgency because the intention was to blow a bridge up just after the battalion had withdrawn across it in order to delay the German advance. In the end the battalion only just made it, for the engineers tasked with carrying out the demolition had received the order to complete their task and were about to detonate when the battalion arrived shortly after 3:00am.|$|E
