25|$|Born in Heemstede, North Holland, Verheul {{made her}} Dutch senior debut {{at the age}} of 19, when she was {{included}} in the squad for its March 1999 tour of Sri Lanka. She went on to play in the third and fourth ODIs of the series. Verheul's next appearance for the national side came at the 1999 1999 European Championship, when she played against Denmark. She made 17 runs from seventh in the batting order, which was her team's equal highest score (with Pauline te Beest) as they were bowled out for 88. At the 2000 World Cup in New Zealand, Verheul <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> team's youngest players, and played in four of a possible seven matches. Her best innings, 46 not out from balls, came against India, and was the second-best by a Dutch player (after Rowan Milburn's 71).

25|$|Li was an {{aggressive}} baseliner whose game was founded upon her quick reflexes, athleticism and powerful groundstrokes that achieved precision, placement and depth. Li's crosscourt forehand {{tended to be}} her favourite shot, hit with great accuracy and pace, although her backhand {{was said to be}} the more consistent and reliable groundstroke, both of which she was known to unleash unpredictably to all areas of the court to dictate play. She boasted an exceptional backhand down-the-line, which was very effective at producing winners or setting up a weak reply from the opponent. Many tennis analysts considered Li one of the cleanest and hardest hitting players on tour, capable of overpowering and outgunning opponents from the baseline. Although she did not possess an overwhelmingly powerful serve, it was very well placed, earning her aces or unreturnables on occasion, however it often became a liability when she lost confidence under pressure, resulting in many double faults. Li employed a solid defensive game combining great footwork, speed and lateral movement. Her ability to turn defense into offense <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> biggest assets as she hit well on the run and scrambled around the court with ease. Having been an accomplished doubles player, she was comfortable when playing at the net, often moving forward {{to take advantage of a}} short ball or finish off an extended rally. Li's inconsistency was cited as her main weakness throughout her career, as she was prone to streaky and erratic play accompanied by a high unforced error count. Since her shots were usually hit hard and flat with minimal topspin or slice, her game lacked variety. Her emotions on court have hurt her game during tight moments. Under the tutelage of Carlos Rodríguez, Li adopted more of an all-round game, implementing a forehand with additional topspin and frequent net approaches into her arsenal, as well as improved consistency, mental stability, mobility and coordination.|$|E
