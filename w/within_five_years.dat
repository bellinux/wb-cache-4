5|$|Born in Salem, Massachusetts, John Clough Holmes {{moved to}} Michigan in 1835, and gained {{employment}} in a Detroit merchant store. <b>Within</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> {{he had married}} his boss's daughter, and soon became {{a partner in the}} family business. Holmes {{served as president of the}} Detroit Horticultural Society in 1847. The following two years he was a member of the Board of Education of Detroit. Then in 1849 he co-founded the Michigan State Agricultural Society.|$|E
5|$|Firm {{evidence}} for specific early {{performances of the}} play is scant. What is known is that {{the crew of the}} ship Red Dragon, anchored off Sierra Leone, performed Hamlet in September 1607; that the play toured in Germany <b>within</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> of Shakespeare's death; and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637. Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to Hamlet (only Falstaff is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, annual {{membership}} dues were stated to be $9,000 per {{member or}} $12,000 for a family, {{with an initial}} deposit of $250,000.

5|$|On {{a single}} day in 1825, 23 ships were left {{stranded}} off the coast. In 1833, Martinus Rørbye became the first artist to paint the fishermen and landscapes of Skagen, {{almost half a century}} before the arrival of the Skagen Painters. Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844. In 1858, the grey lighthouse was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of tiled roofs <b>within</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853.|$|E

An old X-ray department at the hospital was decontaminated and converted into a storage department at a cost of £40,000, and a taxi company was contracted to move the records between sites.|$|E

When a new business management team was appointed {{at the start of the}} 2009–10 season, it inherited a business saddled with debt. The subsequent turnaround has resulted in operational profitability based on the disposal of non-core property assets, a new equity investment and a financial restructuring agreement with lenders for all debt to be repaid <b>within</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> In 2016, the club reported that it was debt-free.|$|E
5|$|<b>Within</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> Trafford Park, Europe's largest {{industrial}} estate, {{was home}} to forty firms. The earliest structures on the canal side were grain silos; the grain was used for flour and as ballast for ships carrying raw cotton. The wooden silo built opposite No.9 Dock in 1898 (destroyed in the Manchester Blitz in 1940) was Europe's largest grain elevator. The CWS bought land on Trafford Wharf in 1903, where it opened a bacon factory and a flour mill. In 1906 it bought the Sun Mill, which it extended in 1913 to create the UK's largest flour mill, with its own wharf, elevators and silos.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1990s, NSB had {{initiated}} {{a program to}} replace the traditional locomotive and carriage trains with new, tilting multiple units. This had led {{to the order of}} sixteen Class 73 four-car units for the three mainline routes on the Bergen, Dovre and Sørland Lines. To supplement this, on 14 November 1996 the board of NSB decided to purchase seven tilting diesel multiple units for the Røros and Rauma Lines. In particular, the aging Di3 locomotives would be retired <b>within</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> and NSB was reluctant to purchase new diesel locomotives for passenger trains. The failure of the Di6, which were returned to the manufacturer Siemens, further motivated NSB to avoid locomotive-hauled trains.|$|E

5|$|Following post-storm surveys, it was {{determined}} that most of the severely damaged schools were built improperly and the upper-floors were not designed to bear typhoon-force winds. According to building codes in Thailand, structures are mandated to be able to withstand up to 120kgf/m2 of pressure from winds. In the years following the typhoon, studies by engineers were conducted in the hardest hit regions to determine how to best rebuild structures in the country. With many of the destroyed structures being constructed from wood, reinforced concrete structures were the suggested replacement. The new buildings could last up to 50 years with proper construction; however, sub-standard building would result in a need for repairs <b>within</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|For three seasons, City {{finished}} in mid-table in Division Three {{and the new}} Division Two, when the leagues were renamed following {{the formation of the}} Premier League. In January 1994, Geoffrey Richmond took over as chairman. He cleared the debts, loaned the club £2.3million, and promised the fans he would take the club to the Premier League <b>within</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> In his first season as chairman, the club {{finished in}} seventh place with Frank Stapleton as manager. Stapleton was sacked and was replaced by Lennie Lawrence. Lawrence could only finish 14th in his first season, before he left for Luton Town in November 1995 to be replaced by his assistant Chris Kamara.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle Prison's New Division was {{constructed}} between 1904 and 1907, {{as a response}} to overcrowding. The division continues the façade alignment of the main block. The building, L shaped in plan, is three storeys high of regular coursed pale ashlar limestone blocks with rock-face. Openings are set in brick and freestone and it has a handsome lantern range above the main atrium. The building is visually significant as it complements the main cell block and completes the northern zone of the prison. The interior configuration and cells are significant as an example of an attempt to introduce the separate system to Western Australia, whereby prisoners were completely isolated for {{the first three months of}} their sentence. The division's exercise yard initially used a panopticon to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading its removal <b>within</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1239 Henry {{introduced}} different policies, possibly {{trying to}} imitate those of Louis of France: Jewish leaders across England were imprisoned {{and forced to}} pay fines equivalent {{to a third of}} their goods, and any outstanding loans were to be released. Further huge demands for cash followed – £40,000 was demanded in 1244, for example, of which around two-thirds was collected <b>within</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> – destroying the ability of the Jewish community to lend money commercially. Henry had built the Domus Conversorum in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s. Anti-Jewish stories involving tales of child sacrifice flourished in the 1250s and, in response, Henry passed the Statute of Jewry in 1253, which attempted to segregate Jews and enforce the wearing of Jewish badges; it remains unclear to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry.|$|E
5|$|In the East the {{situation}} was much darker for the Christians. In the Holy Land, the Second Crusade had disastrous long-term consequences for Jerusalem. In 1149, the atabeg Anur died, {{at which point the}} amir Abu Sa'id Mujir al-Din Abaq Ibn Muhammad finally began to rule. The ra'is of Damascus and commander of the ahdath milita Mu'ayad al-Dawhal Ibn al-Sufi feel that since his ahdath had {{played a major role in}} defeating the Second Crusade that he deserved a greater share of the power, and within two months of Anur's death was leading a rebellion against Abaq. The in-fighting within Damascus was to lead to the end of the Burid state <b>within</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> Damascus no longer trusted the crusader kingdom and was taken by Nur ad-Din after a short siege in 1154.|$|E
5|$|On November21, {{insurance}} {{payments for}} losses {{were expected to}} exceed $12million. On January1, 1963, a $2million relief fund was authorized by President Kennedy. Another $5.4million in relief funds were provided by President Lyndon B. Johnson on February15, 1964. The United States Congress provided Guam with $60million, including $45million through federal loans, mainly to help rebuild the territory and promote expansion of the economy. Additionally, the storm brought {{about the end of}} military security on the island, which in turn aided economic growth. <b>Within</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> of this decision, Japanese tourism to the island dramatically increased, prompting a major {{increase in the number of}} hotels. In the long term, Typhoon Karen, along with other destructive storms, shaped the development of the island's infrastructure. It led to higher quality buildings and more efficient utilities that could withstand powerful typhoons. Since Karen, most buildings on the island have been constructed with concrete and steel.|$|E
