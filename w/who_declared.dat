40|$|This paper {{deals with}} young people <b>who</b> <b>declare</b> {{themselves}} discriminated because of their ethnicity or colour. The aim is to evaluate {{the effect of the}} discrimination feeling on professional paths for young people 7 years after having left school. We use the statistical survey of Cereq Génération 97 (7 years) and the clustering method using self-organizing maps (Kohonen algorithm). Eight classes of professional paths are exposed. Two kinds of segmentation of professional paths are obtained. The "inter-class" segmentation : young people <b>who</b> <b>declare</b> themselves discriminated are more present in temporary-work class or unemployment class. This finding is consolidated by some qualitative talks {{with young people}} <b>who</b> <b>declare</b> themselves discriminated. They explained the refusal of victimization in the labour market. The "intra-class" segmentation : a lot of inequalities exit inside classes. Working full time or become a manager is more difficult for young people <b>who</b> <b>declare</b> themselves discriminated even if their professional path is good.

5|$|By {{the end of}} November, {{the rebels}} gained control of the towns of Harim and Jisr al-Shughur and the villages of their districts.

Other major scenes of fighting occurred at Isqat, Jisr al-Hadid, Kafr Takharim, Darkush, Talkalakh and the areas of al-Qusayr and Antioch. At around the same time, Kurdish tribal forces countered the French at Viranşehir, east of Aleppo, and Bedouin forces commanded by ex-Ottoman officer Ramadan al-Shallash, <b>who</b> <b>declared</b> his support for Hananu, began guerrilla actions against French forces in the general vicinity of Raqqa.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{military}} background, Andronikos failed {{to deal with}} Isaac Komnenos, Béla III of Hungary (r. 1172–1196) who reincorporated Croatian territories into Hungary, and Stephen Nemanja of Serbia (r. 1166–1196) <b>who</b> <b>declared</b> his independence from the Byzantine Empire. Yet, none of these troubles would compare to William II of Sicily's (r. 1166–1189) invasion force of 300 ships and 80,000 men, arriving in 1185. Andronikos mobilised a small fleet of 100 ships to defend the capital, {{but other than that}} he was indifferent to the populace.
