25|$|Chromebooks {{ship with}} Google Chrome OS, an {{operating}} system {{that uses the}} Linux kernel and the Google Chrome <b>web-browser</b> with an integrated media-player. Enabling developer mode allows the installation of Linux distributions on Chromebooks. Crouton is a script that allows the installation of Linux distributions from Chrome OS, and running both operating systems simultaneously. Some Chromebooks include SeaBIOS, which can be turned on to install and boot Linux distributions directly. With limited offline capability and a fast boot-time, Chromebooks are primarily designed for use while connected to the Internet. Instead of installing traditional applications such as word processing and instant messaging, users add web apps from the Chrome Web Store. Google claims that a multi-layer security architecture {{eliminates the need for}} anti-virus software.|$|E

25|$|A {{controller}} is a server-side {{component of}} Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application, by determining which view file to render. The controller {{may also have}} to query one or more models for information and pass these on to the view. For example, in an airline reservation system, a controller implementing a flight-search function would need to query a model representing individual flights to find flights matching the search, and might also need to query models representing airports and airlines to find related secondary data. The controller might then pass some subset of the flight data to the corresponding view, which would contain a mixture of static HTML and logic that use the flight data to create an HTML document containing a table with one row per flight. A controller may provide one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, an action is typically a basic unit that describes {{how to respond to}} a specific external <b>web-browser</b> request. Also, note that the controller/action will be accessible for external web requests only if a corresponding route is mapped to it. Rails encourages developers to use RESTful routes, which include actions such as create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes.rb configuration file.|$|E
500|$|Einstein's {{scientific}} publications {{are listed}} below in four tables: journal articles, book chapters, books and authorized translations. [...] Each publication is {{indexed in the}} first column by its number in the Schilpp bibliography (Albert Einstein: Philosopher–Scientist, pp.694–730) and by its article number in Einstein's Collected Papers. [...] Complete references for these two bibliographies may be found below in the Bibliography section. [...] The Schilpp numbers are used for cross-referencing in the Notes (the final column of each table), since they cover a greater time period of Einstein's life at present. [...] The English translations of titles are generally taken from the published volumes of the Collected Papers. [...] For some publications, however, such official translations are not available; unofficial translations are indicated with a § superscript. Although the tables are presented in chronological order by default, each table can be re-arranged in alphabetical order for any column by the reader clicking on the arrows {{at the top of}} that column. [...] For illustration, to re-order a table by subject—e.g., to group together articles that pertain to [...] "General relativity" [...] or [...] "Specific heats"—one need only click on the arrows in the [...] "Classification and Notes" [...] columns. [...] To print out the re-sorted table, one may print it directly by using the <b>web-browser</b> Print option; the [...] "Printable version" [...] link at the left gives only the default sorting. [...] Collaborative works by Einstein are highlighted in lavender, with the co-author(s) provided in the final column of the table.|$|E

2500|$|The {{implementation}} of affiliate marketing {{on the internet}} relies heavily on various techniques built into the design of many web-pages and web-sites, {{and the use of}} calls to external domains to track user actions (click tracking, Ad Sense) and to serve up content (advertising) to the user. Most of this activity adds time [...] and is generally a nuisance to the casual web-surfer and is seen as visual clutter. [...] Various countermeasures have evolved over time to prevent or eliminate the appearance of advertising when a web-page is rendered. Third party programs (Ad-Aware, Adblock Plus, Spybot, pop-up blockers, etc.) and particularly, the use of a comprehensive HOSTS file can effectively eliminate the visual clutter and the extra time and bandwidth needed to render many web pages. [...] The use of specific entries in the HOSTS file to block these well-known and persistent marketing and click-tracking domains can also aid in reducing a system's exposure to malware by preventing the content of infected advertising or tracking servers to reach a user's <b>web-browser.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{security}} risks that the users are exposed to, while using applications that connect to the Internet. During the research which had been conducted, two <b>Web-Browsers,</b> two Instant Messengers and one File Sharing application have been used in order to generate traffic through the Internet. The purpose of the experiment was to reveal what types of attacks each application was accepting, while it was generating traffic on the Internet. The applications of the same type have been tested together {{at the same time and}} each type of application had been tested at different times, for forty hours each. While these applications were running, the traffic that they generated had been captured. According to the analysis from the traffic that the applications have generated, it has become clear that the Instant Messengers and the File Sharing applications are not accepting a lot of attacks while they are connecting to the Internet. The <b>Web-Browsers</b> on the other side are accepting a larger number of attacks and of more aggressive nature. FACULTY OF TECHNOLOG...|$|R
