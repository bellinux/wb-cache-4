The concept of Wanderland Music and Arts Festival is to produce yearly concert events with different themes to create variety of activities and art installations for the attendees. Their vision is to make Filipino people experience a one of a kind music festival and make Wanderland, the biggest and the most established music festival in the Philippines. Brought by the big success of its first year, many international brands such as Topshop, River Island, Rayban, GAP and Smirnoff and one of the biggest mobile telecom in the country, Globe Telecom, have partnered with Karpos Multimedia in making Wanderland happen. Fox Networks Group Philippines, which manages leading general entertainment channels Fox and Star World would become a co-presenter.|$|R

50|$|In Adamczewski’s view « … {{languages}} {{have two}} parallel series of grammatical markers, {{from which the}} speaker alternately chooses according to his/her strategy in terms of meaning » (1999: 72-transl. ours). Phase 1 markers are those grammatical items which indicate open paradigmatic choice, while Phase 2 items, marking closed paradigmatic choice, enable the speaker to use {{the result of that}} operation to express his/her own standpoint relative to what s/he is saying and relative to the addressee (this for instance could be warning, or regret, or justification...). Phase 2 markers will therefore appear in what is referred to as ‘presupposing contexts’ in the theory. Let us take the example of the French microsystem VOICI/VOILA. In Voici le Professeur X (« This is Professor X »), the NP le Professeur X is non-predictable (open paradigmatic choice), hence the element of surprise that more or less accompanies such utterances; in Voilà le Professeur X (« Here comes Professor X »), somehow the NP le Professeur X is already part of the linguistic context and/or situation of utterance, for instance because it has been mentioned before (« Why! We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Professor X, and here he comes. »).|$|R

5000|$|A {{desire to}} {{separate}} legal from moral {{elements in the}} law. The realists were legal positivists who believed that law should be treated scientifically.

40|$|Not all {{investors are}} rational. Quite {{apart from the}} obvious {{examples}} of credulity {{in the face of}} the latest Ponzi scheme, there is no shortage of evidence that many investors 2 ̆ 7 decisions are influenced by systematic biases that impair their abilities to maximize their investment returns. For example, investors will often hold onto poorly performing stocks longer than warranted, hoping to recoup their losses. Other investors will engage in speculative trading, dissipating their returns by paying larger commissions than more passive investors. And we <b>are</b> not <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> widows and orphans here. There is evidence that supposedly sophisticated institutional investors-mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies-suffer from similar biases that impair their decisions. These biases are not merely isolated quirks, rather, they are consistent, deep-rooted, and systematic behavioral patterns. Apparently even the considerable sums at stake in the securities markets are not enough to induce market participants to overcome these cognitive defects on a consistent basis...|$|R
