Energy consumption {{was the most important}} factor for <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission and decided by economic development and rising living standard. This paper analyzes the situation of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission and the primary factors in China through empirical method. Energy consumption and economic development are chosen to be the crucial factors for the analysis on <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission because these two factors will affect the quantity and structure of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission. To control <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission, in China, advanced energy technology play key role. At the same time, some economic factors, for instance, adjustment of economic structure, investment for <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> control and policy for energy technology improvement, are necessary to control <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission...|$|R

30|$|There are {{two types}} of {{undesirable}} environmental outputs: <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> and wastewater. At the national level, the productive potential rate of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is 0.507, whereas the productive potential rate of wastewater is 0.377. Therefore, over the entire country, <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> can be reduced by 50.7  % without slowing economic growth, and similarly, wastewater can be reduced by 37.7  %. This result demonstrates that at the aggregate level, a greater potential for progress exists for <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> reduction than for wastewater treatment. Therefore, the government should invest more resources into <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> reduction than wastewater treatment.|$|R

5000|$|The {{reciprocating}} chemical muscle {{was developed}} as a drive mechanism for the flapping wings of the entomopter. The RCM reuses energy many times before releasing it into its surroundings. [...] First, it converts mainly heat energy into flapping-wing motion in the entomopter. Then, heat is scavenged for thermoelectric generation in support of ancillary systems. <b>Waste</b> <b>gas</b> from the chemical decomposition of the fuel is then {{used to create a}} frequency modulated continuous wave acoustic ranging signal that is Doppler insensitive (used for obstacle avoidance). <b>Waste</b> <b>gas</b> is then passed through an ejector to entrain external atmospheric gases to increase mass flow and decrease <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> temperature so that lower-temperature components can be used downstream. Some <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is diverted into gas bearings for rotational and linear moving components. Finally, remaining <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is vectored into the wings where it is used for circulation-controlled lift augmentation (Coanda effect). Any remaining gas can be used for vectored thrust, but if the gas budgets are correctly designed, there should be no extra gas beyond the circulation control points. The features of the RCM are tailored to the entomopter to conserve energy.|$|R

50|$|Like {{the lead}} ISASMELT pilot plant, the lead ISASMELT {{demonstration}} plant suffered from constraints {{imposed by the}} <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> handling system. In {{the case of the}} demonstration plant, the problem was caused by sticky fume that formed an insulating layer on the convection tube bundles of the waste heat boilers, significantly reducing the heat transfer rates and thus the ability of the boilers to reduce the <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> temperature. As the plant used baghouses to filter lead fume from the <b>waste</b> <b>gas,</b> it was necessary to reduce the temperature of the gas below {{the point at which the}} bags would be damaged by high temperatures. The problem was solved by allowing cool air to mix with the hot <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> to lower the temperature to a level at which the baghouse could operate. This reduced the ISASMELT plant’s capacity because it was again limited by the volume of gas that could be filtered by the baghouse.|$|R
40|$|In 1996, the BASF Corporation's Geismar, Louisiana site {{determined}} that the increased steam demands of their aggressive investment program would require them to expand their steam generation capacity. The site had operated a gas turbine based cogeneration system since 1985 so they naturally reviewed the economics of another such installation. At the same time, a new Acetylene plant was being planned, which generated a large process <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> stream. Conceptual studies indicated that integrating the two projects would provide significant economic advantages. The new gas turbine {{is similar to the}} first unit with a capacity of approximately 37. 5 MW. However, there are several factors that make this a unique installation. For one, the new unit has a unique dual fuel capability -natural gas as well as the process <b>waste</b> <b>gas.</b> The <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is hydrogen and carbon monoxide rich, and has a much lower heating value per cubic foot than does natural gas. The use of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is a great advantage since it avoids flaring this valuable "fuel" with the associated increased emissions. The innovative fuel system was designed to accommodate a wide range of gas mixes to maximize the amount of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> that can be utilized in the unit. The unit is equipped with a state of the art Selective Catalytic Reduction system in the exhaust stack to greatly reduce the amount of NOx emissions produced by the installation. The emissions are a maximum of 8 -PPM NOx with natural gas and 25 PPM with 100 % <b>waste</b> <b>gas...</b>|$|R

50|$|In the Operating Room the Anaesthetic Gas Scavenging System {{collects}} {{and removes}} <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> {{from the patient}} breathing circuit and the patient ventilation circuit. There is a legal requirement to scavenge <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> to maintain the level of <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> in the Operating Room below the legally acceptable limit. For example, in the UK the limits are typically 100ppm for nitrous oxide and 50ppm for halogenated volatile anaesthetic agents (except halothane which is 10ppm). Other jurisdictions have different requirements for local environmental contamination, for example, nitrous oxide maximum 25ppm and halogenated volatile gases maximum 2ppm. In addition to the legal requirement there is an Occupational Health requirement to maintain a safe workplace and limit exposure to potentially harmful gases.|$|R
40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{incineration}} plants equipped with wet flue <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbing</b> generate process solutions like acid flue <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbing</b> water containing heavy metals such as Hg(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), Ni(II), and Fe(II/III). The specification of these heavy metals does usualy prevent a utilization. Hence a special solvent extraction process has been developed for the removal and the recovery of Hg(II) from acid flue <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbing</b> solutions. The process is based upon extraction of chloromercurat complexes {{by means of the}} anionexchanger Aliquat 336 solved in a mixture of n-paraffins and 1 -decanole. After multiple washing stages the mercury is stripped using an aqueous ethylenediamine solution. The process was tested on a semi-technical scale for feed solutions containing hydrochloric acid in a concentration range of 0. 5 - 5 mole/l. Model solutions as well as flue <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbing</b> solutions from the TAMARA test incinerator for municipal solid waste have been used. The mercury can easily be recovered out of the stripping phase by electrolysis. The described solvent extraction process can also be applied to the recovery of cadmium and zinc. (orig.) Bei Hausmuellverbrennungsanlagen mit nasser Rauchgasreinigung entstehen Prozessloesungen, z. B. das saure Rauchgaswaschwasser, die Schwermetalle enthalten wie Hg(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), Ni(II) und Fe(II/III). Aus der ueblichen Abwasserbehandlung erhaelt man die Schwermetalle nur als nicht verwertbaren Rueckstand. Deswegen wurde speziell fuer die Abtrennung und die Gewinnung von Quecksilber aus dem sauren Rauchgaswaschwasser ein Fluessig-Fluessig-Extraktionsverfahren entwickelt. Der Prozess zur Hg(II) -Abtrennung basiert auf der Extraktion mit dem Anionenaustauscher Aliquat 336, geloest in einem Gemisch aus n-Paraffinen und 1 -Decanol. Nach einer mehrstufigen Waesche erfolgt die Rueckextraktion mit waessriger Ethylendiaminloesung. Das Verfahren wurde im halbtechnischen Massstab fuer HCl-Konzentrationen der Speiseloesung zwischen 0, 5 und 5 M sowohl mit Modelloesungen als auch mit realem Rauchgaswaschwasser der Versuchsanlage TAMARA getestet. Eine Gewinnung des Quecksilbers aus dem Rueckextrakt ist durch elektrochemische Reduktion einfach moeglich. Das beschriebene Extraktionsverfahren kann auch auf die Wiedergewinnung von Cadmium und Zink uebertragen werden. (orig.)
