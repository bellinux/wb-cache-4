50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of {{election}} stock markets. The first type is a <b>winner-takes-all</b> <b>market</b> in which only one contract pays a fixed sum, typically $1, and all other contracts pay $0. Examples {{of this type of}} <b>winner-takes-all</b> <b>market</b> include a referendum outcome (yes or no), one of several parties winning an absolute majority, or one of several parties winning a plurality.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how productivity effects of human capital and innovation vary at dif- ferent {{points of the}} conditional productivity distribution. Our analysis draws upon two large unbalanced panels of 6, 634 enterprises in Germany and 14, 586 enterprises in the Netherlands over the period 2000 - 2008, considering 5 manufacturing and services industries that differ {{in the level of}} technological intensity. Industries in the Netherlands are characterized by a larger average proportion of high-skilled employees and industries in Germany by a more un- equal distribution of human capital intensity. In Germany, average innovation performance is higher in all industries, except for low-technology manufacturing, and in the Netherlands the innovation performance distributions are more dispersed. In both countries, we observe non-linearities in the productivity effects of investing in product innovation in the majority of industries. Frontier firms enjoy the highest returns to product innovation whereas for process innovation the most negative returns are observed in the best-performing enterprises of most industries. We find that in both countries the returns to human capital increase with proximity to the technological frontier in industries with a low level of technological intensity. Strikingly, a negative complementarity effect between human capital and proximity to the technological frontier is observed in knowledge-intensive services, which is most pronounced for the Netherlands. Suggestive evidence suggests an interpretation of a <b>winner-takes-all</b> <b>market</b> in knowledge-intensive services...|$|E
50|$|Election {{stock markets}} {{typically}} cease trading {{the day before}} the election is held. The markets are liquidated after the election based on the election outcome. In markets for the popular vote share and the parliamentary seats share, each contract is valued precisely equal to the corresponding percentage share. In <b>winner-takes-all</b> <b>markets,</b> the winning contract pays $1, while the losing contracts pay $0.|$|R
50|$|The final {{showdown}} {{between the}} Tings and Fongs {{is inspired by}} the backdrop of {{a war in the}} Middle East in 1994. Fong Chin-bok's investment company faces the Ting family in a <b>winner-takes-all,</b> last-man-standing stock <b>market</b> epic battle. To raise the stakes, the Tings are financed by international criminal syndicates. Fong wins the support of three of Hong Kong's wealthiest tycoons, who want to return the favour as they built their financial empires with help from Fong's father back in the 1960s. The stock market rises and falls correspondingly with news of American forces entering or withdrawing from the war. Eventually, the Tings make the wrong bet and their entire fortune is wiped out, compounded by ending up in billions of dollars in debt. Ting Hai forces his sons to commit suicide by jumping off {{from the top of the}} stock exchange building before following suit himself, but he survives and spends the rest of his life in prison.|$|R
40|$|This paper elaborates on {{why and how}} {{business}} relationships develop {{through an}} indepth study of a world-leading industrial tooling company (ITC). The study of the ITC focuses {{on the development of}} a “preferred supplier ” concept, developed in the UK subsidiary since the mid- 1990 ’s. The aim was to capture business volume at customers through greatly increased embeddedness from a legal, technical and social point of view. In brief, the ITC offers greater productivity at the customer plant through productivity analysis using its network knowledge of cutting, milling and drilling operations and the tools involved. This has been codified in a software package. The ICT also offers automated, real-time stock control and consignment stocks. The case study highlights some important implications of business relationships. It shows that strong ties can be built relatively fast if a working methodology exists and if buyers are willing to give suppliers a greater role. The main driver for the relationship in general, commitment, investments and trust, is the explicit methodology and documentation of achievements in terms of productivity gains and cost savings. It is the network knowledge of the ITC that is exchanged, not the tools themselves but rather the optimization of the activities that they perform. For the ITC, what was previously a fragmented but stable market is becoming a <b>winner-takes-all</b> <b>market,</b> at the customer level. This indicates that increased levels of supplier-customer embeddedness can lead to fierce competition among suppliers...|$|E
