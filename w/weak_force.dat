5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} interaction (the <b>weak</b> <b>force</b> or weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the weak interaction is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the <b>weak</b> <b>force</b> is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of the weak interaction, fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass of each of these bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the <b>weak</b> <b>force.</b> The force is in fact termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear force or electromagnetic force.|$|E
5|$|The weak {{interaction}} affects all the fermions of the Standard Model, {{as well as}} the Higgs boson; neutrinos interact through gravity and the {{weak interaction}} only, and neutrinos were the original reason for the name <b>weak</b> <b>force.</b> The weak interaction does not produce bound states (nor does it involve binding energy) – something that gravity does on an astronomical scale, that the electromagnetic force does at the atomic level, and that the strong nuclear force does inside nuclei.|$|E

The only forces immediately available for Vienna's defence were Prince Louis of Baden's force of 36,000 stationed in the Lines of Stollhofen to watch Marshal Tallard at Strasbourg; {{there was also a}} <b>weak</b> <b>force</b> of 10,000 men under Field Marshal Count Limburg Styrum observing Ulm.|$|E
5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} <b>weak</b> <b>force,</b> and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E

50|$|The weak gravity {{conjecture}} (WGC) is a conjecture {{regarding the}} strength gravity can {{have in a}} theory of quantum gravity relative to the gauge forces in that theory.

25|$|The {{neutrino}} is {{so named}} because it is electrically neutral and because its rest mass is so small (-ino) that it was originally thought to be zero.

25|$|While Marshal Nicolas Soult invaded {{northern}} Portugal {{in early}} 1809, two other French forces stood ready {{to cooperate in}} the subjugation of Portugal.

25|$|Below an {{extremely}} high temperature, electroweak symmetry breaking causes the electroweak interaction to manifest {{in part as}} the short-ranged <b>weak</b> <b>force,</b> which is carried by massive gauge bosons. This symmetry breaking is required for atoms and other structures to form, {{as well as for}} nuclear reactions in stars, such as our Sun. However, it is not yet clear how symmetry breaking happens in nature. The Higgs field may provide a mechanism for this observed symmetry breaking. Further measurements will be needed to validate whether the Standard Model is correct in its approach and if it can be made more exact.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Navy inflicted a major setback {{upon the}} Italian Royal Navy during the Battle of Taranto {{on the night}} of 12/13 November. After {{assembling}} enough forces the British launched a counter-attack upon the Italians in Egypt. Operation Compass drove the Italians out of Egypt and resulted in the destruction of the Italian 10th Army in February 1941. Following this success, British forces adopted a defensive position in North Africa and redeployed most troops to Greece in Operation Lustre, leaving a <b>weak</b> <b>force</b> garrisoning the gains made from Operation Compass. In March, the Battle of Kufra ended with the Italians losing the desert oasis of Kufra—a vital link between Italian east and north Africa—which was located in south-eastern Libya.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} model of cosmology {{indicates that the}} total mass–energy of the universe contains 4.9% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter and 68.3% dark energy. Thus, dark matter constitutes 84.5% of total mass, while dark energy plus dark matter constitute 95.1% of total mass–energy content. The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is also unseen. Visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10% of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe. The most widely accepted hypothesis on the form for dark matter {{is that it is}} composed of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that interact only through gravity and the <b>weak</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
40|$|Since {{the advent}} of atomic force microscopy, {{mechanical}} resonators {{have been used to}} study a wide variety of phenomena, such as the dynamics of individual electron spins, persistent currents in normal metal rings, and the Casimir force. Key to these experiments is the ability to measure <b>weak</b> <b>forces.</b> Here, we report on force sensing experiments with a sensitivity of 12 zN Hz^(- 1 / 2) at a temperature of 1. 2 K using a resonator made of a carbon nanotube. An ultra-sensitive method based on cross-correlated electrical noise measurements, in combination with parametric downconversion, is used to detect the low-amplitude vibrations of the nanotube induced by <b>weak</b> <b>forces.</b> The force sensitivity is quantified by applying a known capacitive force. This detection method also allows us to measure the Brownian vibrations of the nanotube down to cryogenic temperatures. Force sensing with nanotube resonators offers new opportunities for detecting and manipulating individual nuclear spins as well as for magnetometry measurements. Comment: Early version.

50|$|Since {{molecular}} solids {{are held}} together by relatively <b>weak</b> <b>forces</b> {{they tend to have}} low melting and boiling points, low mechanical strength, low electrical conductivity, and poor thermal conductivity.

25|$|Wellington aimed {{his main}} assault {{at the lower}} Bidasoa, while sending {{additional}} troops to attack Soult's center. Believing his coastal sector secure, Soult held the right flank with a relatively <b>weak</b> <b>force</b> while concentrating most of his strength on his left flank in the mountains. However, the British general obtained local intelligence that indicated that water levels on the lower river were {{much lower than the}} French suspected. After careful planning, Wellington launched a surprise assault which easily overran the French left flank defenses. In the center, his army also won through the French defenses, though his Spanish allies were repulsed in one attack. At the beginning of the fighting, Soult realized that his left flank was in no danger, {{but it was too late}} to reinforce his positions on the right. Some French generals were shocked at how poorly their soldiers fought.|$|E
25|$|The eigenstates are {{obtained}} by diagonalizing this matrix. This gives new eigenvectors, {{which we can}} call K1 which {{is the sum of}} the two states of opposite strangeness, and K2, which is the difference. The two are eigenstates of CP with opposite eigenvalues; K1 has CP=+1, and K2 has CP=−1 Since the two-pion final state also has CP=+1, only the K1 can decay this way. The K2 must decay into three pions. Since the mass of K2 is just a little larger than the sum of the masses of three pions, this decay proceeds very slowly, about 600 times slower than the decay of K1 into two pions. These two different modes of decay were observed by Leon Lederman and his coworkers in 1956, establishing the existence of the two weak eigenstates (states with definite lifetimes under decays via the <b>weak</b> <b>force)</b> of the neutral kaons.|$|E
25|$|Goring's {{return to}} the west had already been {{countermanded}} {{and he had been}} directed to march to Harborough, while the South Wales Royalists were also called in towards Leicester. Later orders on 26 May directed him to Newbury, whence he was to feel the strength of the enemy's positions around Oxford. It is hardly necessary to say that Goring found good military reasons for continuing his independent operations, and marched off towards Taunton regardless of the order. He redressed the balance there for the moment by overawing Massey's <b>weak</b> <b>force,</b> and his purse profited considerably by fresh opportunities for extortion, but he and his men were not at Naseby. Meanwhile, the King, at the geographical centre of England, found an important and wealthy town at his mercy.
