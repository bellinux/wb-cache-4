They would be in heavily armed vehicles at {{the front and back}} of Hitler's convoy. In addition, army motorcycle outriders were positioned at the front and rear of the convoy of vehicles. The FBK <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> with Hitler and the RSD men <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> in a separate car during the trips.|$|E
5|$|Team CSC {{surprised}} by announcing that Sastre <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> the Giro as helper for Basso, that he <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> all three Grand Tours. 2005's winner Paolo Savoldelli was strongest {{in the first}} stages, and Jan Ullrich took a surprise win in the time trial ahead of Basso, but Basso dominated with three wins on mountain finishes and in the team time trial. Basso won by 9'18.|$|E
5|$|Antón, as expected, {{was named}} as the squad {{leader for the}} Vuelta a España. His goal was overall success. He was joined in the squad by fellow Giro d'Italia stage winner Nieve, Martínez, Verdugo, Txurruka, Oroz, Isasi, Azanza and Cazaux. Nieve commented a day into the Vuelta that he <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> solely to support Antón, {{despite the fact that}} both had won Giro stages and he (Nieve) had {{actually}} finished the race higher overall.|$|E

5|$|Gadret rode {{both the}} Giro and the Tour in 2010, an {{arrangement}} {{which resulted in}} some controversy when he refused to grant Roche, the squad's leader for the race, his wheel after the Irishman had punctured at a particularly inopportune time. This coupled with Gadret's recuperation after the extremely difficult Giro, and his admission that he prefers the Italian Grand Tour in any event, led to speculation {{as to whether the}} two would both be named to the squad. He claimed he <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> only to support Roche, if he rode at all. Lavenu stated that Gadret's impressive Giro had grown his standing with the team, and that the feud between him and Roche had been forgotten, so he hoped Gadret <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> the Tour. Confident of his recovery abilities, Gadret did indeed start the Tour.|$|E
5|$|Seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Vanity Fair magazine published on September 9 that he intended to return to competitive cycling in 2009, after four years of retirement. Aside from trying to win an eighth Tour de France, his goal would be to raise public awareness and money for cancer research. He <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> for no salary.|$|E
5|$|In her childhood, she <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> {{on horseback}} {{to visit her}} grandmother, who bought the young girl a {{newspaper}} to read every day and became {{a role model for}} the rest of her life. She began her education at a local one-room school, and gained local attention for her softball skill. In order to attend high school, she lived with her older sister in the neighboring town, where the school was located, and then began to drive every day despite being only 14. She graduated from Stanberry High School in 1941, aged 16.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixth}} stage, Aucouturier, Garin and Dortignac escaped {{in the last}} kilometres. Aucouturier signed first at the control post in Ville-d'Avray. From that point, the race was neutralised until the velodrome Parc-des-Princes, where the riders <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> the final kilometre. At the moment that the riders arrived in Paris, it started to rain. The organisers decided {{together}} with the cyclists to exclude the final kilometre from the race, and make the control post in Ville-d'Avray {{the end of the}} race. This made Aucouturier the winner of the stage. Maurice Garin finished second, which made him the overall winner.|$|E
5|$|The next day, it {{was further}} {{revealed}} {{that not only}} Bruyneel stood to be forced from the team according to Vinokourov, but also Armstrong and other riders from the former Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team. The team would be built around Vinokourov and Contador, who {{would be able to}} choose which riders he wanted his teammates. It would contain almost exclusively Kazakhstani and Spanish riders, {{in the image of the}} former Liberty Seguros team, for which Contador previously rode. The matter was even addressed by the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. The new team organization would be in place by the Vuelta a España, which Vinokourov <b>would</b> <b>ride.</b>|$|E
5|$|Digging for Fire {{was based}} on a real {{incident}} in which Jake Johnson and his wife dug up a bone and a gun in the garden of a house they had rented. Over a couple of weeks, he and a group of his friends dug up various objects before deciding to bury them again. Johnson described the experience to Joe Swanberg about three years later and they decided to make a film about it. They wrote a two-and-a-half–page outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue or detailed character descriptions. Swanberg wanted the actors to improvise the details of each scene and allowed them to make choices about their characters: for instance, Orlando Bloom decided that his character <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> a motorcycle, Chris Messina suggested that his character go swimming naked, and Brie Larson persuaded Johnson and Swanberg that her character would not be sexually attracted to Tim.|$|E

5|$|In June 2011, the NY Waterway-operated East River Ferry line started operations. The {{route is}} a 7-stop East River service that {{runs in a}} loop between East 34th Street and Hunters Point, making two {{intermediate}} stops in Brooklyn and three in Queens. The ferry, {{an alternative to the}} New York City Subway, cost $4 per one-way ticket. It was instantly popular, with two to six times the number of passengers that the city predicted <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> the ferries. From June to November 2011, the ferry accommodated 2,862 riders on an average weekday, as opposed to a projection of 1,488 riders, and it had 4,500 riders on an average weekend, six times the city's projected ridership; in total, the ferry saw 350,000 riders in that period, over 250% of the initial ridership forecast of 134,000 riders.|$|E
5|$|In their mobility, Khalid's {{troops had}} no match until the Mongol hordes of the 13th century. In fact {{the tactics of}} the desert Arabs and steppe Mongols were {{somewhat}} identical. Entire troops of Khalid <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> on camels while on march, whereas the Mongols used horses, with the difference that the Arabs did not make use of mounted archers. His most commonly used maneuver was surprise attack, such as his night attacks from three different sides on Persian camps at Zumail, Muzayyah and Saniyy, his highly mobile army successfully maneuvering in a 100km area, quickly destroying encampments of the Persians and their Arab allies. The Battle of Maraj-al-Debaj being no exception, where once again his highly mobile army maneuvered around a Byzantine army, appearing from four directions and opening several fronts at a time, a maneuver which later in 13th century {{became one of the}} Mongol armies' principal maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{high-ranking}} US Navy officials {{elected to}} contract a private salvage firm {{to free the}} battleship, but Admiral Smith, at the time Commander, Cruisers, Atlantic, {{and the man who}} was responsible for issuing Missouris orders disagreed with this plan. He reasoned that if the Navy got her on to the shoal, then they should be responsible for getting her off the shoal. Ultimately, he won his case for a US Navy salvage effort, but he was explicitly informed by officials at The Pentagon that his career <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> on his ability to successfully get Missouri back into deep water. To better organize the salvage effort, Smith and a number of men on his staff moved aboard Missouri to supervise her return to deep water. Smith's supervision also extended to answering the nearly 10,000 letters sent to the Navy from concerned citizens offering advice on how to get the battleship back into deep water.|$|E

5|$|The federal government, which {{owned and}} {{operated}} Dulles Airport before Congress created the MWAA, built the Dulles Access Road in the 1960s to connect the airport to Washington by way of Interstate 66. As the access road was built, the government opted to reserve the median of the road for some form of rail transit, and the nearby West Falls Church station was designed so that the line could eventually be extended in this direction. The original 1968 Metrorail plan included an eventual extension to Dulles airport. In 1969, Senator William Spong of Virginia tried unsuccessfully to have the extension to Dulles be built {{as part of an}} early stage of the system rather than having it be built at some unspecified time in the future. A 1971 study of the feasibility of Metrorail running to Dulles estimated that 30,000 people <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> the extension each day.|$|E
5|$|The route {{was noted}} {{to appeal to}} many types of riders, be they climbers, sprinters, or time trialists. The race had seven flat stages which figured into end in mass sprints, and the hilly mixed stages were {{inviting}} for breakaways. Sastre, {{one of the first}} riders to announce he <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> the Giro, commented that the route was much harder than that of the 2009 Giro, and would demand a very strong climber to be its champion. Zomegnan concurred that the route favored climbers, noting that the distance spent time trialing was not great and that it would take errors from climbing specialists to allow a rider better suited for time trialing to be Giro champion.|$|E
5|$|Raglan Castle {{was built}} in several phases, initial work {{occurring}} in the 1420s and 1430s, a major phase in the 1460s, with various alterations and additions {{at the end of}} the 16th century. The castle {{was built in}} stone, initially pale sandstone from Redbrook, and later Old Red Sandstone, with Bath Stone used for many of the detailed features. Like similar properties of the period, the castle of the 1460s was almost certainly designed to be approached and entered in a particular way, maximising the aesthetic and political value of the fortification. At Raglan, the design highlighted the Great Tower: a typical senior visitor <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> through Raglan village, and first the tower and then the rest of the castle would appear suddenly over the slight rise on the hill. A visitor would have needed to circle the Great Tower and the moat, before coming in through the gatehouse, into the Pitched Stone Court, around the edge of the communal hall, before reaching the previously hidden, and more refined, inner Fountain Court. Only then would a privileged guest be able to enter the Great Tower itself, overlooking the Herbert family's own chambers. Many less senior visitors or servants would never have entered this far, seeing only the external elements of the castle, but perhaps having been impressed by the outside of the Great Tower as they arrived.|$|E

Other horses {{on which}} he made his name {{included}} Cammillus, Magistrate, Prime Minister, Sir Malagigi, Rosetta, Rosanne, Reveller, Lisette, Scancalaldi, Epperston, Cambyses and Consul.|$|R

5|$|While Smith was {{attending}} junior high school, his parents divorced. Continuing {{to pursue his}} interest in baseball, he <b>would</b> <b>ride</b> the bus {{for nearly an hour}} to reach Dodger Stadium, cheering for the Los Angeles Dodgers at about 25 games a year. Upon becoming a student at Locke High School, Smith played on the basketball and baseball teams. Smith was a teammate of future National Basketball Association player Marques Johnson on the basketball team, and a teammate of future fellow Hall-of-Fame player Eddie Murray on the baseball side. After high school Smith attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1974 on a partial academic scholarship, and managed to walk-on to the baseball team. In addition to his academic education, he learned to switch-hit from Cal Poly coach Berdy Harr. When Cal Poly's starting shortstop broke his leg midway through the 1974 season, Smith subsequently took over the starting role. Later named an All-American athlete, he established school records in career at bats (754) and career stolen bases (110) before graduating in 1977.|$|E
