500|$|The Fraternity Hymn {{was written}} by brother Scott Jeffrey Heckstall Jr. {{when he was a}} {{prospective}} member of the Eta Gamma chapter in 1977. Heckstall had wanted to be a charter member, but was not chosen. Heckstall was encouraged to rush, and he recalled that as part of his rush process, a couple of brothers took him to a piano and told him, [...] "We know that you play [...] in church. We need a fraternity hymn. We'll give you three hours, and you sit over there {{and come up with a}} hymn. We'll come back in three hours, and <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>a</b> hymn." [...] Heckstall recalled the hymn Someday (Beams of Heaven As I Go) by Charles Albert Tindley and changed a few words—for example, [...] "Beams of Heaven as I go through this wilderness below" [...] became [...] "K K Psi, as we go through this wilderness here below." [...] The brothers of Eta Gamma were satisfied with Heckstall's hymn. Years later, the hymn was presented to the brotherhood assembled at the 1995 National Convention and accepted as the national fraternity hymn. Blue and white are the fraternity's official colors. The fraternity flower is a red carnation, so chosen because it was founder William Scroggs's favorite flower.|$|E
2500|$|The {{explanation}} is that the interstellar medium is optically thin. Starlight traveling through a kiloparsec column undergoes about a magnitude of extinction, so that the optical depth ~ 1. An optical depth of 1 corresponds to a mean free path, which is the distance, on average that a photon travels before scattering from a dust grain. So on average, a starlight photon is scattered from a single interstellar grain; multiple scattering (which produces circular polarization) is much less likely. [...] Observationally, the linear polarization fraction p ~ 0.015 [...] from a single scattering; circular polarization from multiple scattering goes as , so <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>a</b> circularly polarized fraction of [...]|$|E

2500|$|In August 2009, UN {{mediator}} Matthew Nimetz expressed pessimism {{regarding the}} Greek {{response to the}} names he proposed in his July meetings. Nimetz said [...] "Efforts to solve the name issue continue, even though Greece’s answer is not positive". According to the Greek representative, Athens would not accept a proposed formulation that was only intended for use in bilateral relations, and insisted that any name that is decided must be used internationally. In late August, Nimetz met Zoran Jolevski, the ethnic Macedonian negotiator who said that [...] "Macedonia is committed to active participation in the talks over the name and <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>a</b> mutually acceptable solution, which will ensure preserving of the identity, dignity and integrity of the Macedonian citizens {{on the basis of}} Euro-Atlantic values and democratic principles." [...] The [...] "name talks" [...] were frozen because of Athens’ rejection of essential points in the most recent proposal and the elections in Greece in October. The actual talks may, it is reported, restart in May 2010 when the new Greek prime minister will have more space for negotiations.|$|E

[...] It was stated in January 2017 by Maj. Gen. Robert Talbot Rice, the director of land equipment at the Defence Equipment and Support arm of the Ministry of Defence (MoD), that: [...] "We are working through the Foreign Military Sales process. A letter of request has been sent to our American colleagues, and <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>a</b> response in the next few months." [...] Talbot Rice told an audience of industry executives and military personnel at the International Armoured Vehicles conference in London on 24 January that the Army had opted for the single-source purchase due to its ability to meet UK requirements and its value for money.|$|E
2500|$|The great {{turning point}} in Callas's career {{occurred}} in Venice in 1949. She was engaged to sing the role of Brünnhilde in Die Walküre at the Teatro la Fenice, when Margherita Carosio, who was engaged to sing Elvira in I puritani in the same theatre, fell ill. Unable to find a replacement for Carosio, Serafin told Callas {{that she would be}} singing Elvira in six days; when Callas protested that she not only did not know the role, but also had three more Brünnhildes to sing, he told her [...] "I guarantee that you can.". Michael Scott's words, [...] "the notion of any one singer embracing music as divergent in its vocal demands as Wagner's Brünnhilde and Bellini's Elvira in the same career would have been cause enough for surprise; but to attempt to essay them both in the same season seemed like folie de grandeur". Before the performance actually took place, one incredulous critic snorted, [...] "We hear that Serafin has agreed to conduct I puritani with a dramatic soprano ... When can <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>a</b> new edition of La traviata with [...] Gino Bechi's Violetta?" [...] After the performance, one critic wrote, [...] "Even the most sceptical had to acknowledge the miracle that Maria Callas accomplished... the flexibility of her limpid, beautifully poised voice, and her splendid high notes. Her interpretation also has a humanity, warmth and expressiveness that one would search for in vain in the fragile, pellucid coldness of other Elviras." [...] Franco Zeffirelli recalled, [...] "What she did in Venice was really incredible. You need to be familiar with opera to realize the enormity of her achievement. It was as if someone asked Birgit Nilsson, who is famous for her great Wagnerian voice, to substitute overnight for Beverly Sills, {{who is one of the}} great coloratura sopranos of our time." ...|$|E

40|$|We test in {{the context}} of a {{dictator}} game the proposition that individuals may experience a self-control conflict between the temptation to act selfishly and the better judgment to act pro-socially. We manipulated the likelihood that individuals would identify self-control conflict, and we measured their trait ability to implement self-control strategies. Our analysis reveals a positive and significant correlation between trait self-control and pro-social behavior in the treatment where <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> <b>a</b> relatively high likelihood of conflict identification [...] -but not in the treatment where <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> <b>a</b> low likelihood. The magnitude of the effect is of economic significance. We conclude that subtle cues might prove sufficient to alter individuals' perception of allocation opportunities, thereby prompting individuals to draw on their own cognitive resources to act pro-socially...|$|R
