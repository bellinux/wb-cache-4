Suspecting foul play, Manoj and Babli did not continue toward Chandigarh, instead boarding a bus for Karnal. According to a statement filed by Chanderpati, later that day, around 3:40pm, she received a call from a Pipli telephone booth from Manoj, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police had deserted them, and Babli's family members were trailing them, so they would try to take a bus to Delhi and call her back later. Babli asked for acceptance from Chanderpati, who replied affirmatively. That was the last time Manoj's family heard from the couple.|$|E

5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet {{in the hands of}} an inexperienced officer, and that most of the credit for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{music in}} North Georgia, including {{what is now}} Athens, {{was that of the}} Native Americans of the area, principally the Creek and the Cherokee. Athens was officially chartered in 1806, and began growing rapidly near the middle of the 19th century. By the time of the American Civil War in the 1860s, the city was an important part of musical life in Georgia. The war accelerated the development of the city's musical importance, as Athens was largely spared widespread destruction while the larger city of Atlanta {{took a long time to}} recover. Major touring acts like the Dixie Family and The Slomans visited Athens during the war; the Dixie Family, a prominent touring group, performed disastrously, according to local newspapers, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> highlight of the performance came from four local African American musicians, and the Dixie Family had absconded with the concert's proceeds, which had been promised to the local Ladies Aid Society. In the 1870s, the city was almost half African American, and local black-owned industry flourished; among the residents was Bob Cole, born in 1868 to a musically active family. Cole would later become a pioneer in African American theater, known for works like the 1898 musical A Trip to Coontown.|$|E

The name Dialect {{comes from the fact that}} the Mainland government refers to Cantonese as a dialect despite the fact that it is mutually unintelligible with Mandarin.

25|$|The {{peace and}} {{stability}} the Mounties brought fostered dreams of mass settlement on the Canadian Prairies. The land was surveyed by the Canadian Pacific Railway for possible routes to the Pacific. The early favourite was a northerly line that went through Edmonton and the Yellowhead Pass. The success of the Mounties in the South, coupled with a government desire to establish Canadian sovereignty of that area, and the CPR’s desire to undercut land speculators, prompted the CPR to announce a last minute switch of the route to a more southerly path passing through Calgary and the Kicking Horse Pass. This was {{against the advice of}} some surveyors <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> south was an arid zone not suitable for agricultural settlement.|$|E

25|$|On August 11, {{a senior}} {{official}} with the US-led Coalition said that Iraqi forces had surrounded the city and were preparing for a final assault to retake it. On August 23, 23 Iraqi soldiers including 17 Iraqi military soldiers and 6 allied Sunni fighters were killed by ISIL in an attack that involved the use of suicide bombers and artillery. On August 25, Iraqi forces repelled an ISIL suicide attack west of Ramadi by destroying three booby-trapped vehicles and killing everyone inside them. On August 27, 2 Iraqi army generals and 3 soldiers {{were killed in a}} suicide attack while 10 other soldiers were wounded. On September 10, an airstrike by the US-led coalition destroyed an ISIL operating base and staging area in a stadium near Ramadi. On September 15, it was reported that a force of 160 US troops had arrived at Habbaniyah air base and were expected to help the Iraqi army retake Ramadi. The unconfirmed reports also noted that USA agreed to take part in ground combat against ISIL if the Popular Front forces withdrew from Anbar. However, these reports were dismissed by an Iraqi army spokesman <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> US troops at the air base were there to simply provide military advice and coordinate raids against ISIL targets. Popular Front spokesman Karim Al-Nouri also dismissed these reports saying that the Popular Front militia was still deployed in Anbar.|$|E
25|$|Reprieve, a London-based {{human rights}} group, {{said it had}} talked to two sources from the raided village, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> raid went wrong from the start as the Seals opened fire on a 70-year-old {{partially}} blind man, named Nasser Al-Adhal, who {{had come out of}} his house {{to see what was going}} on, possibly to greet the US soldiers after mistaking them for visitors. On hearing al-Adhal being shot, other men then emerged from their homes, and four of them were shot dead by the Seals, according to the Reprieve account. According to Reprive investigators, they were “still trying to get a really full picture of exactly what happened, but what we do know is that Seals landed in the village, and they appear to have been trying to target a group of possible militants but in the course of the ground raid something went wrong, and they ended up killing a number of the people from the village, including a man of about 70, Nasser al-Adhal, who suffered from very bad eyesight. The four other villagers were killed when they started to argue with the Navy Seals after the shooting of Nasser al-Adhal. Six villagers were seriously injured, including another elderly man who was around 69 years old. After that, Al-Qaida fighters gathered nearby, after were alerted by the gunshots in the village and firefight ensued in which at least two of them were killed. The Navy Seals then left with the help of air support from a helicopter.” A US central command spokesman, Maj. Josh Jacques, said that the Reprieve report would be investigated.|$|E
