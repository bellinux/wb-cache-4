500|$|Grodziskie ( [...] ; other names: Grätzer, Grodzisz) is a {{historical}} style of beer from Poland that is typically made from oak-smoked <b>wheat</b> <b>malt.</b> [...] The beer {{can be described as}} having a clear, light golden color, high carbonation, low alcohol content, low to moderate levels of hop bitterness, and a strong smoke flavor and aroma. [...] The taste is light and crisp, with primary flavors coming from the smoked malt, the high mineral content of the water, and the strain of yeast used to ferment the beverage. [...] The beer was nicknamed [...] "Polish Champagne" [...] because of its high carbonation levels, and because it was valued as a high-quality beverage to be used for special occasions.|$|E
500|$|Grodziskie is brewed from <b>wheat</b> <b>malt</b> {{that has}} been dried by {{circulating}} oak smoke through the grains. [...] The smokiness of the grain and the mineral profile of the water used to brew the beverage gives the style its characteristic flavor. [...] Polish breweries historically used locally grown hops {{and one or two}} strains of brewer's yeast in its production. [...] Before packaging, the beer is filtered to produce a bright, clear appearance. [...] The beer is packaged before all of the fermentable sugars have been converted to alcohol by the yeast, earlier in the process than is typical in beers. [...] Fermentation continues after packaging, and the carbon dioxide that is produced remains dissolved in the beer, resulting in a very high level of carbonation in the final product.|$|E
