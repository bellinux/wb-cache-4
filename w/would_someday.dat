5|$|Reagan {{never left}} the United States during the war, but he kept a film reel that he {{obtained}} {{while he was in}} the service. The reel depicted the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp; he believed that doubts <b>would</b> <b>someday</b> arise as to whether the Holocaust had occurred. It has been alleged that he was overheard telling Israeli foreign minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1983 that he had filmed that footage himself and helped liberate Auschwitz, though this purported conversation was disputed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.|$|E
5|$|Raëlians {{believe that}} {{humanity}} {{would be able}} to create life on other planets only if humanity is peaceful enough to stop war. In that case, humanity could travel the distances between stars and create life on another planet. Progress in terraforming, molecular biology, and cloning would enable these teams to create continents and life from scratch. Progress in social engineering would ensure that this creation would {{have a better chance of}} both surviving and having the potential to understand its creators. Research on how civilization would occur on another planet would allow scientists to decide what traces of their origin should be left behind so that their role in life creation <b>would</b> <b>someday</b> be revealed. The progress achieved by the science teams would ultimately sustain a perpetual chain of life.|$|E

25|$|The German {{occupation}} of the Channel Islands lasted from 30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945. During that time, the Channel Islanders had to live under and obey the laws of Nazi Germany and work with their occupiers {{in order to survive}} and reduce the impact of occupation. Given no guidance on how to behave by the British government, there were individuals who got too close to the enemy and a few who undertook resistance activities. Most {{had no choice but to}} accept the changes and depredations to their lives and hope that external forces <b>would</b> <b>someday</b> remove the forces of occupation. It was almost five years before the islanders experienced freedom again.|$|E

Sally gets a C for her pathetic coat-hanger sculpture.|$|E
25|$|The Senate (north) wing was {{completed}} in 1800. The Senate and House shared quarters in the north wing until a temporary wooden pavilion was erected on the future site of the House wing which served {{for a few years}} for the Representatives to meet in, until the House of Representatives (south) wing was finally completed in 1811, with a covered wooden temporary walkway connecting the two wings with the Congressional chambers where the future center section with rotunda and dome <b>would</b> <b>someday</b> rise. However, the House of Representatives moved early into their House wing in 1807. Though the Senate wing building was incomplete, the Capitol held its first session of the United States Congress with both chambers in session on November 17, 1800. The National Legislature was moved to Washington prematurely, at the urging of President John Adams, in hopes of securing enough Southern votes in the Electoral College to be re-elected for a second term as President.|$|E

25|$|His grandmother, {{originally}} from Yokohama, Japan, first introduced Jero to Enka {{and it was}} under her guidance that he grew to love the genre as a child. Jero, who majored in information technology at the University of Pittsburgh, did not initially imagine himself in a career as an Enka singer. Rather, after he permanently moved to Japan, his main forms of employment were as an English teacher at NOVA and as a computer engineer. He only began to actively work towards becoming an Enka singer because he had promised his grandmother {{that one day he}} <b>would</b> <b>someday</b> perform at the annual Kohaku Uta Gassen song show. As a result, he actively participated in numerous singing contests while he continued to work as a computer engineer and eventually achieved real success after only two months since he had arrived in Japan.

50|$|His foes {{appearing}} {{to have been}} defeated, the Beyonder proceeded with his new plan to find fulfillment by using a complex machine to transform himself into a mortal being with his full power. The machine drained the Beyonder's power into itself, transformed him into a mortal baby, and then began transferring the energy back into him. The infant would soon again become an adult. Molecule Man and his allies found the machine, and Reece, believing they could not take the chance that the newly reborn Beyonder <b>would</b> not <b>someday</b> destroy the multiverse, decided to kill {{him while he was}} vulnerable. Reece destroyed the machine, causing the infant's death, and diverted the Beyonder's immense power, which the machine released, through an interdimensional portal into the dimension from which the Beyonder had originally come. There the energy created a new Universe.|$|R

[...] Nonetheless, Bremermann did not foreclose the possibility that a computer <b>would</b> <b>someday</b> be able to solve chess. He wrote, [...] "In order to have a computer play a perfect or nearly perfect game [...] it will be necessary either to analyze the game completely ... or to analyze the game in an approximate way and combine this with a limited amount of tree searching. ... A theoretical understanding of such heuristic programming, however, is still very much wanting." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2008, under Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, Ukraine sent an {{official}} letter of application a Membership Action Plan (MAP), {{the first step}} in joining NATO. These leaders however guaranteed their opposition that membership in any military alliance would not pass without public approval in a referendum. This idea had gained support from a number of NATO leaders, particularly those in Central and Eastern Europe. Russian leaders like Prime Minister and President-Elect Dmitry Medvedev made clear their opposition to Ukraine membership, and leading up to the April 2008 Bucharest summit their emissary actively lobbied against a Ukrainian MAP. After some debate among members at the summit, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer declared in a press conference that Ukraine, together with Georgia, <b>would</b> <b>someday</b> join NATO, but neither would begin Membership Action Plans.

He explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from Earth by the sun. For him, the Earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions, which <b>someday</b> <b>would</b> go dry as well.
