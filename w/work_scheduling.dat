With a concern about the potential adverse impact of parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on children, previous research tended to paint a negative image of the toll related to parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedule.</b> However, this study, based on fixed-effect regression models, found that the impact of parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on children 2 ̆ 7 s academic achievement may differ by parents who undertake nonstandard schedules, children 2 ̆ 7 s developmental stages, types of nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> and family structure. For early childhood children (age 3 or 4) in two-parent families, maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly varying hours, were associated with better academic outcomes, while paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly rotating shift and varying hours, were associated with lower academic outcomes. However, the positive impact of maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedule</b> disappeared for early childhood children in single-parent families. For middle childhood children (age 5 - 10), maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> were found to have no impact on children 2 ̆ 7 s academic achievement both in two-parent and single-parent families, whereas paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly evening shift, had a negative effect in two-parent families. For early adolescents (age 11 - 14), both maternal and paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> had no impact. These findings suggest that the impact of parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on children 2 ̆ 7 s academic outcomes are not uniformly negative or positive, implying that parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> have a dual potential to become a family-unfriendly schedule and {{to be used as a}} family-friendly work option.

Because of the evening work hours, split <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> are contributing to work-family conflicts in the midst of significantly higher female labor force participation. Our purpose is to examine who has a split <b>work</b> <b>schedule</b> and why. We focus on full-time working women with full-time working partners, for whom the need to reconcile work and family responsibilities is likely to be more pressing.

This research endeavors to fill that gap in our understanding by providing the results of a recent survey of human resources directors in 151 U.

30|$|A {{comparison}} of the effect sizes shows that the effect sizes of sabbaticals and flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on organizational attachment are similar. However, the fact that sabbaticals have a significantly stronger effect on organizational attachment than telecommuting indicates that employees consider telecommuting to be less beneficial than sabbaticals and flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules.</b> As mentioned above, and in contrast to flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> telecommuting presents various disadvantages for employees, such as social and professional isolation. Hence, although both practices offer regular flexibility, employees prefer flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> to telecommuting, because flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> provide daily working time flexibility without the significant drawbacks of telecommuting. Employees may also value sabbaticals more than telecommuting because they allow employees to fulfil personal dreams, like a trip around the world, while still having job security as they do not lose their legal rights as employees.|$|R

Weekly <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> in two franchises {{of an important}} retail clothing chain have to be established. Working time accounts are used: each week, an employee can owe the company {{a certain number of}} hours or vice versa. Nevertheless, over a certain threshold, the hours have to be paid for by the company and the account balance returns to zero. A minimum and desired level of capacity of employees is contemplated. Hierarchically, the planned capacity must attempt to reach the minimum level; then it must fit a desired level as much as possible. At present, the task of allocation and the final adjustment of schedules is done manually, which is difficult, ineffective and often inaccurate. The procedure proposed is divided into two phases. Firstly, a <b>work</b> <b>schedule,</b> selected from a list, is assigned to each worker; a mixed linear program, followed by a local optimization process, is used.
