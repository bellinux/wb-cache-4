25|$|Many {{tasks that}} we would like to {{automate}} by using a computer are of question–answer type: we would like to ask a question and the computer should produce an answer. In theoretical computer science, such tasks are called computational problems. Formally, a computational problem consists of instances together with a solution for each instance. Instances are questions that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>ask,</b> and solutions are desired answers to these questions.|$|E
25|$|A {{principal}} {{benefit of}} modeling {{is the ability}} to explicitly compare models: Rather than simply returning a value for each component, the modeler can compute confidence intervals on parameters, but, crucially, can drop and add paths and test the effect via statistics such as the AIC. Thus, for instance to test for predicted effects of family or shared environment on behavior, an AE model can be objectively compared to a full ACE model. For example, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> of the figure above for height: Can C (shared environment) be dropped without significant loss of fit? Alternatively, confidence intervals can be calculated for each path.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts" [...] {{has been}} well {{received}} by television critics. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club gave this episode a [...] "B" [...] rating and commented that [...] "The Simpsons episodes that strive {{to have a little}} heart without going overboard are generally going to work better than the random-gag episodes, at least {{at this point in the}} storied history of The Simpsons, and 'Bart Stops To Smell The Roosevelts' has enough wee little heart to see this episode through", but further wrote that [...] "there were a number of jokes that didn't work, Milhouse's final scene in particular, but the episode had a steady stream of gags to push through the lean times. And that's all <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> for." [...] Ology's Josh Harrison was also positive and gave the episode a rating of seven out of ten, while commenting that he [...] "thought this was a definite downgrade from the season premiere in terms of sheer comedic value, but the sincerity of Bart's educational experience, combined with the enthusiasm of his mad quest for justice, definitely made this one a winner." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} distinctiveness, {{relevance}} and plausibility (DRP) method for systematically evaluating potential experimental confounds. A claim {{is a statement}} being inferred {{on the basis of}} experimental data analysis. A potential confound is a statement providing a prima facie reason why the claim is not justified (other than internal weakness). In evaluating whether a potential confound is problematic, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> start by <b>asking</b> whether the potential confound is distinctive from the claim; <b>we</b> <b>can</b> then <b>ask</b> whether it is relevant for the claim; and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> conclude by <b>asking</b> whether it is plausible {{in the light of the}} evidence. © 2013 The Author...|$|R

This question leads to the famous continuum hypothesis.

The discussion continued until Romney grew frustrated at the repeated questioning and asserted, [...] "States don't want to ban contraception.
