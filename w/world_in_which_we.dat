In most contexts it should be distinguished from postmodernism, the adoption of postmodern philosophies or traits in art, literature, culture and society. In fact, today, historical perspectives on the developments of postmodern art (postmodernism) and postmodern society (postmodernity) can be best described as two umbrella terms for processes engaged in an ongoing dialectical relationship, the result of which is the evolving <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> now live.|$|E
25|$|Veblen {{generalized}} {{the conflict}} between businessmen and engineers by saying that human society would always involve conflict between existing norms with vested interests and new norms developed out of an innate human tendency to manipulate and learn about the physical <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> exist. He also generalized his model to include his theory of instincts, processes of evolution as absorbed from Sumner, as enhanced by his own reading of evolutionary science, and pragmatic philosophy first learned from Peirce. The instinct of idle curiosity led humans to manipulate nature in new ways and this led to changes in {{what he called the}} material means of life. Because, as per the pragmatists, our ideas about the world are a human construct rather than mirrors of reality, changing ways of manipulating nature lead to changing constructs and to changing notions of truth and authority as well as patterns of behavior (institutions). Societies and economies evolve as a consequence, but do so via a process of conflict between vested interests and older forms and the new. Veblen never wrote with any confidence that the new ways were better ways, but he was sure in the last three decades of his life that the American economy could, in the absence of vested interests, have produced more for more people. In the years just after World War I he looked to engineers to make the American economy more efficient.|$|E

50|$|Technological somnambulism is {{a concept}} used when talking about the {{philosophy}} of technology. The term was used by Langdon Winner in his essay Technology as forms of life. Winner puts forth {{the idea that we}} are simply in a state of sleepwalking in our mediations with technology. This sleepwalking is caused by a number of factors. One of the primary causes is the way we view technology as tools, something that can be put down and picked up again. Because of this view of objects as something we can easily separate ourselves from we fail to look at the long term implications of using that object. A second factor is the separation of those who make the technology and those who use the technology. This division causes there to be little thought and research going into the effects of using/developing that technology. The third and most important idea is the way <b>in</b> <b>which</b> technology seems to create new <b>worlds</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> live. These <b>worlds</b> are created by the restructuring of the common and seemingly everyday things around us. In most situations the changes take place with little attention or care from us because we are more focused on the menial aspects of the technology (Winner 105-107).|$|R

Music has to lend emotional expression to this vitality. I accommodate that by seeking out new paths and interpretations". Similarly he revolutionised the strict mugham instrumentation, introducing his own improvisation and including new sounds such as the double-reeded balaban (also known as a duduk), the clarinet and the nagara, a metal-bodied drum. Additionally, he remained conscious of the need to modernise when choosing his ensemble; mixing older, experienced players with younger, more dynamic musicians.|$|E
2500|$|Kittredge's {{administrative}} power, vast erudition, prestige, and the histrionic attitude {{he assumed}} with undergraduates provoked resentment. A notable critic was his colleague, Irving Babbitt (a professor of French) and Babbitt's former student, Stuart Sherman, who together founded so-called [...] "New Humanist" [...] school of literary appreciation. In a famous article in [...] The Nation of 1913, Sherman accused Kittredge of pedantry and of squeezing {{the life out}} of his subject. Deep ideological disagreements lay at the bottom of these attacks. The New Humanists were social and cultural conservatives who conceived of literary studies as leading to moral improvement by providing a guide to conduct and [...] "humane insight" [...] through an appreciation of and reflection on of the timeless beauties of prescribed [...] "great works." [...] Babbitt bitterly opposed the introduction of elective courses for undergraduates. Deeply suspicious of democracy, he envisioned the goal of a university education as the formation of a superior individual in whom the [...] "will to restraint" [...] would counter what he saw as the degenerate modernism he traced back to pernicious ideas of social progress initiated by Rousseau and his followers. Kittredge and his students, on the other hand, situated the study of languages and literatures in their historical contexts, seeking to capture [...] "the spirit of an age" [...] and often ranging far afield of the traditional Western canon. For Kittredge, reading Chaucer illuminated the world of the Middle Ages, which Kittredge often stated had points in common with our own age and thus helped students understand the <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> live.

40|$|Many of the {{traditional}} and trusted understandings of organizational theory and practice have come under sharp question as our organizations become globalized. Theorists, researchers, and organizational leaders are all recognizing that organizational life is part of everyone’s life. Organizations are central players in shaping the economy, the political agenda, the physical environment, {{as well as the}} sense of community- both locally and globally. Organizational life is deeply intertwined with issues of central importance to us such as how we educate our children, how we integrate diversity into our lives, how we generate a sense of what is valued, and how we rebuild neglected countries, cities, and neighborhoods. In other words, our study of organizational communication is not only about isolated organizations and their communication practices. Organizational life is about sustainable life forms. It is an area of study where we come to understand how our actions create the <b>worlds</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> live.

40|$|The <b>world,</b> or <b>worlds,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> live, contain symbols {{as well as}} real objects.

Scheffler's idea of mention - selection which he introduced {{for the treatment of}} fictions and applied also to ritual practices will be a resource in the development of my approach.

These sensors cover the physical sensors around us (environment, place, physical activities like traffic, weather, people movement, crowd gatherings like concerts and sports events) as well as the online sensors we have access to (blogs, tweets, etc.).

40|$|This paper {{points out}} the {{potential}} of using sport {{for the analysis of}} society. Cultivated human movement is a specific social and cultural subsystem (involving sport, movement culture and physical culture), yet it becomes a part of wider social discourses by extending some of its characteristics into various other spheres. This process, theorised as sportification, provides as useful concept to examine the permeation of certain phenomena from the area of sport into the social reality outside of sport. In this paper, we investigate the phenomena of sportification <b>which</b> <b>we</b> parallel with visual culture and spectatorship practices in the Renaissance era. The emphasis in our investigation is on theatricality and performativity; particularly, the superficial spectator engagement with modern sport and sporting spectacles. Unlike the significance afforded to visualisation and deeper symbolic interpretation in Renaissance art, contemporary cultural shifts have changed and challenged the ways <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the active and interacting body is positioned, politicised, symbolised and ultimately understood. We suggest here that the ways <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> view sport and sporting bodies within a (post) modern context (particularly with the confounding amalgamations of signs and symbols and emphasis on hyper-realities) has invariably become detached from sports’ profound metaphysical meanings and resonance. Subsequently, by emphasising the associations between social theatrics and the sporting complex, this paper aims to remind readers of ways that sport—as a nuanced phenomenon—can be operationalised to help us to contemplate questions about nature, society, ourselves and the complex <b>worlds</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> live...|$|R
