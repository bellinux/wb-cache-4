The Ebers papyrus, which is the main source for information on ancient Egyptian medicine, also seems to date to this time (the mention of the Heliacal rise of Sothis by which the early New Kingdom chronology is usually calculated was found on the back of this document).|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to ecological considerations, decisions regarding {{the future of}} the fisheries were also influenced by social and economic factors. Throughout Atlantic Canada, however most pronounced in Newfoundland, the cod fishery was a source of social and cultural identity. For many families, it also represented their livelihood: most families were connected either directly or indirectly with the fishery as fishers, fish plant workers, fish sellers, fish transporters, or as employees in related businesses. Additionally, many companies, both foreign and domestic, as well as individuals, had invested heavily in the boats, equipment and the infrastructure of the fishery, and therefore felt it was in their best interest to maintain an open-access policy to the ocean and its resources. What this alludes to is the unfortunate paradox that often accompanies open-access resources and is known by most as the Tragedy of the Commons: <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> individual's best interest is not always {{in the best interest of}} a society at whole. In the case of Newfoundland and the Northern Cod fishery this meant that from the perspective of the individual participating in the fishing industry, maximizing their catch was in their best interest; however when the government failed to intervene – due largely to the highly sensitive nature of the political discourse created by the expansive group of stakeholders – the ecosystem was brought past its threshold and collapsed, leaving everyone worse-off.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a long-running}} and {{vigorous}} debate over ethical concerns regarding circumcision, particularly neonatal circumcision for {{reasons other than}} intended direct medical benefit. There are three parties involved in the decision to circumcise a minor: the minor as the patient, the parents (or other guardians) and the physician. [...] The physician is bound under the ethical principles of beneficence (promoting well-being) and non-maleficence ("first, do no harm"), and so is charged with the responsibility to promote {{the best interests of the}} patient while minimizing unnecessary harms. Those involved must weigh the factors of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> best interest of the minor against the potential harms of the procedure.|$|E

His techniques were all designed to help disassociate this [...] "strain" [...] from seeing and thereby achieve [...] "central fixation", or seeing <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central point of vision without staring. He asserted that [...] "all errors of refraction and all functional disturbances of the eye disappear when it sees by central fixation" [...] and that other conditions were often relieved as well.|$|E

500|$|Some users add a {{subwoofer}} because {{high levels}} of low bass are desired, even beyond <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original recording, {{as in the case}} of house music enthusiasts. Thus, subwoofers may be part of a package that includes satellite speakers, may be purchased separately, or may be built into the same cabinet as a conventional speaker system. For instance, some floor standing tower speakers include a subwoofer driver in the lower portion of the same cabinet. Physical separation of subwoofer and [...] "satellite" [...] speakers not only allows placement in an inconspicuous location, but since sub-bass frequencies are particularly sensitive to room location (due to room resonances and reverberation 'modes'), the best position for the subwoofer is not likely to be where the [...] "satellite" [...] speakers are located.|$|E

USDA spokesman Mike Jarvis stated that of the 117 million pounds of beef ordered nationally for the school lunch program in the past year, 6% was LFTB. An analysis of California Department of Education data indicated that [...] "anywhere from none to nearly 3 million pounds of beef from the USDA that was served in California schools last year could have contained lean finely textured beef".

[...] He said about the test screenings in particular: [...] "I can see why they do it – there’s a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it’s a flawed process, I really do." [...] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.|$|E
