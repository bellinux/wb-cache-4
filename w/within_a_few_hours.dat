5|$|On July24, {{the storm}} crossed 140°W, {{entering}} the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's (CPHC) area of responsibility. Upon entering the region, Gilma became the fourth consecutive cyclone {{to move into}} the CPHC region. Several hours later, Gilma attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 160mph (260km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 920mbar (hPa; 27.17inHg). After maintaining this intensity for roughly 12hours, the storm abruptly weakened. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> maximum winds decreased by 45mph (75km/h) to 115mph (185km/h), a low-end Category 3 hurricane. The reason for the sudden weakening is unknown; although the tropical upper tropospheric trough originally located over the storm, providing it with a favorable anticyclonic flow, shifted westward to the International Date Line. Additionally, the storm's eye became obscured by cirrus clouds.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the {{digestive}} cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b> This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach {{all parts of the}} digestive cavity. Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric {{decontamination}} with activated charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention is sought <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast on September1. Due to entrainment of dry air, the wave struggled to maintain convection as it progressed westwards. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not begin monitoring the system in its Tropical Weather Outlooks until a concentrated {{area of low pressure}} developed about 350mi (560km) east of the Leeward Islands on September8. The convection quickly diminished and mainly consisted of only sporadically bursts of shower and thunderstorm activity. Little change in organization took place as the disturbance tracked through the Bahamas on September11 and September12. However, the disturbance quickly organized and developed more thunderstorm activity while approaching Florida. A tropical depression is estimated to have formed at 06:00UTC on September13, around the time it was making landfall in Jensen Beach, Florida. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> a strong band of deep convection formed in the northeast quadrant of the cyclone, though westerly wind shear prevented any significant convection from developing on the western side of the storm.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{origin of}} GRBs {{have been a}} mystery for almost 30 years. The {{afterglow}} observed {{in the last few}} years enabled redshift determination for a handful of bursts, and the cosmological origin is now firmly established. Though the distance scale is settled, there still remains orders of magnitude uncertainty in their rate and in the total energy that is released in the explosion due to the possibility that the emission is not spherical but jet-like. Contrary to the GRB itself, the afterglow can be measured up to months and even years after the burst, and it can provide crucial information on the geometry of the ejecta. We review the theory of afterglow from jets and discuss the evidence that at least some of the bursts are not spherical. We discuss the prospects of polarization measurements, and show that this is a powerful tool in constraining the geometry of the explosion. I JETS?- A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION The study of γ-ray bursts was revolutionized when the Italian-Dutch satellite BeppoSAX delivered arcminutes positioning of some GRBs, <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hour...</b>|$|R

5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Mitch {{formed on}} October22 {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean Sea, and it {{eventually}} intensified into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale by October26. By that time, the hurricane was {{just north of the}} coast of Honduras, and was expected by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models to turn to the north. When the track was more westward than expected, the NHC recommended early on October26 for a hurricane warning to be issued for the northeastern Honduran coast, although difficulties in communications prevented their immediate implementation. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> a hurricane warning was in place between Limón to the Honduras and Nicaragua border, including the offshore Swan Island. When Mitch still failed to turn to the north, the government of Honduras issued a hurricane warning for the remainder of their coastline. The hurricane weakened while turning to the south, and made landfall in Honduras 134km (83mi) east of La Ceiba, with estimated winds of 130km/h (80mph). Mitch continued to weaken while moving slowly westward across the country.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Rick {{was a very}} {{powerful}} hurricane that threatened Hawaii during September 1985. Rick originated from a tropical wave moved slowly westward over the warm waters south of Salina Cruz. Moving westward, the EPHC upgraded the low into a tropical depression on 0000UTC September1. The depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Rick midday on September2. Initially, further intensification was slow to occur; the storm did not attain hurricane status until September7, nearly a week after it first formed. After becoming a hurricane, Rick began to intensify more rapidly. Early the next day, the EPHC re-assessed the intensity of Rick to Category4 status. Shortly thereafter, Rick reached its peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h). A weakening trend commenced on September10; Hurricane Rick began to rapidly deteriorate while turning northwest. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> the storm had weakened considerably. By September11, Tropical Storm Rick merged with a trough. Early forecasts noted uncertainty in the storm's path; the hurricane approached the Hawaiian island group, coming close enough to require a high surf advisory. Even though Hurricane Rick turned north sooner than Pauline, the surf did rise slightly.|$|E

40|$|A broadly active {{inhibitor}} {{of viruses}} (vaccinia, polio 1, and vesicular stomatitis) {{was found in}} the culture fluid from many types of normal human and mouse cells in culture. Virus plaque-inhibiting activity appeared in culture fluids <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hour</b> after incubation of cultures with fresh medium. Peak inhibitory activity occurred within 24 h. Blockade of cellular ribonucleic acid or protein synthesis decreased appearance of the inhibitor, thereby substantiating that it is a cell-produced viral inhibitor. Inhibition of virus required the simultaneous presence of inhibitor, virus, and cells (due to the reversible nature of the inhibition of virus attachment and penetration, as shown in the accompanying paper [T. K. Hughes et al., Infect Immun. 32 : 454 - 457, 1981]). The degree of inhibitory activity depended on the animal species of origin of the inhibitor, the cell type used for assay, and the virus type used for challenge. No cell species barrier against inhibitor action was found. Strong inhibition of multicycle yields of vesicular stomatitis virus and Sindbis virus was caused by low doses of inhibitor. These specific characteristics of the present inhibitor separate it from commonly recognized inhibitors. Possible biological significance of the inhibitor is discussed...|$|R
