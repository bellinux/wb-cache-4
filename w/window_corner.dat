60|$|It seems {{then that}} men and women are equally at fault. It seems that a profound, impartial, and {{absolutely}} just opinion of our fellow-creatures is utterly unknown. Either we are men, or we are women. Either we are cold, or we are sentimental. Either we are young, or growing old. In any case life is but a procession of shadows, and God knows why it is that we embrace them so eagerly, and see them depart with such anguish, being shadows. And why, if this--and much more than this is true, why are we yet surprised in the <b>window</b> <b>corner</b> by a sudden vision that the young man in the chair is of all things in the world the most real, the most solid, the best known to us--why indeed? For the moment after we know nothing about him.|$|E

50|$|The landshövdingehus {{built around}} 1880-1890 {{attempted}} {{to imitate the}} more high-status stone houses. They used horizontal board panelling and rich profiling. Often they were decorated with bay or dormer <b>windows,</b> <b>corner</b> towers and/or rustication of the brick wall.|$|R
40|$|Summary. Fatigue {{tests on}} a Comet I {{pressure}} cabin subjected to operational pressure cycles are described.

Conclusions are reached that appear to have some general significance. 1. Introduction. Fatigue investigations made on {{one of a number}} of Comet I fuselages that had been specially provided for research purposes are described in this Report. In these investigations the pressure cabin was subjected to pressure loading cycles only, and attention was directed mainly to the initiation and development of cracksat the <b>window</b> <b>corners.</b> Special care was taken to avoid unnecessary destruction, and cracks were repaired as necessary to prevent catastrophic failure...|$|R
6000|$|Presently the Doctor resumed: [...] "I {{will take}} the smaller matter first: your conduct to your wife. You went, I hear, and had an explanation. That may have been right or wrong; I know not; at least, you had stirred her temper. At the council she insults you; well, you insult her back--a man to a woman, a husband to his wife, in public! Next, upon the back of this, you propose--the story runs like wildfire--to recall the power of signature. Can she ever forgive that? a woman--a young woman--ambitious, {{conscious}} of talents beyond yours? Never, Otto. And to sum all, at such a crisis in your married life, {{you get into a}} <b>window</b> <b>corner</b> with that ogling dame von Rosen. I do not dream that there was any harm; but I do say it was an idle disrespect to your wife. Why, man, the woman is not decent." ...|$|E
60|$|It was. For a {{week the}} Sheldons {{hammered}} and glued and washed and consulted. The north room was already papered {{with a blue}} paper of an old-fashioned stripe-and-diamond pattern. The rag carpet was put down, and the braided rugs laid on it. The old bedstead {{was set up in}} one corner and, having been well cleaned and polished with beeswax and turpentine, was really a handsome piece of furniture. On the washstand Sara placed a quaint old basin and ewer which had been Grandma Sheldon's. Ray had fixed up the table as good as new; Sara had polished the brass claws, and on the table she put the brass tray, two candlesticks, and snuffers which had been long stowed away in the kitchen loft. The dressing table and swing mirror, with its scroll frame of tarnished gilt, was in the <b>window</b> <b>corner,</b> and opposite it was the old chest of drawers. The cupboard was set up in a corner, and beside it stood the spinning-wheel from the kitchen loft. The big grandfather clock, which had always stood in the hall below was carried up, and two platters of blue willow-ware were set up over the mantel. Above them was hung the faded sampler that Grandma Sheldon had worked ninety years ago {{when she was a little}} girl.|$|E
60|$|When the half-frightened curiosity had {{somewhat}} faded away, Emma Ladbruk was uncomfortably {{conscious of}} another feeling towards the old woman. She was a quaint old tradition, lingering about the place, {{she was part}} and parcel of the farm itself, she was something at once pathetic and picturesque—but she was dreadfully in the way. Emma had come to the farm full of plans for little reforms and improvements, in part the result of training in the newest ways and methods, in part the outcome of her own ideas and fancies. Reforms in the kitchen region, if those deaf old ears could have been induced to give them even a hearing, would have met with short shrift and scornful rejection, and the kitchen region spread over the zone of dairy and market business and half the work of the household. Emma, with the latest science of dead-poultry dressing at her finger-tips, sat by, an unheeded watcher, while old Martha trussed the chickens for the market-stall as she had trussed them for nearly fourscore years—all leg and no breast. And the hundred hints anent effective cleaning and labour-lightening and the things that make for wholesomeness which the young woman was ready to impart or to put into action dropped away into nothingness before that wan, muttering, unheeding presence. Above all, the coveted <b>window</b> <b>corner,</b> that was to be a dainty, cheerful oasis in the gaunt old kitchen, stood now choked and lumbered with a litter of odds and ends that Emma, for all her nominal authority, would not have dared or cared to displace; over them seemed to be spun the protection of something that was like a human cobweb. Decidedly Martha was in the way. It would have been an unworthy meanness to have wished to see the span of that brave old life shortened by a few paltry months, but as the days sped by Emma was conscious that the wish was there, disowned though it might be, lurking at the back of her mind.|$|E

50|$|Michael D. Helfrich House is a {{historic}} home located at Evansville, Indiana. It was designed by the noted architecture firm Clifford Shopbell & Co. and built in 1920.

50|$|The {{living room}} can be {{finished}} with small sectional sofas or chairs to make conversational niches around the fireplace, <b>window</b> <b>corner</b> and, {{in the corner}} opposite the entrance, the library corner and its table.

50|$|The George and Martha Hitchcock House is {{a two-story}} {{asymmetrical}} wood-framed Queen Anne structure clad with clapboards. The front facade spans four bays, with the rightmost bay recessed, transitioning into a bay <b>window</b> <b>corner.</b> The porch was altrered in the 1950s by extending {{it across the}} front facade. The attic has a pedimented gable over the three left bays with an elaborate molded lintel.|$|E
50|$|The LMS flush sided coach, {{of which}} many {{examples}} still remained {{as late as}} 1967-8, differed in appearance from its predecessors mainly {{in the shape of}} its windows which now exhibited well-rounded corners. All the earlier coaches had, of course, been built with slightly rounded <b>window</b> <b>corner</b> mouldings but by comparison with Stanier vehicles, the Period I and II coach window was almost square cornered. The second major visible difference was also in the window area. During Period I, the favoured method of admitting fresh air was the droplight which was frequently supplemented by and finally (in Period II) in large measure superseded by the Stones and Dewel pattern glass vane ventilator.|$|E

50|$|Mac OS X Lion {{introduced}} {{many changes}} inspired by iOS that persisted in OS X Mavericks {{as well as}} OS X Yosemite, although the latter changed the overall aesthetic. Scrollbars were removed and scrollbar handles turned into thin, semi-transparent bars that disappear when not used. The corner radii of push buttons were reduced, giving an appearance similar to Mac OS 8 and 9. The gel-like appearance of most components was replaced with a slightly glossy and flatter look. Window backgrounds became slightly brighter and <b>window</b> <b>corners</b> were rounded. Lion also added more animations.|$|R
50|$|One {{particularly}} handsome {{example of}} the houses built is the Calvin Prescott House, 550 Wianno Avenue, which was built in 1882-83. It is 2-1/2 stories in height, with a gabled roof pierced by eyebrow <b>windows,</b> <b>corner</b> turret and complex entry pavilion. The Isobel Richards House, 432 Wianno, has Queen Anne features, and has a windmill on the property, one of several found in the district. The Tiffany House, located next to the Wianno Club and now one of its guest houses, was built for a member of Louis Comfort Tiffany's family in 1879.|$|R

In our experiments, we achieve reasonable results in building facade reconstruction with only a fraction of features compared to standard structure from motion...|$|R
