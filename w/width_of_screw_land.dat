5000|$|The System 1 bridge can be {{replaced}} successfully with a Floyd Rose licensed bridge.The slightly wider pivot <b>screw</b> spacing <b>of</b> the System 1 bridge needs a Floyd Rose licensed bridge design with one pivot screw cutaway that extends {{to the edge of}} the bridge allowing the Floyd Rose licensed bridge to mount onto the System 1 pivot screws.

5000|$|Lead [...] {{and pitch}} {{are closely related}} concepts. They can be {{confused}} {{because they are the}} same for most screws. Lead is the distance along the screw's axis that is covered by one complete rotation <b>of</b> the <b>screw</b> (360°). Pitch is the distance from the crest of one thread to the next. Because the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>screw</b> threadforms are single-start threadforms, their lead and pitch are the same. Single-start means {{that there is only one}} [...] "ridge" [...] wrapped around the cylinder <b>of</b> the <b>screw's</b> body. Each time that the screw's body rotates one turn (360°), it has advanced axially by the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> one ridge. [...] "Double-start" [...] means that there are two [...] "ridges" [...] wrapped around the cylinder <b>of</b> the <b>screw's</b> body. Each time that the screw's body rotates one turn (360°), it has advanced axially by the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> two ridges. Another way to express this is that lead and pitch are parametrically related, and the parameter that relates them, the number of starts, very often has a value of 1, in which case their relationship becomes equality. In general, lead is equal to pitch times the number of starts.|$|R

40|$|Non-thermal plasma (NTP) {{has been}} {{introduced}} {{over the last few}} years as a promising after- treatment system for nitrogen oxides and particulate matter removal from diesel exhaust. NTP technology has not been commercialised as yet, due to its high rate of energy consumption. Therefore, it is important to seek out new methods to improve NTP performance. Residence time is a crucial parameter in engine exhaust emissions treatment. In this paper, different electrode shapes are analysed and the corresponding residence time and NOx removal efficiency are studied. An axisymmetric laminar model is used for obtaining residence time distribution numerically using FLUENT software. If the mean residence time in a NTP plasma reactor increases, there will be a corresponding increase in the reaction time and consequently the pollutant removal efficiency increases. Three different screw thread electrodes and a rod electrode are examined. The results show the advantage <b>of</b> <b>screw</b> thread electrodes in comparison with the rod electrode. Furthermore, between the screw thread electrodes, the electrode with the thread <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 1 mm has the highest NOx removal due to higher residence time and a greater number of micro-discharges. The results show that the residence time <b>of</b> the <b>screw</b> thread electrode with a thread <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 1 mm is 21 % more than for the rod electrode...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Screw turbine was {{developed}} as alternative micro-hydro power plants. Its working principle {{is to use}} the river or irrigation with low discharge. The water flows into the turbine will drive the blades <b>of</b> <b>screw</b> turbine to rotate.

In this paper we will focus on the manufacturing process for small -scale <b>of</b> <b>screw</b> turbine to generate electricity voltage. Manufacturing process <b>of</b> <b>screw</b> turbine component as micro-hydro power plant consists of two components such as mechanical and electrical components. Mechanical components consist <b>of</b> a <b>screw</b> turbine, home <b>of</b> turbine <b>screw,</b> shaft <b>of</b> turbine and bearings.

To meet this objective, the wood plastic panels from the malach choob factory with density of 1. 017 gr/cm 3 and 100 × 100 × 1. 4 cm 3 indimension were prepared, and for withdrawal resistance test the screw with 3 mm in diameter and 2. 5 mm in length were used.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of {{the accuracy of the}} operators' assessments of the hold <b>of</b> bone <b>screws</b> is reported.

Four operators, encompassing a range of experiences in terms <b>of</b> <b>screw</b> insertion, prepared the pilot holes, and inserted a number <b>of</b> <b>screws,</b> assigning each with a score from 0 to 10 on the basis of how good the hold was felt to be. The pullout strength for each screw was then measured using a tensometer. The results were analysed and correlation coefficients calculated. Significant correlation was observed in all four subjects, with P P > 0. 001 in the other two. The conclusions were that there is a strong correlation between the subjective assessment <b>of</b> <b>screw</b> hold and actual pullout strength within the four subjects analysed.
