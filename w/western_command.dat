5|$|A year later, Manekshaw was {{promoted}} {{to the position of}} army commander and took over <b>Western</b> <b>Command.</b> In 1964, he moved from Shimla to Calcutta as the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the Eastern Command. As GOC-in-C Eastern Command, he successfully responded to an insurgency in Nagaland for which he was later awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1968.|$|E
5|$|In May, Major-General A. E. Williams assumed command. The {{division}} was initially assigned to <b>Western</b> <b>Command,</b> and by early 1940 was spread {{out along the}} River Severn in England and Wales.

5|$|No. 6 Commando {{was one of}} {{the units}} formed at this time. Raised at Scarborough on 26 July 1940, it was placed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Fetherstonhaugh, who was a Territorial officer holding the {{substantive}} rank of captain in the Queen’s Royal Regiment. Initially, the unit's personnel were mainly drawn from the British Army's <b>Western</b> <b>Command</b> although later personnel were drawn from all commands and branches of the army. Garrison duties were undertaken at Romney Marsh and Brightlingsea, before the unit moved to Milford Haven where they undertook amphibious training. Around this time, the commando adopted the Scottish Tam o'Shanter as their official headdress.|$|E

5|$|Following General Grant's 1868 presidential victory, the Republicans were {{firmly in}} charge in Washington. As a result, Hancock found himself transferred, this {{time away from}} the {{sensitive}} assignment of reconstructing the South and into the relative backwater that was the Department of Dakota. The Department covered Minnesota, Montana, and the Dakotas. As in his previous <b>Western</b> <b>command,</b> Hancock began with a conference of the Indian chiefs, but this time was more successful in establishing a peaceful intent. Relations worsened in 1870, however, as an army expedition committed a massacre against the Blackfeet. Relations with the Sioux also became contentious as a result of white encroachment into the Black Hills, in violation of the Treaty of Fort Laramie. Still, war was averted, for the time being, and most of Hancock's command was peaceful.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a three-month}} course at Staff College, Camberley, Garrett was {{appointed}} commandant of the Staff College, Queenscliff, Victoria, in June 1946. He was posted to Japan in March 1947, becoming Brigadier-in-Charge of Administration for the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in July. The {{size and scope}} of the occupation declined considerably during his tour, which finished in October 1949. Approximately 2,400 Australians, most from the 67th Battalion, remained by late 1948, compared to 11,000 in October 1946. In December 1949, Garrett resumed command of the Staff College, Queenscliff. Promoted temporary major general, he was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) <b>Western</b> <b>Command,</b> which covered the state of Western Australia, in August 1951. He became Deputy Chief of the General Staff in February 1953.|$|E
5|$|He {{initially}} alienated many of {{his officers}} and men by publicly denigrating their record in comparison to his <b>Western</b> <b>command.</b> He launched an offensive against the Confederate army of General Robert E. Lee, in which he fell prey to a strategic turning movement into his rear areas by Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson. At Second Bull Run, he concentrated his attention on attacking Jackson while the other Confederate corps attacked his flank and routed his army. Following Manassas, Pope was banished far from the Eastern Theater to the Department of the Northwest in Minnesota, where he commanded U.S. Forces in the Dakota War of 1862. He was appointed to command the Department of the Missouri in 1865 and was a prominent and activist commander during Reconstruction in Atlanta. For {{the rest of his}} military career, he fought in the Indian Wars, particularly against the Apache and Sioux.|$|E

5|$|In December, both Erich Hartmann and Gerhard Barkhorn, Graf’s best pilots, {{returned}} to active duty. Within a month, they both achieved their 300th victories. On New Year’s Day, the Luftwaffe's <b>western</b> <b>command</b> launched Operation Bodenplatte, against Allied air forces {{based in the}} Low Countries. It was an unsuccessful attempt to support the Battle of the Bulge offensive. For the failure, Göring fired Galland as General of the Fighters. In response, a meeting of senior Geschwadern commanders, in early January (including Graf), agreed to approach Göring and demand major changes. When confronted, Göring was furious and immediately demoted all the fighter leaders aside from Graf, who stayed as Kommodore of JG52 because of the unit’s exemplary war record. Göring told Graf he needed him against the imminent Soviet attack.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jackson's {{father had}} been {{appointed}} to command Northern Command in May 1940 and was promoted to major general in July. However, the following year he was posted to <b>Western</b> <b>Command</b> and believed {{that he had been}} passed over for a combat command after opposing the Brisbane Line strategy, subsequently retiring in early 1942. By late 1942 Jackson's battalion returned from the Middle East, and he later served in New Guinea fighting the Japanese at Gona, {{as well as in the}} Ramu Valley, the Finisterre Ranges and the New Guinea north coast. He was subsequently posted to Headquarters 18th Brigade as a major during the period 1943–44. In June 1944, he took up a position as an instructor at the Canadian Staff College in Kingston, where he remained until the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Post-Independence, being {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} Major General, Cariappa was appointed as deputy chief of the general staff.

After taking over the command, he immediately renamed it the <b>Western</b> <b>Command</b> and moved its headquarters (HQ) to Jammu; he subsequently raised a corps HQ under Lt Gen S.M. Shrinagesh at Udhampur. He appointed Lt Gen Kodandera Subayya Thimayya as the GOC Jammu and Kashmir Force (later 19th Division), and Atma Singh as the GOC Jammu Division (later 25th Division).|$|E

5|$|Returning to Australia, Jackson {{filled a}} number of staff positions, {{including}} postings to the Royal Military College, Army Headquarters and Headquarters <b>Western</b> <b>Command.</b> His father died of pneumonia at Heidelberg, Victoria, on 24 November 1948. Jackson was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1949 and to colonel in 1951. On 21 June 1956, Jackson assumed command of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) in South Korea deployed {{as part of the}} UN garrison which had remained there following the end of the Korean War and oversaw the battalion's final operational activities before its return to Australia. He subsequently took up a two-year appointment in the United States as Australian Military Attache in Washington. In 1959 he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in recognition of his service to the Australian Staff Corps.|$|E
5|$|The Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General P. P. Kumaramangalam was due {{to retire}} in June 1969. Though Manekshaw was the most senior {{commander}} in army, Defence Minister Sardar Swaran Singh was in favour of Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh, who had {{played a key role}} as the GOC-in-C of <b>Western</b> <b>Command</b> during the 1965 Indo-Pakistani war. Despite this, Manekshaw was appointed as the 8th Chief of the Army Staff on 8 June 1969. As the Chief of the Army Staff, he developed the Indian Army into an efficient instrument of war. During his tenure as COAS, he was instrumental in stopping the implementation of reservations for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the army. Though he was Parsi, a minority group in India, Mankeshaw felt that implementing reservations would compromise the ethos of the army; he also felt all must be given an equal chance.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II a regional command structure was subsequently adopted, with 2 MD becoming Eastern Command, 5 MD redesignated <b>Western</b> <b>Command,</b> while 1 MD in Queensland became Northern Command and the three southern states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania were amalgamated into Southern Command. In {{the early years of}} the war this structure proved effective for operations overseas; however, as the threat of war with Japan grew the various commands and military districts came under greater pressure. The activation of the Militia for full-time duty after Japan's entry into the war in late 1941 compounded the situation. In response, the Army command structure was reorganised in early 1942. While Western Australia remained unchanged, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia were redesignated as Lines of Communications Areas, 7 MD became Northern Territory Force and 8 MD was redesignated as New Guinea Force. In July 1942 the Military Board's functions were assumed by the commander of the military forces, General Sir Thomas Blamey.|$|E

5|$|Jaguar, Léopard and Panthère were {{assigned}} to the Northern Command (Forces maritimes du Nord) on 7 September in anticipation of a German invasion of Belgium. They proved, however, to be too large and unmaneuverable for operations in the shallow waters of the English Channel and North Sea; Panthère ran aground on 10 September in poor visibility, but suffered only minor damage, and Jaguar did the same thing on the night of 28/29 October. The contre-torpilleurs were relieved by smaller torpilleurs d'escadre beginning in mid-October. The other ships {{were assigned}} to the <b>Western</b> <b>Command</b> (Forces maritimes de l'Ouest) for convoy escort duties from October 1939 to May 1940 where they guarded convoys traveling between Gibraltar and Brest as well as Casablanca, French Morocco, and Le Verdon-sur-Mer. They were joined by the first three ships as they were replaced in the Northern Command. Jaguar was badly damaged during a collision with a British destroyer in January 1940 and her repairs were not completed until early May.|$|E
5|$|Kaul sent informers {{to spy on}} Manekshaw {{and based}} on the {{information}} gained, Manekshaw was charged and a court of inquiry was ordered. Meanwhile, two of his juniors—Harbaksh Singh and Moti Sagar—were promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as corps commanders. This incident resulted in the widespread implication that Manekshaw had almost been dismissed from the service. The court, presided over by the then-GOC-in-C <b>Western</b> <b>Command,</b> Lieutenant General Daulet Singh, known for his integrity, exonerated Manekshaw. Before a formal 'no case to answer' could be announced, war with China broke out. But due to the court proceedings, Manekshaw did not see any action during the war. During this war, the Indian Army faced a debacle, and many knew that Kaul and Menon were primarily responsible for the failure. Both were sacked immediately. In November 1962, Nehru asked Manekshaw to take over the command of IV Corps. Manekshaw told Nehru that the action against him was a conspiracy, and that his promotion had been due for almost eighteen months. Nehru apologized, promoted Manekshaw to lieutenant general, and he moved to Tezpur to take over as the GOC IV Corps.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{returned}} to England in 1926, and assumed {{command of the}} 22nd Heavy Battery. Equipped {{with a mixture of}} 9.2 inch guns, 6 inch guns, 12 pounders and 6 pounders, it was responsible for the coastal defences of Weymouth, Dorset. Still a captain, Morgan hoped that his next career move would be to attend the Staff College, Camberley, having narrowly passed the entrance examination. Instead, he was offered a place at the Staff College, Quetta, requiring a return trip to India. Morgan's classmates at Quetta in 1927 and 1928 included William Slim, John Crocker, Kenneth Anderson, David Cowan, George Alan Vasey and Tommy Burns. After graduation, Morgan was posted to the 70th Field Battery at Lucknow, and then was artillery staff officer at headquarters <b>Western</b> <b>Command,</b> under Brigadier Henry Karslake. When Karslake became major-general, Royal Artillery, at GHQ India in 1931, he brought Morgan to Delhi to serve with him as General Staff Officer (Grade 2). Morgan was finally promoted major in 1932 and brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1934.|$|E

He briefly commanded the British Army of the Rhine, until he fell ill in August 1948; he was invalided out of the service early in January 1949 by the lingering effects of the wounds he had received in North Africa. Promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the King's Birthday Honours that year, he served as Honorary Colonel of a Territorial Army unit of the Royal Artillery. In 1949 he was appointed Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, a post traditionally held by retired officers; this appointment was confirmed on the accession of Elizabeth II in 1952. Black Rod has the responsibility of supervising the administration of the House of Lords, controlling admission to it, and taking part in ceremonies. In 1957, Horrocks had the unusual duty of ordering Vivien Leigh out of the House when she interrupted proceedings to plead that the St James's Theatre be saved from demolition. On other occasions, because the Black Rod had to remain in place during long debates, Horrocks relieved his boredom by completing football pools coupons. This had the advantage of looking like note-taking to the assembled lords. Horrocks held the post of Black Rod until 1963.|$|E
