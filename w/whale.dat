5|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 15 mysticete species. One species—the North Atlantic right whale—is Endangered {{with only}} around 400(±50) {{individuals}} left, and four more are also classified as Endangered (North Pacific right <b>whale,</b> the blue <b>whale,</b> the fin <b>whale,</b> and the Sei <b>whale),</b> and another 5 ranked as Data deficient (Bryde's <b>whale,</b> Eden's <b>whale,</b> Omura's <b>whale,</b> Southern minke <b>whale,</b> and pygmy right <b>whale).</b> Species {{that live in}} polar habitats are vulnerable {{to the effects of}} ongoing climate change, particularly declines in sea ice, as well as ocean acidification.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{whales are}} {{rorquals}} (family Balaenopteridae), {{a family that}} includes the humpback <b>whale,</b> the fin <b>whale,</b> Bryde's <b>whale,</b> the sei <b>whale,</b> and the minke <b>whale.</b> The family Balaenopteridae {{is believed to have}} diverged from the other families of the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Oligocene (28 Ma ago). It is not known when the members of those families diverged from each other.|$|E
5|$|Many parasites {{latch onto}} whales, notably <b>whale</b> lice and <b>whale</b> barnacles. Almost all species of <b>whale</b> lice are {{specialized}} towards a certain species of <b>whale,</b> and {{there can be}} more than one species per <b>whale.</b> <b>Whale</b> lice eat dead skin, resulting in minor wounds in the skin. <b>Whale</b> louse infestations are especially evident in right whales, where colonies propagate on their callosities. Though not a parasite, <b>whale</b> barnacles latch onto the skin of a <b>whale</b> during their larval stage. However, in doing so it does not harm nor benefit the <b>whale,</b> so their relationship is often labeled as an example of commensalism. Some baleen whales will deliberately rub themselves on substrate to dislodge parasites. Some species of barnacle, such as Conchoderma auritum and <b>whale</b> barnacles, attach to the baleen plates, though this seldom occurs. A species of copepod, Balaenophilus unisetus, inhabits baleen plates of whales in tropical waters. A species of Antarctic diatom, Cocconeis ceticola, forms a film on the skin, which takes a month to develop; this film causes minor damage to the skin. They are also plagued by internal parasites such as stomach worms, cestodes, nematodes, liver flukes, and acanthocephalans.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 4.454 <b>whales</b> {{came in at}} the station in the period 1906-1984 3.155 Fin <b>whales,</b> 524 Sperm <b>whales,</b> 509 Sei <b>whales,</b> 124 Minke <b>whales,</b> 62 Blue <b>whales,</b> 30 {{humpback}} <b>whales</b> and 410 unlisted <b>whales.</b>|$|R
25|$|Marine mammals include seals, sea lions, {{humpback}} <b>whales,</b> killer <b>whales,</b> gray <b>whales,</b> blue <b>whales,</b> sperm <b>whales,</b> pacific white-sided dolphin, and bottlenose dolphin.|$|R
50|$|Dolphins, killer <b>whales,</b> and {{occasionally}} humpback <b>whales</b> visit the harbor. Other cetacean {{species such as}} Bryde's <b>whales,</b> sperm <b>whales,</b> pilot <b>whales,</b> and false killer <b>whales</b> are known to come into Rangaunu Bay and around Karikari Peninsula, but very few <b>whales</b> actually appear into Rangaunu Harbour. The harbor environment is an ideal habitat for southern right <b>whales,</b> and Rangaunu harbor might once have been a resting/calving ground for these coast-hugging <b>whales.</b>|$|R
5|$|Rorquals {{consist of}} two genera (Balaenoptera and Megaptera) and nine species: the fin <b>whale</b> (B. physalus), the Sei <b>whale</b> (B. borealis), Bryde's <b>whale</b> (B. brydei), Eden's <b>whale</b> (B. edeni), the blue <b>whale</b> (B. musculus), the common minke <b>whale</b> (B. acutorostrata), the Antarctic minke <b>whale</b> (B. bonaerensis), Omura's <b>whale</b> (B. omurai), and the {{humpback}} <b>whale</b> (M. novaeangliae). In a 2012 review of cetacean taxonomy, Alexandre Hassanin (of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle) and colleagues suggested that, based on phylogenic criteria, {{there are four}} extant genera of rorquals. They recommend that the genus Balaenoptera {{be limited to the}} fin <b>whale,</b> have minke whales fall under the genus Pterobalaena, and have Rorqualus contain the Sei <b>whale,</b> Bryde's <b>whale,</b> Eden's <b>whale,</b> the blue <b>whale,</b> and Omura's <b>whale.</b>|$|E
5|$|The animal's {{large size}} aids in identification, {{and it is}} usually only {{confused}} with the blue <b>whale,</b> the sei <b>whale,</b> or, in warmer waters, Bryde's <b>whale.</b>|$|E
5|$|The blue <b>whale</b> {{is usually}} {{classified}} {{as one of}} eight species in the genus Balaenoptera; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus, Sibbaldus, {{but this is not}} accepted elsewhere. DNA sequencing analysis indicates that the blue <b>whale</b> is phylogenetically closer to the sei <b>whale</b> (Balaenoptera borealis) and Bryde's <b>whale</b> (Balaenoptera brydei) than to other Balaenoptera species, and closer to the humpback <b>whale</b> (Megaptera) and the gray <b>whale</b> (Eschrichtius) than to the minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata and Balaenoptera bonaerensis). If further research confirms these relationships, {{it will be necessary to}} reclassify the rorquals.|$|E
25|$|Primarily Right <b>whales,</b> {{humpback}} <b>whales,</b> gray, and fin <b>whales</b> were hunted. Blue <b>whales,</b> sei, Bryde's and sperm <b>whales</b> were however {{also taken}} when possible.|$|R
25|$|Southern right <b>whales</b> and {{humpback}} <b>whales</b> frequent {{the area}} between July and October when they congregate to mate and calve in the protected waters of the sound. Other <b>whales</b> that have been spotted in the area include minke <b>whales,</b> blue <b>whales,</b> short-finned pilot <b>whales,</b> false killer <b>whales</b> and killer <b>whales.</b> Sperm <b>whales</b> were known to visit the sound during the whaling era but none have been sighted recently, although a pod was detected further out in the Southern Ocean in 2002.|$|R
5000|$|The area is also {{important}} for migrating cetaceans and the [...] "Whale Bay" [...] in the east of Kanmaw Kyun was named historical presences of large number of <b>whales.</b> Such variety includes resident population of Bryde's <b>whales,</b> Omura's <b>whales,</b> occasional blue <b>whales,</b> longman's beaked <b>whales,</b> strap-toothed <b>whales,</b> and killer <b>whales,</b> dolphins, finless porpoises, and Irrawaddy dolphins.|$|R
5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right <b>whale</b> is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large <b>Whale</b> Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize <b>whale</b> entanglement in fishing gear and record large <b>whale</b> sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans {{knew very little about}} whales over the course of history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered the <b>whale</b> as they were {{important}} pieces of their lives. In Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded <b>whale,</b> he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the <b>whale</b> back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin <b>whale</b> and hit the blowhole, causing the <b>whale</b> to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and a <b>whale</b> came and killed him.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual <b>whale</b> migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead <b>whale,</b> by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer <b>whale</b> pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a <b>whale</b> calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback <b>whale</b> calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a <b>whale</b> is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E
50|$|Behavioral {{differences}} {{can also be}} used to differentiate pygmy killer <b>whales</b> from false killer <b>whales.</b> Pygmy killer <b>whales</b> usually move slowly when at the surface whereas false killer <b>whales</b> are highly energetic. Pygmy killer <b>whales</b> rarely bow ride but it is common in false killer <b>whales.</b>|$|R
50|$|Minke <b>whales,</b> Bryde's <b>whales,</b> false killer <b>whales,</b> killer <b>whales</b> {{and pilot}} <b>whales</b> will pass the coast at various times, {{as well as}} very rarely blue, fin and sei <b>whales.</b> Sperm <b>whales</b> are present {{off the coast of}} Sydney but tend to stay {{near the edge of the}} {{continental}} shelf over 20 nmi km to sea, so are not often seen close to shore.|$|R
50|$|<b>Whales</b> in Ghanaian marine {{environment}} belong to species of families Ziphiidae (beaked <b>whales),</b> Physeteridae (sperm <b>whales)</b> and Kogiidae (pygmy sperm <b>whales).</b> 'Dolphins', {{and other species}} recorded along western African waters but not within Ghanaian waters such as blue <b>whales,</b> bryde's <b>whales,</b> and minke <b>whales</b> are not listed below. Most common of dolphins along Ghanaian waters include Atlantic humpback dolphins and common bottlenose dolphins.|$|R
5|$|Cetotheriidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the pygmy right <b>whale</b> (Caperea marginata). The first descriptions {{date back to the}} 1840s of bones and baleen plates resembling a smaller version of the right <b>whale,</b> and was named Balaena marginata. In 1864, it was moved into the genus Caperea after a skull of another specimen was discovered. Six years later, the pygmy right <b>whale</b> was classified under the family Neobalaenidae. Despite its name, the pygmy right <b>whale</b> is more genetically similar to rorquals and gray whales than to right whales. A study published in 2012, based on bone structure, moved the pygmy right <b>whale</b> from the family Neobalaenidae to the family Cetotheriidae, making it a living fossil; Neobalaenidae was elevated down to subfamily level as Neobalaeninae.|$|E
5|$|Eschrichtiidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the gray <b>whale</b> (Eschrichtius robustus). The two populations, one in the Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan {{and the other in}} the Mediterranean Sea and East Atlantic, are thought to be genetically and physiologically dissimilar. The gray <b>whale</b> is traditionally placed as the only living species in its genus and family. However, DNA analysis by studies, such as the one by Takeshi Sasaki (of the Tokyo Institute of Technology) and colleagues, indicates certain rorquals, such as the humpback <b>whale,</b> Megaptera novaeangliae, and the fin <b>whale,</b> Balaenoptera physalus, are more closely related to the gray <b>whale</b> than they are to some other rorquals, such as the minke <b>whale,</b> Balaenoptera acutorostrata.|$|E
5|$|Fin {{whales are}} rorquals, {{members of the}} family Balaenopteridae, which also {{includes}} the humpback <b>whale,</b> the blue <b>whale,</b> Bryde's <b>whale,</b> the sei <b>whale,</b> and the minke whales. The family diverged from the other baleen whales in the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Miocene, although it is not known when the members of these families further evolved into their own species.|$|E
5000|$|... "Cardigan Bay’s Big Three" [...] include {{bottlenose}} dolphins, Harbor porpoises and Atlantic grey seals. Other mammals, such as Minke <b>whales,</b> Risso's dolphins and Common dolphins, {{many species}} of sea birds such as Puffin, and sharks {{can be seen as}} well. Seasonal or rarer megafaunas visiting the area include Humpback <b>whales,</b> Fin <b>whales,</b> Sperm <b>whales,</b> Pygmy sperm <b>whales,</b> Northern bottlenose <b>whales,</b> Sowerby's beaked <b>whales,</b> Killer <b>whales,</b> Long-finned pilot <b>whales,</b> Thresher sharks, Basking sharks, and Sunfish. The Leatherback turtle, a very rare, critically endangered species are also known to visit the bay.|$|R
50|$|Marine {{waters in}} the park are rich in {{cetacean}} diversities including such as humpback <b>whales,</b> bryde's <b>whales,</b> sperm <b>whales,</b> pilot <b>whales,</b> and several species of dolphins.|$|R
50|$|Among larger cetaceans, Bryde's <b>whales</b> are {{residents}} and relatively {{common in the}} Gulf, and their presence in these busily travelled waters leads to {{a large number of}} ship strikes, with sometimes several of the <b>whales</b> dying each year from collisions with shipping vessels or sport boats. The population remaining is estimated to be between 100-200. In recent years, increases in numbers of migrating baleen <b>whales</b> are confirmed long after the end of hunting era. These are humpback <b>whales,</b> southern blue <b>whales,</b> pygmy blue <b>whales,</b> and southern minke <b>whales.</b> Less frequently, fin <b>whales</b> and sei <b>whales</b> are seen as well. For southern right <b>whales,</b> these <b>whales</b> will possibly become seasonal residents in the gulf as the populations recover (one of two of the first confirmed birth records on New Zealand's main islands since after commercial and illegal whalings were recorded at around Milford and Browns Bay in 2012). Sperm <b>whales</b> visit occasionally.|$|R
5|$|Fossils of an extinct relative, Globicephala baereckeii, {{have been}} found in Pleistocene {{deposits}} in Florida. Another Globicephala dolphin was discovered in Pliocene strata in Tuscany, Italy, and was named G. eturia. The pilot whales were also close relatives of the extinct blunt-snouted dolphin. Close living relatives of the pilot whales are the melon-headed <b>whale,</b> the pygmy killer <b>whale,</b> the false killer <b>whale,</b> and Risso's dolphin.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{two studies}} of DNA samples {{from each of}} the <b>whale</b> populations {{concluded}} the northern and southern populations of right <b>whale</b> should be considered separate species. What some scientists found more surprising was the discovery that the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and that the North Pacific species is more closely related to the southern right <b>whale</b> than to the North Atlantic right <b>whale.</b> The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3million and 12million years.|$|E
50|$|Several {{species of}} {{cetaceans}} are found near the Farallon Islands, most frequently gray <b>whales,</b> blue <b>whales,</b> and humpback <b>whales.</b> Blue <b>whales</b> and humpback <b>whales</b> {{are most frequently}} found near the islands {{in the summer and}} fall, when strong upwelling may support a rich pelagic food web. Killer <b>whales</b> are also found around the islands. Gray <b>whales</b> are reliably found near the Farallones during their spring migration north and the fall/winter migration south. Some gray <b>whales</b> may also be found during the summer, when a few <b>whales</b> skip the trip north to Alaska and spend the summer months off the coast of Canada and the continental United States.|$|R
50|$|During {{the winter}} season (October-March) large schools of herring arrive in Andfjorden, {{followed}} by orcas, humpback <b>whales</b> and fin <b>whales.</b> Sperm <b>whales</b> and pilot <b>whales</b> are encountered all year round.|$|R

5|$|The South African Museum in Cape Town {{features}} a hall devoted to whales and natural history {{known as the}} <b>Whale</b> Well. The centrepiece of the exhibit is a suspended mounted blue <b>whale</b> skeleton, from the carcass of a partially mature specimen that washed ashore in the mid 1980s. The skeleton's jaw bones are mounted {{on the floor of}} <b>Whale</b> Well to permit visitors direct contact with them, and to walk between them so as to appreciate the size of the animal. Other mounted skeletons include that of a humpback <b>whale</b> and a right <b>whale,</b> together with in-scale composite models of other whales, dolphins and porpoises.|$|E
5|$|The blue <b>whale</b> {{rose from}} {{relative}} obscurity in the 1970s, {{after the release}} of the Songs of the Humpback <b>Whale.</b> The difference between the humpback and the blue <b>whale</b> was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue <b>whale</b> singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E
5|$|The gray <b>whale</b> {{has been}} placed {{in a family of}} its own as it is {{sufficiently}} different from the right whales and the rorquals. The gray <b>whale</b> is the only benthic feeding baleen <b>whale,</b> filtering small organisms from the mud of shallow seas. They also have a gestation period of over a year, which is unusual for baleen whales.|$|E
5000|$|The bay {{was once}} a resting area for {{migrating}} <b>whales</b> and dolphins such as southern right <b>whales</b> and humpback <b>whales,</b> and pygmy blue <b>whales</b> may be observed off the bay as well.|$|R
50|$|The Caribbean Sea {{offshore}} of {{the island}} of Dominica is home to many cetaceans. Most notably a group of sperm <b>whales</b> live in this area year-round. Other cetaceans commonly seen in the area include spinner dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins and bottlenose dolphins. Less commonly seen animals include killer <b>whales,</b> false killer <b>whales,</b> pygmy sperm <b>whales,</b> dwarf sperm <b>whales,</b> Risso's dolphins, common dolphins, Atlantic spotted dolphins, humpback <b>whales</b> and Bryde's <b>whales.</b> This makes Dominica a destination for tourists interested in whale-watching.|$|R
5000|$|North Atlantic right <b>whales</b> {{are highly}} endangered. In the early 1900s, the {{population}} was reduced to {{only a few hundred}} <b>whales</b> as a result of commercial whaling. [...] Although <b>whales</b> were protected from commercial whaling since 1935, the population still has not fully recovered. In 2011 the population of western North Atlantic right <b>whales</b> estimated about 465 <b>whales.</b> [...] Despite recent small growth in population, the North Atlantic right <b>whales</b> remain critically endangered. Unfortunately, the eastern North Atlantic right <b>whales</b> are nearly extinct.|$|R
