500|$|We {{too often}} forget the {{humanity}} of doctors and nurses. They become godlike {{to most of us}} and yet it is their humanity that makes them so interesting and enjoyable. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> a drama and have no intention of doing anything like dealing with life and death issues. We want to make people laugh so we de-emphasize the more serious elements of hospital life. It isn't that he [...] just sees things differently, he also deals with them differently. That is why Noland will dream up a baby derby, a gambling night at the hospital, a variety show at Christmas and off-track betting when patients get bored with the hospital routine.|$|E
500|$|Slow {{progress}} {{has led to}} frustration, expressed by {{the executive director of}} the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria – Mark Dybul: [...] "we have the tools to end TB as a pandemic and public health threat on the planet, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> it." [...] Several international organizations are pushing for more transparency in treatment, and more countries are implementing mandatory reporting of cases to the government, although adherence is often sketchy. Commercial treatment providers may at times overprescribe second-line drugs as well as supplementary treatment, promoting demands for further regulations. The government of Brazil provides universal TB-care, which reduces this problem. Conversely, falling rates of TB-infection may not relate to the number of programs directed at reducing infection rates but may be tied to increased level of education, income, and health of the population. Costs of the disease, as calculated by the World Bank in 2009 may exceed 150 billion USD per year in [...] "high burden" [...] countries. Lack of progress eradicating the disease may also be due to lack of patient follow-up – as among the 250M rural migrants in China.|$|E

2500|$|Restrictions on Armenians {{entering}} Turkey {{had been}} lifted in January 2002, {{and although the}} border between the two countries remained closed, Armenian workers were reportedly entering the country via Georgia and remaining illegally after their 30-day non-resident visa expired.

We could deport them but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> so."

I have a less satisfactory account to give of airships. Naval airship developments were retarded by various causes. The mishap which destroyed the May-fly, or the Won't Fly, {{as it would be}} more accurate to call it, at Barrow, was a very serious set-back to the development of Admiralty policy in airships." [...] And on 31 March 1913 Sir Bolton Eyres-Monsell (who would himself later become First Lord of the Admiralty) made the following comment regarding the fate of Mayfly and the lack of British airships: [...] "The 'May-fly' broke three years ago, and nothing further has been done. In non-rigid airships, Germany has seventeen, and against that we have two very inferior ones and two on order, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> anything in this respect." ...|$|E

60|$|That is {{not only}} a great ethical, but a great {{political}} law, and we shall reap a sour and sorry harvest if it is forgotten. It would be folly to pretend to any dogmatic assurance--and I certainly do not--as to the course of the future in India. But for to-day anybody who takes part in the rule of India, whether as a Minister or as a Member of the House of Commons, participating in the discussion on affairs in India--anyone who wants to take a fruitful part in such discussions, if he does his duty will found himself {{on the assumption that the}} British rule will continue, ought to continue, and must continue. There is, I know, a school,--I do not think it has representatives in this House--who say that we might wisely walk out of India, and that the Indians would manage their own affairs better than we can manage affairs for them. Anybody who pictures to himself the anarchy, the bloody chaos, that would follow from any such deplorable step, must shrink from that sinister decision. We, at all events--Ministers and Members of this House--are bound to take a completely different view. The Government, and the House in all its parties and groups, is determined that we ought to face all these mischiefs and difficulties and dangers of which I have been speaking with a clear purpose. We know that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> it for our own interest alone, or our own fame in the history of the civilised world alone, but for the interest of the millions committed to us. We ought to face it with sympathy, with kindness, with firmness, with a love of justice, and, whether the weather be fair or foul, in a valiant and manful spirit.|$|E
5000|$|Davitt McAteer, {{former leader}} of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, had harsh words for the {{disaster}} citing lessons unlearned from the 2006 Sago Mine disaster: [...] "That was defining of Sago.

Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope.

50|$|Waste {{diversion}} is {{the process}} of diverting waste from landfills through recycling and source reduction activities. This can be calculated in different ways. As a global community, we can measure the size and number of landfills from one year to the next.

If landfills have increased in number, then <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> enough to combat the growing population and growing waste we produce. On a smaller scale, we can track our week to week, or even day to day, waste diversion rate.|$|E

40|$|Many honors {{programs}} {{struggle with}} how to attract {{the best and brightest}} students, primarily because the students we seek often have multiple lucrative offers from highly rated institutions. At Miami University, we found ourselves in the unfortunate position of losing top-tier students to competitor programs in the region and state and thus needing to take action. Our first step was to take a critical look at the scope and type of communication <b>we</b> <b>were</b> having with prospective students. What <b>we</b> found <b>was</b> that although <b>we</b> offer an excellent honors program with learning opportunities that are equivalent to or perhaps better than those of our competitors, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> an adequate job of communicating our strengths to prospective students.
