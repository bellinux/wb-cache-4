Beware of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> in youth {{because you will}} get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a buonaroba, a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of {{language}} and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written Romeo and Juliet. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he {{will never be a}} victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman's invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.|$|E

The clay structures to be offered once your wishes are fulfilled and what other than the actual clay offerings made by devotees lying in the temple, can give you the evidence of sanctity of this deity.

40|$|The {{surprising}} and unpredictable {{story of the}} personal and social after-effects of rapid and dramatic weight loss. Using in-depth, first person accounts of 33 {{men and women who}} underwent weight-loss surgery, this book elaborates on the complexities of finally getting <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> – the good, the bad, and the totally unexpected. Suddenly being treated well by previously dismissive strangers is embraced by some, yet it angers others who question a kindness reserved only for the non-obese. Attention from the opposite sex is both flattering and scary, as many have little experience dealing with such advances. Marriages and relationships are rocked for better and for worse, as jealousy, insecurity and shifting roles jolt previously stable dynamics. All the changes provoke a re-evaluation of who one is and what one values. This is the story of how dramatic weight loss can result in personal growth, with all of its attendant joys and painful challenges. We live in a culture fascinated by physical make-overs, but no one talks about their psychological consequences. Losing a lot of weight is perhaps the most extreme make-over of all. It leaves people emotionally changed. These changes are the heart of our book. The fascinating narratives contain important lessons for individuals considering or having had the surgery and for those who try to help them. The material will be of personal significance to the lay-person {{but it is also a}} guide for health providers in the design of pre- and post-operative support interventions. At a more basic level, it is simply a story of how finally getting what you’ve always <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> can be much more complicated affair than you ever imagined...|$|R

5000|$|That night Periya Hazrat had a dream. A mass {{of people}} were running, and Periya Hazrat asked where they were going. People replied as {{they are going to}} see Allah's Tajalli. Periya Hazrat joined them. When they reached a place, {{at the top of a}} small hill, Allah's Tajalli was {{glittering}} very gloriously and everyone there enjoyed it. A voice came toward Moulana Meer Ahamed Ibrahim saying <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> is given.It was early morning and time for Fajr prayers when Hazrat woke up. Now Periya Hazrat’s teacher asked him again to leave the madharasa. He added, “Yesterday I told you to go, because you were unfit to learn, but today I need you to leave the madarasa as I am not qualified enough to teach you.” This is how Moulana Meer Ahamed Ibrahim became educated.Periya Hazrat then returned to His home town Madurai and started a madarasa to educate Muslims from all over Tamil Nadu. Many scholars of Islam in Tamil Nadu were Periya Hazrat’s students, and those scholars in turn started madarassas all over Tamil Nadu. For His outstanding wisdom and expertise in the Islamic Fiqh laws, Mir Ahamadh Ibrahim was appointed as the government chief Kazi of Madurai and Kaziul Kuzaat by the then Nawab of Carnatic in India. He served excellently with Khilafatship and Kaziship and added Glory to Islam in Madurai and other parts of Tamil Nadu. [...] Periya Hazrat died in 1872, at the age of 63, leaving four sons (Saajid Alaihir Rahma, Qadi Syed Abdul Qadir Ibrahim, Syed Mahmood Ahmad Ibrahim, Contractor Hazrat, constructor of Maqbara and Saqi Meer Niyamatullah Ibrahim) and a daughter, Saalima, wife Saalim Hazrat.|$|R
5000|$|Get Home Safely was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. Steven Goldstein of HipHopDX gave the album three out of five stars, saying [...] "Dom Kennedy is the genre’s ambassador for not trying too hard, and Get Home Safely stands out in 2013 for refusing to force anything. It also doesn’t challenge itself much, and the album’s potential is stunted by casualness eventually blending with complacency {{over the course of}} 16 songs. If Pusha T just came out with My Name Is My Name as the “conscious dopeboy,” then Dom’s the conscious hedonist—his strengths lying in candor and an unfiltered stream of consciousness that makes him a storyteller not over-telling his story." [...] Max Weinstein of Vibe gave the album a positive review, saying [...] "That’s just the thing about Get Home Safely—look too deep and <b>you</b> might get <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> <b>for,</b> which isn’t a whole lot. Even the album’s name sets out the mission of the music: to return you to your secure cocoon. Dom doesn’t want to challenge or confuse you; he just wants to make you happy. Those looking for a little flare and intensity to their music might want to opt for West Coast cousins like Nipsey, YG, or Bad Lucc, but if Dom’s music weaves a web of serenity for you to kick back and relax to, then Get Home Safely will take you right to your door." [...] Gregory Heaney of AllMusic gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "Get Home Safely isn't an album that's going to turn a house party upside down or bring a dancefloor to its knees, but that's not really Kennedy's intention. Instead, the songs feel like casual slices of life, painting a picture of Kennedy's world in a way that's relatable and engaging. [...] " ...|$|R

Alas, {{while the number}} of those who know so much {{increases}} more and more, the really able men become fewer and fewer! But it was such a man that <b>you</b> once <b>wished</b> to be. <b>You</b> have surely not forgotten what we said about sincerity: that a man must retain a clear recollection of what he once wished to be; and now you are to prove your sincerity before God in the confession of sins. <b>What</b> was it <b>you</b> once <b>wished?</b> <b>You</b> <b>wished</b> to strive after the highest ideals, to apprehend the truth and dwell in it; you would spare neither time nor effort; you would renounce everything, including every illusion. If you did attain the highest goal, you wanted to make sure of being clearly conscious of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> had formerly meant in striving to attain it. If this was ever so little, you would rather be faithful over a little than unfaithful over much. If this was your sole thought, and you became the poorest of all {{in the midst of the}} rich who know everything, you would rather still be as true as gold-and this is in the power of everyone who wills it, for gold is for the rich, but a golden loyalty is possible also for the poor. And he who was faithful over a little, faithful in the day of trial, when the reckoning is made in the stillness where no reward beckons, but only the guilt becomes clear, faithful in this sincerity which acknowledges everything, even the imperfection of the sincerity, faithful in the love that repents, the humble love whose demand is for self-accusation: he shall also be made ruler over more.
