In 2007, former Rockstar employee Jeff Williams revealed that even the game's staff were somewhat uncomfortable about the level of violence; [...] "there was almost a mutiny at the company over that game". Williams explained that the game [...] "just made us all feel icky. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> violence, and it was realistic violence. We all knew there was no way we could explain away that game. There was no way to rationalize it. We were crossing a line." ...|$|E

And I noticed people was waiting for certain parts of the record," [...] he says. It was an insight as profound as Ruddy Redwood's dub discovery. The moment when the dancers really got wild was in a song's short instrumental break, when the band would drop out and the rhythm section would get elemental. Forget melody, chorus, songs—it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> groove, building it, keeping it going. Like a string theorist, Herc zeroed in on the fundamental vibrating loop {{at the heart of the}} record, the break.|$|E

Supervising producer Josh Singer later noted how [...] "August" [...] helped them write the rest of the season, [...] "There was one episode, 'August', which <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Observers, that I feel was mythology without being mythology. And somehow, in working that episode, we sort of found a new creative vein. And it's not that that episode was necessarily so related to everything else we did. But I feel like it sort of opened us up in terms of how we were feeling about the year".|$|E

She said that since the band was from Los Angeles, the [...] "metal capital of the US", {{they thought they were}} making a [...] "pop record with an edge", and were surprised by people's reactions when they were told it was violent and extreme. Love also said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light... I was trying to heal." [...] In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was [...] "posing in a lot of ways" [...] with the album: [...] "It was the truth, but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I'd done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up with the guy with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But I hated it. I'd grown out of it by the time I was seventeen." [...] In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been [...] "consciously self-conscious" [...] when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{wrote that}} [...] "after an underwhelming pre-credits sequence... this sucker moved, {{and lots of}} things happened. [...] We met our four new regulars, {{squeezed}} in useful flashbacks about [...] and even found out the real reason they're on the island ... The flipside of all this business is that 'Confirmed Dead' didn't have the same emotional resonance as ' Beginning of the End'... but you clearly can't have everything in every episode." [...] Times James Poniewozik said that [...] "What amazed [...] about this episode was the economy and precision with which it introduced... {{the crew of the}} downed chopper from [...] [...] Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet {{by the end of the}} episode, I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly thought that [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] "was downright alive with fascinating new characters, mind-blowing new possibilities, and exciting new theory fodder"; however, he had heard complaints from others who received the preview screeners that they found the episode to be flawed. [...] They considered the scene where 815 is found to be cheating the flashback formula because Daniel only experiences it by watching it on television, Frank's safe landing of the helicopter to be a mystery, Naomi's flashback to be cheating Lost rules because she is dead and Ben's manipulation of Locke to be an overused storyline. [...] E!'s Kristin Dos Santos exclaimed [...] "hot damn!" [...] in response to the scene where 815 is found in the Sunda Trench. [...] She also thought that [...] "Juliet and Kate giggling at Jack's 'wink thing' was hilarious" [...] and it was [...] "awesome to see [...] again". [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard highlighted [...] "watching Dan's landing from his point of view. [...] You can feel his panic as he's free-falling through the air, looks up at his parachute, looks down to see himself about to hit the trees... it was amazing." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott gave [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] an 8/10, writing that it [...] "isn't a disappointing episode by any means but it definitely suffers from being a 'setup' episode for these four new characters" [...] and praising the new actors by writing that [...] "Leung does an adequate job of getting Miles' arrogant brand of confidence across while Davies presents Faraday's awkward mannerisms well. [...] Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] "Watching 'Confirmed Dead' was like watching my dream episode of Lost [...] people asked direct questions for once... this episode <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Freighties." [...] A day after the original broadcast, BuddyTV's Dahl claimed that [...] " [...] on an epic journey, one that has been as entertaining and engrossing as any TV series has ever been". In contrast, TV Guides Michael Ausiello of [...] said that it [...] "was thirty-one flavors of awesome... the negatives outweighed the positives". [...] He had problems with Claire's lack of grief for Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) death and Jack waiting so long to find out the freighter folk's main objective. [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] three out of five stars, calling it [...] "so-so", but commenting that [...] "the new revelations in the episode are fairly startling and provide a momentary distraction from the frustrations." ...|$|E

2500|$|Until the 1980s, {{most large}} {{newspapers}} were printed with turn-of-the-century [...] "letterpress" [...] technology using easily smudged oil-based ink, off-white, low-quality [...] "newsprint" [...] paper, and coarse engraving screens. While letterpresses produced legible text, the photoengraving dots that formed pictures often bled or smeared and became fuzzy and indistinct. In this way, even when newspapers used photographs well— a good crop, a respectable size— murky reproduction often left readers re-reading the caption {{to see what}} the photo <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> Wall Street Journal adopted stippled hedcuts in 1979 to publish portraits and avoid the limitations of letterpress printing.

2500|$|In 1989 {{the death}} of Emperor Hirohito officially brought Japan’s postwar period to an end. The {{category}} of [...] "postwar", born out of the cataclysmic events of 1945, had until that time been the major defining image of what contemporary Japanese poetry <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> (<b>The</b> New Modernism, 2010). [...] For poets standing at that border, poetry had to be reinvented just as Japan as a nation began reinventing itself. But while this was essentially a sense of creativity and liberation from militarist oppression, reopening the gates to new form and experimentation, this new boundary crossed in 1989 presented quite a different problem, {{and in a sense}} cut just as deeply into the sense of poetic and national identity. The basic grounding “postwar”, with its dependence on the stark differentiation between a Japan before and after the atomic bomb, was no longer available. Identity was no longer so clearly defined (The New Modernism, 2010) [...] In 1990, a most loved and respected member of Japan’s avant-garde and a bridge between Modernist and Post-Modern practice unexpectedly died. Yoshioka Minoru, the very embodiment of what the postwar period meant to Japanese poetry, had influenced virtually all of the younger experimental poets, and received the admiration even of those outside the bounds of that genre (The New Modernism, 2010). The event shocked and dazed Japan’s poetry community, rendering the confusion and loss of direction all the more graphic and painful. [...] Already the limits of “postwar” were being exceeded in the work of Hiraide Takashi and Inagawa Masato. These two poets were blurring the boundary between poetry and criticism, poetry and prose, and questioning conventional ideas of what comprised the modern in Japan (The New Modernism, 2010). [...] Statistically there are about two thousand poets and more than two hundred poetry magazines in Japan today. [...] The poets are divided into five groups: (1) a group publishing the magazine, Vou, under the flag of new humanism; (2) Jikon or time, with neo-realism as their motto, trying to depict the gap between reality and the socialistic ideal as simply as possible; (3) the Communist group; (4) Rekitei or progress, mixing Chinese Han poetry and the traditional Japanese lyric, and (5) Arechi or waste land (Sugiyama, 254).|$|E

2500|$|In late October 2001 Superheist {{embarked}} {{on their first}} US tour. With US management duties taken up by Gary Avila or Bigtime Management Paparoach the band based themselves in West Hollywood. Their first live show was a showcase at SIR Studios in Hollywood {{in front of a}} packed room full of record company executives and journalists. Superheist had come to America with a huge hype, and the industry was out in force to see what the buzz <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> band played a tight and energetic set. The onlookers suitably impressed. Over the next few weeks a bidding war began for the signature of the band and a US record deal. With commitments back in Australia, the band left America a flew home on 5 September 2001. On 11 September 2001 a devastating terrorist attack on New York’s twin towers effectively all negotiations and communication with perspective record labels was lost until February 2002. By then all the interest in signing Superheist was gone. This was a defining moment for Supeheist. The band felt they had missed their calling. Unrest set in amongst some members. Even still, song writing continued. Norton moving the sound away from [...] "rap rock" [...] to a more straight rock metal sound. This did not sit well with vocalist Berger. Further strain on the relationship occurred as Berger distanced himself from the band. In a board meeting set up by management Berger stated he would [...] "only play the big shows and the band would be dropped by the record company should he decide to leave". In mid-November Superheist was set to hit the road with the launch of the Channel V Music Bus. The night before the tour was to begin, the band was played a warm-up show at an all ages event at Berwick youth centre. Mcleod claimed to be unwell on the night and refused to go on stage, the event was sold out and Superheist refused set to cancel the show at the last minute. The band desperately looked for a fill in vocalist. They first approached Wes from Another Race and then finally Joey Biro from one of the earlier supports, From the Inside, not only did Joey know all the Superheist songs, delivered an amazing performance that shocked the crowd and the band. Berger refuse to go on the Channel V Music Bus tour so Superheist invited Joey Biro to be his replacement for the shows. The next few days Biro stayed on with the band and launched the channel V music bus through regional Victoria and NSW. With live national TV broadcasts revealing a fill in singer and shocking fans across the country. During the chaotic week, played out on national television, it became clear {{to the rest of the}} band that McLeod no longer shared the commitment and enthusiasm and the band no longer trusted him as their lead singer. He was given a final ultimatum and after consultation with management and record label was fired from the band and replaced by Biro that same week. In 2002 Superheist was to play every major festival in Australia including a main stage slot on the coveted BIG DAY OUT. The shows were a huge success with Biro winning over the fans with his heartfelt performances and powerful voice.|$|E
