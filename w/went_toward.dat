5|$|Bishop Swinefield was {{concerned}} {{to ensure that}} his clergy were well treated. He worked to ensure that churches within his diocese were not misappropriated through the granting of custody to unworthy candidates, and was vigilant over monastic houses. His main efforts, though, <b>went</b> <b>toward</b> securing the canonisation of his predecessor Thomas de Cantilupe. This did not however take place until 1320, after Swinefield's death.|$|E
5|$|On the 150th anniversary (1856–2006) of the university’s founding, Seton Hall {{initiated}} the Ever Forward capital campaign {{to raise a}} total of $150million.

The funds were directed to many areas throughout the university, however a majority <b>went</b> <b>toward</b> building and reconstructing campus facilities and historic sites.|$|E
5|$|After {{some months}} of travel, Heraclius entered Constantinople in triumph and {{was met by}} the people of the city, his son Heraclius Constantine, and Patriarch Sergius, prostrating {{themselves}} in joy. His alliance with the Persians resulted in the recovery of the Holy Sponge which fastened to the True Cross in an elaborate ceremony on 14 September 629. The ceremonial parade <b>went</b> <b>toward</b> the Hagia Sophia. There, the True Cross was slowly raised up until it vertically towered over the high altar. To many, this was a sign that a new golden age was about to begin for the Byzantine Empire.|$|E

It was recorded in September 1981 at a free benefit concert in Central Park, New York City, where the pair performed in front of more than 500,000 people. Proceeds <b>went</b> <b>toward</b> the redevelopment and maintenance of the park, which had deteriorated {{due to lack of}} municipal funding. The concert and album marked the start of a short-lived reunion for Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} fringe of Macedonia, {{which is now}} part of Albania, Jovan Vladimir was remembered as a saintly ruler, cut down by his father-in-law, an emperor, who {{believed}} some slander that he was a womanizer. The enraged emperor, accompanied by soldiers, found Vladimir on a mountain pass named Qafë Thanë (also known as Derven), on the road between the Macedonian town of Struga and Elbasan. He struck his son-in-law with a sword, but could not cut him. Only when Vladimir gave him his own sword was the emperor able to cut off his head. Vladimir took his severed head and <b>went</b> <b>toward</b> the site of his future church. There stood an oak, under which he fell after the tree bowed down before him. The saint was interred in the church which was subsequently built at that place and dedicated to him.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{increase}} in coin collecting among {{the public in the}} mid-nineteenth century, there arose considerable demand for older American coins. Mint Director James Ross Snowden began selling restrikes of Gobrecht dollars and trading them for rare medals (especially those depicting or relating to former President George Washington), which were then added to the Mint's coin collection, then known as a coin cabinet. The money generated from selling the restrikes <b>went</b> <b>toward</b> purchasing new items for the coin cabinet. The restrikes created under Snowden's tenure were likely struck in 1859 and 1860, but the practice was largely halted after the eruption of a public scandal; other Mint employees were creating and selling restrikes of early American coins for their own profit. All Gobrecht dollar restrikes, when tilted on their axis, depict the reverse eagle flying level, rather than upward as it is depicted on the coins struck during the official production run. It is unknown precisely why the orientation of the eagle was altered, though it is believed by many numismatists that Snowden did this intentionally to make restrikes distinguishable from originals. Numismatic historian Walter Breen suggests that Snowden simply used the alignment because that was the same used on the Flying Eagle cent, which began production in 1856. Mint Engraver James B. Longacre, its designer, had borrowed Gobrecht and Peale's eagle reverse for the one-cent coin's obverse.|$|E

25|$|Russian {{capital was}} {{invested}} in trade through the Baltic countries, including Latvia. Some of those profits <b>went</b> <b>toward</b> establishing a Russian-owned industry. By {{the middle of}} the 19th century, the developing industry began to attract Russian workers. The influx of Russian peasantry had also continued, seeking less socially and religiously oppressive conditions within the empire owing to the certain degree of autonomy accorded the Baltic provinces, which were not subject to all the same laws {{as the rest of the}} Russian Empire. While the Russian nobility also established a presence, administrative control remained in the hands of the Baltic Germans.|$|E

25|$|The IceHogs had {{a shorter}} {{off-season}} than usual {{due to their}} major league affiliate, the Chicago Blackhawks, having an extended 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs and winning the Stanley Cup. Head coach Ted Dent believed Rockford would have to develop new top scorers to replace those who left the team. Nevertheless, much of the focus in off-season practices <b>went</b> <b>toward</b> defense and discipline, particularly on avoiding taking penalties. The IceHogs played a pair of preseason exhibition away games, starting with a 2–1 victory over the Chicago Wolves on September 25. Jared Brown and Matt Lowry both scored for Rockford, but were nevertheless released from the team the next day. The IceHogs lost the preseason finale 2–1 to the Milwaukee Admirals on September 27, which Winchester scoring the team's only goal. The game went to a shootout, where nobody from either team scored until Milwaukee's Mathieu Tousignant in the tenth round.|$|E

The season also marked the first losing season for the Aggies after 21 years. In the 2004 season, Franchione attempted the rebuilding process as the team improved to a 7–5 record, and a 5–3 record in conference play, including a 35–34 overtime loss to unranked Baylor, ending a 13-game winning streak the Aggies had over Baylor and a 32–25 overtime win over the then #25 Texas Tech at Kyle Field, snapping a 3-game skid to the Red Raiders. The Aggies ended up advancing to the Cotton Bowl Classic to play #17 Tennessee, but lost 38–7. Following the bowl game, A officials extended Franchione's contract through 2012 and raised his salary to $2 million. In June 2005, prior to the 2005 season, Franchione donated $1 million to the A athletic department. The donation <b>went</b> <b>toward</b> {{the construction of an}} indoor practice facility, which is now located adjacent to Kyle Field.|$|E
25|$|As Price {{pitched in}} the fourth game, the start in game 5 went to Marcus Stroman, who opposed Cole Hamels {{for the second time}} in the ALDS. Texas got out to a 1–0 lead quickly, scoring in the first inning. In the third inning, Shin-Soo Choo hit a solo home run, giving Texas a two-run lead. The Jays responded in the bottom of the third, with Jose Bautista {{doubling}} in Ben Revere. In the sixth inning, Edwin Encarnacion hit a home run to tie the game at 2–2. In the seventh inning, controversy arose when Russell Martin attempted to throw the ball back to pitcher Aaron Sanchez. The ball hit the bat of Shin-Soo Choo, and <b>went</b> <b>toward</b> third base. Rougned Odor, who was at third base, scored the go-ahead run on the play, though initially home plate umpire Dale Scott rules the ball dead. After a lengthy delay, which included Toronto fans throwing beer cans and plastic bottles onto the field, the call was upheld, and Texas took a 3–2 lead. Shortly afterward, Toronto manager John Gibbons informed the umpires that the team would play the rest of the game under protest. In the bottom half of the seventh inning, the Texas defence would commit three errors, which loaded the bases with no outs. After Ben Revere grounded out, Josh Donaldson tied the game with a bloop single to right field. With runners on first and third and two outs in the inning, Jose Bautista hit a go-ahead three-run home run to take a commanding 6–3 lead. Bautista flipped his bat after he scored the home run, which later became viral on social media. Roberto Osuna came on to close the game with a five-out save, becoming the second-youngest pitcher in MLB history to record a postseason save by sealing the 6–3 victory.|$|E
