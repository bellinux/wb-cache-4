5|$|A {{number of}} the Khawarij met in Mecca and {{discussed}} the 659 Battle of Nahrawan, at which former supporters of Ali had rebelled against him for agreeing to discuss {{the leadership of the}} community with Muawiyah.

The assassination attempts were to occur simultaneously as the three leaders came to lead morning prayer in their respective cities of Damascus, Fustat and Kufa. The method <b>was</b> <b>to</b> come out of the prayer ranks and strike the targets with a sword dipped in poison.|$|E

5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J.

Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.|$|E

5|$|At Wardour Street {{station a}} branch <b>was</b> <b>to</b> leave the main route and head south-east, {{to connect to}} the DR's deep-level line east of its station at Charing Cross. Wardour Street station was planned to have {{platforms}} on both branches. The south-west extension to Walham Green was retained with minor alterations. The new route <b>was</b> <b>to</b> branch from the original route east of Brompton Road station, which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have platforms on both routes. Stations were planned along Fulham Road at its junctions with College Street (now Elystan Street), Neville Street, Drayton Gardens, Redcliffe Gardens, Stamford Bridge and Maxwell Road. The route would interchange with the DR at Walham Green {{before coming to the}} surface and running parallel with the DR as far as Parsons Green, beyond which the line <b>was</b> <b>to</b> connect to the DR. The requests for an extension of time and for the powers to build the DR deep-level line from South Kensington to Earl's Court were re-presented. As the B and the GN were now in common ownership, the bill also sought powers to enable the companies to merge and for the B to change its name.|$|E

The plan was for the rebels to split into three groups. One group <b>was</b> <b>to</b> infiltrate the infantry barracks, kill French NCOs in their beds and raise support amongst the Vietnamese troops; a second, which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> include the external VNQDD members, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> fight {{its way into the}} post headquarters, while the third group would enter the officers' quarters.
