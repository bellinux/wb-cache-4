5|$|In 2008, Ham-Kam {{tried to}} sell the naming rights of the stadium for between NOK5 and 8 million per year, but neither of their main sponsors, Eidsiva Energi and Sparebanken Hedmark, were interested. The first stage of the stadium opened on 10 August 2008, after which further {{construction}} was terminated. Stage one cost NOK92.5 million to build and NOK19 million for purchase of real estate. By April 2010, BG had combined negative assets, debt and received grants of NOK240 million. Of this, NOK78 million was <b>written-off</b> bad debts to BE1 and NOK19 million was purchase of lots. On 25 September 2009, Hamar Municipality bought HSA, BG, BIP and BE1 for NOK73,000. In December 2009, the municipality increased the share capital in BG with NOK16 million and in BE1 with NOK32 million.|$|E
25|$|Aer Lingus has had 12 incidents, {{including}} six accidents which left aircraft <b>written-off</b> (of which three were fatal) and one hijacking.|$|E
25|$|The Lockheed 1049E Super Constellation was {{registered}} PH-LKT and christened Neutron. With {{a construction}} number of 4504, the aircraft first flew in 1953 and accumulated 11,867 hours of flight. After Flight 844, Neutron was <b>written-off.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Redhens {{were built}} in three batches. The overall design of the railcars was very similar, but there were {{differences}} in detail between the batches. Several railcars in the 300 class were re-numbered later in life, taking on the numbers of <b>written-off</b> or modified units.|$|E
25|$|On 3 June 1984, a Nimrod MR2 XV257 {{stationed}} at RAF St Mawgan suffered extensive damage when a reconnaissance flare ignited in the bomb bay during flight. The aircraft successfully returned to base but was subsequently <b>written-off</b> due to fire damage. There were no casualties.|$|E
25|$|Including the {{prototype}} SN 600, {{a total of}} eight Corvettes are recorded as having been <b>written-off</b> in crashes. The worst loss {{of life in a}} Corvette crash was on 3 September 1979, when an SN 601 of Sterling Airways crashed in the Mediterranean Sea off Nice following a double engine failure. All ten occupants were killed.|$|E
25|$|Captain-class frigates {{acted in}} {{the roles of}} convoy escorts, anti-submarine warfare vessels, coastal forces control frigates and {{headquarters}} ships for the Normandy landings. During the course of World War II this class participated in the sinking of at least 34 German submarines {{and a number of}} other hostile craft; 15 of the 78 Captain-class frigates were either sunk or <b>written-off</b> as a constructive total loss.|$|E
25|$|These {{locomotives}} {{were converted}} from Class 31 locomotives. The first, no. 97203, was {{operated by the}} Railway Technical Centre, based at Derby. It was used to haul various test-trains operated by the centre. However, in 1987, the locomotive was <b>written-off</b> after having sustained fire damage. Therefore, a replacement {{in the form of}} 97204 was converted. This later returned to normal traffic, as no. 31970. Both locomotives were painted in RTC's red/cream livery with a black bodyside band.|$|E
25|$|Two of the Royal Flying Corps' early Bristol Scout C aircraft, numbers 1609 and 1611, {{flown by}} Captain Lanoe Hawker with No. 6 Squadron RFC, were each, in their turn – as 1609 was <b>written-off</b> from combat damage, 1611 {{received}} its gun mount hardware as its replacement—armed with a Lewis machine {{gun on the}} left side of the fuselage, almost identical to the manner of the rifles tried on the second Scout B, using a mount that Hawker had designed. When Hawker downed two German aircraft and forced off a third on 25 July 1915 over Passchendaele and Zillebeke he was awarded the first-ever Victoria Cross for the actions of a British single-seat military scout/fighter pilot in aerial combat against an enemy's heavier-than-air aircraft, following the earlier VC awards to William Rhodes-Moorhouse (flying a B.E.2 two-seat observation biplane) and Reginald Warneford (flying against an enemy Zeppelin) in April and June 1915 respectively.|$|E
500|$|Observing {{that the}} {{concentration}} of facilities, aircraft and personnel, at any relatively small military airfield, made it more vulnerable to enemy attack, Wilson began to consider dispersing some subordinate units. Following reports, on 27 January, that the formidable Japanese combined carrier fleet had entered the Flores Sea, Wilson ordered the dispersal of assets at RAAF Darwin. Repair and maintenance equipment and staff were moved to Daly Waters, almost [...] further south. [...] However, when Wilson also ordered the transfer of obsolete aircraft (five CAC Wirraway armed trainers belonging to No. 12 Squadron RAAF) to Daly Waters, he was overruled by the Deputy Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock. (Three of the Wirraways were damaged and <b>written-off</b> following the first air raid on Darwin.) At around the same time, Wilson ordered the arrest of a civilian suspected of signalling enemy vessels using an improvised signal lamp, from a location near RAAF Darwin.|$|E
2500|$|... #2: Raced by Johansson at Rio, Imola, Spa, Monaco, Detroit, Paul Ricard, Silverstone, Hockenheim, and Hungaroring. The car was <b>written-off</b> in {{practice}} at Österreichring by Johansson, after a deer struck the car, and crashed.|$|E
2500|$|... #3: Raced by Alain Prost at Rio, Imola, Spa, Monaco, Detroit, and Paul Ricard. Car {{modified}} for Johansson {{for race}} use at Österreichring. It was originally a spare car at Mexico, but then raced by Johansson, but <b>written-off</b> in 1st-lap accident.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 September 1987, KC-10A {{serial number}} 82-0190 was {{undergoing}} maintenance {{on the ground}} at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana and suffered an explosion and subsequent fire. [...] The KC-10 was significantly damaged and <b>written-off.</b> [...] One member of the ground crew, Sgt. Joseph M. Burgio died in the fire.|$|E
2500|$|... 97401 was a Class 46 'Peak' locomotive, {{bought by}} the Derby-based Railway Technical Centre {{straight}} from British Rail service in 1984. This locomotive did not receive its allocated departmental number and retained its original number of 46009. It was used in a high-publicity test, to prove the safety of rail transported nuclear flasks. The locomotive was deliberately crashed into a container at [...] Whilst the locomotive was <b>written-off,</b> the flask was undamaged.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{people who}} use {{simulator}} software, especially flight simulator software, build their own simulator at home. Some people—to further the realism of their homemade simulator—buy used cards and racks that run the same software used by the original machine. [...] While this involves solving the problem of matching hardware and software—and the problem that hundreds of cards plug into many different racks—many still find that solving these problems is well worthwhile. Some are so serious about realistic simulation that they will buy real aircraft parts, like complete nose sections of <b>written-off</b> aircraft, at aircraft boneyards. This permits people to simulate a hobby that {{they are unable to}} pursue in real life.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, {{several of}} the Anglia fleet were {{withdrawn}} following mishaps. For example, nos. 86220, 86221 and 86237 were withdrawn in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively, following transformer failures. Another machine, no. 86252 was <b>written-off</b> in 2002 after catching fire near Colchester on 1 December 2001 whilst no. 86257 was withdrawn in 2003 due to its general bad condition. These locomotives were replaced by locomotives made redundant from Virgin CrossCountry (nos. 86234/242) or West Coast (nos. 86209/260) franchises. Another locomotive, no. 86227 was reinstated to traffic in 2002 after being stored for many years. It was repainted in a variation of Anglia's turquoise livery, with a large Union Flag painted on the side, and named [...] "Golden Jubilee" [...] to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II's 50th anniversary of reign.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, several Class 86 {{locomotives}} {{have been}} involved in accidents. The most serious of these was the Watford Junction rail crash 23-Jan-1975 (between Bushey and Watford Junction), when no. 86209 collided head-on with Class 83 no. 83003. [...] The Class 86 was seriously damaged after falling down an embankment, coming to rest in a field (now the site of the Colne Valley Retail Park). It was eventually recovered several weeks later by road. Surprisingly, given the seriousness of the incident, it was authorised for repairs and later returned to service. Also in 1975, nos. 86006 and 86242 were involved in the Nuneaton rail crash. Both were later repaired. Another serious accident was the Colwich rail crash in 1986, when nos. 86211 and 86429 were involved in a head-on collision. Both locomotives were <b>written-off</b> and subsequently scrapped.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of the Anglia Railways, Virgin Trains and EWS fleets, Freightliner is now the main operator of the class. As of January 2005, it has an operational fleet of 19 locomotives, with several more in [...] "warm-storage", which are capable of being returned to traffic. In the last few years, several locomotives have been withdrawn from service, mainly due to the influx of new Class 66 diesel locomotives, although two locomotives (nos. 86611/631) were <b>written-off</b> following the Norton Bridge rail crash, and another three (nos. 86615/620/621) have been withdrawn following fire damage and subsequently scrapped too. In addition, Freightliner's Class 90 fleet, which were previously hired to passenger operators Virgin Trains and Anglia Railways have now all returned to the company, thus reducing the requirement for the Class 86 fleet. However, the class does still remain in use with the company, with Freightliner retaining a core fleet of 14 locomotives in service as of 2017, ensuring the class has been in service well over 53 years after first being introduced. Two locomotives (nos. 86622 and 86637) have been repainted in Freightliner Powerhaul Livery.|$|E
