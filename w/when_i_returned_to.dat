25|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> IP in 1962 as {{president}} and editor-in-chief the house faced bankruptcy. Its publishing program had practically ceased, its debt to the publishers' services was so great without any prospect of payment in sight that the printers refused to undertake new work and the binders refused to release our books in stock. Fortunately, Trachty had some reserve funds that I drew upon immediately. I also arranged small loans {{from a number of}} our devoted readers. I also sent out an unprecedented appeal for donations to keep the publishing house going. We were thus able to meet the payroll and office expenses, and also to pay off enough of our debt to resume publishing.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the hall, {{carrying}} my bag, I found Audrey there.|$|E
60|$|I hurried away. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Simla I told Mrs. Awksby of my discoveries, {{and spoke}} of the armchair.|$|E
5000|$|Even though I am thin, {{the empire}} is getting fattened. Every time Xiao Song made reports to me, he {{followed}} my desires, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the palace {{and think about}} the empire, I cannot sleep well. Han often criticized and tried <b>to</b> correct me. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the palace {{and think about the}} empire, I sleep well. I use Han Xiu for the state.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{assure you}} quite disembarrassed of any attentions whatever. But, <b>I</b> suppose, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Athens, <b>I</b> must get Platonic again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The count smiled. [...] "Whoever you are, you are shrewd and bold, young sir. I shall doubtless see you <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Paris." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the drawing-room, Aunt Emma {{sat there}} on the sofa, crying silently, the very picture of misery.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> {{the pilot}} house {{to report the}} good news to my {{companion}} {{he handed me a}} paper.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> her again, I had a faint, painful {{impression}} as of a buckle slipped, so coldly {{she returned}} the packet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will go in}} a woman's robe to all {{services}} of the Church if I may be permitted, but I will resume the other dress <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> my cell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>when</b> {{his glass}} had been {{refilled}} by the storekeeper, [...] "what <b>I</b> shall say <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Montevideo, and am asked what news {{there is in}} the country?" ...|$|R
60|$|You {{can think}} this over, and talk it over; and I will join you in doing so, please God, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> our Italian bowers, which I shall be heartily glad to do.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> camp my comrades were at breakfast. Romer {{appeared}} vastly {{relieved to}} see that I had not taken a gun with me.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> my palace I {{found that}} the rumor already had reached Dejah Thoris, so I told her all that I had heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely {{my choice}} was {{the choice of}} a virtuous girl? And yet the day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> my needle was the fatal day of my life.|$|E
60|$|And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Lily, {{she tells}} me that she cannot trust me. She has watched me with those others. She knows me for a gad-about. Her gentle face is full of pain.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a noble pursuit," [...] said Uncle Chris firmly. [...] "Worthy of {{the great}} nation that has {{produced}} it. No doubt, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> America, <b>I</b> shall have opportunities of recovering my lost skill." ...|$|R
60|$|CAESAR (relenting). Well, well: let us try the Lesbian. (The Major-Domo fills Caesar's goblet; then Cleopatra's and Apollodorus's.) But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Rome, <b>I</b> {{will make}} laws against these extravagances. I will {{even get the}} laws carried out.|$|R
60|$|It {{was getting}} on toward evening <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the cottage. Benjamin {{appeared}} to have been on the lookout for me. Before I could ring at the bell he opened the garden gate.|$|E
60|$|I {{attended}} the theatre that night. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> my hotel, a quiet man in dark clothes, who seemed interested in rubbing his finger nails with a silk handkerchief, appeared, magically, at my side.|$|E
60|$|But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> America I {{met with}} a great disappointment: my glowing anticipations were not realized. I could find {{scarcely}} any one who cared to know what I had seen, heard, or done.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said de Lescure, [...] "I have {{at length}} {{acquired}} {{the privilege of}} shedding my blood in the cause; {{but it is only}} a broken arm; Victorine will have a little trouble with me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Clisson." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These hats are all {{the rage}} in England just now," [...] he said airily, [...] "but they have had their day, do you not think so, Monsieur? <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> town, <b>I</b> shall have to devote my whole mind to the {{invention}} of a new headgear..." ...|$|R
6000|$|Winston laughed. [...] "Can't {{we leave}} my virtues, or the reverse, {{out of the}} question? I feel that I am right, and want you to dissuade your uncle. It would be even better if, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Winnipeg, you would empower me to buy wheat for you." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the road, {{after this}} breathing, Anneke [7] had disappeared, and I was so shy and silly {{as not to}} ask her family name from Caesar the Great, or Pompey the Little.|$|E
60|$|It {{was past}} one {{o'clock in the}} morning <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the hotel, yet the porter who {{admitted}} me pointed toward the figure of a man who stood waiting in the dimly lit hall.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> {{that scene}} of carnage Pierre had already {{gathered}} a goodly assortment of accouterments from those men whose bodies {{had not been}} mangled, for even he shrank from dyeing his hands with blood.|$|E
60|$|I have ceased exercising. As long as I {{remain in}} the room, the {{hallucination}} does not bother me. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the room after an absence, he is always there, sitting at the desk, writing. Yet I dare not confide in a physician. I must fight this out by myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] said Hadden, {{with a shrug}} of his shoulders; [...] "then I {{hope that}} Sompseu, or the Queen's Induna, or both of them, will pay me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> my own country. Meanwhile I will obey you because I must, but I should first like {{to make you a}} present." ...|$|R
60|$|Sad as this estrangement is, {{there is}} one consolation--so far as I am concerned, it will not last. My father and I are sure, sooner or later, {{to come to an}} {{understanding}} together. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the rectory, <b>I</b> shall make my peace with him, and we shall get on again as smoothly as ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a {{big black}} brute that was!" [...] said Charlie, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> him. [...] "Well, look here, I've just done a poem; did it instead of playing dominoes after lunch. May I read it?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the farm, it was evening. The lamp {{was not yet}} lighted in the hall. Pausing to accustom {{my eyes to the}} obscurity indoors, I {{heard the}} voice of the lawyer whom we had {{employed}} for the defense speaking to some one very earnestly.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Arden, I gave Walkirk {{an outline}} of what had occurred, but I did not go into details, having no desire that the preposterous idea which had gotten into the head of Miss Laniston should enter that of my under-study. Walkirk was not in good spirits.|$|E
6000|$|... 4. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> my cold home, you ask [...] 25 Why I am not as I {{have ever}} been. YOU spoil {{me for the}} task Of acting a forced part in life's dull scene,-- Of wearing on my brow the idle mask Of author, great or mean, [...] 30 In the world's carnival. I sought Peace thus, and but in you I found it not.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{hear that}} you have been putting down your carriage. I do not give you money to hoard in a bank, but I give it to you that you may keep up a fitting {{appearance}} with it. Let me {{hear that you}}r carriage is back in the coach-house <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Paris. Junot, you rascal, I hear {{that you have been}} gambling and losing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then so shall it be," [...] Wulf said, [...] "I {{shall see}} my Lord Harold before I start, and will {{tell him that}} you are minded to be my man, and that I am minded so to take you. He will not object, I am sure, but it were best to ask him, since, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> court, <b>I</b> shall have you about me." ...|$|R
