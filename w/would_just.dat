5|$|When BSkyB publicised their {{intentions}} {{to take over}} Manchester United, supporters reacted furiously to the news. The majority felt the club’s traditions, built on a loyal fan base and great teams including the Busby Babes and currently Fergie's Fledglings <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be tarnished forever. United were no longer an independent entity, and major decisions affecting the club looked increasingly likely to be taken {{on the other side}} of the globe.|$|E
5|$|It was the Ottomans' {{skill with}} {{dealing with their}} opponents that made them very {{powerful}} very quickly. They would subjugate their opponents as vassals rather than destroy them, otherwise they would have exhausted themselves in the process. The exacting of tribute from conquered states {{in the form of}} children and money was effective in forcing subjugation over conquest. Coupled with this, the entire region was composed of many states (Bulgaria, Serbia, Latin states) who <b>would</b> <b>just</b> as soon fight each other as the Ottomans and realized too late that the Ottoman forces defeated them by integrating them in a network of subordinate states.|$|E
5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it <b>would</b> <b>just</b> stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E
60|$|At {{first she}} thought it <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> like {{holidays}} all the time, she <b>would</b> feel <b>just</b> free. Her soul was in chaos, blinded suffering, maimed. She had no will left to think about herself. For a time she must just lapse.|$|R

5000|$|The houses {{would take}} {{advantage}} of a range of new technologies and processes involving prefabrication and off-site assembly. This would reduce the construction time, but also reduce waste and energy in the transportation of materials to site. Each house would have a timber frame. The cladding panel would mean that waste was reduced to just 15% during manufacturing. The structure <b>would</b> take <b>just</b> one week to manufacture in the factory before travelling to site. The external element of the building <b>would</b> take <b>just</b> two days to form the shell, without the need for any scaffolding. The interior of the building <b>would</b> take <b>just</b> two weeks to complete. The first houses went up for sale in Spring 2007.|$|R
5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses. With the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state <b>would</b> <b>just</b> observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.|$|E
25|$|Donations for {{the statue}} poured in {{from around the}} country and, when it was finally erected, Sir Henry's son, Sir Henry Havelock-Allan, paid his first visit to Sunderland and met Gourley. The pair <b>would,</b> <b>just</b> a few years later, jointly {{represent}} in Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Reputedly, {{heat damage}} {{is the most}} {{widespread}} and common problem found in wines. It often goes unnoticed because of the prevalence of the problem, consumers don't know it's possible, and most often <b>would</b> <b>just</b> chalk the problem up to poor quality, or other factors.|$|E

25|$|During the tag team {{revival of}} the group the routine was {{truncated}} so that Triple H would say his part while Michaels would take Billy Gunn's lines to conclude it.

25|$|The Touchstone Energy 300 {{was held}} April 24 at Talladega Superspeedway. Ken Schrader won the pole. The Big One {{happened}} midway in the race, with pole-sitter Schrader crashing and erupting in flames in Turn 1, also taking many other cars out. Schrader was uninjured. Terry Labonte <b>would</b> <b>just</b> barely edge Joe Nemechek in the closest finish of NASCAR Busch Series history.|$|E
25|$|This type of {{classification}} displays {{information about the}} artifact via the object's display. Stylistic typology {{is not to be}} confused with classification of certain styles, for that <b>would</b> <b>just</b> entail organizing artifacts based on how they look. This type of typology accounts for information told through the artifact. Pottery is an example of a stylistic typology because the artifacts provide information on artistic evolution.|$|E

50|$|Offensively, Ryan Smyth {{would lead}} the club with 23 goals, 36 assists and 59 points. Radek Dvorak <b>would</b> finish <b>just</b> behind Smyth with 50 points, while Ethan Moreau and Raffi Torres would each score 20 goals. Marc-Andre Bergeron {{would lead the}} defense with 9 goals and 26 points, while Eric Brewer <b>would</b> finish <b>just</b> behind him with seven goals and 25 points. Georges Laraque would lead the club in penalty minutes, with 99.|$|R

25|$|Upon launch, Central's {{on screen}} {{presentation}} featured a sphere (which resembled a moon or a total eclipse) which would burst open with light, before reforming, {{accompanied by a}} light jingle, but was dropped and revised during 1983, so the moon ident <b>would</b> <b>just</b> appear of darkness with the colour spectrum appearing to its left hand side. This ident was dropped locally in 1985, but remained {{on the front and}} end of networked programmes until 1988.|$|E
25|$|Changmarín {{used his}} {{writings}} as his main weapon for resistance. For years, he used politically charged décimas as means {{to educate the}} people about identity and the struggle at hand. Que se vayan del Canal (I wish they <b>would</b> <b>just</b> leave from the Canal) and Quiero Sembrar un Maíz (I want to plant corn in the Canal Zone) were the songs of the protests against the constant abuse by the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{developing}} emulation technology raises ethical issues related to animal welfare and artificial consciousness. The neuroscience required to develop brain emulation would require animal experimentation, first on invertebrates and then on small mammals {{before moving on to}} humans. Sometimes the animals <b>would</b> <b>just</b> need to be euthanized in order to extract, slice, and scan their brains, but sometimes behavioral and in vivo measures would be required, which might cause pain to living animals.|$|E

25|$|Attendance did {{not improve}} as the season progressed, in fact, it got much worse, {{averaging}} an announced 5,703. The two playoff games drew 2,836 and 3,340 respectively, even after the team launched their SOS (Save Our Soccer) campaign late in the season. Losses for the season were pegged in the $500,000 range. This led too many wondering {{if there would be}} a next season, or if the owner <b>would</b> <b>just</b> pull the plug.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} two decades of RTÉ 2, little {{original}} drama was produced for the channel; often RTÉ <b>would</b> <b>just</b> repeat their dramas on the channel such as Fair City and Glenroe. RTÉ did place some emphasis on short film in the RTÉ 2 series Short Cuts. Short films remain on RTÉ 2 most Monday nights at 11:30; these shorts are not just taken from RTÉ co-financed productions but also from independent producers around the world.|$|E
25|$|A canal {{joining a}} river which is {{normally}} below it, but which can rise above it (at very high tides, or after heavy rain). One pair of gates {{can be made}} bidirectional, i.e. the inward-pointing gates would be supplemented by a pair pointing out to the river. When the river {{is higher than the}} canal, the normal gates <b>would</b> <b>just</b> drift open, but the additional pair of gates can be closed to protect the canal, and prevent navigation to the river. In effect, we have simply added a flood gate.|$|E

25|$|The 350-16 had an {{interesting}} bug where, occasionally, the machine <b>would</b> <b>just</b> freeze entirely and not even boot up if turned off and on at the mains. Although it would power on, the BIOS just didn't start. The solution was {{to turn on the}} machine at the mains and hold down the power button for 30 seconds, at which point it would normally start. It was suggested that this was due to an under-valued capacitor in the power circuit. This problem appeared to be resolved in the 350-40, which had a different PSU.|$|E
25|$|Like the 2005–06 {{championship}} season, the Heat were criticized, {{for being}} unable to beat the top-caliber teams of the NBA. This criticism though <b>would</b> <b>just</b> grow {{more and more as}} the regular season was beginning to wind down. Despite beating their division rival Orlando Magic two of three games, sweeping the Lakers 2–0, and beating both the San Antonio Spurs and the Thunder once, they had lost to the defending Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics three times, swept by the Chicago Bulls and Dallas Mavericks who swept the season series and continued their regular season dominance against Miami for their 16th straight victory dating back to the 2004–05 season.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who were}} {{considered}} Mischlinge were generally restricted in their options of partners and marriage. Mischlinge of first degree generally needed permission to marry, and usually only to other Mischlinge or Jewish-classified persons; however, a {{marriage to a}} Jewish-classified person would re-categorize the Mischling as Geltungsjude (Full Jew). After 1942, marriage permissions were generally not granted any more—arguably due to the war—without further notice. Mischlinge of second degree did not need permission to marry a spouse classified as Aryan; however, marriage with Mischlinge of any degree was unwelcome. The reasoning behind this was that a mischling marrying an Aryan would produce a child with an acceptably low amount of Jewish heritage, but a mischling marrying a mischling <b>would</b> <b>just</b> produce another mischling.|$|E

60|$|Stuyvesant {{went out}} to the hen-house, and {{measured}} the height of the loft. He found it to be seven feet. He concluded to have his ladder eight feet long, and to have six cross-bars, one foot apart, the upper and lower cross-bars to be one foot from the ends of the ladder. The cross-bars themselves being about two inches wide each, the breadth of the whole six <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> one foot. This Stuyvesant calculated <b>would</b> make <b>just</b> the eight feet.|$|R
