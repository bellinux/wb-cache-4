50|$|Lanolin (from Latin lāna, ‘wool’, and oleum, ‘oil’), {{also called}} <b>wool</b> <b>wax</b> or wool grease, is a wax {{secreted}} by the sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Lanolin used by humans comes from domestic sheep breeds that are raised specifically for their wool. Historically, many pharmacopoeias {{have referred to}} lanolin as wool fat (adeps lanae); however, as lanolin lacks glycerides (glycerol esters), {{it is not a}} true fat. Lanolin primarily consists of sterol esters instead. Lanolin's waterproofing property aids sheep in shedding water from their coats. Certain breeds of sheep produce large amounts of lanolin. There is an inverse correlation between fiber diameter and <b>wool</b> <b>wax</b> content.|$|E

50|$|Cholecalciferol is {{produced}} industrially {{for use in}} vitamin supplements and to fortify foods. As a pharmaceutical drug it is called cholecalciferol (USAN) or colecalciferol (INN, BAN). It {{is produced}} by the ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol extracted from lanolin found in sheep's wool. Cholesterol is extracted from wool grease and <b>wool</b> <b>wax</b> alcohols obtained from the cleaning of wool after shearing. The cholesterol undergoes a four-step process to make 7-dehydrocholesterol, the same compound that is produced in the skin of animals. The 7-dehydrocholesterol is then irradiated with ultraviolet light. Some unwanted isomers are formed during irradiation: these are removed by various techniques, leaving a resin which melts at about room temperature and usually has a potency of 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 International Units per gram.|$|E
40|$|The stable oil-in-water {{emulsion}} contained in wool scouring effluent was destabilised by {{aerobic biological treatment}} {{as the basis of}} a potential new effluent treatment process. The de-emulsified <b>wool</b> <b>wax,</b> which is recalcitrant to biodegradation, can then be readily removed by centrifugation. In 12 -day batch experiments, 97 % of <b>wool</b> <b>wax</b> and 87 % of COD were removed after gentle centrifuging at 200 x g, compared to only 6 % and 8 %, respectively, for sterile controls. Steady-state chemostat experiments under optimum conditions gave essentially complete removal of <b>wool</b> <b>wax</b> and 90 % removal of COD at less than 40 h retention time, and demonstrated that the mechanism of pollutant removal was by bioflocculation rather than aerobic degradation. At 100 L pilot scale, 95 % of <b>wool</b> <b>wax</b> and 82 % of COD were consistently removed over a period of 116 days of continuous operation at 38 h retention time and 30 °C, producing a spadable sludge of 5. 7 mL/g. Variable influent concentration or filamentous bacteria did not disrupt this process and foaming was readily controlled using a mechanical foam breaker. After a shutdown period of 15 days the process could be restarted easily, achieving normal performance within one retention time. The successful operation of the pilot reactor suggests this process could be developed to full scale and incorporated into an overall treatment package...|$|E

40|$|Wool {{scouring}} effluent is {{a highly}} polluted industrial wastewater in which the main pollutant, <b>wool</b> <b>wax,</b> is held in a stable oil-in-water emulsion by non-ionic detergent. The use of microbial action to cause emulsion destabilisation has been proposed as a new treatment strategy for this effluent stream. This strategy aims at improving aerobic treatment performance by physically removing the high-COD, slowly bio-degradable <b>wool</b> <b>wax</b> from the system without bio-degradation. The mechanism by which an aerobic-mixed culture destabilises the wool scouring effluent emulsion was investigated. Our results show that destabilisation is due to partial bio-degradation of both the scouring detergent and the <b>wool</b> <b>wax.</b> Cleavage of the <b>wool</b> <b>wax</b> esters was the first stage in wax degradation, when 40 - 50 % of wax was de-emulsified. Over the same period, detergent degradation was low, at 7 - 21 %. With further incubation, detergent degradation increased, aiding further breakdown of the emulsion. The degradation of the detergent, a nonylphenol ethoxylate, resulted in both a reduction in molar concentration (of up to 82 %) and a shortening of the ethoxylate chain length. The latter reduced the hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) from 12 to approximately 7, thereby reducing {{the ability of the}} residual detergent to stabilise the emulsion. Analysis of the emulsified and de-emulsified wax fractions could not identify a group of compounds that were preferentially de-emulsified based on molecular weight or polarity. These findings will assist in using a de-emulsification strategy in both existing and new treatment systems in order to save on aeration costs and treatment times for biological treatment of this highly polluted wastewater...|$|E
40|$|Within the akin {{of animals}} are {{situated}} various glands which secrete {{their products to}} the outer surface of the skin. The glands exist in many forms and their functions are diverse. A satisfactory classification based on the morphology of the glands has been worked out and the glands of the vertebrata are recognised as belonging to three main types: - holocrine, eccrine and apocrine glands. In man the holocrine glands {{are referred to as}} sebaceous and the eccrine as sudoriferous or sweat glands. These terms are often used also for animals. Comparatively few animal skin glands or secretions have been investigated chemically. The sebaceous secretion of the sheep, <b>wool</b> <b>wax,</b> has been much investigated owing to the commercial value of this product; and the author participated for some years in studies of <b>wool</b> <b>wax</b> at the National Chemical Research Laboratory, Pretoria. In Chapter I is summarised the present knowledge of <b>wool</b> <b>wax</b> chemistry, including contributions from this laboratory into the investigation of dihydric alcohols and hydroxy-acids and the syntheses of iso-acids which occur in <b>wool</b> <b>wax.</b> Skin secretions which have no commercial applications are nevertheless of great interest from a physiological and biochemical point of view. In this respect human skin secretions may naturally attract more attention than those of other animals. Their investigation may prove rewarding in throwing further light upon the studies of dermatological disorders in general, and more particularly upon the all-important problem of skin cancer. A study of human sebaceous secretions was taken up in this laboratory by the author; the aliphatic alcohols and some polycyclic hydrocarbons present were investigated. The chemistry of human sebaceous secretions is reviewed in Chapter II. Chapter III reviews work of other investigators on various skin gland secretions. The "scent" glands of musk deer and other animals and the "preen" glands of some birds have been investigated. Some materials of human origin such as ear wax, which are considered as related to sebaceous secretions, are included in this review. Natural fats and waxes are generally of complex composition and early workers did not succeed in isolating many pure components from such materials. As a result of improved techniques and methods considerable {{progress has been made in}} the last few years towards the elucidation of the fine structures of fats and waxes...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that only one stereoisomeric form, nat-cholesterol, {{naturally}} occurs. Nat-cholesterol and its enantiomer, ent-cholesterol, sometimes show enantiospecific interactions with biological molecules. If cholesterol is naturally found only one form, then the question of “why does cholesterol show an enantiomeric selectivity?” arises. For this purpose, stereoisomer analysis of cholesterol obtained from porcine liver and <b>wool</b> <b>wax</b> were carried out with three different high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems including reversed-phase, reversed-phase with different cyclodextrins as a mobile phase modifier, and chiral. Results from HPLC analysis of both cholesterol samples by permethylated γ-cyclodextrin and amylose tris-(3, 5 -dimethylphenylcarbamate) chiral columns showed {{that there was no}} stereoisomer of cholesterol present. However reversed-phase HPLC analysis of cholesterol samples from porcine liver carried out with various cyclodextrins as mobile phase modifiers presented a peak which was not observed in the analysis of cholesterol samples from <b>wool</b> <b>wax.</b> On the other hand, different storage conditions of cholesterol samples and addition of cyclodextrins as mobile phase modifiers produced almost identical alterations in chromatograms of fresh samples by reversed-phase HPLC. This could be attributed to catalytic properties of cyclodextrins. Cyclodextrins may not be suitable as a mobile phase modifier in the stereoisomer analysis of cholesterol with high performance liquid chromatography...|$|E

50|$|In the fall, the {{immature}} female adelgid, small, globular, and wingless (1.2-1.7 mm), finds a spruce {{on which}} to overwinter. In the spring when the winter thaw occurs, the female matures and lays some eggs in what resembles sacks (totalling several hundred eggs) on the branches near the developing buds.

40|$|New {{discoveries in}} {{ovulation}} induced mammals, researchers considered {{the question of}} whether spontaneous and induced ovulations are distinct entities or individual parts of a single continuum of a “malefacilitated oestrus and ovulation”. This rigid classification should be taken with precaution, because is possible that the various mechanisms involved in the spontaneous ovulation can, under specific conditions coexist in some determined species. It is possible that male hormones can provoke the ovulation by masculine pheromones. The “Ram Effect” can be used to synchronize ewes naturally, for artificial insemination. Pheromones are specialized hormones released by the ram and smelled by the ewes; they are found in the <b>wool</b> and <b>wax,</b> {{in such a way that}} synchronized the heat and the advancement of the breeding season Also, using artificial vaginal-cervical stimulation (AVS) with a glass rod, ovulation has been induced in the mink, shrews and felids. This form of tactile stimulation (AVS) has found no ability for induction of ovulation in SAC. Additional stimuli/cues are often necessary to facilitate the ovulatory response. They include olfactory, visual, auditory or posture, more of them very common in SAC. Few research studies in alpacas and llamas showed a variable number of females ovulating by the sole proximity of the male to the female, by adopting the copulatory position (posture) (sitting or prone position), female to female mounting (tactile), males mounting females covered with aprons to avoid penis intromission (tactile and auditory), interrupted matings, sitting close to a male copulating to a female (visual, olfactory?), the guttural sound (orgling) made by the copulating male (auditory), and probably other non-identified cues. The rate of spontaneous ovulation in alpacas and llamas, increase up to 50 % during the breeding season. These spontaneous ovulation has been diagnosed by sexual behavior (female rejection to the male), by laparoscopic technique, by the progesterone increase in the peripheral circulation and corpus luteum formation, and by ultrasonography. All this factors should be considered in the future research of sexual behavior in SAC, in order to find the cues for facilitating the ovulation in these species...|$|R

Every bargain seemed to occupy at least an hour, and perhaps Yusuf lingered the longer in order to give Arthur more time for consideration; or it might be that his native tongue, once heard, exercised an irresistible fascination over him. He never failed to have what he called a 'crack' with his young countryman at the hour of the siesta, or at night, perhaps persuading the sheyk that it was controversial, though it was more apt to be on circumstances of the day's trade or the news of the Border-side. Controversy indeed there could be little with one so ignorant as kirk treatment in that century was apt to leave the outcasts of society, nor had conversion to Islam given him much instruction in its tenets; so that the conversation generally was on earthly topics, though it always ended in assurances that Master Arthur would suffer for it if he did not perceive what was for his good.

A {{benchtop}} scouring {{procedure was}} used to evaluate the ability of conventional detergent scouring systems to adequately clean fleece samples from a selection of Western Australian Merino wools. Sixteen fleeces were selected from the Western Australian Department of Agriculture resource flocks, covering a wide range in yield (49. 2 to 77. 5 %), wax (7. 3 to 26. 9 %), suint (4. 9 to 11. 6 %), and dust (1. 4 to 16. 3 %) contents.

This natural cream is suggested to feature multiple biological functions such as facilitating the skin formation during pregnancy and hydrating the skin of the newborn. The aim of this thesis was the rational design of synthetic creams which mimic VC’s structure and its unique properties. Synthetic creams were made of highly hydrated synthetic particles embedded in <b>wool</b> <b>wax</b> and skin lipids. These creams were shown to mimic excellently the structure and composition of natural VC, while the water content and release properties could be controlled. The developed creams showed their great potential for disrupted and underdeveloped skin concerning several aspects: the skin barrier recovery rate was drastically reduced, crust formation was prevented and thickening of the epidermis was less frequently observed. These promising results give rise to future clinical studies in order to prove the benefits of the newly developed creams to treat healthy, dry and diseased human skin.

40|$|Dyeing and {{diffusion}} {{properties of}} dyes into wool fiber {{are governed by}} a membranous structure which is formed by a matrix protein and lipid components. External lipids (<b>wool</b> <b>wax)</b> are mainly non-polar, while internal lipids consist mainly of sterols, polar lipids (ceramides), and free fatty acids. These components constitute a real hydrophobic barrier to the diffusion of dye molecules and in fact conventional wool dyeing methods are based on long times at temperature near the boil {{in order to ensure}} good levels of dye penetration. To limit the action of this barrier and to achieve higher values of dye bath exhaustion operating at temperatures lower than 98 oC, wool fabric was subjected to three different pre-treatments. The first pre-treatment consisted of the removal of internal lipids by extraction with solvents in order to obtain a higher affinity of the fiber towards the dyes. The second involved hydrolysis with a protease, which leads to the formation of access routes within the fiber to improve the uptake of dyes or other reagents.

En el presente trabajo se compara el porcentaje de recuperaci&# 243;n de la cera de lana de efluentes industriales mediante t&# 233;cnicas alternativas a la tradicional (Microondas, Soxhlet automatizado y Fluidos Supercr&# 237;ticos) obteniendo recuperaciones del 100 %, reduciendo el tiempo de an&# 225;lisis, el consumo de disolvente y la generaci&# 243;n de residuos...|$|E
