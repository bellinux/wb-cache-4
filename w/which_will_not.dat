5|$|When I assumed office, I {{found that}} my {{predecessor}} {{had signed a}} contract for {{the building of the}} battleship Rio de Janeiro, a vessel of 32,000tons, with an armament of 14 in. guns. Considerations of every kind pointed to the inconvenience of acquiring such a vessel and to the revision of the contract in the sense of reducing the tonnage. This was done, and we shall possess a powerful unit <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood the time of experience.|$|E

5|$|In the soil, {{the roots}} {{encounter}} the hyphae of fungi. Many {{of these are}} known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> flourish {{in the absence of}} its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus while it obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree. The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients from one place to another. The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues. Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic, four hundred million years ago, when the first vascular plants colonised dry land.|$|E

25|$|The 6309 is {{fabricated}} in CMOS technology, {{while the}} 6809 is an NMOS device. As a result, the 6309 requires less power to operate than the 6809. It {{is also a}} fully static device, <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> lose internal state information. This means {{it can be used}} with external DMA without needing refresh every 14 cycles as the 6809 does.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{division}} in the early Drosophila embryo happens so quickly, no proper checkpoints exist, so mistakes may be made in division of the DNA.

25|$|Abortion: a {{disciplinary}} council may be held for any member who submits to, performs, encourages, pays for, or otherwise arranges an abortion.

25|$|The table below {{highlights}} some of {{the challenges}} with decision making and prognostication in thyroid cancer. While there is general agreement that stage I or II papillary, follicular or medullary cancer have a good prognosis, {{it is not possible}} when evaluating a small thyroid cancer to determine which ones will grow and metastasize and <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>not.</b> As a result, once a diagnosis of thyroid cancer has been established (most commonly by a fine needle aspiration), it is likely that a total thyroidectomy will be performed.|$|E
25|$|The ReWritable Audio CD is {{designed}} to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder, <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> (without modification) accept standard CD-RW discs. These consumer audio CD recorders use the Serial Copy Management System (SCMS), an early form of digital rights management (DRM), to conform to the United States' Audio Home Recording Act (AHRA). The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-RW due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3% AHRA royalty used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.|$|E
25|$|On November 11, 2016, it was {{announced}} that screenwriter Christina Hodson has been signed on to pen the screenplay adaptation for Birds of Prey, <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> so much be a Harley Quinn solo spin-off film as originally thought, but an ensemble film of DC Comics' most notorious female heroines and villains. Margot Robbie is set to reprise her role as Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad plus co-produce the film.

25|$|For {{take-off}} {{of fixed}} wing aircraft, Admiral Kuznetsov uses a ski-jump {{at the end}} of her bow. On take-off aircraft accelerate toward and up the ski-jump using their afterburners. This results in the aircraft leaving the deck at a higher angle and elevation than on an aircraft carrier with a flat deck and catapults. The ski-jump take-off is less demanding on the pilot, since the acceleration is lower, but results in a clearance speed of only 120–140km/h (75–85mph) requiring an aircraft design <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> stall at those speeds.|$|E
25|$|Since the mid-20th century wild {{blueberries}} {{have been}} cultivated on the Isaac Wile Hill and Balsam Fir Christmas trees have been grown {{in various parts}} of the community. After the first three autumn frosts which set the needles, the trees are traditionally cut in November. Research is currently being done in Truro, Nova Scotia to develop a tree <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> drop its needles after being cut. This is key to an industry which exports 80 percent of its product to the USA—a market that is steadily become interested in artificial trees that don't drop needles.|$|E
25|$|After {{several days}} of fasting, all cells in the body begin to break down protein. This {{releases}} alanine and lactate produced from pyruvate into the bloodstream, which can be converted into glucose by the liver. Since much of human muscle mass is protein, this phenomenon {{is responsible for the}} wasting away of muscle mass seen in starvation. However, the body is able to selectively decide which cells will break down protein and <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>not.</b> About 2–3 g of protein has to be broken down to synthesize 1 g of glucose; about 20–30 g of protein is broken down each day to make 10 g of glucose to keep the brain alive. However, this number may decrease the longer the fasting period is continued in order to conserve protein.|$|E
