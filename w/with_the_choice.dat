The king of the land, Creon, has forbidden the burial of Polyneices for he was a traitor to the city. Antigone decides to bury his body and face the consequences of her actions. Creon sentences her to death. Eventually, Creon is convinced to free Antigone from her punishment, but his decision comes too late and Antigone commits suicide. Her suicide triggers the suicide of two others close to King Creon: his son, Haemon, who was to wed Antigone, and his wife, Eurydice, who commits suicide after losing her only surviving son.|$|E

When the 49ers hired Frankie Albert as head coach in 1956, Tittle was pleased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> at first, figuring Albert would be a good mentor. However, the team lost four of its first five games, and Albert replaced Tittle with rookie Earl Morrall. After a loss to the Los Angeles Rams brought San Francisco's record to 1–6, Tittle regained the starting role and the team finished undefeated with one tie through the season's final five games.|$|E
5|$|Employing the Sub Intelligent Numbers Selector {{theory that}} {{assigned}} non-descript unit names and randomized numerical designations to formations {{in order to}} disguise their role from the enemy, the company was designated the 8213th Army Unit. Upon formation, {{it was decided that}} the company would be considered an ad hoc, or provisional unit, which meant it did not have a permanent lineage and was only a temporary formation, akin to a task force. This decision was unique to the Eighth Army Ranger Company, as subsequent companies assumed the lineage of Ranger units from World War II, and veterans later expressed resentment <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> as it prevented the company from accruing its own campaign streamers or unit decorations. While subsequent Ranger companies were authorized shoulder sleeve insignia with the distinctive black and red scroll of their World War II predecessors, the Eighth Army Ranger Company wore the shoulder patch of the Eighth United States Army, which commanded all UN troops in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Faced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of {{remaining}} with Clarkson, whose plans were nullified by SDCC's decision, or {{cooperating with the}} council, Maguire chose the former and with Mulden's financing, initiated a High Court judicial review of the decision. The review failed and on 11 April 2005, facing debts of over two million Euro, the club entered into examinership. The 400 Club agreed to completely bankroll the club during the process. On 5 May 2005, Tony Maguire resigned on request by the FAI, who had discovered that the club had submitted their 2003 accounts in their {{application for a licence}} for the 2005 season. This resulted in a points deduction and subsequent relegation under Roddy Collins. The examinership concluded in July 2005 with the examiner accepting the 400 Club's bid for Shamrock Rovers, saving the club from extinction, and the supporters-owned club won promotion at the first attempt in 2006 under Pat Scully. The 2007 and 2008 seasons at Tolka Park were ones of overachievement and stability, but the major event of the period was the recommencement of building on the stadium after more than two years of legal disputes between the council and Thomas Davis CLG.|$|E

5|$|Fraser's {{experiences}} {{as an intern}} convinced her that she would prefer medical research to actual practice with patients. When she completed her New York internship in 1926, she moved to Philadelphia, after a brief visit home to Toronto to visit {{her mother and her}} brother Donald. In Pennsylvania, Fraser began her post-doctorate training under the direction of Muriel McPhedran at the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis in January 1927, specialising in bacteriology The experiences in her internships were markedly different in that in New York, she lived at the hospital and the staff was predominantly made up of women. In Philadelphia, she lived in her own apartment in the town and often had to struggle to be accepted as a doctor and be able to see patients. In March, 1927, Fraser was offered a position in the Connaught Laboratories, a research facility dedicated to developing vaccines, where her brother worked. Accepting the position to begin {{at the end of her}} internship in October meant that she would not be joining Williams in England. Williams had hoped that Fraser would join her, where they might be able to live together, but recognized <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of going back to Toronto, that would not be possible.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{were tied}} with the Cubs and Giants in the wild-card race as {{late in the}} season as September 25 at 88–72. However, the Mets lost their {{remaining}} two games and finished their season one game back of the Cubs and Giants who ended tied at 89–73. This record was also the best non-division-winning record and as such a tie-breaker was necessary to determine the wild-card winner. A coin flip on September 14 gave the Cubs' home field advantage, setting Wrigley Field as the location for the game. In the event of a three-way tie the Cubs were presented <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> to either host two home games or receive a bye and play the winner of a Mets-Giants game on the road because they had the best combined record against the Mets and Giants. Cubs' general manager Ed Lynch decided on the second option, though the choice was moot as the Mets fell out of the race. The Cubs' Steve Trachsel and Mark Gardner of the Giants were slated to start the tie-breaker on the September 28.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 13 May General Winkelman advised the Dutch {{government}} that he considered the general situation to be critical. On land the Dutch had been {{cut off from the}} Allied front and it had become clear no major Allied landings were to be expected to reinforce the Fortress Holland by sea; without such support there was no prospect of a prolonged successful resistance. German tanks might quickly pass through Rotterdam; Winkelman had already ordered all available antitank-guns to be placed in a perimeter around The Hague, to protect the seat of government. However, an immediate collapse of the Dutch defences might still be prevented if the planned counterattacks could seal off the southern front near Dordrecht and restore the eastern line at the Grebbeberg. Therefore, the cabinet decided to continue the fight for the time being, giving the general the mandate to surrender the Army when he saw fit and the instruction to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Nevertheless, it was also deemed essential that Queen Wilhelmina was to be brought to safety; she departed around noon from Hoek van Holland, where a British Irish Guards battalion was present, on HMS Hereward, a British destroyer, and when sea mines made it too dangerous to try to reach Zealand, she went to England. The previous evening, the Queen's only child and heir presumptive Princess Juliana, together with her husband Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld and their children, had departed from IJmuiden on HMS Codrington for Harwich. Arrangements for the departure had already been made before the invasion. As the Queen constitutionally was part of the government, her departure confronted the cabinet <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> whether to follow her or remain. After heated discussions it was decided to leave also: the ministers sailed at 19:20 from Hoek van Holland on HMS Windsor to form a government in exile in London, having conferred all governmental authority over the homeland to Winkelman. Three Dutch merchant ships, escorted by British warships, transferred government bullion and diamond stocks to the United Kingdom.|$|E
