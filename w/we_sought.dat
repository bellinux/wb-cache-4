We are stating a fact, not pronouncing a judgment, {{for it is}} impossible to utter a downright and irrevocable opinion at one hearing.

Boelcke and I had the one Englishman evenly between us, when another opponent, hunted by our friend Richthofen, cut directly in our path. As fast as lightning, Boelcke and I took evasive action simultaneously, and for one instant our wings obstructed our view of each other – it was then it occurred....|$|E

Now science has filled {{in some of the}} realm– not all– that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [...] I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hebert, Kowalski and Daniel Bell, {{deputy chief}} of the {{criminal}} section in the Civil Rights Division, testified that they considered Sessions to have been more welcoming {{to the work of}} the Civil Rights Division than many other Southern US Attorneys at the time. Sessions has always defended his civil rights record, saying that [...] "when I was , I signed 10 pleadings attacking segregation or the remnants of segregation, where we as part of the Department of Justice, <b>we</b> <b>sought</b> desegregation remedies". Critics later argued that Sessions had exaggerated his involvement in civil rights cases. Michigan Law professor Samuel Bagenstos, reviewing Sessions's claims, argued that [...] "ll this shows is that Sessions didn't completely refuse to participate in or have his name on pleadings in cases that the civil rights division brought during his tenure ... These four cases are awfully weak evidence of Sessions's supposed commitment to civil rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both sides {{considered}} the judgment a victory. Vivid Entertainment founder and co-chairman Steven Hirsch {{said in a}} statement that he is pleased with the decision regarding the enforcement questions, but plans to appeal the part of the ruling that upholds the measure. He stated, [...] "We won most everything <b>we</b> <b>sought</b> to be determined unconstitutional with Measure B. We are, however, disappointed the Court found it necessary to rewrite a portion of the measure in order to salvage a small portion of the measure and refused, at this time, to accept the adult industry’s own regulations by imposing an unfunded mandate upon the county by AHF." [...] AIDS Healthcare Foundation president Michael Weinstein stated, [...] "Today’s ruling that requiring condoms in porn is constitutional is just a tremendous, tremendous victory, one that will go a long way to safeguard the health and safety of those adult performers working in the industry." [...] Vivid filed an appeal.|$|E
