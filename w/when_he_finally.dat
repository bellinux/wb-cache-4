5|$|Coming off {{his fourth}} championship, the 34-year-old Niedermayer {{contemplated}} retirement. Remaining undecided on his future as the 2007–08 season began, {{he failed to}} report to the team and was suspended by the Ducks as a formality. Pronger replaced him as captain, and Niedermayer remained undecided until early December <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> chose to return. He appeared in only 48 games that season, scoring 25 points, but played in his fourth All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{spent the}} {{following}} year working to secure the election of Ferdinand as King of Hungary. On 14 February 1527, she asked for his permission to resign as regent. Permission was denied, and Mary had {{to remain in the}} post until the summer of 1527, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> came to Hungary and assumed the crown, to Mary's relief.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 2013, Horton {{signed a}} seven-year free agent {{contract}} worth $37.1 million with the Columbus Blue Jackets. Off-season shoulder surgery, however, would sideline Horton until January 2, 2014 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> made his Blue Jackets debut and scored the game-winning goal in a 2–0 {{victory over the}} Phoenix Coyotes.|$|E

Ron is shocked and jealous to see that Hermione is attending with Krum. Cedric gives Harry a tip on the egg, telling him {{to take it to}} the prefects' bathroom, but Harry refuses to listen, jealous over Cho.|$|E
5|$|Wood officially {{joined the}} Rolling Stones in 1975 for their {{upcoming}} Tour of the Americas, while the Faces disbanded. Unlike the other band members, however, Wood was paid an employee's salary, and that remained the case {{until the early}} 1990s, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> joined the Rolling Stones' business partnership.|$|E
5|$|After {{resuming}} production, Navarro {{questioned the}} methods of the Chili Peppers' recording procedures. He wondered why such {{a considerable amount of}} jamming was involved with the album's conception. Various qualms followed, and the process soon became uncomfortable for the band. Months went by, and only small amounts of material were written. Kiedis made a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan in December, where his family realized he'd resumed an active addiction once again. He returned to Hollywood in late January 1995, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> finished recording his vocals. The rest of the recording was completed within the next month.|$|E
2500|$|Haggard said {{he started}} smoking {{marijuana}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was 41 years old. He admitted that in 1983, he bought [...] "$2,000 (worth) of cocaine" [...] and partied {{for five months}} afterward, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> realized his condition and quit for good. He quit smoking cigarettes in 1991, and stopped smoking marijuana in 1995. However, a Rolling Stone magazine interview in 2009 indicated that he had resumed regular marijuana smoking.|$|R
50|$|Comparing {{traditional}} and virtual queuing timelines shows {{the difference in}} the customer experience. In this first example, the customer waits in a traditional queue for 12 minutes. <b>When</b> <b>he's</b> <b>finally</b> connected with an agent, he talks for 3 minutes - but some of that time is spent complaining about his time spent in the queue. Note that many customers in this situation would abandon the queue before reaching an agent, and retry the call later, resulting in additional telecom costs for the contact center and skewed call center metrics.|$|R

5|$|Cobra Commander escapes {{during the}} battle and Storm Shadow disappears after avenging his uncle. The real President {{addresses}} the nation at a White House ceremony where Roadblock, Lady Jaye, Flint, Jinx, and Snake Eyes are commemorated as heroes. Colton presents Roadblock with an M1911 pistol that belonged to General George S. Patton, to use <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> finds Cobra Commander and to avenge Duke and the other Joes. Roadblock proudly raises the weapon and fires a single shot {{in honor of his}} fallen comrades.|$|E
5|$|In August 1492, Christopher Columbus {{stopped at}} La Gomera in the Canary Islands, for wine and water, {{intending}} to stay only four days. He became romantically {{involved with the}} governor of the island, Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio, and stayed a month. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> sailed, she gave him cuttings of sugarcane, which became the first to reach the New World. The first sugar cane harvest was conducted in Hispaniola in 1501, and many sugar mills had been constructed in Cuba and Jamaica by the 1520s. The Portuguese took sugar cane to Brazil. By 1540, there were 800 cane sugar mills in Santa Catarina Island and another 2,000 on the north coast of Brazil, Demarara, and Surinam.|$|E
5|$|Kemp's {{ankle injury}} {{took a lot}} longer to heal than had been expected, and the team {{reported}} that they hoped {{to get him back}} in September. However, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> began his minor league rehab assignment at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga in late August, he struggled at the plate and his return date was pushed back. He went hitless in five games, with seven strikeouts, and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated.|$|E
50|$|Wong {{retired from}} the Cabinet {{following}} the 2011 general election. He remains a Member of Parliament and also Special Adviser to Economic Cooperation until 2015, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was <b>finally</b> retired from political service after 31 years.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> was <b>finally</b> buried, {{his grave}} spot became a {{stopping}} place for Christian pilgrims. He was respected for his piety and devotion to St. Wenceslaus. Today a chapel marks his ancient grave in the Czech Republic.|$|R
50|$|Gennadius (Γεννάδιος, died c. 665), {{sometimes}} referred to as Gennadius II (his 6th-century predecessor being Gennadius I), was a Byzantine general who exercised the role of Exarch of Africa from 648 to 665, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was <b>finally</b> expelled.|$|R
5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to think. He sees old photographs, including one of himself as a child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father was not even there <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} Rupert's actions, {{even after his}} forces disengaged, was to force another delay in the Parliamentarian retreat; Essex spent much of 19 September looking after wounded {{soldiers}} and, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> managed to begin moving again, he was confronted with swampland and bog which further delayed him while the Royalists marched across the relatively open chalk downs above the Kennet. These hardships meant that the Royalists arrived at Newbury before Essex, with both armies settling down for the night outside the town, too exhausted to immediately fight.|$|E
5|$|When Dante next meets Trish, she betrays him {{and reveals}} that she too {{is working for}} Mundus, but when her life is endangered, Dante chooses to save her. Claiming he did so only because of her {{resemblance}} to his mother, he warns her to stay away. Yet <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> confronts Mundus, {{who is about to}} kill Trish, Dante again chooses to save her and is injured. Mundus tries to finish him off, but Trish takes the attack instead. This unleashes Dante's full power, thus allowing him to take on the form of Sparda. Dante and Mundus then battle on another plane of existence.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> was <b>finally</b> {{tried in}} 1871, they {{sentenced him to}} life in prison. He served 33 years in the Koper jail <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was paroled {{at the age of}} 68 due to efforts of his stepson Jozo who was a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army.|$|R
25|$|Wüsthoff {{remained}} in French captivity in Château-Gontier until 1920. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> was <b>finally</b> released, <b>he</b> was malnourished and on crutches.

60|$|Ralph {{was hardly}} {{in need of}} such a plaything, but Bob's scheme had so excited him that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> did <b>finally</b> succeed in getting to sleep that night, it was only to dream of {{wonderful}} wells spouting wonderfully pure oil.|$|R
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> {{retired from}} public life, Reitz moved to Gordon's Bay, but {{returned}} to Cape Town several years later, {{where he had}} a house in Tamboerskloof and was {{taken care of by}} his daughter Bessie, a medical doctor. He remained active to the end with writing and translating. Reitz died at his house Botuin on 27 March 1934, and received a state funeral three days later, with a funeral service at the Grote Kerk. He was buried at the Woltemade cemetery at Maitland.|$|E
5|$|As for Governor General Prevost, {{who often}} clashed with Brock, he {{remained}} in command of all British forces until after the Battle of Plattsburgh, in 1814. The battle {{was intended to be}} a joint naval/infantry attack, but Prevost did not commit his forces until after the naval battle had nearly ended. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> did attack, his forces proved unable to cross the Saranac River bridge, which was held by a small group of American regulars under the command of the recently promoted John E. Wool. Despite a heavy advantage in manpower, Prevost finally retreated upon hearing of the failure of the naval attack. For his failure at Plattsburgh, Prevost was recalled to England to face an inquiry, and a naval court martial determined that the blame for the loss at Plattsburgh primarily rested with Prevost. Prevost's health failed him, and he died in early 1816.|$|E
5|$|Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a {{defensive}} retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from the Taliban fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is {{shot in the}} shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains {{at the top of}} the cliff and is killed by the Taliban insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up the cliff to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the Taliban fighters to provide Murphy with cover. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by Taliban fighters.|$|E
25|$|The Central Bank of Ireland {{failed to}} spot Madoff's {{gigantic}} fraud, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> started using Irish funds {{and had to}} supply large amounts of information {{which would have been}} enough to enable Irish regulators to uncover the fraud much earlier than late 2008 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was <b>finally</b> arrested in New York.|$|R
50|$|After {{accomplished}} {{displays in}} the FA Cup, most notably against Swansea City and Watford in January 2007, Casement moved out on loan to Millwall for three months. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> did <b>finally</b> join Millwall, <b>he</b> {{did not make}} an appearance during his month there.|$|R
50|$|His brother Cathal {{was at home}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{was killed}} and {{recalled}} that while being interrogated by The Tans <b>he</b> heard gunshots, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was <b>finally</b> allowed to go outside he saw his brother's body below a window in the backyard {{in a pool of}} blood. Hand is buried at Baldungan Castle.|$|R
5|$|Friday {{was known}} at Hayes for his {{excessive}} drinking, {{and on one}} occasion the team started a match a player short because Friday had not turned up. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> arrived, eighty minutes after kick-off, his intoxication was obvious, {{but he was still}} sent onto the pitch with the match still goalless. The opposition paid him little attention and Friday scored a late winning goal. Hayes were drawn to play Football League Fourth Division club Reading in the FA Cup's second round on 9 December 1972; the team managed to draw 0–0 at Reading and earn the right to a replay at home, which they lost 1–0 three days later. Although Hayes had lost, the interest of Reading manager Charlie Hurley was piqued. Hurley travelled to Hayes more than once to watch Friday. Having researched the player's background, he was cautious about signing him, but was impressed all the same by his on-field performances.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{accepted}} {{reports of}} a Japanese counterattack at Saidor, and sent reinforcements in response, but the attack did not eventuate. Because the 32nd Infantry Division was required for the upcoming Hansa Bay operation, he was initially reluctant to authorize it to block the trails behind the American beachhead. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> did so, it was too late. The retreating Japanese made good their escape, thereby defeating {{the whole purpose of}} the operation. The next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign in February 1944, played out differently. Based on Fifth Air Force reports that the islands were unoccupied, MacArthur accelerated his timetable and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force of the islands. Krueger sent in the Alamo Scouts, who confirmed that the islands were still well-defended.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of his life at Kenwood House. Most of his time was spent maintaining the grounds. In the summer, he was visited by groups of barristers who informed him of the goings-on at court. On 1 August 1792 he was made Earl of Mansfield, in the County of Middlesex. On 10 March 1793, he complained of feeling sleepy, and although he recovered the next day, by 12 March, he was again complaining of a need for sleep. He went to bed early and remained asleep until 18 March, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> died. His body was buried in the North Transept of Westminster Abbey. Mansfield left a large amount of money after his death, including land worth £26,000. He gave £2,000 to Francis Buller.|$|E

50|$|When Staff Sergeant Ernest Gallego, USAAF {{tried to}} enlist, {{he was too}} young and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was <b>finally</b> of age, <b>he</b> failed the depth {{perception}} test and therefore chose gunnery school. Gallego and his crew flew on many missions from their base in Italy.|$|R
50|$|His run {{ended on}} the 8th day of May 1916 tournament, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was <b>finally</b> {{defeated}} by Tochigiyama Moriya. On {{the final day}} of January 1917 tournament, he was defeated by Ōnishiki Uichirō. Tochigiyama and Ōnishiki were pupils of Hitachiyama. After this second loss, he retired.|$|R
