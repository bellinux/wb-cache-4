This question is important in the light of changes in the social security system which are characterised by moves to cut the length and amount of benefits and place a stronger emphasis on the duty to work. This report analyses how non-workers perceive their situation and what they are doing to find work again. Are people who do not work socially isolated? Do they experience many financial problems? Do they want to work or have they reconciled themselves to a jobless existence? This study follows on from an earlier SCP study which analysed the views of workers and non-workers. This made it possible to explore whether the consequences of not working for those affected have changed in recent decades...|$|E

40|$|In {{the study}} of work time, a wealth of {{influential}} ideas have emerged about the potentially damaging impact of too many hours in the labour market {{on the rest of}} peoples’ lives, as well as about the negative economic ramifications of short hours working. The paper focuses on the temporal and economic wellbeing of female employees in Europe, stimulated by the importance of work time in debates over time poverty and work life integration. It asks whether women in shorter hours jobs are happiest with their time, for paid work and leisure, but also what might the lower wages from reduced hours <b>working</b> <b>mean</b> for women, particularly those in low level occupations. The paper shows first that although working fewer hours contributes to women’s satisfaction with their time in many countries, it is long full-time hours that have the strongest (negative) relationship with women’s temporal wellbeing across Europe. Second, the paper demonstrates the damaging impact of working in low level occupations – both part-time and full-time - on the economic wellbeing of women’s households. It stresses the importance of a combined work time and occupational class approach in the ongoing analysis of women’s working lives...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{identify}} prognostic {{factors for}} the 2 -year course of work participation in early osteoarthritis (OA) of hips or knees. Methods In this prospective cohort study, questionnaire data from 925 subjects was analyzed. Rate ratios were calculated to compare work participation {{with the general}} Dutch population, corrected for age, sex and education. The overall participation rate at T- 2 was compared to baseline. Personal factors, self-reported health status (Western Ontario McMasters Arthritis Index-WOMAC), medical consumption and physical work demands were compared between subjects with sustained work participation and subject who stopped working; factors that differed significantly were included in a logistic regression analysis. Results Work participation in the cohort (mean age 58, 79 % females) decreased from 51 to 46 %, a similar rate to the general population. Subjects who continued working were younger than those who stopped <b>working</b> (<b>mean</b> 4. 2 years) and they had less frequently reported sick-leave at baseline; the regression model included both factors. 11 % Of the workers reported sick-leave {{in the past year}} because of hip/knee complaints (similar to baseline). 20 % Reported work adaptations, compared to 14 % at baseline. Conclusion The 2 -year course of work participation of people with early OA was similar to the general Dutch population.

40|$|Spatial data {{analysis}} {{has become more}} and more important in the studies of ecology and economics during the last decade. One focus of spatial {{data analysis}} is how to select predictors, variance functions and correlation functions. However, in general, the true covariance function is unknown and the working covariance structure is often misspecified. In this paper, our target is to find a good strategy to identify the best model from the candidate set using model selection criteria. This paper is to evaluate the ability of some information criteria (corrected Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and residual information criterion (RIC) for choosing the optimal model when the working correlation function, the working variance function and the <b>working</b> <b>mean</b> function are correct or misspecified. Simulations are carried out for small to moderate sample sizes. Four candidate covariance functions (exponential, Gaussian, Matern and rational quadratic) are used in simulation studies. With the summary in simulation results, we find that the misspecified working correlation structure can still capture some spatial correlation information in model fitting. When the sample size is large enough, BIC and RIC perform well even if the the working covariance is misspecified. Moreover, the performance of these information criteria is related to the average level of model fitting which can be indicated by the average adjusted R square (Formula presented.), and overall RIC performs well...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Risks and Protection of Nurses Working in Acute Care Departments Nurses {{working in}} acute care {{departments}} face enhanced risks of injuries, accidents, infections and stress. A burden consists in providing acute care to clients who are undergoing the checkup and have hardly any anamneses. Nurses {{are exposed to}} work stress, stress resulted from human relationships, overloading and shift work. Occupational stress increases risks of injuries, accidents and infections. Nurses are supposed to observe {{the health and safety}} rules as they are presented in work safety trainings, in regulations and standards. All nurses should know them, use protective <b>working</b> <b>means</b> and protect themselves from injuries and accidents. Any injuries and accidents must be reported which bring both advantages and disadvantages. We have surveyed an intensive care unit of the cardiosurgical department, a department of anaesthetics and resuscitation and operating theatres. We asked six respondents in our qualitative research. There were five aims stated. 1. To find out how much the nurses are informed about work safety rules. 2. To find out if there is any relation between nurse´s age and her awareness of risks in acute care departments. 3. To find out if they protect themselves affectively from injuries and accidents. 4. To find out how stress affects nurses´ work in risky departments. 5. To find out if they apply the methods given in work safety rules in case they are injured or infected. The aims have been fulfilled. The analysis of non-standardised interviews resulted into four hypotheses. 1. Nurses are most affected by risk awareness at productive age. 2. Nurses use gloves and mouth protections as the only personal protective <b>working</b> <b>means.</b> 3. Long-term work stress causes psychosomatic illnesses in nurses. 4. Overanxious and lengthy procedure in case of work injury makes nurses to keep the fact in secret. The findings have proved the fact that nurses know the work safety rules. They use ptotective <b>working</b> <b>means</b> marginally. Nurses at productive age and nurse/mothers of small children are aware of the risks. Work stress does not affect their job performance but it definitely leads to injuries and accidents. The procedure in case of work injuries is viewed as lengthy and that is the reason why they do not often follow it...|$|R
40|$|High {{prevalence}} of sleep problems, fatigue and depression {{are reported in}} maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. To assess fatigue, depression, sleep problems and their co-relates among MHD patients in a tertiary care center in India, we studied 47 patients on MHD for > 3 months. Patients demographic, medical and co-morbidity profile were recorded. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (poor sleeper if score > 5) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (EPSS, abnormal daytime sleepiness if score > 13) {{were used to assess}} sleep abnormalities and quality. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to screen for depression. Depression was classified on BDI scores as mild-moderate (score 11 - 30) and severe (score > 30). Fatigue Severity Scale was used to assess fatigue (score ≥ 36 indicates fatigue). The correlations of these parameters among themselves and with social and demographic parameters were also analyzed. The mean age of the study population was 37. 1 ± 13. 1 (range 19 - 65 years) years, with 89. 3 % being males. The majority (68. 1 %) of the MHD patients was poor sleepers, but only five (10. 6 %) patients had borderline or abnormal daytime sleepiness. Of the patients, 44. 7 % reported fatigue and (72. 3 %) had depression (mild to moderate in 59. 7 % and severe in 12. 6 %). Fatigue scores were found to be significantly associated with lesser frequency of dialysis (P < 0. 05). There was higher daytime sleepiness in patients who were <b>working</b> (<b>mean</b> EPSS score 6. 2 ± 3. 7) than who were unemployed (mean EPSS score 3. 9 ± 2. 7). Depression was found to be higher in those who were paying for the treatment themselves (mean BDI score 20 ± 11. 8) as compared with those who were getting medical expenditure reimbursed (mean BDI score 12. 9 ± 8. 8). Fatigue positively correlated with that of daytime sleepiness (P = 0. 02), poor nighttime sleep (P = 0. 02) and depression (P= 0. 006). In the present study, there was no correlation (P < 0. 05) found between daytime and night time sleep and depression. We found a high {{prevalence of}} fatigue, depression and poor sleep quality in our MHD patients.
