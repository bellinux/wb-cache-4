50|$|An arrest <b>warrant</b> is an {{outstanding}} arrest <b>warrant</b> when the person named in the <b>warrant</b> {{has not yet been}} arrested. A <b>warrant</b> may be outstanding if the person named in the <b>warrant</b> is intentionally evading law enforcement, unaware that there is a <b>warrant</b> out for his or her arrest, the agency responsible for executing the <b>warrant</b> has a backlog of <b>warrants</b> to serve, or a combination of these factors.|$|R

5|$|Although he {{depicted}} Pavo on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Omega in 1756, but omitted Psi and Xi, and labelled {{two pairs}} of stars close together Mu and Phi Pavonis. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould designated a star Xi Pavonis as he felt its brightness <b>warranted</b> a name, but dropped Chi Pavonis due to its faintness.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, <b>warrant</b> {{officers}} are appointed by <b>warrant</b> then {{commissioned by the}} President of the United States at the rank of chief <b>warrant</b> officer. <b>Warrant</b> officers range from WO1-CW5.

5|$|Another {{exception}} to the general rule that courts will generally only judicially review errors of law is where action is taken or a decision is {{made on the basis}} of no evidence, a lack of sufficient evidence, or an error of material fact. In such situations, intervention by the High Court is <b>warranted</b> as the action or decision is factually unsustainable.|$|E
5|$|Nathan Lovejoy's 1996 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} morphology, {{found that the}} yellow {{stingray}} is the most basal member of a clade that also contains Pacific Urobatis species and the genus Urotrygon of Central and South America. This finding would render Urobatis polyphyletic, though further study is <b>warranted</b> to elucidate the relationships between these taxa.|$|E
5|$|Ordinarily, spinner sharks do {{not pose}} a {{substantial}} danger to humans; they do not perceive large mammals as prey, as their small, narrow teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting. However, they can become excited {{by the presence of}} food, so caution is <b>warranted</b> if this species is encountered while spearfishing. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed 16 unprovoked attacks and one provoked attack attributable to the spinner shark, none of them fatal.|$|E

On 25 July 1864 the standing <b>warrant</b> officers {{were divided into two}} grades: <b>warrant</b> officers and chief <b>warrant</b> officers (or [...] "commissioned <b>warrant</b> officers", a phrase that was replaced in 1920 with [...] "commissioned officers promoted from <b>warrant</b> rank", although they were still usually referred to as [...] "commissioned <b>warrant</b> officers", even in official documents).|$|R

5|$|Since 1998, the mallard {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is {{because it has a}} large range–more than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)–and because its {{population}} is increasing, rather than declining by 30% over ten years or three generations and thus is not <b>warranted</b> a vulnerable rating. Also, the population size of the mallard is very large.|$|E
5|$|The Essex Bypass, {{completed}} {{around the}} village of Essex in 1972, was designed to accommodate future widening to a divided four lane road when traffic volumes <b>warranted.</b> By the mid-1990s, a regular pattern of fatalities were occurring, prompting local politicians and Essex Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Bruce Crozier to lobby the MTO widen the route.|$|E

The Beeloo Whadjuk Noongar people of the Perth region knew it as the Mungyt. Despite its variation across its range, George noted that B.menziesii was a clearly defined species, and no formal division into subspecies was <b>warranted.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} this era had no {{permanent}} battery of guns; guns were completely portable and were often exchanged between ships as situations <b>warranted.</b> Each commanding officer modified his vessel's armaments to his liking while {{taking into consideration}} {{factors such as the}} overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, a vessel's armament would change often during its career; records of the changes were not generally kept.|$|E

The main reason caused the systematic deviations is the asym-metries in the risk exposure of <b>warrants</b> issuers. These asymmetries make the reference price of PT/MA investors low for call <b>warrants</b> issuers and high for put <b>warrants</b> issuers. These factors cause the systematic deviations in Chinese <b>warrants.</b> Individual specula-tion behaviors can explain only small parts of <b>warrants</b> price deviations. consequently, we think the main reason caused systematic price deviations is <b>warrants</b> creation mecha-nism, which create defective <b>warrants,</b> rather than only caused by individual investors’ speculative behaviors...|$|R
