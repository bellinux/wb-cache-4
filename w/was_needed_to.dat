5|$|A further {{complication}} is that {{a certain}} proportion of the Allied manpower <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> man the fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men. Since the Battle of Mycale was fought at least near-simultaneously with the Battle of Plataea, then this was a pool of manpower which could not have contributed to Plataea, and further reduces the likelihood that 110,000 Greeks assembled before Plataea.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the cyclone's slow movement, heavy rains {{impacted}} the same area for more than a week, resulting in severe flooding. Throughout Mangaia, nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of the livestock perished. Following an assessment of the damage, it was determined that US$52,000 <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> repair losses. Due to the severity of damage caused by Trina, its name was retired in May 2002 and replaced with Tino.|$|E

5|$|Hoover was {{defeated}} for re-election by Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Roosevelt {{was convinced that}} federal activism <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> reverse the country's economic decline. In his first hundred days in office, the Congress enacted at Roosevelt's request a series of bills designed to strengthen the banking system, including the Emergency Banking Act, the Glass–Steagall Act (which created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), and the 1933 Banking Act. The Congress also passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act to stabilize the nation's agricultural industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{attempted}} {{to pass the}} Meech Lake Accord, a series of constitutional amendments to persuade Quebec to endorse the Canada Act 1982. Unanimous support in the legislature <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> bypass public consultation. Manitoba politician Elijah Harper, a Cree, opposed {{because he did not}} believe First Nations had been adequately involved in the Accord's process, and thus the Accord failed.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, the Government {{decided that}} a further {{generation}} of new towns in South East England <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> take the projected population increase of London, after the initial 1940s/1950s wave. Bletchley had already been considered as a new town in this first wave, and in the 1950s the London County Council had constructed overspill housing for several London boroughs there.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1660s, a {{building}} program was initiated {{to expand the}} fleet and replace old capital ships. A new flagship <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> replace the old Kronan from 1632. The felling of vast quantities of timber that were required for the new admiral's ship had already begun {{in the winter of}} 1664–65. Swedish historian Kurt Lundgren has estimated that 7–10 hectares (17–25 acres) of hundred-year-old oak forest was required for the hull and several tall, stout pines for the masts and bowsprit.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the second}} airport in Båtsfjord. The first was built in 1973, but only had a gravel runway. When Widerøe {{replaced}} their smaller de Havilland Canada Twin Otters with the Dash8, a new airport <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> serve Båtsfjord. The new airport cost 178million Norwegian krone and opened on 9September1999.|$|E
50|$|Rabbit warrens {{were almost}} entirely H0e or 00-9. Their small {{dimensions}} and tight curves required a narrow gauge. Narrow gauge models with short wheelbases <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> negotiate them. Larger motors than standard gauge models <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> climb the spirals.|$|R
50|$|Testing {{occasionally}} {{during the}} middle of the night is also important, particularly when high waking blood sugars are found, to determine if more insulin <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> prevent hyperglycemia or if less insulin <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> prevent such a rebound.|$|R
30|$|PET {{studies with}} [11 C]flumazenil in epileptic rats <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> clarify whether local changes in {{cerebral}} [11 C]flumazenil uptake in epilepsy {{are due to}} decreased GABA-ergic function, P-gp upregulation, or both. Furthermore, a comparison between naive and epileptic rats <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> assess to which degree P-gp upregulation affects cerebral uptake of [11 C]flumazenil. Ultimately, [11 C]flumazenil studies in both pharmacoresistant and pharmacosensitive patients with epilepsy, {{as well as in}} healthy volunteers <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> elucidate this important issue.|$|R
5|$|The British {{believed}} that a new permanent approach <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> establish and maintain continuous contact with the Peshwa's court in Pune.

5|$|The Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Robert I, died in January 1228. His brother Baldwin II succeeded him, but a regent <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> {{rule the}} Latin Empire since Baldwin {{was ten years}} old. Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria was {{willing to accept the}} regency, but the barons of the Latin Empire {{suspected}} that he wanted to unite the Latin Empire with Bulgaria. They offered the imperial crown instead to John, an ally of the Holy See.|$|E
5|$|The Stokes Mortar {{was rapidly}} {{developed}} {{when it became}} clear that some type of weapon <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> provide artillery-like fire support to the infantry.

5|$|The debate, again {{including}} {{contributions from}} Justice Minister Michael McDowell, {{took place in}} February 2007. All speakers supported civil unions for same-sex couples and complimented Deputy Howlin on the bill. One expressed reservations about adoption. Minister McDowell claimed that the bill violated the constitutional provisions on marriage and the family. Government speakers said that civil unions needed to be introduced but that more time <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> {{take account of the}} ongoing Supreme Court case and investigation work in the Department of Justice.|$|E
5|$|The {{founding}} of a colonial college {{had long been}} the desire of John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. As an Oxford-educated military commander who had fought in the American Revolutionary War, Simcoe believed a college <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> counter the spread of republicanism from the United States. The Upper Canada Executive Committee recommended in 1798 a college be established in York, the colonial capital.|$|E
5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an innovative solution <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> get drive {{from the rear of the}} engine to the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E

The doctors discovered that he had ruptured an important blood vessel and immediate surgery <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> fix it.

5|$|A more {{immediate}} {{need for a}} canal covering the section between Givors and Rive-de-Gier emerged in the 1750s, when a cheaper method than pack mules <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> carry coal to heat houses in Lyon and to fuel the glass works that had been opened in Givors in 1749. In 1751, there were 1,200 mules engaged in carrying the coal from Rive-de-Gier to Givors, from where it was taken by water north to Lyon and south to the towns of the Midi. Lyon was consuming 36,000 tons annually. The coal sold for 5 francs a ton at the mine head and 21.70 francs per ton at the Lyon docks.|$|E
5|$|A second KKS {{line was}} opened on 27 March 1900, from Nybrua, {{located on the}} KSS's Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, via Trondheimsveien to Rodeløkka. Named the Rodeløkka Line, the {{southern}} section would later {{become part of the}} Sinsen Line. From Nybrua to the city centre, KSS track was used. The depot was located at Rodeløkka. A third line opened on 28 August 1900, from Tollbugaten in the city centre southwards to Festningsbryggen at Vippetangen—the Vippetangen Line. Again, KSS track <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> connect the line into the city centre. Twenty cars and twelve trailers were bought from Busch with electric components delivered from Schuk—stock that remained in service until 1967. The company failed to make any profits, and was sold to KSS in 1905.|$|E
