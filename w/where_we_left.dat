500|$|In February 2011 Soundgarden {{announced}} on their homepage {{that they had}} started recording a new album. On March 1, 2011, Chris Cornell confirmed that Adam Kasper would produce it. Four days later, the band stated it would consist of material that was [...] "90 percent new" [...] with the rest consisting of updated versions of older ideas. They also noted that they had 12 to 14 songs that were [...] "kind of ready to go". Although Cameron claimed the album would be released in 2011, the recording was prolonged as Thayil said that [...] "the more we enjoy it, the more our fans should end up enjoying it". Thayil also reported that some songs sound [...] "similar in a sense to Down on the Upside" [...] and that the album would be [...] "picking up <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> off. There are some heavy moments, {{and there are some}} fast songs." [...] The next day, Cornell reported that the new album would not be released until the spring of 2012.|$|E
500|$|... "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] {{was written}} by Carey, Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, with {{featured}} artist Wale. The song interpolates a song called [...] "I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair", written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez and originally performed by Inner Life in 1979. Adams and Gonzalez are credited as songwriters as a result. In August 2012, Cox revealed that he, Carey and Dupri had started working on Carey's then untitled fourteenth studio album, later revealed to be Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, before the singer became pregnant with twins in 2010, and then resumed working on the project after she gave birth in 2011. [...] "She was committed to making it before she got pregnant. Then she got pregnant and she took the time off. Then after she came back, we started really vibing again and we picked up right <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> off. I just feel like between Jermaine, myself and her, {{we came up with}} a few things that [...] really, really a solid body of work".|$|E
500|$|Talk of {{a reunion}} {{commenced}} {{weeks after the}} trio began speaking again. After a two-hour phone conversation between DeLonge and Hoppus, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. DeLonge {{was the first to}} approach the subject of reuniting. The trio had, in Hoppus's words, [...] "two gnarly heart-to-hearts," [...] during which the three opened up. [...] "Tom had just kind of come out to Los Angeles for the day," [...] recalled Hoppus, [...] "I remember he said, 'So, what do you guys think? Where are your heads at?' And I said, 'I think we should continue with what we've been doing for the past 17 years. I think we should get back on the road and back in the studio and do what we love doing.'" [...] Eventually, the band appeared {{for the first time on}} stage together in nearly five years as presenters at the 51st Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009. The band's official website was updated with a statement: [...] "To put it simply, We're back. We mean, really back. Picking up <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> off and then some. In the studio writing and recording a new album. Preparing to tour the world yet again. Friendships reformed. 17 years deep in our legacy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Right Back <b>Where</b> <b>We</b> Started From (<b>Left</b> Back On The Side Mix) (rare) ...|$|R
60|$|Before we {{sat down}} to table I looked forth from an upstairs window. The day was {{beginning}} to decline; the links were utterly deserted; the despatch-box still lay untouched <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> it hours before.|$|R
60|$|Before {{we could}} reach it, however, two shots rang out {{clear in the}} {{direction}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> poor Doolittle and the horses. Then a sharp cry broke the stillness--the cry of a wounded man. We redoubled our pace. We knew we were outwitted.|$|R
2500|$|Eddie Izzard {{said in a}} 2007 {{interview}} that he is currently putting together a script for a movie as a conclusion. He said {{the plan is to}} [...] "pick up exactly <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> off, and we think we're going to make a film of the next bit".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} with Raissman, Russo {{did not rule}} out a reunion with Francesa. Russo said, [...] "You never want to say never. You know how the radio business is. So, you never say never, but I haven’t thought about it in my crystal ball, let's put it that way... But I’ll tell you right now, if Mike and I did shows together we would have no trouble picking right up <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> off." ...|$|E
2500|$|The record, by all accounts, sold poorly and {{received}} mixed reviews {{in the music}} press. Hoppus and Barker continued touring on the Honda Civic Tour and commenced work on a second +44 album. The August 2008 death of friend and producer Jerry Finn deeply affected Hoppus, who referred to Finn as a lifelong friend and mentor. The following month, Barker and collaborator Adam Goldstein (aka DJ AM), {{were involved in a}} plane crash that killed four people, leaving Barker and Goldstein the only survivors. Hoppus immediately boarded a plane to the burn unit, and DeLonge reconnected with the duo under the tragic circumstances. When the band regrouped in the studio for a day, past acrimony vanished with near immediacy. Regarding these experiences, Hoppus wrote, [...] "The events of the past two months supersede everything that happened before. Life is too short." [...] In February 2009, the band's official website was updated with a statement: [...] "To put it simply, We're back. We mean, really back. Picking up <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> off and then some. In the studio writing and recording a new album. Preparing to tour the world yet again. Friendships reformed. 17 years deep in our legacy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry we}} {{did not get the}} duck, however," [...] {{observed}} Peterkin, as we returned to the place <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> the canoe. [...] "Elephant meat is coarse, nasty stuff, and totally unfit for civilised mouths, though these niggers seem to relish it amazingly." ...|$|R
60|$|With the two beasts {{trotting}} after us, <b>we</b> {{returned to}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> Juag. Here I had the dickens' own time keeping the female from Juag's throat. Of all the venomous, wicked, cruel-hearted beasts on two worlds, I think a female hyaenodon takes the palm.|$|R
60|$|He linked {{his arm in}} {{mine and}} drew me away. As we turned {{the corner of the}} drive I caught a glimpse over my {{shoulder}} of the Little Nugget's parents. They were standing <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> them, as if Sam's eloquence had rooted them to the spot.|$|R
2500|$|Wanting {{to return}} to their sound from that {{particular}} era, after narrowing down the selection from twelve finished songs to ten that they wanted to record, the band sought to work with James [...] "Jimbo" [...] Barton, who had mixed and engineered the band's hit albums Operation: Mindcrime and Empire, and whom they had last worked with in the mid-90s, when he produced their album Promised Land. Deciding to work with Barton was [...] "a no-brainer", according to La Torre, and Rockenfield has said that Barton was really the only choice. Barton had stayed in contact with Wilton, who would often fill him in on {{what was going on in}} the band. Queensrÿche invited him to see them perform at the House of Blues in West Hollywood on November 24, 2012, where he reportedly said that the band [...] "had something really special here and he wanted to be a part of it." [...] In the studio in Seattle, he told the band: [...] "Look guys, let's just start <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> off, back in 1995". Rockenfield looks back on the collaboration, saying: [...] "Working with Jimbo [...] and the addition of Todd has revitalized the band in ways we never knew until we heard the final results" [...] and: [...] "We had the best time, and he was such a great, perfect match to make this record." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Henry Jackman was in {{the running}} to score Captain America: The First Avenger, he had written [...] "a full-on {{traditional}} symphonic, Americana score" [...] as proof-of-concept for Marvel, which he looked to return to when Marvel asked him to score the sequel, [...] He felt that Silvestri had used that same style to great effect in the first film, but found that the second film [...] "could {{not have been more}} different, and the score was not suitable, so I had to rewrite it". Jackman said of his work on the film, [...] "it’s 50% production and all the tricks I’ve learnt from spending years in the record industry but then it’s also got the kind of injection of symphonic, thematic, heroic music that all kind of merges into one musical, and hopefully coherent piece". He described the film as aesthetically [...] "way closer to something like Dark Knight Rises than it is to say the Richard Donner's Superman, or the traditional, nostalgic superhero film." [...] Some of Silvestri's work from the first film is tracked into the opening of the sequel, which Jackman said [...] "reminds everyone <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> off. This character is about to get hurled into a completely different environment, so it’s a nice way to tie the two films together." ...|$|E
60|$|After an hour's walk, Crusty and I {{arrived at}} the place <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> the canoe.|$|E
60|$|We waited {{nearly two}} hours for the dusk to fall and allow me to ride off. We spoke of Ortheris in whispers, and {{strained}} our ears to catch any sound from the spot <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> him. But <b>we</b> heard nothing except {{the wind in the}} plume-grass.|$|R
60|$|At dark <b>we</b> {{returned}} to <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> Wallace and the cowboys. Frank had {{solved the problem}} of water supply, for {{he had found a}} little spring trickling from a cliff, which, by skillful management, produced enough drink for the horses. We had packed our water for camp use.|$|R
60|$|We {{called at}} home once more that I might send a hasty note to my guardian, {{and then we}} hurried back to <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> the carriage. The horses were brought {{out as soon as}} we were seen coming, and we were on the road again in a few minutes.|$|R
60|$|And {{where was}} Mr. Vanborough all this time? Exactly <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> him five years since.|$|E
60|$|MOSCON: Run! run! for <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> My master. I now {{hear the}} clash of swords.|$|E
60|$|We return {{again to}} Mrs Frog <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> her, sitting beside her cheerful fire, sewing and conversing with Hetty.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are right}} enough, Onondago, in saying that. I shall not like it, nor will my companions, here, like it; {{and the first}} thing you will have to do, will be to guide us, {{straight}} as the bird flies, to the Ravensnest; the picketed house, you know, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> have <b>left</b> our sweethearts." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{we reached}} the place <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> our apparatus, I swung the rope over the wall, and, hooking the grapnel firmly on the inside, {{prepared}} to go down, for, as before, I wished to be under Rectus, if he should slip. But Maiden's Heart {{put his hand on}} my shoulder.|$|R
60|$|I did {{not know}} Guert's intentions, but I saw {{it was time to}} act with decision. We moved swiftly down to the spot <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> the sleigh; and the reader will judge of our horror, when we found it gone! The whole of the low point of the island <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> it, was already covered with cakes of ice that were in motion, and which had doubtless swept off the sleigh during the few minutes that we had been absent! Looking around us, however, we saw an object on the river, a little {{distance}} below, that I fancied was the sleigh, and was about to rush after it, when a voice filled with alarm, took us in another direction. Mary Wallace came out from behind a tree, to which she had fled for safety, and seizing Guert's arm, implored him not to quit her again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} the lunch is {{of the nature of}} the dinner, and that in the country we shall begin lunching <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> off dining." ...|$|E
60|$|Jambres (late 'Asher') {{turned from}} him, {{and he fell}} (still making notes) prone on his face, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> him, as the pace {{was too good to}} inquire.|$|E
6000|$|... 36. Jules. This is the Jules of Noon. His {{history is}} thus carried on beyond the point <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> {{him at the}} close of his {{interview}} with Phene.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aye, aye, sir!' {{said the}} mate, and putting his helm hard down the boom swung across, and the Maria darted {{off like a}} scared seabird into the fog. Looking back {{there was nothing but}} a dim loom to show <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> the great vessel. We could hear, however, the hoarse {{shouting}} of orders and the bustle of men.|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's {{a curious}} fact," [...] he {{continued}} after a pause, during which {{we walked in}} silence towards the spot <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> our comrades--"it's a curious fact that wherever the missionaries get a footin' all these things {{come to an end}} at once, an' the savages take to doin' each other good and singin' psalms, just like Methodists." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{went up on}} {{the inside}} after bait, and had the luck to find some. Crossing the island, we came out at the old {{construction}} camp <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> the canoe. By this time a stiff breeze was blowing and the tide was rising fast. We had our troubles paddling and poling up to the grove of cocoanuts. Opposite this we anchored and began to fish.|$|R
6000|$|... “I am afraid, Elizabeth,” she said, “ {{that we have}} mortified Oliver. He {{is still}} {{standing}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> him, leaning on his rod. Perhaps he thinks us proud.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I really do. You are {{so little}} altered, except to grow big, that I don't feel at all strange {{with you and}} want to begin <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{go back to}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Todd, and you {{can watch}} this elk," [...] said Dave. [...] "I'll ask Todd what we had best do with both animals." ...|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth was alone, {{and still}} {{reclining}} on the sofa, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> last <b>left</b> her. A hand, which exceeded {{all that the}} ingenuity of art could model, in shape and color, veiled her eyes; and the maiden was sitting as if in deep communion with herself. Struck by the attitude and loveliness of the form that met his eye, the young man checked his impatience, and approached her with respect and caution.|$|R
60|$|Round the world! There is much in {{that sound}} to inspire proud feelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through numberless perils {{to the very}} point whence <b>we</b> started, <b>where</b> those that <b>we</b> <b>left</b> behind secure, were all the time before us.|$|R
60|$|This {{also was}} a {{fortunate}} discovery. Jack went down on his knees, and {{with the edge of}} the axe began carefully to force out the nails. But as they were firmly fixed in, and the operation blunted our axe, we carried the oar up with us to the place <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> the rest of our things, intending to burn the wood away from the iron at a more convenient time.|$|R
