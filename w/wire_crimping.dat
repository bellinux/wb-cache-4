40|$|Abstract. Failure {{analysis}} on a strain clamp cracking on 220 kV transmission line {{was carried out}} based on results of macro-observation, mechanical property examination and EDAX analysis. It is concluded that the main reason of the clamp failure lies in incomplete surface cleaning during <b>wire</b> <b>crimping</b> that cause large current flowing through steel cores, heating them and reduced their strength. In addition, oxidation due to residue water for insufficient baking also contributes to the failure. Finally suggestions were put forward...|$|E

40|$|Stapedotomy with {{implantation}} of an alloplastic prosthesis is {{a well-established}} therapy {{for the treatment}} of otosclerosis. Since the middle of 2008, a new Nitinol prosthesis with memory function and superelastic properties has been available which is expected to make fixation on the long process of the incus much easier. The advantage of this prosthesis is that heat-induced <b>wire</b> <b>crimping</b> is no longer necessary and damage to the incus caused by heat is avoided. Since May 2008, laser-assisted stapedotomy with implantation of a Nitinol prosthesis was performed in 21 patients suffering from otosclerosis. The prostheses used for all patients had a size of 4. 5  mm ×  0. 4  mm. The patient collective consisted of 14 women and 7 men {{with a mean age of}} 53. 4  years. Pre- and postoperatively, an ENT examination was carried out followed by an audiological evaluation of the hearing result. In addition, the properties of the prosthesis (“proper fitt”, “handling”, and “overall rating”) were evaluated intraoperatively by means of a test protocol. The Nitinol prosthesis was implanted successfully in all 21 patients. The mean air-bone gap for the frequencies from 0. 5 to 4  kHz was 9. 83  dB postoperatively. Intraoperatively, the fit of the prosthesis was rated as “good to very good”, the handling as “good” and the overall rating of the system was “good to very good”. Our patient collective showed good postoperative hearing results. Due to simple intraoperative handling, especially placing the Nitinol prosthesis in position, the critical work step of crimping is no longer necessary...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a new ultrasonic measurement technique to quantitatively assess <b>wire</b> <b>crimp</b> terminations is discussed. The {{development of}} a prototype instrument, based on a modified, commercially available, crimp tool, is demonstrated for applying this technique when <b>wire</b> <b>crimps</b> are installed. The crimp tool has three separate crimping locations that accommodate the three different ferrule diameters. The crimp tool in this study is capable of <b>crimping</b> <b>wire</b> diameters ranging from 12 to 26 American Wire Gauge (AWG). A transducer design is presented that allows for interrogation of each of the three crimp locations on the crimp tool without reconfiguring the device. An analysis methodology, based on transmitted ultrasonic energy and timing of the first received pulse is shown to correlate to both crimp location in the tool and the AWG of the crimp/ferrule combination. The detectability of a number of the crimp failure pathologies, such as missing strands, partially inserted <b>wires</b> and incomplete <b>crimp</b> compression, is discussed.

40|$|The {{development}} of a new ultrasonic measurement technique to quantitatively assess <b>wire</b> <b>crimp</b> connections is discussed. The amplitude change of a compressional ultrasonic wave propagating through the junction of a <b>crimp</b> connector and <b>wire</b> is shown to correlate with the results of a destructive pull test, which previously has been used to assess <b>crimp</b> <b>wire</b> junction quality. Various crimp junction pathologies (missing wire strands, incorrect wire gauge, incomplete wire insertion in connector) are ultrasonically tested, and their results are correlated with pull tests. Results show that the ultrasonic measurement technique consistently (as evidenced with pull-testing data) predicts good crimps when ultrasonic transmission is above a certain threshold amplitude level. A physics-based model, solved by finite element analysis, describes the compressional ultrasonic wave propagation through the junction during the crimping process.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of a new measurement technique to quantitatively assess the condition of <b>wire</b> <b>crimp</b> connections. This ultrasonic (UT) method transmits high frequency sound waves through the joint under inspection. The wire-crimp region filters and scatters the ultrasonic energy as it passes through the <b>crimp</b> and <b>wire.</b> The resulting output (both time and frequency domains) provides a quantitative measure of the joint quality that is independent and unaffected by current. Crimps of poor mechanical and electrical quality will result in low temporal output and will distort the spectrum into unique and predictable patterns, depending on crimp "quality". This inexpensive, real-time measurement system can provide certification of crimps as they are made and recertification of existing <b>wire</b> <b>crimps</b> currently in service. The measurements for re-certification do not require that the wire be disconnected from its circuit. No other technology exists to measure in-situ the condition of wire joints (no electrical currents through the crimp are used in this analytical technique).

40|$|The {{development}} of a new ultrasonic measurement technique to assess quantitatively <b>wire</b> <b>crimp</b> terminations is discussed. The amplitude change of a compressional ultrasonic wave propagating at right angles to the wire axis and through the junction of a crimp termination is shown to correlate with the results of a destructive pull test, which is a standard for assessing <b>crimp</b> <b>wire</b> junction quality. To demonstrate the technique, the case of incomplete compression of crimped connections is ultrasonically tested, and the results are correlated with pull tests.

50|$|Traditionally, {{screen cloth}} {{was made with}} metal wires woven with a loom. Today, woven cloth is still widely used {{primarily}} because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life. Slotted opening woven cloth is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top woven cloth is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular woven <b>wire,</b> the <b>crimps</b> (knuckles on woven wires) wear out faster {{than the rest of}} the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top woven wire, the cloth wears out equally until half of the wire diameter is worn, resulting in a longer wear life. Unfortunately flat-top woven wire cloth is not widely used because of the lack of crimps that causes a pronounced reduction of passing fines resulting in premature wear of con crushers.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that {{ultrasonic}} inspection provides a means of assessing electrical crimp quality that ensures the electrical and mechanical integrity of an initial crimp before the installation process is completed. The amplitude change of a compressional ultrasonic wave propagating {{at right angles to}} the wire axis and through the junction of a crimp termination was shown to correlate with the results of destructive pull tests, which is a standard for assessing <b>crimp</b> <b>wire</b> junction quality. Of additional concern are crimps made at high speed assembly lines for wiring harnesses, which are used for critical applications, such as in aircraft. During high-speed assembly it is possible that many faulty crimps go undetected until long after assembly, and fail in service. The position and speed of the crimping jaw become factors as the high-speed crimp is formed. The work presented in this paper is designed to cover the more difficult and more subtle area of high-speed crimps by taking into account the rate change of the measurements. Building on the previous work, we present an analysis methodology, based on transmitted ultrasonic energy and timing of the first received pulse that is shown to correlate to the gauge of the crimp/ferrule combination and the position of the crimping jaw. Results demonstrating the detectability of a number of the crimp failure pathologies, such as missing strands, partially inserted <b>wires</b> and incomplete <b>crimp</b> compression, are presented.

5000|$|Assembly of a screw {{connection}} requires some care in workmanship to ensure proper removal of insulation, containment of all wire strands, and the adequate tightening of the screw. If the wire diameter is small {{in relation to}} the size of the screw, the wire may be cut through by the over-tightening of the screw. This is less likely to occur when a wire is clamped between two plates by the action of a screw.

40|$|International audienceBecause of the {{increasing}} size of electrical networks in automotives, the degradation of wires and connectors {{has become a major}} concern. As a matter of fact, severe system failures are often merely due to broken <b>wires,</b> bad <b>crimping</b> or degraded connectors. Furthermore, the difficulty to localize those kinds of defects using nowadays techniques generally leads to costly repair. Reflectometry is a well-known method used to monitor the health of lines and wired networks. Wiring networks can be affected with two types of faults: "soft ones" are created by the change of the impedance along the line due to different kinds of defects (insulation, radial crack, and degradation of connector [...] .) in the wire and "hard ones" which correspond to open and short circuits. For the first type of faults, the frequency-domain response of the faulty wiring presents a modification of the impedance, in the defect location. For that reason, this paper focuses on the application of the reflectometry technique to the broadband characterization of a vibration degraded Cu-Sn connector. Once the Sn plating is removed, the electrical properties of the contact interface are entirely modified. The results presented in this paper show that observing such kind of transition can be used as criteria for estimating the degradation level of the connector...|$|R

Williams Grand Prix had struggled for success in its first years and Jones was entrusted to give them their first taste of it. As well as Williams, he also signed with Haas-Hall for 1978, and competed in a Lola 333CS in the Can-Am series, winning the title. Jones took nine poles in ten races but missed the Laguna Seca race due to a Formula One scheduling conflict. Stand-in Brian Redman finished twelfth in that race after the kill <b>wire</b> was <b>crimped</b> under a valve cover, resulting in intermittent ignition. Of the nine races in which he competed, Jones won five (Atlanta, Mosport, Road America, Mid-Ohio, and Riverside.) He finished second to Elliot Forbes-Robinson at Charlotte after hitting a chicane and losing a spark plug wire, retired through accident at St Jovite and lost a radiator at Watkins Glen. He finished third at Trois-Rivières after losing a shift fork and being stuck with only second and fifth gears on the tight road circuit. At that race, water-injected brakes were first used in Can-Am, developed by the Haas team and copied with varying degrees of success by others. Jones ran one Can-Am race in 1979 (Mid-Ohio), where he and Keke Rosberg finished 1-2, with Jones winning his last Can-Am start. For Williams, his best result that season was a second-place finish at Watkins Glen. Jones helped put the team on the Formula One map in 1979 using the Williams FW07, after winning four races in the span of five events {{near the end of the}} season. Jones finished third in the championship that year, and it was the springboard to an excellent 1980 campaign.

50|$|These {{crossovers}} are wired by hand, in Montreal, by {{skilled and}} experienced technicians. We prefer to mechanically <b>crimp</b> <b>wires</b> rather than solder components into place {{because it simply}} sounds better. Solder affects micro dynamics and clarity but for the times when we must use it we use WBT Silver Solder, regarded as the purest and cleanest in the industry. Crossovers {{are connected to the}} drivers with wire so it is as important as any other part creating the synergy. The wiring inside every single Totem speaker is unique and requires us to use roughly 40 different types. Each and every wire, inside each and every Totem network, feeding each and every Totem driver, has been painstakingly selected by Vince. While they are all different, all are 99.999% oxygen free silver plated copper and Teflon coated so they will never oxidize and keep the electron flow the same over the long life of the speaker. These ultra-high grade wires have also been chosen because the copper has been stretched slowly, allowing the molecular crystals to align themselves in a very cohesive fashion once the speaker has had a proper break in time.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is aimed at developing a very comprehensive system of manufacturing wire splices for automobile wire harnesses. Ultrasonic welding is increasingly being used in various industrial applications. Lack of a scientific data-base of its properties when applied to wire splicing is {{a major reason for}} lack of proper usage by the wiring harness industry and its subsequent acceptance by the end user. This thesis presents various experiments conducted to develop tensile strengths and electrical resistances of various types of ultrasonically welded <b>wire</b> splices. <b>Crimping</b> technology was evaluated for its mechanical strengths and electrical properties by conducting various experiments {{to make it possible for}} the industry to compare it with other alternative splicing technologies. The results are then compared with ultrasonic welding. The next stage of this thesis discusses the economic feasibility of ultrasonic wire splicing. In order to find the number of ultrasonic welding machines required to meet a particular level of demand, which is a prerequisite for establishing the economic feasibility, a virtual model of the process and the manufacturing cell has been prepared and this model was used to study the dynamics of demand and the number of required machines. Simulation in manufacturing-problem-solving is being used very widely by researchers. Proper understanding and visualisation of the future of the factory and understanding and answering various questions related to the adoption of new technology, is another major reason why companies shy away from adopting ultrasonic welding systems. An advanced simulation tool namely QUEST was used to model the wire splice manufacturing cell of Alcatel and simulation studies were conducted to foresee how the production dynamics would be if ultrasonic welding machines were incorporated in place of crimping machines and various what if scenarios were developed and some vital production related questions were answered. Material handling is a major bottleneck in any wiring harness manufacturing environment. Some conceptual designs are presented on automating the task of feeding wires to ultrasonic welding machines and transferring the wire assemblies from welding stations to different work stations, currently being done manually. A wire palletising system was designed to improve the productivity. This thesis concludes that ultrasonic welding could be very effectively used for wire splicing and could be safely used in the manufacture of wiring harnesses for the automobile industry...|$|R
40|$|A {{miniature}} {{latching valve}} has been invented {{to satisfy a}} need for an electrically controllable on/off pneumatic valve that is lightweight and compact and remains in the most recently commanded open or closed state when power is not supplied. The valve includes a poppet that is moved into or out of contact with a seat to effect closure or opening, respectively, of the flow path. Motion of the poppet is initiated by electrical heating of one of two opposing pairs of nickel/titanium shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires above their transition temperature: heated wires contract to their remembered length, applying tension to pull the poppet toward or away from the seat. A latch consisting mainly of a bistable Belleville washer (a conical spring) made of a hardened stainless steel operates between two stable positions corresponding to the fully closed or fully open state, holding the poppet {{in one of these}} positions when power is not applied to either pair of SMA wires. To obtain maximum actuation force and displacement, the SMA wires must be kept in tension. The mounting fixtures at the ends of the wires must support large tensile stresses without creating stress concentrations that would limit the fatigue lives of the wires. An earlier design provided for each <b>wire</b> to be <b>crimped</b> in a conical opening with a conical steel ferrule that was swaged into the opening to produce a large, uniformly distributed holding force. In a subsequent design, the conical ferrule was replaced with a larger crimped cylindrical ferrule depicted in the figure. A major problem in designing the valve was to protect the SMA wires from a bake-out temperature of 300 C. The problem was solved by incorporating the SMA wires into an actuator module that is inserted into a barrel of the valve body and is held in place by miniature clip rings...|$|R
50|$|Self-cleaning {{screen media}} was {{initially}} engineered to resolve screen cloth blinding, clogging and pegging problems. The {{idea was to}} place <b>crimped</b> <b>wires</b> side-by-side on a flat surface, creating openings and then, in some way, holding them together over the support bars (crown bars or bucker bars). This would allow the wires {{to be free to}} vibrate between the support bars, preventing blinding, clogging and pegging of the cloth. Initially, <b>crimped</b> longitudinal <b>wires</b> on self-cleaning cloth were held together over support bars with woven wire. In the 50s, some manufacturers started to cover the woven cross wires with caulking or rubber to prevent premature wear of the crimps (knuckles on woven wires). One of the pioneer products in this category was ONDAP GOMME made by the French manufacturer Giron. During the mid 90s, Major Wire Industries Ltd., a Quebec manufacturer, developed a “hybrid” self-cleaning screen cloth called Flex-Mat, without woven cross wires. In this product, the <b>crimped</b> longitudinal <b>wires</b> are held in place by polyurethane strips. Instead of locking (impeding) the vibration over the support bars with woven cross wires, the polyurethane strips lessens the vibration of the longitudinal wires over the support bars but does not stop it, consequently allowing vibration from hook to hook. Major Wire quickly started to promote this product as a high-performance screen that helped producers screen more in-specification material for less cost and not simply a problem solver. They claimed that the independent vibrating wires helped produce more product compared to a woven wire cloth with the same opening (aperture) and wire diameter. This higher throughput would be {{a direct result of the}} higher vibration frequency of each independent wire of the screen cloth (calculated in hertz) compared to the shaker vibration (calculated in RPM), accelerating the stratification of the material bed. Another benefit that helped the throughput increase is that hybrid self-cleaning screen media offered a better open area percentage than woven wire screen media. Due to its flat surface (no knuckles), hybrid self-cleaning screen media can use a smaller wire diameter for the same aperture than woven wire and still lasts as long, resulting in a greater opening percentage.|$|R
40|$|During {{the early}} {{development}} stage of balloon deployment systems for missions, nichrome wire cable cutters were {{often used in}} place of pyro-actuated cutters. Typically, a nichrome wire is wrapped around a bundle of polymer cables with a low melting point and connected to a relay-actuated electric circuit. The heat from the nichrome reduces {{the strength of the}} cable bundle, which quickly breaks under a mechanical load and can thus be used as a release mechanism for a deployment system. However, the use of hand-made heated nichrome wire for cutters is not very reliable. Often, the wrapped nichrome wire does not cut through the cable because it either pulls away from its power source or does not stay in contact with the cable being cut. Because nichrome is not readily soldered to copper <b>wire,</b> unreliable mechanical <b>crimps</b> are often made to connect the nichrome to an electric circuit. A self-contained device that is reusable and reliable was developed to sever cables for device release or deployment. The nichrome wire in this new device is housed within an enclosure to prevent it from being damaged by handling. The electric power leads are internally connected within the unit to the nichrome wire using a screw terminal connection. A bayonet plug, a quick and secure method of connecting the cutter to the power source, is used to connect the cutter to the power leads similar to those used in pyro-cutter devices. A small ceramic tube [0. 25 -in. wide 0. 5 -in. long (. 6. 4 -mm wide 13 -mm long) ] houses a spiraled nichrome wire that is heated when a cable release action is required. The wire is formed into a spiral coil by wrapping it around a mandrel. It is then laid inside the ceramic tube so that it fits closely to the inner surface of the tube. The ceramic tube provides some thermal and electrical insulation so that most of the heat generated by the wire is directed toward the cable bundle {{in the center of the}} spiral. The ceramic tube is cemented into an aluminum block, which holds it in position. The leads of the nichrome wire are attached to screw terminals that connect them to power leads. A bayonet plug mounted at the bottom of the rectangular block connects the power leads to a relay circuit. A thin aluminum shell encloses the entire structure, leaving access points to attach to the bayonet plug and to feed a cable into the cylinder. The access holes for the deployment cable are a smaller diameter than the nichrome coil to prevent the cable from coming in direct contact with the nichrome when loaded. It uses the same general method of severing a cable with a heated wire as was used previously, but implements it in such a way that it is more reliable and less prone to failure. It creates a mechanism to create repeatability that was nonexistent in the previous method...|$|R
