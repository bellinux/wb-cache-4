2500|$|Hip-hop {{journalist}} Harry Allen {{called the}} album a big {{turning point in}} hip-hop where you didn’t have to be [...] "tough". A Tribe Called Quest member Ali Shaheed Muhammad further elaborated that [...] "LL Cool J, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, N.W.A, even Public Enemy, had a tough guy image. It was this bravado {{at the time that}} all the hip-hop artists had. People’s instinctive Travels wasn’t any of that. We weren’t trying to be tough guys. It was about having fun, being lighthearted, being witty, being poetic. Just being good with one another. That’s what <b>we</b> <b>presented.</b> Just be. Just exist. Be comfortable in your own skin. People’s Instinctive Travels was about celebrating you, whoever you are".|$|E
2500|$|Security {{researchers}} Alexander Sotirov and Mark Dowd {{have developed}} a technique that bypasses {{many of the new}} memory-protection safeguards in Windows Vista, such as address space layout randomization (ASLR). The result of this is that any already existing buffer overflow bugs that, in Vista, were previously not exploitable due to such features, may now be exploitable. This is not in itself a vulnerability: as Sotirov notes, [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>presented</b> is weaknesses in the protection mechanism. It still requires the system under attack to have a vulnerability. Without the presence of a vulnerability these techniques don’t really [...] anything." [...] The vulnerability Sotirov and Dowd used in their paper as an example was the 2007 animated cursor bug, CVE-2007-0038.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2004, {{an unknown}} entity calling himself [...] "Steev Mike" [...] – a {{pseudonym}} Andrew W.K. had used for himself on {{several of his}} releases – launched a number of websites accusing W.K. of fraud and not being behind his own career. After W.K.'s official website was hacked, apparently by the same entity, W.K. attempted to address the confusion in a public statement in which he wrote, [...] "PLEASE DON'T BELIEVE STEEV MIKE. I USED TO CALL MYSELF STEEV MIKE A LONG TIME AGO AND IT'S NOTHING NOW. Someone is trying to confuse you and make me look bad." [...] In May 2009, W.K. discussed the accusations {{in an interview with}} British magazine Front, in which he stated that [...] "the nature of how <b>we</b> <b>presented</b> my initial offerings caused some confusion, even though I tried to make it as straightforward as possible," [...] and: [...] "Different people I've worked with and different parts of my back story have gotten twisted and changed. But I made the music on my albums – I had a lot of help from incredible people, but not the kind of help that some people think." [...] Wilkes-Krier has denied various theories accusing him of being a fake entity through his official social media accounts.|$|E
2500|$|Abhorring {{all forms}} of {{prejudice}} and rejecting any system of segregation, the Bahá'í Faith was introduced on a one-to-one basis and the community quietly grew during the apartheid years, without publicity. [...] Despite {{the nature of the}} politics of that time, <b>we</b> <b>presented</b> our teachings on unity and the oneness of humankind to prominent individuals in politics, commerce and academia and leaders of thought including State Presidents.... oth individual Bahá'ís and our administrative institutions were continually watched by the security police.... Our activities did not include opposition to the previous Government for involvement in partisan politics and opposition to government are explicitly prohibited by the sacred Texts of our Faith.... During the time when the previous Government prohibited integration within our communities, rather than divide into separate administrative structures for each population group, we opted to limit membership of the Bahá'í Administration to the black adherents who were and remain in the majority of our membership and thereby placed the entire Bahá'í community under the stewardship of its black membership.... The pursuit of our objectives of unity and equality has not been without costs. [...] The [...] "white" [...] Bahá'ís were often ostracized by their white neighbours for their association with [...] "non-whites". The Black Bahá'ís were subjected to scorn by their black compatriots for their lack of political action and their complete integration with their white Bahá'í brethren. [...] The most tragic loss to our community was the brutal execution of four of our adherents, at our places of worship, three in Mdantsane and one in Umtata.|$|E

60|$|Therefore, {{for my part}} I {{was thankful}} when at last, in Zululand, we fell in with some traders whom I knew, who hired us one of their wagons.
