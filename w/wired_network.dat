The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a <b>wired</b> <b>network,</b> with one computer's iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for HDMI and component video, and played video at a maximum resolution of 720p. On May 30, 2007, a 160 GB hard disk drive was released alongside the existing 40GB model. A software update released on January 15, 2008, allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.|$|E

2500|$|In Shadowrun, Fourth Edition, the Matrix {{rules have}} changed, {{thanks to the}} setting's {{constant}} evolution and a drive to match real world technological developments. After the second Matrix crash in 2064, Matrix technology was {{moved away from the}} <b>wired</b> <b>network</b> and led into a wireless technology. The most noticeable difference between the Matrix in the 2070s and the earlier editions is that wireless technology has become completely ubiquitous. Communications and Matrix access is provided through Wi-Fi nodes placed throughout the infrastructure of just about every city on Earth, fulfilling a service similar to contemporary cell sites—but as these nodes are as numerous as telephone poles, only a tiny percentage of their range is necessary. The nodes of all electronic devices a person carries are connected in a similar manner, creating a Personal Area Network (PAN). People access their PAN with their Commlink, a combination personal computer/cell phone/PDA/wireless device available either as a brain implant or a head-mounted display. This access can be the total sensory immersion common to cyberpunk fiction, or a sensory enhancement by which the virtual features of one's physical surroundings can be perceived and manipulated. The Matrix of the 2070s is thus not only a virtual reality, but an augmented or mixed reality. Cyberdecks are obsolete, so [...] "deckers" [...] have once again become [...] "hackers". In turn, the otaku of previous versions (deckers who did not need decks to access the Matrix) have been reworked into technomancers, who possess an innate connection to the Matrix that permits them to access the wireless network without hardware.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—. Wireless data {{networks}} have spread between home users and companies in an increasing fashion. The main reason behind this fast adaptation {{is due to}} the nature of wireless networks where it provides the flexibility and freedom that <b>wired</b> <b>networks</b> lack. The increasing of bandwidth capabilities has inspired people to think seriously about replacing <b>wired</b> <b>networks</b> with wireless networks especially in places where it is hard or expensive to have <b>wired</b> <b>networks.</b> One of the main places that can benefit from these ideas are rural areas, where <b>wired</b> <b>networks</b> infrastructure is either difficult or impossible to create due to physical obstacles. With continual advances in technology, coupled with increasing price/performance advantages, wireless accessibility is being deployed increasingly. This topic discusses the security threats and risks associated with wireless networks, and outlines a number of best practices for deploying wireless networks and home Finally, a set of security tips is provided for end-users surfing the Internet using wireless networks...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{applying}} area of ad hoc networks has expanded, {{and demands}} for inter-connection with <b>wired</b> <b>networks</b> {{and the same}} service offered in <b>wired</b> <b>networks</b> have risen. In the integration of ad hoc <b>networks</b> and <b>wired</b> <b>networks,</b> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) {{will be used as}} a transport layer protocol because TCP is generally used in <b>wired</b> <b>networks.</b> However, when TCP is used in an ad hoc network, it is known that the throughput of TCP will deteriorate be-cause of the high error rate of wireless channels and the collisions of packets. Many other studies convert TCP itself, or propose a new transport layer protocol to solve these problems. However, {{we do not want to}} modify TCP itself because seamless communication between <b>wired</b> <b>networks</b> and ad hoc networks is desirable. Therefore, in order to increase TCP performance in an ad hoc network, support from the lower layers of the transport layer is required. In this thesis, we propose two techniques that approach from the data link layer. First, we focus on the frequent collisions of the opposite direction’s packets of data and ACK. We reduce the collisions of packets by combining a data packet and an ACK packet and transmitting them simultaneously. With this technique, we can increase the efficiency of wireless channel utilization...|$|R

40|$|We {{exploited}} {{the combination of}} dry deposition of monolayer of 2 D (two dimensional) templates, lift-up transfer of 2 D template onto flat surfaces and evaporation lithography [1] to fabricate gold micro- and submicron size <b>wire</b> <b>networks.</b> The approach relies upon the defect free dry deposition of 2 D monolayer of latex particles [2] on patterned silicon template and flat PDMS-substrate to create square centered and honey-comb <b>wire</b> <b>networks</b> respectively. The process is followed by lift-up transfer of 2 D latex crystal on glass substrate. Subsequently, {{a small amount of}} AuNP-suspension is doped on top of the transferred crystal; the suspension is allowed to spread instantaneously and dried at low temperature. The liquid evaporates uniformly to the direction perpendicular to glass substrate. During evaporation, AuNPs are de-wetted along with the movement of liquid to self-assemble in-between the inter-particle spaces and therefore, giving rise to liquid-bridge networks which upon delayed evaporation, transforms into <b>wire</b> <b>networks.</b> The approach is used to fabricate both micro- and submicron wire-networks by simply changing the template dimensions. One of the prime motives behind this study is to down-scale the existing particle array template-based evaporation lithography process to fabricate connected gold <b>wire</b> <b>networks</b> at both micro- and submicron scale. Secondly, the idea of combining the patterned silicon wafer with lifted latex particle template creates an opportunity to clean and res-use the patterned wafer more often and thereby, saving fabrication time and resources. Finally, we illustrated the validity of this approach by creating an easy and high-speed approach to develop gold <b>wire</b> <b>networks</b> on a flexible substrate with a thin deposited adhesive. These advances will not only serve as a platform to scale up the production, but also demonstrated that the fabrication method can produce metallic <b>wire</b> <b>networks</b> of different scale and onto a variety of substrates...|$|R
