Their intent was to deal cooperatively with wool buyers to regularize pricing and avoid wide swings in the supply-demand situation.|$|R

The association had been formed in 1865, and became more active in the 1880s {{as a response to}} the decline in domestic <b>wool</b> production; <b>wool</b> <b>growers</b> faced increasing overseas competition, and had gone from 50 million sheep producing wool in 1883 to 40 million in 1888.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of a reserve price scheme in 1970, the interest in wool marketing previously shown by agricultural economists has not been maintained outside the public service and the wool industry itself. Nor is the subject as divisive amongst <b>wool</b> <b>growers</b> with, in general, 'orderly marketing' now acceptable to all factions of <b>wool</b> <b>growers.</b> The history of wool marketing discussion in Australia is reviewed and some reasons for this changing climate of opinion are discussed.

5000|$|The {{house was}} built by, and was a home of, Robert Edgar Jack (died 1916), who was [...] "a {{prominent}} banker and land developer and <b>wool</b> <b>grower</b> in Central California." [...] The house was deemed significant for its association with Jack. Jack lived there from 1882 until his death. Jack, as a banker and a leading citizen, was quite involved in promoting the development of railroad through the central coast, and also benefited economically from the railroad. The house is also perhaps of significance architecturally as {{a good example of}} Italianate architecture.|$|E
5000|$|Jack {{studied at}} Maine Wesleyan Seminary, and he later was an {{accountant}} at a shipping house in New York City. In the Civil War he {{enlisted in the}} 56th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and he served in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, during the Battle of Gettysburg and then in New York to quell [...] "anti-Negro riots" [...] there.

When that property was subdivided, the two bought the Cholame land. Jack married Hollister's daughter, Lucy Ellen (Nellie) in 1870 and became the largest <b>wool</b> <b>grower</b> in Central California, later switching to cattle and agriculture. Jack organized the County Bank of San Luis Obispo.|$|E

5000|$|Wool was weighed, conveyed, classed, baled, branded, stored, displayed, marketed and sold. [...] Within {{multi-storey}} ‘wool-warehouses’ bales {{were moved}} on trolleys, by steam or hydraulic lifts and dropped down chutes. Within the one-storey modern wool store, wool {{was moved by}} vehicles. Improvements made to Woolstores in the 1940s included metal wool gates for dividing the wool, electric lifts and elevators, wool presses and wool drops. [...] Wool brokers charged growers a fee for handling and selling the wool in the store. Brokers also provided a range of other services such as credit facilities, banking, advice, and hotel and travel bookings. They linked the <b>wool</b> <b>grower</b> {{to the outside world}} of commerce and international trade. As buildings that were visited by clients, whether they be buyers or suppliers, the stores had to provide a reasonable level of amenity and could not simply be regarded as large sheds. Changing rooms and showers were also installed in the larger Woolstores for use of buyers and growers and of course the offices of wool valuers.|$|E

5000|$|The Royal Canberra Show {{can trace}} its origins {{back to the}} first events {{organised}} by the Ginninderra Farmers' Union, which was formed in 1905. At first, it ran sporting events at Ginninderra, including ploughing matches, but in 1909 it held its first annual agricultural show. These shows were discontinued because of the First World War, despite the 1915 event being attended by 1,200 people and raising much-needed funds for the war effort. One of the driving forces, from the days of the Ginninderra Farmers' Union until 1944, was the Ginninderra blacksmith, Harry Curran, father of Babe Curran of Deasland, the district's preeminent <b>wool</b> <b>grower.</b> The Advance Hall and District Association organised a small district show in 1924 and 1925. The show of 1927 is officially recognised by the Royal National Capital Agricultural Society as the [...] "inaugural" [...] Canberra Show. The show continued to grow: the first two-day show was held in 1931, and the 1932 show was opened by Prime Minister J.A. Lyons. After a hiatus in the Second World War, the show resumed with the support of leading sheep breeder Sir Walter Merriman. In 1964 the show moved to its permanent home at the Canberra Showground. The Show was given [...] "Royal" [...] status in 1979.|$|E
50|$|About 7% of Australian wool is sold {{by private}} treaty on farms or to local wool-handling facilities.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{primarily}} concerned with differences in returns per pound of wool accruing to Montana wool growers by the alternative methods of sale to various types of buyers. The results presented in the table's indicate that no appreciable difference {{can be attributed to}} selling wool either on a graded or ungraded basis. They do indicate an advantage for the farm flock grower, who produced less than 3, 000 pounds, to sell his wool by consignment to local wool pools. The results also imply an advantage for the farm flock grower producing from 3, 000 to 5, 000 pounds and above, to sell their wool directly to buyers. The results of this study also indicate that net returns are largest on both direct and consignment sales to manufacturers, implying that returns are highest " to growers when handler's margins are not a cost to manufacturers. This indication must-be qualified, however, because of the limited number of manufacturers who bought wool in the state in 1956. In certain instances it may be less costly for the manufacturer to buy in volume from handlers in the central markets. The price paid for wool is affected by the competitive structure of the market and by supply and demand conditions within the market. This study points out that the <b>wool</b> <b>grower</b> can sell all of his wool at the market price, but can sell non...|$|E
