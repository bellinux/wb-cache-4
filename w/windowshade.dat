5000|$|<b>WindowShade</b> was {{a control}} panel {{extension}} for the classic Mac OS that allowed a user to double-click a window's title bar to [...] "roll up" [...] the window like a <b>windowshade.</b> When {{the window was}} [...] "rolled up", only the title bar of the window was visible; the window's content area disappeared, allowing easier manipulation of the windows on the screen.|$|E
50|$|It {{debuted in}} System 7.5, but {{disappeared}} in Mac OS 8, when the feature was implemented {{as a part}} of the Appearance Manager. A widget was added to the title bar in addition to the double-click method of collapsing a window. The entire feature disappeared with the release of Mac OS X; windows could be minimized to the Dock on the new system or, starting with Mac OS X 10.3, moved aside with Exposé. However, several third-party utilities, such as <b>WindowShade</b> X for Unsanity's Application Enhancer software, have brought the ability back to Mac OS. It has since reappeared as a commercial haxie and offers other features, like translucent windows and minimize-in-place. <b>WindowShade</b> X from Unsanity stopped working in Mac OS 10.7, and other third-party developers have since released applications such as WindowMizer from RGB World that keep the <b>WindowShade</b> feature working on Mac OS X 10.6 and greater.|$|E
50|$|The <b>WindowShade</b> {{control panel}} itself {{stems from a}} {{third-party}} utility originally written for System 6.0.7 by Rob Johnston. Apple purchased the rights to this software from the developer for use in System 7.5.|$|E
5000|$|Tami Erin as Pippilotta Delicatessa <b>Windowshade</b> Mackrelmint Efraim's Daughter [...] "Pippi" [...] Longstocking, a spunky nine {{year old}} girl who arrives on land {{after her father}} is lost at sea. When Pippi was a baby her mother died.|$|E
5000|$|<b>WindowShade,</b> {{another former}} {{shareware}} control panel, provided {{the ability to}} condense a window down to its title bar. Introduced as a [...] "minimize" [...] feature to compete with Windows 95 as Mac OS had no taskbar or dock.|$|E
50|$|Shareware {{products}} {{exist that}} provided some {{features of the}} Appearance Manager before they were offered directly in the Appearance Control Panel. Church Windows and Décor provide desktop picture functionality. <b>WindowShade,</b> which had been purchased by Apple and bundled with System 7, provides collapse functionality. When windows collapse, they “roll up”, leaving only the title bar.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{most popular}} {{software}} includes ShapeShifter and <b>WindowShade,</b> utilising their freeware Application Enhancer module. On February 24, 2008, beta versions {{of some of}} their major products were introduced which were compatible with Leopard, bringing Leopard compatibility to their product line for the first time after a long wait of over three months since the introduction of Leopard.|$|E
5000|$|After Jerry must save Tuffy from Tom (by {{splitting}} Tom in {{two with}} an axe), he prepares to send Tuffy back to François in disgrace. However, as Tuffy is walking back home, Tom ambushes Jerry. Tuffy hears {{the attack and}} stops it by chopping off the tip of Tom’s tail, with Tuffy exclaiming [...] "Touché, Pussy Cat!" [...] When Tom pins Tuffy to the wall in retaliation, Jerry saves him by causing Tom’s tunic to roll up like a <b>windowshade.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Application Enhancer (APE) is a {{software}} program released by Unsanity for Apple's Mac OS X operating system. Application Enhancer provides a framework that allows third-party developers to write [...] "haxies" [...] for Mac OS X. It also provides a daemon to load haxies when certain applications are launched. These haxies, or plugins, are known as application enhancer modules, or APEs. Once the APE is loaded by the daemon, the module modifies the behavior of an existing application. Examples include allowing the classic Mac OS <b>WindowShade</b> behavior, or adding/removing Mac OS X's brushed aluminum theme to/from all applications.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1957, {{songwriter}} Bob Crewe saw {{a couple}} embracing through a <b>windowshade</b> {{as he passed}} on a train. He quickly set about turning the image into a song. Frank Slay, who owned the small Philadelphia record label XYZ with Crewe, added lyrics, and they soon had a complete song ready to record. The story has frequently been reported that Slay heard The Rays audition for Cameo-Parkway Records, for which he worked, and immediately decided {{that they were the}} perfect group for [...] "Silhouettes". However, Slay and Crewe were actually already familiar with the group, as [...] "Silhouettes" [...] was their third single with them.|$|E
5000|$|Elder {{was known}} as an inveterate prankster. As a child, he once cut out paper silhouettes of a man {{carrying}} a knife and a woman. Attaching them to a rotating record turntable, he projected their image onto the <b>windowshade,</b> and began screaming. People {{on the outside of}} the building saw what they thought was an assailant chasing his victim around the room. EC colorist Marie Severin recalled, [...] "Will used to have this painting of a deer... I guess it was one of those 5-and-10-cent store things. It had a deer, a mountain, some trees, a path, flowers and the like, and he'd change it with the seasons! If it was winter he'd paint snow on the deer, and then he would paint over that and put the sun out for the springtime with flowers coming up." [...] Kurtzman recounted the time Elder and his playmates found a stock of fresh meat as a child: [...] "These kids collected a bunch of clothes and they dressed the meat in clothes and spread the combination of meat and clothes along the right-of-way for about half a mile on the railroad tracks. Then Willy started shrieking at the top of his voice that Mikey had fallen down onto the railroad tracks. Naturally every woman for miles around who had a son named Mike went out of their mind, seeing this mess of clothes and meat along the tracks... This is the kind of kid that Willy was." [...] Years later, Elder still had a gruesome side to his humor, sending his wife a heart from a slaughterhouse as a Valentine's Day gift.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Jerry happily {{emerges from}} his darkroom, having made {{numerous}} {{copies of his}} photo of Tom framing Spike. He plants copies of the photos in places where George or Joan are likely to see them. Realizing that Jerry knows the truth about him framing Spike, Tom is forced to use the guise of being a recklessly playful cat as he swoops in to destroy the photos before George and/or Joan see them: he tears up George's newspaper, steals Joan's new dress and covers George's eyes to stop them seeing the photos, resulting in him nearly getting {{kicked out of the}} house when George mistakes him for Joan and kisses him (causing him to flip out upon realizing just who it was). When Jerry slips a photo inside a cake Joan is finishing, Tom reaches inside to grab it but is foiled by Joan, who asks if he wants to taste it. When he nods, she holds out the knife she had been using to ice the cake, only for the cat to somehow eat the whole thing in one bite and then swallow it with some difficulty. He is forced to flee the kitchen as Joan hurls dishes, buckets and a rolling pin at him for eating her cake. To make matters worse, Tom taunts Spike from inside, but Spike ducks out of sight as George comes along which makes it look like Tom is making silly faces and actions out the window for no reason. Thinking Tom has completely lost it, George snaps at him (almost scaring the cat to death in the process). He orders Tom to stop making those faces unless he wants the neighbors to think he's gone crazy and pulling down the <b>windowshade</b> to reveal four more photos stuck on it. To make sure George doesn't see them, Tom shoots up with the shade just as George comes back and wonders where 'that goofy cat' has gone now.|$|E
40|$|A highly {{reflective}} {{insulating material}} developed to protect NASA spacecraft from intense solar radiation {{is now being}} used in a commercially-available window-insulating product which offers significant energy savings. Called Nunsun, it is a thin metallized film adhesively bonded to windows of homes, office buildings, schools, industrial plants and other facilities; the film reflects the sun's heat and glare outward, thereby cutting down on energy costs for cooling. Trained dealer personnel can affix the film to windows of any size in minutes (right), converting ordinary glass to heat-reflective mirror glass {{at a fraction of}} the cost. Manufactured by National Metallizing, a division of Standard Packaging Corporation, Cranbury, New Jersey, Nunsun is also available in <b>windowshade</b> form...|$|E
