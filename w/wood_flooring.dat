5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{is located on}} Broad Street {{in the town of}} Montgomery, Powys, a short distance from Montgomery Castle. There is a separate dining room and bar/lounge area in the restaurant. The dining room has low-slung beams, and an open brick fireplace, around which are placed Laura Ashley sofas. The chestnut <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> of the restaurant was created from a fallen tree on the Francis family farm. There is room to serve up to 40 diners, with 12 members of staff working there. There are three en-suite rooms available to hire on a hotel basis.|$|E
5|$|In {{its native}} range, the {{sycamore}} {{is associated with}} a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, but these are not always present in areas to which it has been introduced. It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an amenity tree and produces a hard-wearing, creamy-white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> and kitchen utensils. It also makes good firewood. The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and honey is made by bees collecting the nectar.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUnder {{different}} heating conditions, {{the composite}} <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> and pine carbonization samples were prepared, and the charring surface morphology, crack width, carbonization depth and average charring rate were compared and analyzed. The {{results show that}} under the thermal radiation condition, the carbonization of composite <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> is the most serious, and cracks distributed radially; under the arc condition, the compound <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> is difficult to ignite, and the carbonization layer is shallow; small amount spilled gasoline combustion has little effect on carbonization degree, but the char is obvious at the corner; at the same heating condition, the carbonization degree of pine was more serious than the composite <b>wood</b> <b>floor,</b> and the carbonized surface morphology had significant differences...|$|R

25|$|A wood {{surface is}} ideal for social dancing if {{maintained}} properly and is also standard for many indoor sports. Engineered wood is normally used nowadays for <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> as it is less liable to warp or shrink and is more economic.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if transverse vibration methods could be used to effectively assess the structural integrity of <b>wood</b> <b>floors</b> as component systems. A total of 10 <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> systems, including 3 laboratory-built floor sections and 7 in-place floors in historic buildings, were tested. A forced vibration method was applied to the floor systems to determine the natural frequency and assess the stiffness and structural integrity. The results show that deterioration in <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> systems can be identified by measuring damped natural frequency of those floors. The forced vibration method used in this research holds promise as an inspection tool...|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} design had {{a complex of}} hipped roofs and an open belfry atop the tower. In 1927 fire destroyed the tower and severely damaged the roof. A team of architects who supervised the rebuilding changed the design to its current appearance. They also initiated major work on the interior, intended to fireproof the building. Much of this consisted of replacing structural wood with other materials. <b>Wood</b> <b>flooring</b> was replaced with terrazzo, staircases with marble, and doors were clad in metal. The chimneys were capped.|$|E
25|$|The Church of the Presidents is {{the last}} {{remaining}} structure associated with all seven presidents who vacationed in Long Branch. In 1999 the Long Branch Historical Museum Association began fundraising efforts to save the building. The {{first step was to}} stabilize the building to prevent it from collapsing. The <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> was removed and reinforced concrete was poured to support the building. Steel supports replaced wooden pilasters that had deteriorated. The stained-glass windows, original altar, organ, and handmade pews were removed and put in storage during renovation.|$|E
25|$|Goodwin Heart Pine is {{a company}} located in Micanopy, Florida and specializes in {{reclaiming}} antique heart pine and heart cypress from rivers and old buildings to produce lumber for flooring, stair parts and millwork.

Goodwin Heart Pine also produces precision-engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring,</b> from these specialty woods. The company has a unique focus of harvesting resin-saturated deadhead logs from rivers that loggers felled in the 1800s, which sank due to their high resin content. The interior of the reclaimed logs is typically preserved by the tree's resin.|$|E

25|$|Thirteen steel columns, {{arranged}} in a circle {{in the center of}} the building, support the dome overhead. The columns are irregularly spaced to accommodate building's site and avoid blocking entrances. Horizontal steel beams run outward from these columns to the outer walls, supporting the upper floors. Each of the columns was coated in a thick layer of plaster, with vertical conduits and air ducts embedded and hidden in the plaster. On the first floor, the plaster-coasted columns were clad in marble, but merely painted on the second and third floors. Each of the upper floors was constructed with a concrete base, on top of which were placed brick and red tile arched supports. A wood floor was constructed atop the arched supports, and in parts of the second floor marble tile was laid atop the <b>wood</b> <b>flooring.</b> Intricate embossed bronze brackets supported the second-floor balcony. The first floor ceiling, formed by the second floor balcony, was decorated with highly detailed bronze coffers.|$|E

The reference to the [...] "white maple" [...] in the English Christmas carol, [...] "Wassail, Wassail All Over the Town", [...] in [...] "Our bowl, it is made of the white maple tree" [...] presumably refers not to the silver or white maple (A. saccharinum), which does not occur naturally in Europe, but to the white wood of the sycamore or the field maple, Acer campestre.|$|E
500|$|In about 1981, {{descendants}} of William and Florence Dowse decided {{to restore the}} house. [...] The project was spearheaded {{by two of the}} Dowse sons, Philip and Curtis, and supported by the Comstock Community Club. [...] In the course of several years, over $6,000 was raised for the project. [...] A fence was built to exclude cattle from the house. [...] The roof was repaired and reshingled. [...] The exterior walls were reinforced and repaired with new sod blocks, cut with a horse-drawn plow about [...] from the house; additional concrete coating was applied in places. [...] The porch walls were re-shingled, and doors and windows were replaced. [...] Inside the house, the manure covering the floors was removed, and the <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> repaired; the plaster on the walls was patched or replaced, up to 20 layers of old wallpaper was removed, and new wallpaper applied in places. [...] Pioneer-era interior furnishings such as a cast-iron stove were installed. [...] In May 1982, the house was opened as a museum.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary means}} of {{inspecting}} buildings and other structures is to evaluate each structure member individually. This is a time-consuming and expensive process, particularly if sheathing or other covering materials must be removed to access the structural members. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if a low frequency vibration method could be used to effectively assess the structural performance of <b>wood</b> <b>floors</b> as component systems. Twelve <b>wood</b> <b>floors</b> were constructed with solid sawn wood joists in the laboratory and tested with both vibration and static load methods. The results indicated that the forced vibration method was capable of measuring the fundamental natural frequency (bending mode) of the <b>wood</b> <b>floors</b> investigated. An analytical model derived from the flexural beam theory was found to fit the physics of the floor structures and can be used to correlate natural frequency to section modulus (E 1 product) of the floor systems...|$|R
