5|$|Dysprosium is a {{rare earth}} element that has a metallic, bright silver luster. It is soft enough to be cut <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife,</b> and can be {{machined}} without sparking if overheating is avoided.

5|$|In 2012, two {{brothers}} {{in their early}} 20s, one of them armed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife,</b> attacked a 63-year-old man in a town in the Northern Bohemian borderland. He shot both attackers with his legally owned pistol, killing one of them. The police closed the case as legitimate self-defense six months later and brought charges against the surviving attacker.|$|E

5|$|Lithium metal is soft {{enough to}} be cut <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife.</b> When cut, it {{possesses}} a silvery-white color that quickly changes to gray as it oxidizes to lithium oxide.

5|$|Pure thulium metal has a bright, silvery luster, which tarnishes on {{exposure}} to air. The metal {{can be cut}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife,</b> as it has a Mohs hardness of 2 to 3; it is malleable and ductile. Thulium is ferromagnetic below 32K, antiferromagnetic between 32 and 56K, and paramagnetic above 56K.|$|E
5|$|After the match, which Galatasaray won 4–1 on penalties, {{approximately}} 300 Arsenal {{fans in the}} Finsbury Park area of Islington in London attacked Turkish {{restaurants and}} businesses, with bottles being used to break windows. They then broke into an apartment building to threaten Kosovan refugees <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife,</b> mistakenly believing them to be Turkish. Six people were arrested and three Metropolitan Police officers were injured. In Turkey, nine people were accidentally shot and injured by Galatasaray fans firing guns in celebration despite police warning them not to.|$|E

5|$|Born in Kentucky, Bowie {{spent most}} of his life in Louisiana, where he was raised and where he later worked as a land speculator. His rise to fame began in 1827 on reports of the Sandbar Fight. What began as a duel between two other men {{deteriorated}} into a melée in which Bowie, having been shot and stabbed, killed the sheriff of Rapides Parish with a large knife. This, and other stories of Bowie's prowess <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife,</b> led to the widespread popularity of the Bowie knife.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, A {{man with}} {{criminal}} {{and drug abuse}} history attempted to rob a store in Prague, armed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife.</b> He managed to stab the store owner, but was shot by his wife and later died in hospital. Police ruled out the shooting as legitimate self-defense. This case is notable, because the store the man attempted to rob was a gun store, leading many to speculations that the robbery was, in fact, a suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|Potassium is {{the second}} least dense metal after lithium. It is a soft solid with a low melting point, and can be easily cut <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife.</b> Freshly cut {{potassium}} is silvery in appearance, but it begins to tarnish toward gray immediately on exposure to air. In a flame test, potassium and its compounds emit a lilac color with a peak emission wavelength of 766.5 nanometers.|$|E

5|$|Thallium is {{malleable}} and sectile {{enough to}} be cut <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> at room temperature. It has a metallic luster that, when exposed to air, quickly tarnishes to a bluish-gray tinge, resembling lead. It may be preserved by immersion in oil. A heavy layer of oxide builds up on thallium if left in air. In the presence of water, thallium hydroxide is formed. Sulfuric and nitric acid dissolve thallium rapidly to make the sulfate and nitrate salts, while hydrochloric acid forms an insoluble thallium(I) chloride layer.|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife.</b> Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that of}} soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals.|$|E
5|$|After the arrest, Nhung and Nghĩa {{sat with}} the {{brothers}} in the APC, and the convoy departed for Tân Sơn Nhứt. Before the convoy had departed for the church, Minh {{was reported to have}} gestured to Nhung with two fingers. This was taken to be an order to kill both brothers. The convoy stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip, where by all accounts the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by Đôn determined that Nghĩa had shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi-automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the bodies <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife.</b>|$|E

5|$|Beauchamp {{was convicted}} of the murder and sentenced to hang. The morning of the execution, {{he and his wife}} {{attempted}} a double suicide by stabbing themselves <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> she had smuggled into prison. She was successful; he was not. Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows before he could bleed to death, and was hanged on July 7, 1826. The bodies of Jereboam and Anna Beauchamp were arranged in an embrace and buried in a single coffin, as they had requested. The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy inspired fictional works such as Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play, Politian, and Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E

Ned orders his men to arrest Cersei and Joffrey. As both sides prepare to fight, the City Watch slaughters the Stark men while Littlefinger holds Ned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> at his throat, telling Ned {{that he should have}} listened to Littlefinger's advice about distrusting him.|$|E
5|$|Calcium metal melts at 842°C and boils at 1494°C, {{higher than}} its {{adjacent}} group 2 metals do. It crystallises in the face-centered cubic arrangement like strontium; above 450°C, it changes to an anisotropic hexagonal close-packed arrangement like magnesium. The density of 1.55g·cm−3 {{is the lowest}} in its group, with others decreasing towards it. Calcium can be cut <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knife</b> with effort, although it is still harder than lead. While calcium is a poorer conductor of electricity than copper or aluminium by volume, it is a better conductor than both of them by mass due to its very low density. Although it is infeasible for terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with atmospheric oxygen, its use as a conductor in space has been considered.|$|E
