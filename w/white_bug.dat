2500|$|The album {{expanded}} on L.D. 50, with a {{wider range}} of riffs, tempos, moods and vocals. Because of this experimentation, Entertainment Weekly called this album more [...] "user-friendly" [...] than its predecessor {{and it was one of}} 2002's most acclaimed heavy-metal albums. The music video for the single [...] "Not Falling" [...] demonstrated the Mudvayne's change in appearance from L. D. 50, with the musicians transformed into veined creatures with <b>white,</b> egg-colored <b>bug</b> eyes.|$|R
5|$|Viruses and pests affect {{yield of}} Bt cotton varieties. Cotton leaf curl virus, {{which is a}} plant {{pathogenic}} virus of the family Geminiviridae, stunts plant growth seriously affecting yield. Pests like <b>White</b> Fly, Mealy <b>Bugs,</b> Aphids, Pink Boll Worm infect the plants reducing yield.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, a new bug {{with more}} of a {{horizontal}} orientation was introduced. The CBS Sports logo that previously adorned {{the top of the}} bug was replaced with the CBS [...] "eye" [...] logo in blue and <b>white.</b> The <b>bug</b> was divided into two rectangles, the left one housing the time and quarter and the right the teams and scores, all in white text on blue. As in years past, the down and distance were contained in a pop-out box, also in the blue and white scheme.|$|R
50|$|Various insects may {{penetrate}} the hard {{skin of the}} gourd. External structures appear to prevent damage by most insects and the plant is highly resistant to cucumber beetle and squash <b>bug.</b> <b>White</b> molds seem to result in smooth surface areas and black molds often form circular patterns.|$|R
50|$|The song {{has three}} music videos: two {{official}} and one unofficial. The first video depicts the band being transformed into veiny creatures with <b>white,</b> egg-colored <b>bug</b> eyes and performing {{the song in}} a dark chamber. Additionally featured are images of parasites traveling through someone's bloodstream. The second video, directed by Dean Karr, features the members performing the song in a blizzard, notably without the costumes. The unofficial third music video appears on the DVD for the 2002 horror film Ghost Ship, in which the song was featured heavily. The video consists of a montage of clips from the film with the song played over.|$|R
30|$|Bt cotton targets the budworm/bollworm complex, {{but does}} not affect other insect pests, {{including}} the boll weevil, plant <b>bugs,</b> <b>white</b> flies, and stinkbugs. Applications of broad-spectrum insecticides are typically made on essentially 100 % of planted cotton hectares to control the budworm/bollworm complex and other insects. Bt cotton will reduce the use of insecticides on the budworm/bollworm complex, but will only indirectly impact applications of insecticides targeting other insects.|$|R
50|$|Kee Games's Super Bug (1977) and Atari's Fire Truck (1978) have a {{top-down}} view multi-directional scrolling. Both {{games are}} black and <b>white,</b> though Super <b>Bug</b> uses a yellow overlay {{in the center of}} the screen. In 1980, Namco's color driving game Rally-X also allowed scrolling in multiple directions, and it is possible to pull the screen quickly in either direction. It also features an early example of a radar, to show the car's location on the map.|$|R
2500|$|The current logo was {{introduced}} in April 2008, with lowercase [...] "starz" [...] typing featuring a asteroid-shaped star inserted between the [...] "a" [...] and [...] "r"; the coloring of the logo was modified to an orange/gold rendering in April 2011. The channel replaced the opaque on-screen logos with a bright <b>white</b> logo <b>bug</b> on all channels and a bright orange bug for Starz HD as of April 7, 2008 and Starz Kids & Family's HD simulcast feed in July 2011. After the 2011 logo rebrand, the bright white version of the 2008 logo for Starz channels stayed on screen {{for the second time}} until September 2012 that it will reverted to two-minute version, along with Encore channels. After the current logo's introduction, the [...] "InfoBar" [...] began to once again serve only to promote programming on the main Starz channel, while it serves mainly as a network ID on some of its multiplex channels.|$|R
5000|$|Sam now chases Bugs again, {{and is now}} {{subjected}} to the famous lots-of-doors in-and-out routine (previously used in Little Red Riding Rabbit), which ends with Sam getting blasted by a cannon again. Sam confronts Bugs, who throws a match into the powder room, which a panicking Sam swiftly retrieves (a gag that would later be recycled into 1954's Captain Hareblower). This is repeated until finally, Sam {{is too late to}} retrieve the match that ends up exploding the pirate ship's powder magazine when he refused to go after another match again, reducing the ship to splinters. On his last nerve, Sam furiously chases Bugs with his gun: [...] "Oooooh, I'll blast your head off for this!" [...] until he seemingly has Bugs defeated ("Alright, now! I got ya cornered! Come out and meet your doom!") until a cannon blasts him once more. Finally, defeated, Sam raises the <b>white</b> flag. <b>Bugs</b> turns to the audience, puts on an old-style ship captain's hat, and paraphrases John Paul Jones, [...] "I have not even begun to fight!" ...|$|R
40|$|From 1988 through 1992 {{we studied}} the {{overwintering}} number of brown-marmorated stink bugs (Halyomorpha mista), at Unazuki Spa Town in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, where the overwintering flight of Halyomorpha mista {{has been observed}} every year. The flight of H. mista to the wall surface of buildings starts usually {{at the end of}} September and reaches a peak around the 3 rd week of October. The coming-fly of bugs ceases at the end of November. The flight of stink bugs started in the daytime when the maximum temperature reached nearly 25 ℃ after overnight minimum temperature of about 15 ℃; the maximum number of bugs was recorded on an autumn day after the minimum temperature fell below 10 ℃. Regarding the slit traps which were set on the building roofs, more bugs were attracted to the slit traps which faced riverside than to those which faced the mountains. The natural wood-color board (coated with clear lacquer) attracted more bugs than boards painted in black or <b>white.</b> The <b>bugs</b> attached to the slit traps were observed 1 or 2 weeks after the onset of their flying to the wall surface of buildings...|$|R
5000|$|At {{this point}} Bugs could simply {{relax and enjoy}} the {{unexpected}} trip, which must eventually take the boat back to its starting point and allow him to disembark, but he prefers to seek an adversary with whom he can match wits. He finds one in the Yosemite Sam-esque Colonel Shuffle, a neurotic riverboat gambler played by Billy Bletcher. After Shuffle's gunplay clears out the customer base in the casino when another player tops his hand of three queens with one of four kings, Bugs remains as his only challenger in a poker game. Beginning with a hundred dollar stake (which amounts to only half a <b>white</b> chip), <b>Bugs</b> soon wins all of Shuffle's money including the original white half-chip when he tops the cheating Shuffle's hand of five aces with six aces. Literally beaten at his own game ("If'n I had four feet and went 'hee-haw', what would I be?", [...] "Why, uh, you'd be a jackass"), Shuffle challenges Bugs to a pistol duel and an explosion from an exploding cigar, given to Shuffle by Bugs ("And the gentleman wins a cigar!"), leaves Shuffle in [...] "blackface" [...] and Bugs leads him in a dance to [...] "De Camptown Races" [...] (with Shuffle literally dancing off the boat, banjo in hand).|$|R
