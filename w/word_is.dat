Although this property {{is not unique to}} the word—one study of 5,411 one-syllable English words found 80 words with no rhymes—the lack of rhyme for orange has garnered significant attention, and inspired many humorous verses.|$|E

5|$|MalcolmX had by {{now become}} a media favorite, and some Nation members {{believed}} he {{was a threat to}} Muhammad's leadership. Publishers had shown interest in MalcolmX's autobiography, and when Louis Lomax wrote his 1963 book about the Nation, When the <b>Word</b> <b>Is</b> Given, he used a photograph of MalcolmX on the cover. He also reproduced five of his speeches, but featured only one of Muhammad'sall of which greatly upset Muhammad and made him envious.|$|E
5|$|The full {{etymology}} is unknown. The oldest known {{usage of}} the <b>word</b> <b>is</b> in the 794 text Shin'yaku Kegonkyō Ongi Shiki. Other old sources include Nihon Ryōiki (810–824) and Wamyō Ruijushō (c. 934). These oldest sources are written in Man'yōgana which clearly identifies the historical spelling as ki1tune. Following several diachronic phonological changes, this becomes kitsune.|$|E
5|$|The word batik is Javanese in origin. It {{may either}} {{come from the}} Javanese word amba ('to write') and titik ('dot'), or may derive from a {{hypothetical}} Proto-Austronesian root *beCík ('to tattoo'). The <b>word</b> <b>is</b> first recorded in English in the Encyclopædia Britannica of 1880, {{in which it is}} spelled battik. It is attested in the Indonesian Archipelago during the Dutch colonial period in various forms: mbatek, mbatik, batek and batik.|$|E

5|$|The word {{universe}} {{derives from}} the Old French word univers, which in turn {{derives from the}} Latin word universum. The Latin word was used by Cicero and later Latin authors {{in many of the}} same senses as the modern English <b>word</b> <b>is</b> used.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a debate}} {{on the origins of}} the word Ahimsa, and how its meaning evolved. Mayrhofer as well as Dumot suggest the root word may be han which means kill, which leads to the {{interpretation}} that ahimsa means do not kill. Schmidt as well as Bodewitz explain the proper root <b>word</b> <b>is</b> hiṃs and the Sanskrit verb hinasti, which leads to the interpretation ahimsa means do not injure, or do not hurt. Wackernagel-Debrunner concur with the latter explanation.|$|E
5|$|Adults who {{do believe}} that zero is even can {{nevertheless}} be unfamiliar with thinking of it as even, enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number <b>word</b> <b>is</b> flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or even. The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{beginning}} the <b>Word</b> <b>was</b> existing. And the <b>Word</b> <b>was</b> in fellowship with God the Father. And the <b>Word</b> <b>was</b> as to His essence absolute deity.

5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The <b>word</b> <b>is</b> from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Fairman {{writes that}} legal {{precedent}} regarding {{use of the}} <b>word</b> <b>is</b> unclear because of contradictory court decisions. He presents case studies of these contradictory applications of the law, and uses them to analyze public perceptions surrounding freedom of speech. He provides examples of exceptions to the First Amendment, such as speech intended to cause violent acts, and discusses {{the manner in which}} federal and state governments sanction these exceptions. Fairman draws parallels between protection of comedians' usage of taboo language to the ability of individuals in society to express ideas freely. He argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict specific words {{that can be used in}} speech, this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a <b>word</b> <b>is</b> compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the sort}} of {{authority}} accorded by this position is widely discussed. The problem arise from the word MTQNNʿ; its exact meaning is debated. The <b>word</b> <b>is</b> translated to Latin as corrector but restitutor is another possible translation; the latter title was an honorary one meant to praise the bearer for driving enemies out of Roman territories. However, the inscription of Vaballathus is clearer as the word PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene word but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes which is usually an equivalent to corrector.|$|E
5|$|Other {{vernacular names}} applied include shepherd's {{companion}} (because it accompanied livestock), frogbird, morning bird, and Australian nightingale. Many Aboriginal names are onomatopoeic, {{based on the}} sound of its scolding call. Djididjidi is a name from the Kimberley, and Djigirridjdjigirridj {{is used by the}} Gunwinggu of western Arnhem Land. In Central Australia, southwest of Alice Springs, the Pitjantjatjara <b>word</b> <b>is</b> tjintir-tjintir(pa). Among the Kamilaroi, it is thirrithirri. In Bougainville Island, it is called tsiropen in the Banoni language from the west coast, and in Awaipa of Kieta district it is maneka. In the Solomon Islands Pijin it is sometimes called the polis (police) or pris (priest) bird, because of its black-and-white colouring.|$|E
5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the <b>word</b> <b>is</b> obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and 𐐮 is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
