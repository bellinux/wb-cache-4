25|$|The Braunton Burrows {{core area}} {{consists}} of fixed and mobile sand dune systems with geomorphological and successional processes. There are also variable-flooded slacks, grassland and scrub further inland supporting {{a wide variety}} of flowering and lower plants, birds, and insects. It includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities, with over 400 vascular plant species. It is characterised by marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush (Juncus acutus), and willow (Salix) species. On the strandline there is rock sea lavender (Limonium binervosum). The fore and mid dunes are generally sandy yellow dunes, colonised and stabilised by marram grass. Other notable species include sea stock (Matthiola sinuate), sea stork's-bill (Erodium maritimum), sea clover (Trifolium aquamosum), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica), sea spurge (Euphorbia paralias), and <b>white</b> <b>horehound</b> (Marrubium vulgare). Further inland, the stable grey dunes are stabilised by other species such as dune fescue (Vulpia membranacea). The dune slacks, the valleys between the dunes, may flood after heavy rain and are wet and marshy during the winter. They support round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush, round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia ssp. maritima), early gentian (Gentianella anglica), and many orchid species. Listed as endangered on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee's Vascular Plant Red Data List for Great Britain, the water germander (Teucrium scordium), a perennial plant that lives in the slacks, has just one other population in the UK.|$|E

50|$|The Great Orme has a {{very rich}} flora, {{including}} most notably the only known site of the critically endangered wild cotoneaster (Cotoneaster cambricus), of which only six wild plants are known. Many of the flowers growing in shallow lime-rich earth on the headland have developed from the alpine sub-Arctic species that developed following the last ice-age. Spring and early summer flowers include bloody cranesbill, thrift and sea campion, clinging to the sheer rock face, while pyramidal orchid, common rockrose and wild thyme carpet the grassland. The old mines and quarries also provide suitable habitat for species of plants including spring squill growing on the old copper workings. The <b>white</b> <b>horehound</b> (Marrubium vulgare), which is found growing on the western-most slopes of the Orme {{is said to have}} been used, and perhaps cultivated, by 14th-century monks, no doubt to make herbal remedies including cough mixtures.

40|$|A {{number of}} weed plants {{available}} in Bangladesh have potential uses as food for human and as medicinal purposes, which {{need to be}} conserved in a well-managed herb garden. Most of these weeds can be eaten raw as salad, cooked in soup or the seeds and leaves ground and consumed as teas or in porridge. They are high in essential minerals especially in calcium, magnesium, iron, phosphorus, manganese, zinc etc. They are also high in vitamins A, C, D, and K, niacin, thiamin, riboflavin etc. Some of these are useful for the remedy of digestive disorders, reduce cholesterol levels, some are used as antidotes against poisoning from arsenic and mercury.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this work}} {{was to provide a}} {{detailed}} breakdown of horse nutrition, to mention the importance of dietary supplements. The main part deals with the basics of horse nutrition, the bare necessities of nutrients, the proportion of maintenance rations and the technique of feeding. Afterwards, I outline the properties and effects of varied herbal plants such as garlic, hemp, hyssop, <b>white</b> <b>horehound,</b> coltsfoot and oats. Flaxseed, biotin, zinc, yeast and probiotics are dietary supplements improving the quality of fur, horsehair and hoofs. The feed will be analysed by standard methods. As far as horse excrement is concerned, we are going to observe its shape, colour, consistency, pH value and smell. The assessment of horse excrement will serve as a judgement about the activity of digestive system. The ethology observations will provide information on daily activity of a horse, on particular activities, to which the horse gives its attention during a day, and the amount of time it dedicates to them. As far as horses with respiratory disorders are concerned, we will observe the signs of their health problems and the rate of these problems occurring both at rest and in action. The information will be completed by the measurement of body proportions useful to body weight calculation. The statistical and economic methods will be selected in terms of the results accomplished during the research...|$|E
40|$|Background: Marrubium vulgare Lamiaceae, {{known as}} <b>white</b> <b>horehound,</b> is {{frequently}} used in folk medicine to treat many illnesses from ancient times. Aims: The {{present study is}} conducted to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of hydromethanolic extract of the aerial part of M. vulgare. Materials and Methods: The oxygen consumption {{and the production of}} superoxide anions, by rat pleural polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated by opsonized zymosan, were performed. PMNs were collected after induction of an acute inflammatory reaction by injection, in the rat pleural cavity, of suspension of calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Plant extract was tested at a concentration range 10 - 100 mg/ml and 100 - 400 mg/kg/day for in vitro and in vivo assays respectively. Statistical analysis: All values are expressed as mean ΁ standard error. The significance of differences between control and treated samples in vitro was analysed using the Student′s t-test. For in vivo studies, data were analysed using one-way analysis of variance. Differences with P ≤ 0. 05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: Hydromethanolic extract of M. vulgare showed, in vitro a significant anti-inflammatory effect in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, only the high amounts of the plant extract (300 and 400 mg/kg/day) exhibited a significant anti-inflammatory effect. The plant extract contains a high amount of polyphenols. Conclusion: Hydromethanolic extract of M. vulgare had an anti-inflammatory effect, which corroborates the usefulness of this plant in the treatment of inflammatory disorders...|$|E
40|$|Recurrent airway {{obstruction}} (RAO), known previously as chronic obstructive {{pulmonary disease}} (COPD), is a debilitating respiratory condition that significantly contributes to lost training days and illness in racehorses. Herbs {{are becoming increasingly}} popular for the prophylaxis or treatment of the clinical signs of RAO despite a paucity of research on efficacy and safety. We evaluated the ability of an herbal composite containing garlic, <b>white</b> <b>horehound,</b> boneset, aniseed, fennel, licorice, thyme, and hyssop to reduce the clinical signs of RAO, hypothesizing that the product would safely reduce signs and would improve the inflammatory cell profile within the lungs. The composite was fed to 6 horses with symptomatic RAO for 21 d in a crossover manner. Ventigraphs were used to record respiratory rate and intrapleural pressure; the proportion of inflammatory cells in fluid aspirated from the trachea was determined. Blood biochemical and hematologic screening was conducted to identify possible adverse effects. Treatment with the composite did not result in statistically significant changes in any of the parameters evaluated. A trend to a decrease in respiratory rate (P = 0. 1) and an increase in the proportion of macrophages (P = 0. 1) was observed in the horses receiving the herbal composite compared with placebo. These data indicate a potential for the herbal composite to safely reduce the elevated respiratory rate in horses with RAO. Future research with a greater number of horses is warranted to further characterize the effect of this product on horses with RAO...|$|E
40|$|Marrubium vulgare L., {{commonly}} known as a <b>white</b> <b>horehound</b> or common horehound, belongs to the plant family Lamiaceae. It is a perennial aromatic herb which grows naturally in Europe, Asia, and America. Since ancient Egypt, this species has been known as a remedy for upper respiratory tract ailments. Nowadays, horehound is used in herbal medicine for treatment of liver diseases, biliary tract disorders, and for increasing the appetite and supporting {{the function of the}} stomach. The main biologically active substances in M. vulgare organs are: marrubiin, tannins, essential oils, and ursolic acid. The paper presents micromorphological analyses of non-glandular and glandular trichomes of M. vulgare. The research material was sampled from the plant collection in the Botanical Garden of the Maria Curie-Sklodowska University in Lublin (51 ° 14 ′ N, 22 ° 34 ′ E). The above-ground parts of horehound were collected during the flowering period in July 2013. Using light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the types and sizes of trichomes from the stem, leaf, calyx, and corolla were investigated. The results of the microscopic observations show that the surfaces of M. vulgare vegetative and reproductive organs are densely clothed with glandular and non-glandular trichomes. The glandular trichomes are of two main types: peltate and capitate. Peltate trichomes consist of a short stalk cell and a large head with secretory cells arranged in a circle. The height of a mature trichome is about 31. 33 μm and the diameter of the head is 31. 47 μm. The substance produced by secretory cells passes through the apical walls and accumulates within a space between the cuticle and the cell wall layer. Capitate long trichomes with a basal cell, long stalk, neck cell, and a unicellular head are 36. 65 μm long and the diameter of the head is about 15. 6 μm. There are two types of short capitate trichomes: with a bicellular head and a unicellular stalk and with four-celled head and a unicellular stalk. The length of these trichomes is on average 26. 32 μm and the diameter of the head is 20. 32 μm. Moreover, we observed two types of non-glandular trichomes: multicellular uniserrate and multicellular branched. The length of the non-glandular trichomes is between 60. 69 μm and 1130. 3 μm...|$|E
