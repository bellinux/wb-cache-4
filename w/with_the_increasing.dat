5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went hand in hand <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> use of hired labor by the government.

5|$|Following World War II, a {{nationwide}} movement pressed {{to return to}} pre-war society {{as quickly as possible}} in the U.S. When combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> national paranoia about communism and psychoanalytic theory that had become pervasive in medical knowledge, homosexuality became an undesired characteristic of employees working for the U.S. government in 1950. Homosexuals were thought to be vulnerable targets to blackmail, and the government purged its employment ranks of open homosexuals, beginning a widespread effort to gather intelligence about employees' private lives. State and local governments followed suit, arresting people for congregating in bars and parks, and enacting laws against cross-dressing for men and women.|$|E

3000|$|... 3 nanofluid {{is shown}} in Fig.  5. It is clear from this figure that <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> of φ {{velocity}} of nanofluids is decreased.

30|$|In fact, {{sorption}} is an {{exothermic process}} [[22]]. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in {{temperature of the}} adsorbate-adsorbent system, the sorption decreases. In other words, the adsorption equilibrium constant will decrease <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in temperature. However, when the diffusion process (intra-particle or transport-pore diffusion) mainly controls the adsorption process, the sorption capacity will <b>increase</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in temperature. This is basically {{due to the fact}} that the diffusion process is an endothermic process, which leads to <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> sorptive capacity of the adsorbent. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> of sorption capacity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> of temperature maybe attributed to the diffusion process.|$|R

It anchored in deep water at what is now Sylph's Hole off Old Settlement Beach, but was eventually tragically lost at sea in 1873 which added to the woes of the island at this time.|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing.

Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E

5|$|Butthole Surfers {{began to}} take the {{collection}} of visual equipment seriously following Coffey's recruitment in 1983, when he added a clear plastic drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe lights at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more space than their instruments. Smoke machines were later added. Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies {{at the same time}} which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse.
