5|$|Dysprosium is used, in {{conjunction}} with vanadium and other elements, in making laser materials and commercial lighting. Because of dysprosium's high thermal-neutron absorption cross-section, dysprosium-oxide–nickel cermets are used in neutron-absorbing control rods in nuclear reactors. Dysprosium–cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation, which is useful for studying chemical reactions. Because dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization, they are employed in various data-storage applications, such as in hard disks. Dysprosium is increasingly in demand for the permanent magnets used in electric car motors and <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>generators.</b>|$|E
5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>generators</b> behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports on}} the design cost and scaling model of a small scale superconducting <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>generator,</b> where the levelized cost of energy (COE) was calculated. The {{proposed}} design of the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> {{is based on the}} vertical axis <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> (VAWT) type that drives the superconducting generator. VAWT was chosen due to its ability to operate under low <b>wind</b> speed. <b>Wind</b> <b>turbine</b> using superconducting <b>generator</b> was proposed since it is able to enhance magnetic flux within the stator of the generator and consequently improve the performance of the generator. Once the design has been accomplished, all the cost of parts and components must be accounted and contributes to the overall cost of generating electrical energy from the superconducting <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>generator.</b> The cost elements include the initial capital cost (ICC), balance of station (BOS), operation and maintenance (O&M), levelized replacement cost (LRC) and annual energy production (AEP).
