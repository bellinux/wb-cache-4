25|$|The planned dive {{profile is}} an {{important}} input parameter for gas planning and decompression planning, and is generally based on {{the time required to}} perform the task of each specific dive, and the depth at which the task <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed,</b> in combination with environmental considerations and the breathing gas mixtures chosen. Limits are often due to exposure to cold, work load, decompression time, safety constraints and logistics of breathing gas supply.|$|E

25|$|The table below {{highlights}} some of {{the challenges}} with decision making and prognostication in thyroid cancer. While there is general agreement that stage I or II papillary, follicular or medullary cancer have a good prognosis, {{it is not possible}} when evaluating a small thyroid cancer to determine which ones will grow and metastasize and which will not. As a result, once a diagnosis of thyroid cancer has been established (most commonly by a fine needle aspiration), it is likely that a total thyroidectomy <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} OSH benefits {{stemming from}} the wider use of robotics should be substitution for people working in unhealthy or dangerous environments. In space, defence, security, or the nuclear industry, but also in logistics, maintenance, and inspection, autonomous robots are particularly useful in replacing human workers performing dirty, dull or unsafe tasks, thus avoiding workers' exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical, ergonomic and psychosocial risks. For example, robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks, to handle radioactive material or to work in explosive atmospheres. In the future, many other highly repetitive, risky or unpleasant tasks <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> by robots {{in a variety of}} sectors like agriculture, construction, transport, healthcare, firefighting or cleaning services.|$|E

25|$|Composer/performer Rinde Eckert gives Farinelli's time in Spain a {{contemporary}} treatment in his 1995 work for radio, Four Songs Lost in a Wall, commissioned by New American Radio. That period {{in his life}} is also the setting for Farinelli and the King (the king in question being Philip V of Spain), a play by Claire van Kampen, which premiered at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse from 11 February to 7 March 2015. It {{was transferred to the}} Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End in the final months of 2015, with the role of Farinelli doubled between 'speaking' and 'singing', with Iestyn Davies playing the latter. Kampen's Farinelli and the King <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> on Broadway at the Belasco Theatre from December 5th, 2017 to March 25th, 2018.|$|E
25|$|In a single-lung {{transplant}} {{the process}} starts {{out after the}} donor lung has been inspected and the decision to accept the donor lung for the patient has been made. An incision is generally made from under the shoulder blade around the chest, ending near the sternum. An alternate method involves an incision under the breastbone. In {{the case of a}} singular lung transplant the lung is collapsed, the blood vessels in the lung tied off, and the lung removed at the bronchial tube. The donor lung is placed, the blood vessels reattached, and the lung reinflated. To make sure the lung is satisfactory and to clear any remaining blood and mucus in the new lung a bronchoscopy <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed.</b> When the surgeons are satisfied with the performance of the lung the chest incision will be closed.|$|E
25|$|In a {{language}} with lazy evaluation, like Haskell, a list is evaluated {{only to the}} degree that its elements are requested: for example, if one asks for the first element of a list, only the first element will be computed. With respect to usage of the list monad for non-deterministic computation that means that we can non-deterministically generate a lazy list of all results of the computation and ask for the first of them, and only as much work <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> as is needed to get that first result. The process roughly corresponds to backtracking: a path of computation is chosen, and then if it fails at some point (if it evaluates mzero), then it backtracks to the last branching point, and follows the next path, and so on. If the second element is then requested, it again does just enough work to get the second solution, and so on. So the list monad is a simple way to implement a backtracking algorithm in a lazy language.|$|E

500|$|Cedar Point worked {{mainly with}} the Emmy Award-Winning RWS and Associates and Chauvet Professional {{to build the}} production.

The park also worked with Chauvet to set up and program the lights, as well as the lights used on Millennium Force and Power Tower.

500|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} was done by {{drilling}} and blasting. During planning, use of a tunnel boring machine was considered, but the conventional drilling and blasting method was chosen because it was both cheaper and faster. At Hommelvik, the new section of track starts at the river of Homla, where it will run in a curve towards the tunnel entrance at Solbakken. Just within the entrance, there will be built a pool and pump to collect surface water. A crosscut is located at Muruvik, close to the quarry. At this point it is [...] to the tunnel and blasting <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> in both directions from the tunnel's interception with the crosscut. Muruvik will also serve as the operational hub; transport of the masses to the airport will run along the old E6. The third point of entry for blasting is the entrance at Hell. The works include replacing the level crossing at Hell Station with an overpass.|$|E
