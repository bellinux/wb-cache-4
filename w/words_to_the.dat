5|$|During {{the trial}} in January 1972 Bukovsky was accused of slandering Soviet psychiatry, {{contacts}} with foreign journalists, and the possession and distribution of samizdat. On this occasion he again used his final <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court to reach a much wider audience when the text circulated in samizdat. He was sentenced {{to two years in}} prison, five in a labour camp, and five more in internal exile.|$|E
5|$|Morris’s {{aesthetic}} and social values became a leading {{force in the}} Arts and Crafts Movement. The Kelmscott Press influenced much of the fine press movement in England and the United States during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries.

5|$|Rotblat {{continued}} to have strong reservations {{about the use of}} science to develop such a devastating weapon. In 1985 he related that at a private dinner at the Chadwicks' house at Los Alamos in March 1944, he was shocked to hear the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., say <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effect that the real purpose in making the bomb was to subdue the Soviets. Historians, notably Barton Bernstein, have cast doubt on this story.|$|E

5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the {{swearing-in}} of the jury and introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened {{on the night of}} the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Greek was the {{language}} of Homer and of classical Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vocabulary of English and many other European languages, {{and has been a}} standard subject of study in Western educational institutions since the Renaissance. Latinized forms of Ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in other scientific terminology.|$|E

25|$|Sequences are {{sung poems}} based on couplets. Although many {{sequences}} {{are not part}} of the liturgy and thus not part of the Gregorian repertory proper, Gregorian sequences include such well-known chants as Victimae paschali laudes and Veni Sancte Spiritus. According to Notker Balbulus, an early sequence writer, their origins lie in the addition of <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> long melismata of the jubilus of Alleluia chants.|$|E
25|$|Latin was {{originally}} spoken in Latium, in the Italian Peninsula. Through {{the power of}} the Roman Republic, it became the dominant language, initially in Italy and subsequently throughout the Roman Empire. Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages, such as Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Romanian. Latin and French have contributed many <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English language. Latin and Ancient Greek roots are used in theology, biology, and medicine.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, the folklorist {{and author}} Stetson Kennedy {{infiltrated}} the Klan; he provided internal data to media {{and law enforcement}} agencies. He also provided secret code <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> writers of the Superman radio program, resulting in episodes in which Superman took on the KKK. Kennedy stripped away the Klan's mystique and trivialized its rituals and code words, which {{may have contributed to}} the decline in Klan recruiting and membership. In the 1950s, Kennedy wrote a bestselling book about his experiences, which further damaged the Klan.|$|E

25|$|The attested Hurrian lexicon {{is quite}} homogenous, {{containing}} {{only a small}} number of loanwords (e.g. tuppi (clay tablet), Mizri (Egypt) both from Akkadian). The relative pronouns iya and iye may be a loan from the Indo-Aryan language of the Mitanni people who had lived in the region before the Hurrians; cf. Sanskrit ya. Conversely, Hurrian gave many loan <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearby Akkadian dialects, for example hāpiru (nomad) from the Hurrian hāpiri (nomad). There may also be Hurrian loanwords among the languages of the Caucasus, but this cannot be verified, as there are no written records of Caucasian languages from the time of the Hurrians. The source language of similar sounding words is thus unconfirmable.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of alchemy to Latin Europe may be dated to 11 February 1144, with {{the completion of}} Robert of Chester's translation of the Arabic Book of the Composition of Alchemy. Although European craftsmen and technicians preexisted, Robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in Latin Europe {{at the time of}} his writing. The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century Toledo, Spain, through contributors like Gerard of Cremona and Adelard of Bath. Translations of the time included the Turba Philosophorum, and the works of Avicenna and al-Razi. These brought with them many new <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent. Alcohol, carboy, elixir, and athanor are examples.|$|E
