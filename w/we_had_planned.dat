500|$|According to the rowing {{correspondent}} of The Times, it was [...] "one of {{the greatest}} battles {{in the history of}} the race". [...] Cambridge's boat club president Masser said [...] "I cannot speak too highly Oxford's magnificent row. [...] <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>planned</b> to build up an early lead and then row clean away ... but hard as we tried we could not shake Oxford off our tail." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Jon Bernthal is a {{tremendous}} talent and he’s {{got a lot of}} professionalism. A lot of the actors came in to the room as we were starting this season and Bernthal was one of those actors. He was aware {{of a lot of the}} things that were coming up and we talked to him about his character and what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>planned</b> for him this season and he was on board with a lot of it. It was nice being able to run though scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character. Because actors, a lot of times, think about their characters more than the writers because they’re focused on that single character for months of their lives, if not years. He was all prepared for this." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, McCain {{continued}} {{questioning the}} progress of the war in Iraq. In September 2005, he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers' optimistic outlook on the war's progress: [...] "Things have not gone as well as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>planned</b> or expected, nor as we were told by you, General Myers." [...] In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: [...] "We [...] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be." [...] From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007. The strategy's opponents labeled it [...] "McCain's plan" [...] and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said, [...] "McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now." [...] The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party, as McCain's presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, [...] "I would much rather lose a campaign than a war." [...] In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began.|$|E
30|$|As {{a future}} work, first <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>planned</b> {{to enhance the}} {{technique}} for Web Static pages. Second, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> also <b>planned</b> to enhance the tool for clone removal by using the refactoring technique. Third, if there are some simple modifications in the source code, then the clone has to be detected in the whole software from the scratch. It surely takes the same or more {{time to do the}} same process. This time can be reduced to a considerable extent, by making it to retain the previous clone detection results with the intermediate values and thus produce the results in a fraction of time for the next revisions. Next <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>planned</b> to enhance our tool with this incremental process.|$|R

Mahendra Jain, additional chief secretary (urban development department), {{stated that}} {{the government did not}} consider the project feasible [...] "as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> already <b>planned</b> for the Namma Metro." [...] He further explained, [...] "The decision was taken because there was no sufficient road width available for the BRTS. The balance carriage way would be very less so we decided not to take it forward.

60|$|My son and I had a quiet hour {{together}} on that happy night before we retired to rest.

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>planned</b> {{to strike}} our first blow at {{the nervous system}} of the Oligarchy. The latter had remembered the general strike, and had guarded against the {{defection}} of the telegraphers by installing wireless stations, in {{the control of the}} Mercenaries. We, in turn, had countered this move. When the signal was given, from every refuge, all over the land, and from the cities, and towns, and barracks, devoted comrades were to go forth and blow up the wireless stations. Thus at the first shock would the Iron Heel be brought to earth and lie practically dismembered.|$|E

They bound me hand and foot and placed me in a cave until all the warriors should return to witness my death; but while they were away I heard someone calling me in a muffled voice which {{seemed to come from}} the wall of the cave.

She was plainly nervous; the abstract was becoming concrete. Her little house was in spotless, speckless order from top to bottom. Aunt Olivia had herself scrubbed the garret floor and swept the cellar steps that very morning with as much painstaking care as if she expected that Mr. Malcolm MacPherson would hasten to inspect each at once and she must stand or fall by his opinion of them.|$|E

6000|$|We {{went to bed}} {{each night}} at ten and quite as {{regularly}} rose at half-past six. Dinner came exactly at noon, supper precisely at six. Although my upstairs study {{was a kind of}} retreat, we spent less time in it than <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>planned</b> to do, for mother was so appealingly wistful to have us near her that neither of us had the heart to deny her. She could not endure to have us both absent. Careful not to interrupt my writing, she considered Zulime's case in different light. [...] "You can read, or sew or knit down here just as well as up there," [...] she said. [...] "It is a comfort for me just to have you sit where I can look at you." ...|$|E

In the first place, I found out that our suspicions were right, and that the fellow is a highwayman, {{and seems to be}} captain of a gang {{consisting}} anyhow of three, and perhaps of more, fellows like himself. In the second place, he intends, with his three comrades, to attack the coach on Friday week, two or three miles out of town. Nothing could better suit our purpose, even if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>planned</b> the affair ourselves. Of course, we will be there. If we can capture him while engaged in that work, we can get anything out of him. He has either got to confess or be hanged." ...|$|E
60|$|About {{two hours}} before the dawn Larico came, {{knocking}} on the side-door as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>planned.</b> I opened to him and he entered disguised in a hooded cloak of sheep's wool which covered his robes and his face, such as priests wear when the weather is cold. He gave to me the garments of a priest of the Sun which he had brought with him in a cloth. I clothed myself in them though because of the fashion of them to do this I must be rid of my armour which would have betrayed me. Larico desired that I should take off the sword Wave-Flame also, but, mistrusting him, this I would not do, but made shift to hide it and my dagger beneath the priest's cloak. The armour I wrapped in a bundle and took with me.|$|E

60|$|The {{money in}} this place is English, of course, as it is an English colony; {{but there are so}} many {{visitors}} from the United States, that American currency is as much in use, for large sums, as the pounds-shillings-and-pence arrangement. But all sums under a quarter are reckoned in English money,--pennies, half-pennies, four, six and eight-pences, and that sort of thing. One of our quarters passes for a shilling, but a silver dime wont pass in the shops. The darkeys will take them--or almost anything else--as a gift. I didn't have to get our money changed into gold. I got a draft on a Nassau house, and generally drew greenbacks. But I saw, pretty plainly, that I couldn't draw very much for this new monarchical undertaking, and stay in Nassau as long as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>planned.</b>|$|E
60|$|Fortune seemed {{inclined}} to favour us. About the usual time the blind was gently raised, and very soon afterwards there came {{round the corner}} {{the figure of a}} man. We entered the street ourselves a few seconds later, and it seemed likely that, as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>planned,</b> we should {{come face to face with}} him under the gaslight. He walked towards us, stooping and with bent head. We expected him to pass the house by. To our surprise he stopped when he came to it, and pushed open the gate. In another moment we should have lost all chance of seeing anything more of him except his bent back. With a couple of strides my friend was behind him. He laid his hand on the man's shoulder and forced him to turn round. It was an old, wrinkled face with gentle, rather watery eyes.|$|E
60|$|The day {{had been}} so lovely till now that we said we would stay many days in Ronda, and we loitered in the sun admiring the garden; the young landlady among her flowers said that all the soil had to be brought for it in carts and panniers, and this made us admire its autumn blaze the more. That {{afternoon}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>planned</b> taking our tea on the terrace for the advantage {{of looking at the}} sunset light on the mountains, but suddenly great black clouds blotted it out. Then we lost courage; it appeared to us that it would be both brighter and, warmer by the sea and that near Gibraltar we could more effectually prevent our steamer from getting away to New York without us. We called for our bill, and after luncheon the head waiter who brought it said that the large black cat which had just made friends with us always woke him if he slept late in the morning and followed him into the town like a dog when he walked there.|$|E
