5|$|The two {{predecessor}} {{theories to}} two-level utilitarianism, act and rule utilitarianism, were beset by various objections. For example, rule utilitarianism {{was criticized for}} implying {{that in some cases}} an individual should pursue a course of action that <b>would</b> <b>obviously</b> not maximise utility. Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or impossible) for an ordinary person.|$|E
25|$|This {{represents}} {{the flexibility to}} implement 16 functions, leaving the physical design untouched. Additional serial lines and parallel inputs <b>would</b> <b>obviously</b> {{increase the number of}} realizable functions. However, a significant drawback of such devices is that, as the number of realizable functions increases, an increasing number of clocking regions is required. As a consequence, a device exploiting this method of function implementation may perform significantly slower than its traditional counterpart.|$|E
25|$|For decades, {{both the}} college campus and Beaver Falls {{residents}} themselves had been wanting Pennsylvania Route 18 re-routed, as the route made a sharp s-turn through the campus. The s-turn was only 800 feet {{between the two}} turns, and while it <b>would</b> <b>obviously</b> cause problems for pedestrians (most of whom were students at the campus), {{it was also a}} danger for semi-trucks as well as drivers who would dangerously speed around the s-bend.|$|E

25|$|Paris had arguably {{been the}} {{classical}} music {{capital of the}} world since the advent of musical Impressionism in the late 19th century. One of its practitioners, Erik Satie, collaborated with Picasso and Cocteau in a mad, scandalous ballet called Parade. First performed by the Ballets Russes in 1917, it succeeded in creating a scandal but in a different way than Stravinsky's Le Sacre du printemps had done almost five years earlier. This was a ballet that was clearly parodying itself, something traditional ballet patrons <b>would</b> <b>obviously</b> have serious issues with.|$|E
25|$|Widespread {{complaints}} emerged against Shimun VII's consecration of {{his younger}} nephew as his designated successor. This led to three non-related bishops of Shimun VII (the bishops of Erbil, Urmia and Salmas) {{to call an}} assembly in Mosul of clergy, monks, and Church members from ten regions to elect the hesitant Yohannan Sulaqa as the new patriarch. However, A bishop of metropolitan rank was needed at the ceremony in order to consecrate Sulaqa as patriarch. As the Eliya family <b>would</b> <b>obviously</b> object to it, and since the Syriac Orthodox Church also declined due to doctrinal differences, Yohannan Sulaqa made the decision of asking Pope Julius III of Rome to celebrate the consecration.|$|E
25|$|The show parodies {{many things}} about popular culture, {{primarily}} being a spoof of {{shows such as}} Jackass; whereas they perform stunts designed to injure and/or humiliate an individual, the Fist team do things that <b>would</b> <b>obviously</b> kill them. Such as jumping off cliffs, being hit by trucks, getting shot in the head, etc. These dangerous stunts and outlandish actions are usually achieved {{with the use of}} computer generated imagery. Indeed, one of the most innovative and noteworthy features of Double the Fist is its extensive and imaginative use of CGI, especially considering that the programme was produced for a very low budget, even by Australian standards ($250,000 for all 8 episodes).|$|E

25|$|The MythBusters episode {{also pointed}} out another complication: it would be {{necessary}} to insert the item into one's mouth (for example, eat an onion, rinse with mouthwash, conceal a battery), take the breath test, and then possibly remove the item — all of which would have to be accomplished discreetly enough to avoid alerting the police officers administering the test (who <b>would</b> <b>obviously</b> become very suspicious if they noticed that a person was inserting items into their mouth prior to taking a breath test). It would likely be very difficult, especially for someone in an intoxicated state, to be able to accomplish such a feat.|$|E

From the end of October onward, the child maintained an obstinate silence, explained by Laurent as a determination taken on the day he made his deposition against his mother. On 19 December 1794 he was visited by three commissioners from the Committee of Public Safety— J. B. Harmand de la Meuse, J. B. C. Mathieu and J. Reverchon— who extracted no word from him.|$|E
25|$|Beeching's reports made no {{recommendations}} {{about the}} handling of land after closures. British Rail operated a policy of disposing of land that was surplus to requirements. Many bridges, cuttings and embankments have been removed and the land sold for development. Closed station buildings on remaining lines have often been demolished or sold for housing or other purposes. Increasing pressure on land use meant that protection of closed trackbeds, as in other countries (such as the US Rail Bank scheme, which holds former railway land for possible future use) was not seen to be practical. Many redundant structures from closed lines remain, such as bridges over other lines and drainage culverts. They often require maintenance {{as part of the}} rail infrastructure while providing no benefit. Critics of Beeching argue that the lack of recommendations on {{the handling of}} closed railway property demonstrates that the report was short-sighted. On the other hand, retaining a railway on these routes, which <b>would</b> <b>obviously</b> have increased maintenance costs, might not have earned enough to justify that greater cost. As demand for rail has grown since privatisation, the failure to preserve the routes of closed lines (such as the one between Bedford and Cambridge, which was closed despite Beeching recommending its retention) has been criticised.|$|E

25|$|With David II in his custody, Edward III {{had a good}} {{opportunity}} to try to reach terms, though Edward Balliol's interests were a sticking point. He had evidently prepared to overlook them by the time he made his first offer, in 1348, which seems to have been that David II would hold Scotland as a fief for England, naming Edward III or one of his sons as his successor, should he die without children. This had altered somewhat by 1350 when Edward III sent Douglas of Liddelsdale, also in custody in the Tower of London, to see if the Scots would be willing to take different terms: to ransom David II for a fee of £40,000, the restoration of the disinherited lords, and the naming of Edward III's young son John of Gaunt as David's successor, should he die without children. David himself is credited with removing Edward III's name from the line of succession in Scotland, and the Scots seem to have been willing to entertain the idea as they sent Douglas of Liddesdale back for further negotiation and David II was himself permitted to briefly return to Scotland in early 1352 to try to seal the deal. Stewart <b>would</b> <b>obviously</b> be disinclined to support terms that removed him from succession, but he seems ultimately not to have been alone. The Parliament convened in March 1352 did not find the prospect of submitting to the English a fair trade for the freedom of their king. David II was sent back.|$|E

[...] Kobayashi, placed second at the restart, shared similar feelings to Schumacher about finishing in a lower position: [...] "Originally I qualified 13th so then it is not bad to finish seventh, {{but on the other hand}} I started second after the long red flag and looking from there the result is disappointing." ...|$|E

This <b>would</b> <b>obviously</b> violate the Fourth Amendment rights of anyone stopped, but people stuck in traffic who were injured by the collateral damage of unconstitutional actions {{would not be able to}} sue because none of their rights was violated. Similarly, it is not enough for Heffernan to have shown injury but violation of an actual right as well. For the dissent, even if the dismissal was for the wrong reason and harm was suffered, the dismissal cannot infringe upon rights he never exercised.|$|E

500|$|As the {{postcard}} effort was reaching its peak, tabloid newspapers {{speculated that the}} Labour Party wanted to put Hewson up for the Irish presidential election of 2004, with the Daily Mirror quoting an unnamed party insider as saying, [...] "She's a mother of four but she has always had world issues at heart and she'd make the perfect candidate." [...] (Labour had succeeded with its candidate Mary Robinson in the 1990 election but came in fourth with Roche in the 1997 election.) Hewson stated {{that she had not}} been approached, and that [...] "It's not a serious proposition. It <b>would</b> <b>obviously</b> be a huge honour if I was asked to take on such a huge task, but for one thing I'm not sure I'm qualified, and for another I've got four small kids to bring up first." [...] She also expressed contentment with incumbent President Mary McAleese staying for another term. She jokingly added that she could not see Bono agreeing to live in a smaller house. Hewson received a media mention two years later as a possible Social Democratic and Labour Party candidate in the 2004 European Parliament elections after John Hume had stood down. [...] The notion of her running for Irish president came up again in 2008 in conjunction with the 2011 election; columnist Fiona Looney wrote in the Daily Mail that while [...] "she is certainly a decent and smart woman", the position was better held by someone with a stronger background and more diplomatic experience. Hewson demurred once more, saying she did not speak the Irish language well enough, this time adding humorously that she could not see her husband being willing to walk behind her at events. The candidate that Labour did put up, Michael D. Higgins, won the post. Notwithstanding this speculation, Hewson generally shies away from political comments in the media.|$|E

[...] the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [...]" [...] Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created all the costumes for the Alien films since Alien 3) was in negotiations, and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic. An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however. Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and dry ice for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance <b>would</b> <b>obviously</b> render him unable to act.|$|E
