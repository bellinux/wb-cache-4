5|$|A late {{invitation}} to join Team Canada's summer camp {{in preparation for}} the 2002 Winter Olympics helped Iginla emerge as a star player. He was so surprised by the invite he initially thought one of his Calgary Flames teammates <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> prank on him. He scored two goals in the gold medal game, a 5–2 victory over the United States, as Canada won its first Olympic gold medal in 50years. With this win, Iginla became the first black man to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics. Iginla also represented Canada at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey as an alternate captain, playing on a line with Joe Sakic and Mario Lemieux. Canada won the gold medal.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Eton, {{he went to}} Magdalene College, Cambridge, on a music scholarship, and was {{expected}} to make music his career. A highlight of his undergraduate musical career <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> two piano arrangement of Chabrier's España with Boris Ord, then organist of King's College, Cambridge. However, Chadwick chose to further his interest in Evangelical Christianity, which had existed from his school days. He graduated in 1941 and began his theological training in 1942, at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, being ordained deacon by the Archbishop of Canterbury, in Canterbury Cathedral, in 1943 and priest by the Bishop of Dover in 1944. He served a curacy at the Evangelical parish of Emmanuel, Croydon, arriving {{towards the end of}} the Second World War, as Croydon was attacked by German V-weapons, which provided a difficult pastoral challenge. From there, he became an assistant master at Wellington College. He married Peggy Browning in 1945, and they had three daughters.|$|E

5|$|Ramachandran {{had dreamed}} of making his own film ever since he {{attended}} a screening of Frank Lloyd's historical drama, If I Were King (1938) starring Ronald Colman, in Calcutta. This occurred while he <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> minor role in Maya Machhindra (1939). He wished {{to make a film}} that would express his political views and interests to the people of Tamil Nadu. To this end, he assembled a team of three people: R. M. Veerappan, V. Lakshmanan and S. K. T. Sami. He gave them suggestions about the outline of the story and urged them to watch If I Were King and two other films: The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), another Colman film, and Elia Kazan's Viva Zapata! (1952). After several brainstorming sessions, the team came up with a story loosely based on the three films and decided on the title Nadodi Mannan. The trio then helped make it look more Indian.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also liked the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked that people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was a reminder that the player <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E

25|$|As {{the first}} {{installments}} of vote counting results were being released, {{about a week}} after election day, Ramazan Bashardost, who ran third in exit polls, contended that the U.S. <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> role in manipulating the outcome, in order to use a contested situation for its plans to broker a deal among the leading candidates. Others have made the same contention.|$|E
25|$|Since the Emancipation Proclamation {{was based}} on the President's war powers, it only {{included}} territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty. The Emancipation Proclamation greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from Britain or France. By late 1864, Lincoln <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> leading role in getting Congress to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment, which made emancipation universal and permanent.|$|E
25|$|By then, Ray Thomas <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> diminished {{role in the}} {{recording}} studio with the band evolving into a synthpop act, a genre that was unsuitable {{for the use of}} a flute. Thomas provided additional percussion, notably a brisk tambourine, on many more Moodies songs which continued to be featured, plus occasional harmonica, but by this point he was largely relegated to the status of a backup singer and he was also unwell during this period, further limiting his involvement with the band in {{the recording}} studio.|$|E

25|$|Wagenhals and Kemper cast Harrison Hunter in the play's title role. They did {{not show}} Hunter or the other cast members the final scene (in which the Bat's {{identity}} is revealed) until shortly before the dress rehearsal. Hunter, who had thought he <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> detective, was upset to learn that his role {{was that of a}} criminal. However, he remained in the role for the entire Broadway run before joining a touring company for the play. At the end of 1922, while still playing the Bat, Hunter became ill and died a week later.|$|E
25|$|In May, as Hulk Hogan {{had been}} banned in storyline from {{television}} by Vince McMahon, Hogan returned under a mask as Mr. America, and continued his feud with Piper, O'Haire and McMahon, {{who tried to}} reveal Mr. America's true identity. This storyline also saw Piper tear off the fake leg of one-legged wrestler Zach Gowen, who <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> Hogan fan. At Judgment Day, Piper argued with Chris Jericho if Piper's Pit was better than Jericho's talk show The Highlight Reel. Later at the event, Piper lost to Mr. America.|$|E

25|$|Avon, {{still the}} leader of the group, was portrayed as being {{increasingly}} determined to destroy the Federation, in contrast to the first series where Avon had dismissed Blake's aims as insane, his own being to obtain wealth. Avon becomes increasingly self-centred and paranoid: in Stardrive he showed few reservations about causing the death of a scientist in order to escape Federation pursuit ships; and in Orbit he threatened to do the same to Vila. In Blake, Avon kills his former comrade whom he accuses of betrayal, unaware that Blake <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> double game in order to recruit freedom fighters genuinely opposed to the Federation.|$|E
25|$|The British had, at that time, {{essentially}} withdrawn their troops. The situation {{pushed the}} leaders of the neighbouring Arab states to intervene, but their preparation was not finalized, and they could not assemble sufficient forces to turn the tide of the war. The majority of Palestinian Arab hopes lay with the Arab Legion of Transjordan's monarch, King Abdullah I, but {{he had no intention of}} creating a Palestinian Arab-run state, since he hoped to annexe as much of the territory of the British Mandate for Palestine as he could. He <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> double-game, being just as much in contact with the Jewish authorities as with the Arab League.|$|E

For security reasons, the team needed to spend the night inside the stadium, accompanied by the French squad who stayed behind in an act of comradery. Four days later, on 17 November 2015, the German team was scheduled to face the Netherlands at Hanover's HDI-Arena, also in a friendly. After initial security reservations, the DFB decided to play the match on 15 November. However, after reports about a concrete threat to the stadium, the match was cancelled ninety minutes before kickoff.|$|E
