5|$|Dot {{has been}} {{generally}} well received by critics; {{she has been}} referred to as a cultural archetype and Brown has won multiple awards for her portrayal. However, aspects of the character such as her smoking and her religious beliefs have been criticised, <b>with</b> <b>religious</b> groups suggesting Dot's faith is used in a pejorative manner. The character has also made an impact on popular culture; she has been spoofed, most notably by Alistair McGowan, and has been credited as inspiration for catwalk collections.|$|E

5|$|In later years, {{there was}} a flurry of {{contradictory}} statements from convention members (including Mason) about who composed which articles. Randolph credited Henry with Articles 15 and 16, but the latter (dealing <b>with</b> <b>religious</b> freedom), was written by Madison. Mason had imitated English law in drafting language requiring toleration of those of minority religions, but Madison insisted on full religious liberty, and Mason supported Madison's amendment once made.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} public policy she favoured pragmatism in dealing <b>with</b> <b>religious</b> matters. The {{question}} of her legitimacy was a key concern: although she was technically illegitimate under both Protestant and Catholic law, her retroactively declared illegitimacy under the English church was not a serious bar compared to having never been legitimate as the Catholics claimed she was. For this reason alone, it was never in serious doubt that Elizabeth would embrace Protestantism.|$|E

5|$|Northern triptychs and polyptychs {{were popular}} across Europe {{from the late}} 14th century, with the peak of demand lasting until the early 16th century. During the 15th century, {{they were the most}} widely {{produced}} format of northern panel painting. Preoccupied <b>with</b> <b>religious</b> subject matter, they come in two broad types: smaller, portable private devotional works, or larger altarpieces for liturgical settings. The earliest northern examples are compound works incorporating engraving and painting, usually with two painted wings that could be folded over a carved central corpus.|$|E
5|$|One form of art {{particularly}} apt for Baroque purposes was the theater. Various theatrical {{shows were}} most often staged in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>religious</b> occasions and moralizing, and commonly utilized folk stylization.

A permanent court theater with an orchestra {{was established by}} Władysław IV at the Royal Castle in Warsaw in 1637; the actor troupe, dominated by Italians, performed primarily Italian opera and ballet repertoire.|$|E

5|$|Women and men {{religious}} {{engage in}} a variety of occupations, from contemplative prayer, to teaching, to providing health care, to working as missionaries.

5|$|Government {{publications}} on {{the dangers}} of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere <b>with</b> <b>religious</b> freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, {{in large part because of}} public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services.|$|E

Delano, however, exempted his department from competitive examinations, and Congress refused to enact permanent Civil Service reform. Zachariah Chandler, who succeeded Delano in 1875, reformed the Interior Department and fired corrupt clerks in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The same year, Grant fired Attorney General George Henry Williams after his wife was discovered to be involved in a bribery scandal, and appointed reformer Edwards Pierrepont in his place. Grant suggested other reforms as well, including a proposal that states should offer free public schooling to all children; he also endorsed the Blaine Amendment, which would have forbidden government aid to schools <b>with</b> <b>religious</b> affiliations.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon reopening his business, Johnson started {{publishing}} theological and political works by Priestley and other Dissenters. Starting in the 1770s, Johnson published more specifically Unitarian works, {{as well as}} texts advocating religious toleration; he also became personally involved in the Unitarian cause. He served as a conduit for information between Dissenters {{across the country and}} supplied provincial publishers <b>with</b> <b>religious</b> publications, thereby enabling Dissenters to spread their beliefs easily. Johnson participated in efforts to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted the civil rights of Dissenters. In one six-year period of the 1770s, Johnson was responsible for publishing nearly one-third of the Unitarian works on the issue. He continued his support in 1787, 1789, and 1790, when Dissenters introduced repeal bills in Parliament, and he published much of the pro-repeal literature written by Priestley and others.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{the first}} Miss World contest (originally the Festival Bikini Contest), was {{organized}} by Eric Morley. When the winner, Kiki Håkansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, countries <b>with</b> <b>religious</b> traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. Håkansson remains {{the first and last}} Miss World to be crowned in her bikini, a crowning that was condemned by Pope Pius XII who declared the swimsuit to be sinful. Bikinis were banned from beauty pageants around the world after the controversy. In 1949 the Los Angeles Times reported that Miss America Bebe Shopp on her visit to Paris said she did not approve the bikini for American girls, though she did not mind French girls wearing them. Actresses in movies like My Favorite Brunette (1947) and the model on a 1948 cover of LIFE were shown in traditional two-piece swimwear, not the bikini.|$|E
