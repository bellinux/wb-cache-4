25|$|The Technical Officer of the Board of Inquiry (BoI) {{identified}} a suspected fatigue {{failure of the}} inboard arm of the front bottom <b>wing</b> <b>attachment</b> main forging, and suggested vibration from the high airflow volumes required by the RR Conway 11 engines as a possible cause.|$|E
25|$|On 1 June 2007 a Europa Classic, {{registration}} G-HOFC, {{broke up}} during a flight over South Wales, United Kingdom, killing both occupants. The investigation indicated irregularities {{in the construction}} of the right <b>wing</b> <b>attachment</b> at the rear lift/drag pin. There was also evidence of movement of the tailplane surfaces beyond the normal range of movement.|$|E
25|$|In November 2012 Cessna {{issued a}} Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) {{as a result}} of cracks found on its cyclic test aircraft. The MSB {{requires}} addition of new wing ribs and modifications to the <b>wing</b> <b>attachment</b> structure for the first 228 Cessna 162s delivered. The modification was extensive and required 32 man-hours to complete and was required to be done within the next 100 flight hours or at the next annual inspection, whichever came first. Cessna paid to modify all aircraft involved.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is mainly}} built with wood, a semi-monocoque construction with steel tubes for <b>wing</b> <b>attachments.</b> The two seat cockipt has dual controls. The empennage is conventional, with a braced tailplane mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage. The landing gear is a forward skid with elastic dampers and a single, fixed wheel aft of the centre of gravity.|$|R
50|$|For {{several years}} Airtrainer {{production}} ceased, although the type remained nominally available for orders. In 1991, {{in an attempt}} to win a lucrative United States Air Force contract, two new developments of the CT/4 airframe were flown - the CT/4C turboprop and the CT/4E with a 300 hp piston engine, a three-bladed propellor, 100 mm longer fuselage and <b>wing</b> <b>attachments</b> moved rearwards. Neither attracted production orders at the time but, in 1998, CT/4E production commenced with orders for the Royal New Zealand Air Force for 13 and Royal Thai Air Force for 16. Both nations used the CT/4E to replace their earlier model CT/4A and B.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the two}} {{surviving}} Junkers Ju 87s is a G-2 model {{displayed at}} the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford; the <b>wings</b> have <b>attachment</b> points for BK 3,7 gun pods {{but it is not}} displayed with them fitted.|$|R
25|$|The 737 {{had broken}} into several large pieces upon impact. These were the nose and cockpit section, the cabin up to the <b>wing</b> <b>attachment</b> point, the cabin from behind the wings to the rear airstairs, and the empennage. Although actual impact speeds were low and well within {{survivability}} limits, the structural breakup of the fuselage and exposure to freezing water nonetheless proved fatal for all persons aboard the plane except those seated in the tail section. It {{was not possible to}} determine the position of the rudder, slats, elevators, and ailerons due to impact damage and the majority of the flight control system having been destroyed.|$|E
2500|$|Assistant Chief Engineer [...] Howell [...] "Pete" [...] Miller and Zantford [...] "Granny" [...] Granville {{spent three}} days of wind tunnel testing at NYU with {{aeronautical}} engineering professor Alexander Klemin. The aircraft had a very peculiar design. Granville reasoned that a teardrop-shaped fuselage— especially as seen from directly above— would have lower drag than a straight-tapered one, so the fuselage was wider than the engine at its widest point (at the <b>wing</b> <b>attachment</b> point, within {{the length of the}} wing chord). The cockpit was located very far aft, {{just in front of the}} vertical stabilizer, in order to give the racing pilot better vision while making crowded pylon turns.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} is a flat-sided Warren girder structure, plywood covered {{apart from}} the curved glass fibre rear decking. [...] <b>Wing</b> <b>attachment</b> involves some aluminium fittings. The single seat cockpit is ahead of the wing leading edge under a single piece canopy. [...] All 460 series aircraft use a fixed, unsprung monowheel main undercarriage. [...] On the first four prototypes at least, this was mounted below the fuselage in a fairing which exposed only {{the edge of the}} wheel. [...] On the 463s, the wheel is unfaired but assisted by an integral skid. [...] The 465s have no skid and the wheel mounting is instead raised into the fuselage. [...] All have a tail bumper with a [...] "roller skate" [...] tailwheel.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the short runway and {{frequent}} winds, there have been very few safety incidents at the airport. However, at the air show held on opening day in 1959 there were two significant incidents. A Royal New Zealand Air Force Sunderland flying boat scraped its keel along the runway during a low pass in turbulent conditions; it returned to its base at Hobsonville and was beached for repair. A Royal Air Force Avro Vulcan bomber aborted its landing when it touched down short of the runway, rupturing its left main landing gear drag link, the <b>wing</b> <b>attachments</b> and engine fuel lines; the aircraft flew to Ohakea air base where it was stranded for several months being repaired.|$|R
500|$|It {{was learned}} {{that if the}} {{forklift}} were incorrectly positioned the engine/pylon assembly would not be stable as it was being handled, causing it to rock like a see-saw and jam the pylon against the <b>wing's</b> <b>attachment</b> points. The forklift operator was guided only by hand and voice signals, {{as he or she}} could not directly see the juncture between pylon and wing. [...] Positioning had to be extremely accurate or structural damage could result. Compounding the problem, maintenance work on N110AA did not go smoothly. The mechanics started to disconnect the engine and pylon, but there was a shift change halfway through the job. When work was resumed, the pylon was jammed on the wing and the forklift had to be re-positioned, resulting in unseen structural damage to the <b>wing's</b> pylon <b>attachment</b> points. The structural damage was not enough to cause an immediate failure. However, fatigue cracking developed, and worsened with each takeoff and landing cycle during the eight weeks that followed the maintenance on N110AA. [...] Finally, the damaged rear pylon mount reached its breaking point and failed. Due to the absence of this attachment, the engine, at full takeoff power, swung itself and the pylon upward on the latter's still-attached forward mount. The structure surrounding the forward pylon mount failed from the resulting stresses, and the engine/pylon assembly broke free of the wing.|$|R
2500|$|Hurricane Mk IIB {{conversion}} {{armed with}} two 40mm (1.57in) anti-tank autocannons in a gondola-style pod, one under each wing {{and a single}} Browning machine gun in each wing loaded with tracers for aiming purposes. The first aircraft flew on 18 September 1941 and deliveries started in 1942. Serial-built aircraft had additional armour for the pilot, radiator and engine, and were armed with a Rolls-Royce gun with 12 rounds, later changed to the 40mm (1.57in) Vickers S gun with 15 rounds. The outer <b>wing</b> <b>attachments</b> were strengthened so that 4G could be pulled at a weight of 8,540 lb (3,874 kg). The weight of guns and armour protection marginally impaired the aircraft's performance. These Hurricanes were nicknamed [...] "Flying Can Openers", perhaps a play on the logo of No. 6 Squadron, which flew the Hurricane starting in 1941.|$|R

2500|$|Up to 2011 {{there were}} no O-2's known to exist. However, in 2011 the {{wreckage}} of [...] O-2H 29-163 that crashed out of Kelly Field Texas on March 16, 1933 has been positively identified. The rear and central/forward portion of the fuselage behind the firewall, <b>wing</b> <b>attachments</b> and landing gear parts, tailplane and many engine parts and eight of the twelve pistons are now recovered. Research is continuing on this aircraft. It is known it was flown by Aviation Cadet Charles D. Rogers on a night recon advanced training mission. Apparently flying low, the aircraft hit a hill and burned after the crash leaving only the found wreckage today. Weather was not considered a contributing factor. Cadet Rogers was instantly killed in the crash by the impact. His body was recovered but the wreckage was abandoned due to the airframe and engine both being a writeoff.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Topology Optimization is {{a defined}} as the method of {{determining}} optimal distribution of material for the assumed design space with functionality, loads and boundary conditions [1]. Topology optimization {{can be used to}} optimize shape for the purposes of weight reduction, minimizing material requirements or selecting cost effective materials [2]. Topology optimization has been implemented through the use of finite element methods for the analysis, and optimization techniques based on the method of moving asymptotes, genetic algorithms, optimality criteria method, level sets and topological derivatives. Case study of Typical “Fuselage design” is considered for this paper to explain the benefits of Topology Optimization in the design cycle. A cylindrical shell is assumed as the design space and aerospace standard pay loads were applied on the fuselage with <b>wing</b> <b>attachments</b> as constraints. Then topological optimization is done using Finite Element (FE) based software. This optimization results in the structural concept design which satisfies all the design constraints using minimum material...|$|R

50|$|Construction was {{predominantly}} of {{wood with}} plywood skinned semi-monocoque fuselage, thick skinned built up wings, and fibreglass cockpit shell. With high g limits, high Vne and effective speed limiting air-brakes {{on the upper}} surface of the wings, the SZD-36 Cobra is popular as an aerobatic machine. There have been cases of catastrophic structural failure due to incorrect <b>wing</b> <b>attachment,</b> caused ultimately by worn parts in the attachment assemblies.|$|E
5000|$|After several {{accidents}} {{attributed to}} structural failure, all Foka aircraft extant {{have now been}} limited to a maximum speed of 165 km/h in clear air and 140 km/h IFR/rough air.

40|$|As a {{follow up}} of the {{recommendations}} of the design review committee a few modifications were made in the structural design of the LCA wing. The important among them being the addition of three more bolts on the rear side of the port wing to strengthen, the <b>wing</b> <b>attachments.</b> Steel leading edge proposed in the original design was replaced by an aluminium alloy leading edge. A revised finite element analysis of the wing establishes that in general the stress levels are low over {{a large portion of the}} wing. The stress values in the wing bolts show that the bolts have adequate factor of safety. The splitter plate analysis results point to the adequate strength of them, and the natural frequency spectrum, shows that the fundamental frequency of the old model is much above the buzz frequency. The latter observation leads to they conclusion that the buzz noticed in the model is not due to any resonance phenomenon...|$|R
5000|$|On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 {{participated in}} an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, {{formerly}} Rongotai Airport. After a [...] touch-and-go landing on Runway 34, it came around for a full stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold, the port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging <b>wing</b> <b>attachments,</b> engine fuel lines and the main landing gear drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the runway surface before {{it was able to}} lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.|$|R
