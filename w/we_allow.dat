25|$|Take {{for example}} {{one who is}} invited to dine with his colleagues or clients, would <b>we</b> <b>allow</b> him to avoid embarrassment by eating fruit and {{vegetables}} from which terumot and ma'asrot (which nowadays is Rabbinic) have not been removed, or by consuming hamets she-avar alav haPesah, or by drinking Stam yeynam (wine touched or poured by a non-Jew). Or alternatively, suppose someone is at a meeting and is ashamed to walk out in order to daven Minha. And what about prayers {{at the airport in}} between flights. Would <b>we</b> <b>allow</b> him to forgo his rabbinic prayer obligation because of this embarrassment? The answer is that in those cases where acting according to halakha - be it to not eat terumot and ma’asrot, or to not drink stam yeynam, or to fulfill ones prayer obligation – creates the embarrassment, then kevod ha-beriyyot cannot set aside the Rabbinic prohibition. One should be proud to be fulfilling the halakha.|$|E

30|$|To {{provide a}} basis for {{selecting}} the appropriate number and duration of beacons available in each trial, a pilot experiment was conducted. Six (Mage[*]=[*] 22.1  years; 4 men, 2 women) participants attempted to locate a sequence of 40 successive landmarks in the VE. For the first two participants, <b>we</b> <b>allowed</b> two beacons for 3  s duration each; both participants failed to complete the task. For the second two participants, <b>we</b> <b>allowed</b> four beacons for 3  s each; one of the two participants completed the task. Finally, for the final two participants, <b>we</b> <b>allowed</b> five beacons for 5  s duration each and both participants were able to complete the task. Notably, one participant found it much more challenging than the other. Given these results, we determined that the main experiment would provide up to five beacons for 5  s duration each, per trial.|$|R
25|$|Using {{the above}} methods for simple polygons, <b>we</b> <b>allow</b> that {{particular}} regions within the polygon may have their area multiplied {{by a factor}} which we call {{the density of the}} region. For example, the central convex pentagon {{in the center of a}} pentagram has density 2. The two triangular regions of a cross-quadrilateral (like a figure 8) have opposite-signed densities, and adding their areas together can give a total area of zero for the whole figure.|$|E
25|$|If <b>we</b> <b>allow</b> for the {{possibility}} that K1a9 and N1b2 might have a Near Eastern source, then we can estimate the overall fraction of European maternal ancestry at ~65%. Given the strength of the case for even these founders having a European source, however, our best estimate is to assign ~81% of Ashkenazi lineages to a European source, ~8% to the Near East and ~1% further to the east in Asia, with ~10% remaining ambiguous... Thus at least two-thirds and most likely more than four-fifths of Ashkenazi maternal lineages have a European ancestry.|$|E
25|$|There is one {{fundamental}} lesson we {{must learn}} from this experience: electricity is really different from everything else. It cannot be stored, it cannot be seen, and we cannot do without it, which makes opportunities {{to take advantage of}} a deregulated market endless. It is a public good that must be protected from private abuse. If Murphy's Law were written for a market approach to electricity, then the law would state 'any system that can be gamed, will be gamed, and at the worst possible time.' And a market approach for electricity is inherently gameable. Never again can <b>we</b> <b>allow</b> private interests to create artificial or even real shortages and to be in control.|$|E

500|$|Senior Software Engineer Dr. Kelly Ward, a hair {{simulation}} {{major and}} {{graduate from the}} University of North Carolina, was placed in charge of developing special software meant to assist the animators in animating 70 to 75feet of hair. Ward revealed that, in real life, the character's hair would weigh roughly 60 pounds, [...] "more weight than a real person {{would be able to}} move around as effortlessly as <b>we</b> <b>allow</b> Rapunzel to do in the movie". For simplicity sake, the animators reduced the realistic total of 100,000 individual strands of hair found on a typical human head to a more manageable 100 for Rapunzel. Acquiring the unique but realistic shade of golden blonde for Rapunzel's hair also proved challenging animators.|$|E

500|$|The {{proposal}} of using criminal sanctions to enforce attendance under this new system was opposed by MPs {{from both the}} Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, who believed compulsion and threats were the wrong approach to increasing participation. A spokesperson for the DfES said the proposals were not about [...] "forcing young people to do something they don't want to", and that [...] "we are letting young people down if <b>we</b> <b>allow</b> them to leave education and training without skills {{at the age of}} 16." [...] However, the Prime Minister's Queen's Speech in November 2007, which discussed the raise in school leaving age, suggested that pupils who failed to comply with new laws are to be expected to face fines or community service, rather than custodial sentencing which had previously been proposed. Local Authorities will also be expected to ensure pupils are participating up to 18 years of age.|$|E

Similarly we UMNO Youth have to be often seen as a very racialist political group fighting for the Malay interests....

500|$|The park's attractions include {{naturalized}} plantings {{that are}} inspired by the landscape that grew on the disused tracks, and views {{of the city and}} the Hudson River. The trail is made of pebble-dash concrete walkways that swells and constricts, swings from side to side, and divides into concrete tines that meld the hardscape with the planting embedded in railroad gravel mulch. [...] "By opening the paving, <b>we</b> <b>allow</b> the plants to bleed through," [...] said landscape architect James Corner, [...] "almost as if the plants were colonizing the paved areas. There's a sort of blending or bleeding or suturing between the hard paving, the surface for people to stroll on, and the planting...." [...] Stretches of track and ties recall the High Line's former use. Portions of track are adaptively re-used for rolling lounges positioned for river views. The 120-species plant palette, curated by Dutch landscape architect Piet Oudolf, includes rugged meadow plants such as clump-forming grasses, liatris, and coneflowers, with scattered stands of sumac and smokebush, but not limited to American natives. At the Gansevoort Street end, a grove of mixed species of birch already provides some dappled shade by late afternoon. Ipê timber for the built-in benches has come from a managed forest certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, to ensure sustainable use and the conservation of biological diversity, water resources, and fragile ecosystems.
