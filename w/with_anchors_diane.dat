In this program, ABC News <b>anchors</b> <b>Diane</b> Sawyer and Sam Donaldson and correspondent John Stossel find out as they probe the downside of the self-esteem movement.

In 1992, WOTV brought back a full news department {{for a second time}} branded as 41 News.

2500|$|In April 2010, KNTV {{entered into}} an {{arrangement}} with former NBC affiliate KRON-TV to broadcast network programs during {{instances in which}} KNTV has to preempt them for special programming such as telecasts of San Francisco Giants games. Incidentally, KRON's owner, Young Broadcasting discussed entering KRON into a shared services agreement with KNTV's owner NBCUniversal, which ultimately never materialized. KRON's default carriage of preempted NBC shows ended in 2012, when KICU-TV (then owned by Cox Enterprises as a sister station to KTVU) resumed those duties until the sale of both KICU and KTVU to Fox Television Stations in 2014; pre-emptions are now handled in-house with a move of NBC programming to KNTV's COZI TV subchannel. On April 13, 2010, KNTV {{became the subject of}} Stephen Colbert's program, The Colbert Report, where Colbert played a clip read by weekend <b>anchor</b> <b>Diane</b> Dwyer on the issue of [...] "unpaid internships". Colbert would eventually use that given clip to set the stage for laughs based on unpaid interns.|$|R
