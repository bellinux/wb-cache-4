5|$|In 1935, the United States Navy Naval Research Laboratory began {{studies and}} tests on low {{visibility}} camouflage for ships. Some measures were deceptive, like a false painted bow <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> {{give the impression}} of high speed at all times. Measures making cruisers resemble destroyers were discontinued after causing station-keeping confusion among ships operating in formation.|$|E
5|$|The cycle repeats at a {{frequency}} relative to {{how long it}} takes a <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> travel to the first open hole and back twice (i.e. four times the length of the pipe). For example: when all the holes bar the very top one are open (i.e. the trill 'B' key is pressed), the note A4 (440 Hz) is produced. This represents a repeat of the cycle 440 times per second.|$|E

5|$|Alan begins {{driving the}} car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. They look behind to <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> Alan, and he waves back. However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a {{railroad}} with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right {{into the path of}} the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides to go back on the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane John was the {{eleventh}} named storm, seventh hurricane, and fifth major hurricane of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. Hurricane John developed on August 28 from a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> {{the south of}} Mexico. Favorable conditions allowed the storm to intensify quickly, and it attained peak winds of 135mph (215km/h) on August 30. Eyewall replacement cycles and land interaction with western Mexico weakened the hurricane, and John made landfall on southeastern Baja California Sur with winds of 110mph (180km/h) on September 1. It slowly weakened as it moved northwestward through the Baja California peninsula, and dissipated on September 4. Moisture from {{the remnants of the}} storm entered the southwest United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E

5|$|In a {{broadcast}} system, the central high-powered broadcast tower transmits a high-frequency electromagnetic <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> numerous low-powered receivers. The high-frequency wave {{sent by the}} tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then tuned so as {{to pick up the}} high-frequency wave and a demodulator is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either analog (signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded as a set of discrete values).|$|E
5|$|On October 7, a {{vigorous}} tropical wave emerged {{off the coast}} of Africa near Cape Verde, and despite semi-favorable conditions, the wave did not develop initially, due to embedded westerlies, which caused the <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> remain disorganized, despite having deep convection. Six days later, the wave had reached the Lesser Antilles, and split, the northern portion of the wave then developed into Tropical Depression Sixteen on October 16. The depression rapidly intensified to a tropical storm, and then a hurricane the next day, receiving the name Nana. Development increased slightly and the system reached its peak intensity of 85mph (140km/h) that same day. Nana dissipated while heading southward on October 21.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} transport, {{they are}} {{surprised}} when three armored trucks leave Steve's mansion, but Napster is able to determine which one carries the bullion, and manipulates the traffic accordingly. Knowing that Steve is monitoring the transport by helicopter, they get {{the car to the}} target spot and then create a diversion as they detonate explosives to drop the part of the road with the car into the old subway tunnels below. Stella cracks the safe, and they load up the Coopers with the gold. They race from the subway to the Los Angeles River and through the city, pursued by Steve's henchmen on motorcycles, with Napster helping to create a green <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> evade traffic. Steve himself eventually leaves his helicopter and steals a truck to follow them to Union Station.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{noticeable}} features {{is their}} golden liver-coloured coat which {{is unique to}} the breed. Historically however, {{there have also been}} examples of both black and sandy coloured Sussex Spaniels. The coat is thick (sometimes with a slight <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.|$|E
5|$|Reconnaissance Aircraft {{and surface}} reports {{confirmed}} {{the existence of}} a circulation. Dean moved northwestward at 22mph (35km/h), {{under the influence of the}} Bermuda High to its northeast. The storm strengthened slightly to reach winds of 60mph (95km/h) later on August 22, though the circulation was exposed on the western edge of the convection due to the storm's quick forward motion and persistent wind shear. Initial forecasts predicted the shear to decrease, allowing Dean to attain hurricane status with winds of over 80mph (130km/h). However, an upper-level trough produced an increase of shear over the storm, and by August 23 Dean weakened to a tropical depression. Hours later, the circulation dissipated, and Dean degenerated into a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> the east of the Bahamas. Regeneration was considered unlikely at the time.|$|E
5|$|The band {{formed at}} Manchester University, but settled in London where they signed with Charisma. They {{went through a}} number of incarnations in their early years, {{including}} a brief split in 1969. When they reformed, they found minor commercial success with The Least We Can Do Is <b>Wave</b> <b>to</b> Each Other (February 1970), and after the follow-up album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), stabilised around a line-up of Hammill, organist Hugh Banton, saxophonist David Jackson, and drummer Guy Evans. The quartet subsequently achieved significant success in Italy with the release of Pawn Hearts in 1971.|$|E

5|$|The group's {{previous}} album, The Least We Can Do Is <b>Wave</b> <b>to</b> Each Other (February 1970) {{had achieved}} {{a small amount}} of commercial success and critical acclaim in the UK and Europe. The next project the group attempted was recording the soundtrack to the 1970 film Eyewitness, but it was rejected, largely for being too sinister. They started to develop a live following during 1970, counting film director Anthony Minghella as one of their fans, but things backfired after a show at the Royal Festival Hall in June that drew negative reviews from Melody Makers Chris Welch. Around this time, the band decided to write some new material for a follow-up album.|$|E
5|$|The {{landings}} initially encountered heavy {{resistance from}} the German 716th Division; the preliminary bombardment proved less effective than had been hoped, and rough weather forced the first <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> be delayed until 07:35. Several assault companies—notably those of the Royal Winnipeg Rifles and The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada—took heavy casualties in the opening minutes of the first wave. Strength of numbers, coordinated fire support from artillery and armoured squadrons, cleared most of the coastal defences within two hours of landing. The reserves of the 7th and 8th brigades began deploying at 08:30 (along with the Royal Marines), while the 9th Brigade began its deployment at 11:40.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression One brought severe {{flooding}} to Jamaica in June1979. The second {{tropical cyclone}} of the Atlantic hurricane season, the depression developed from a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> {{the south of}} Grand Cayman on June11. Tracking generally northward, the depression passed west of Jamaica. On June12, the depression peaked with maximum sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h), never having reached tropical storm status. The following day, it made landfall in Cuba, where minimal impact was recorded. Early on June14, the depression emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean and then moved parallel to {{the east coast of}} Florida for a few days. The depression made another landfall in South Carolina on June16 and dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Carlos was {{the first}} of five {{tropical}} cyclones to make landfall during the 2003 Pacific hurricane season. It formed on June26 from a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> the south of Mexico. It quickly strengthened as it approached the coast, and early on June27 Carlos moved ashore in Oaxaca with winds of 65mph (100km/h). The storm rapidly deteriorated to a remnant low, which persisted until dissipating on June29. Carlos brought heavy rainfall to portions of southern Mexico, peaking at 337mm (13.3in) in two locations in Guerrero. Throughout its path, the storm damaged about 30,000houses, with a monetary damage total of 86.7million pesos (2003MXN, $8million 2003USD). At least nine people were killed throughout the country, seven due to mudslides and two from river flooding; there was also a report of two missing fishermen.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Dorothy was {{the deadliest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1970 Atlantic hurricane season. The fourth named storm and fifth tropical storm or hurricane of the season, Dorothy developed on August17 from a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> {{the east of}} the Lesser Antilles. It tracked west-northwestward throughout its entire duration, and despite forecasts of attaining hurricane status, Dorothy reached peak winds of 70mph (110km/)– slightly below hurricane status. The storm struck Martinique on August20, and subsequently began a gradual weakening trend in the Caribbean Sea. On August23, Dorothy dissipated south of Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Elena was a weak {{tropical}} storm that moved ashore along Texas in the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season. The sixth {{tropical storm}} of the season, Elena developed from a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> {{the south of}} Louisiana on August 29. It tracked generally west-northwest, strengthening little before making landfall on Matagorda Island on September 1 as a minimal tropical storm; the storm quickly dissipated over land. Elena dropped moderate rainfall along its path, causing two direct deaths in Houston from drowning; storm damage was minor, amounting to less than $10 million (1979 USD, $28 million 2007 USD). Lightning from the storm set fire to an oil supertanker in Houston, causing three indirect deaths and 13 injuries.|$|E
