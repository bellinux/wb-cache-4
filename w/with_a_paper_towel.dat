40|$|The {{objective}} was to compare the in vivo distribution profiles of betamethasone 17 -valerate (BMV) across the stratum corneum (SC) following (a) delivery from gelled and un-gelled formulations, and (b) two different skin cleaning procedures {{at the end of}} the application period. BMV was dissolved in gelled and un-gelled vehicles comprising either medium chain triglycerides (MCT) or a brand microemulsion (ME). The BMV concentration was adjusted to 80 % of saturation and applied to the forearms of healthy volunteers. After 2 h, the treated skin site was cleaned either <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dry <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> or <b>with</b> <b>an</b> isopropyl alcohol swab, and the SC was then progressively removed by repeated adhesive tape-stripping. BMV distribution profiles across the SC showed reasonable reproducibility, and that delivery from the ME was significantly superior to that from MCT. Gelled vehicles were less efficiently removed from the skin surface by dry wiping than un-gelled formulations. Removing excess formulation more aggressively with isopropyl alcohol resulted in a lower apparent uptake of drug into the SC. Excess gelled formulation may be trapped in the skin 'furrows', and requires an efficient skin cleaning procedure to ensure its complete removal...|$|R

30|$|Substrate and spawn (5 % {{inoculation}} rate, unless indicated differently) {{were mixed}} manually in 1  kg portions {{and placed in}} transparent polyethylene bags. To allow gas exchange, {{the upper end of}} the plastic bag was fitted into a plastic cylinder (4  cm diameter) and the hole covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> clean white <b>paper</b> <b>towel.</b> Incubation lasted 3  weeks at 24 – 26  °C and after the substrate was colonized by the mushroom mycelium, the bag was opened and a casing (peat: lime: water 1 : 1 : 3; no thermal treatment) overlay (4  cm deep) was applied. The substrate was further incubated at 18  °C and 90 % relative humidity for three more weeks. Irrigation was applied daily. When used, supplements were mixed into the substrate at spawning and before applying the casing (9 % each time). Mushrooms were harvested (three breaks) when the pileus was open and the veil broken. No attempts were made to control weed molds and diseases.|$|R
40|$|The spore-forming {{bacterium}} Bacillus cereus {{can survive}} pasteurisation {{and thus a}} limiting factor for the shelf life of pasteurized milk. The occurrence of B. cereus spores in the housing environment of dairy cows was investigated and the routes of contamination elucidated also measures to improve hygiene in cubicles and alleys were tested. High numbers of spores were found in deep sawdust bedded cubicles hence a source of contamination of milk via soiled teats. In laboratory tests, type of different bedding material, pH, {{and the availability of}} nutrient in form of faeces in the beds were shown to be important factors for the growth of B. cereus. In deep sawdust bedded cubicles more frequent adding of fresh bedding and entire bed replacement had a limited effect on reducing spore content in the beds. It was shown by experimentally feeding spores to cows that highly contaminated feed could be a potential source of contamination via faeces and soiled teats. The effects of different premilking teat-cleaning methods were evaluated on experimentally spore contaminated teats. The most effective method in reducing the milk spore content (96 % reduction) was the use of a moist washable towel with or without soap followed by drying <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dry <b>paper</b> <b>towel.</b> Mechanical scrapers on top of the slatted floor reduced the amount of manure on alley floor, hence reducing the faecal contamination in the cubicles, and improving the hygiene score of udder and teats. The drainage capacity of slatted floors was tested in a laboratory arrangement. For loose faeces from high-yielding dairy cows, the greater void ratio the better drainage capacity, irrespective of slat and slot widths was obtained...|$|R

50|$|All Phyllobates {{species are}} highly toxic, and P. sp. aff. aurotaenia is no exception. Its skin {{contains}} batrachotoxins, extremely potent neurotoxic alkaloids. When {{in contact with}} the skin, batrachotoxins seep through open wounds and, in some cases, skin pores, and prevent nerves from transmitting impulses, leaving the muscles in an inactive state of contraction. This can lead to heart failure or fibrillation. Some native people use this poison to hunt by coating darts with the frogs' poison. Alkaloid batrachotoxins can be stored by frogs for years after the frog is deprived of the food-based source, and such toxins do not readily deteriorate, even when transferred to another surface. Chickens and dogs have died from contact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> on which the more toxic P. terribilis had walked.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAim: {{hospital}} acquired infections {{cost the}} NHS £ 1 billion {{each year and}} medical equipment may act both as source and vector of nosocomial infection. This study examined bacterial contamination of Doppler ultrasound probes (USP) in routine use on vascular surgical wards in six hospitals and the knowledge of staff {{about the potential for}} cross infection from contaminated probes. Methods: probe head impressions and swab cultures of probe holders were plated on mannitol salt agar before and after cleaning <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towel.</b> Putative S. aureus isolates were identified to species level and susceptibility to selected antimicrobials tested. Concurrently, junior medical staff were surveyed about probe cleaning protocols. Results: methicillin susceptible S. aureus was isolated from 2 / 21 (10 %) with near confluent bacterial growth from six others (28 %). The latter may have obscured low numbers of S. aureus. Further since swabs were plated without prior enrichment culture, it is likely that contamination with S. aureus might have been underestimated. No positive cultures were obtained after wiping the USP <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towel.</b> 22 / 23 (95 %) junior doctors failed to clean the USP prior to use. Conclusion: USP contamination with pathogenic bacteria occurs under “in-use” conditions and junior medical staff are unaware of simple measures to prevent this. Strict guidelines for USP cleaning between patient use should, therefore, be adopted particularly when monitoring postoperative graft patency...|$|E

30|$|The wheat {{culture has}} been {{introduced}} {{in our previous study}} (Zhao et al. 2013). In brief, the wheat seeds with sterilization treatment were germinated on wet filter paper for 7  days, and then fifty seedlings were transferred to 1  L glass beakers containing half-concentrated Hoagland’s solution (Lin and Xing 2008) for further growth at 25  °C and a lighting period of 16  h per day. When their roots reached 8  ±  1  cm, and leaves grew 10  ±  1  cm, these seedlings were transferred to an exposure apparatus containing half-concentrated Hoagland’s solution with each of PFCAs at 1  μg/mL for the study of PFCA uptake induced by salinity and temperature. After the wheat was grown for five days in nutrient solution at different salinities (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4  %) or different temperatures (20, 25 and 30  °C), they were harvested at a time. The harvested wheat was divided into shoots and roots which were washed in deionized water to remove any external salt or PFCA residues and patted dry <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towel,</b> and stored at − 20  °C until extraction. Three replicates for each salinity and temperature were used, including blank controls. During the five days of exposure, the PFCA-spiked nutrient solution was exchanged three times to keep the PFCA’s concentration at a constant level and the PFCA concentrations in the nutrient solution were also monitored.|$|E
40|$|When a gas is {{compressed}} rapidly, its temperature will increase. This {{process is}} known as adiabatic compression. You’ve probably noticed this effect while inflating a bicycle tire. The increase in temperature results from the work being done on the gas. Pushing on the gas increases the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. This increase in internal energy manifests itself as an increase in temperature. The rapid compression reduces {{the amount of energy}} lost to the environment. In a diesel engine, air is compressed adiabatically. This compression raises the temperature inside the cylinder to the flash point of the fuel mixture. The diesel engine differs from the gasoline engine by using adiabatic compression to ignite the fuel rather than a spark plug. The fire syringe provides a rather dramatic way of demonstrating the heating of a gas, in this case air, that accompanies rapid compression. With this fire syringe, the air can reach a temperature of over 260 degrees C (500 degrees F). As cotton fibers burn at 235 degrees C (454 degrees F), a small piece of cotton fiber placed {{at the bottom of the}} combustion tube will ignite. USING THE FIRE SYRINGE: Note: Prior to use, ensure that the seal is tight. To do this, place the piston 2 - 3 cm into the combustion tube. Depress the piston as far as possible and then release it. The piston should spring back almost to the end of the combustion tube. If this does not occur, the O-rings may need to be greased with silicone lubricant to ensure a tight seal. Once the syringe is ready, follow these steps for proper use: 1. Put on protective eyewear. 2. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towel,</b> dry the inside of the combustion tube. 3. Place a small piece of cotton fiber in the bottom of the combustion tube. 4. Insert the end of the piston part way into the combustion tube...|$|E
