5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring <b>of</b> <b>batter.</b> Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> stale pancake <b>batter.</b> Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|R

Domestic violence prevention advocates and medical professionals are becoming increasingly conscious of the neurobiological consequences <b>of</b> <b>battering,</b> producing a wellspring of evidence with potential relevance to the battered woman 2 ̆ 7 s case.

40|$|Despite growing {{awareness}} {{of the severity of}} domestic violence, the lives <b>of</b> <b>battered</b> women are too often misconstrued by the Canadian public and the judicial system. The author argues that stereotypes <b>of</b> victimized <b>battered</b> women emanating from the courts and feminist theory may both prevent women who kill their partner from making valid claims of self-defence and generally undermine women's fight against oppression. The author reviews the doctrine <b>of</b> the <b>battered</b> woman syndrome and its application in the context of self-defence to illustrate how the courts' treatment of the doctrine conveys a narrow and incomplete depiction <b>of</b> <b>battered</b> women. An alternative theoretical framework based on battered women's partial agency is proposed as a means to address feminist theory's simplified representation <b>of</b> <b>battered</b> women. Various law and policy reform initiatives {{in the criminal justice system}} are explored to assess how the law may validate and promote battered women's partial agency...|$|R

Major attempts to explain the behavioral profile <b>of</b> children <b>of</b> <b>battered</b> women include issues related to family characteristics and patterns; effects of family violence on children; links between marital violence and child abuse; and critiques of assessment and treatment research studies. The major domains frequently studied in children's behavior problems related to exposure to multiple forms of family violence are identified and discussed. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the effects <b>of</b> wife <b>battering</b> and a violent home environment on the development of children, and the role these play in understanding the developmental delays and behavioral dysfunction of children who witness and experience violence. Research on the approaches to the assessment and treatment <b>of</b> children <b>of</b> <b>battered</b> women is reviewed. Directions for future research are also discussed.
