5|$|The sensors were {{designed}} for air deployment by either of two means. The first was by parachute, which <b>would</b> <b>hang</b> the devices in trees, where {{they appeared to be}} part of the foliage. The second method was the use of gravity, which would drive the spike-shaped device into the ground like a lawn dart, burying all but their antennae, which {{were designed}} to appear as weeds. Surprisingly, approximately 80 percent of the air-dropped sensors were found to be operational after delivery.|$|E
5|$|There were {{numerous}} proposals {{at the time}} to build an electric aerial tramway, with one such line to go down the Avenida de Mayo. One proposal was the 1889 Le Tellier proposal, which envisioned multiple lines running along the city's wider avenues with the trams moved using cables and <b>would</b> <b>hang</b> from steel rails fixed to 6 metre high steel and iron posts positioned in 10–15 metre intervals. The lines would take 24 months to build and construction would commence 3 months after their approval by the Argentine National Congress, a decision which was ultimately not taken, favouring instead an underground tramway.|$|E

5000|$|Once Ali ibn Abi Talib, told Maytham that he <b>would</b> be <b>hanged</b> {{on account}} of the love for the Imam of his time.

The tree on which he <b>would</b> be <b>hanged</b> was the {{smallest}} of the ten trees existing in the farm at that time. Maytham was also informed that his tongue would be cut out because he would not stop praising his Imam of time (Ali ibn Abi Talib). After getting this information, it is recorded in history that, Maytham used to go to the tree pointed out by Ali ibn Abi Talib, clean the place and water the tree and offer prayers saying, [...] "O tree! You are for me and I am for you. Months and years passed by, Ali was martyred then Hasan ibn Ali (the Second Shī`a Imām) was martyred and Maytham kept waiting for the time.|$|R

25|$|In a rare show of inter-theater cooperation, MACV-SOG landed four {{of their}} {{long-range}} reconnaissance patrols from South Vietnam on the northern fringe of Tchepone as a diversion, also on 5 January. The teams reported any PAVN troop movements toward the Silver Buckle units. Additionally, from 12 to 17 January, MACV-SOG staged diversions south of Tchepone by faked recon team insertions and resupply drops at 11 locations. The actual recon teams <b>would</b> <b>hang</b> on north of Tchepone until 22 January.|$|E
25|$|In January 1948, {{the leaders}} of Givat Shaul met with the mukhtar of Deir Yassin {{to work out a}} non-aggression pact: if armed militia entered Deir Yassin, the villagers <b>would</b> <b>hang</b> out laundry in a certain {{sequence}} or place lanterns in a particular location. In return, patrols from Givat Shaul guaranteed safe passage to Deir Yassin residents, in vehicles or on foot, passing through their neighborhood on the way to Jerusalem. Over time, Deir Yassin became a halfway site for Arab forces moving from Ein Karem and Malha to al-Qastal and Kolonia, which overlooked the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway.|$|E
25|$|The basic costume of the Mongol {{fighting}} man {{consisted of}} a heavy coat fastened at the waist by a leather belt. From the belt <b>would</b> <b>hang</b> his sword, dagger, and possibly an axe. This long robe-like coat would double over, left breast over right, and be secured with a button a few inches below the right armpit. The coat was lined with fur. Underneath the coat, a shirt-like undergarment with long, wide sleeves was commonly worn. Silk and metallic thread were increasingly used. The Mongols wore protective heavy silk undershirts. Even if an arrow pierced their mail or leather outer garment, the silk from the undershirt would stretch to wrap itself around the arrow as it entered the body, reducing damage caused by the arrow shaft, and making removal of the arrow easier.|$|E

25|$|B’laan tribe is {{probably}} the most popular Mindanao occupants of Mountain provinces for Hanging Coffins of Sagada. Even before the influence of Christianity, the elders feared being buried on the ground, since they wanted to reach heaven in their afterlife. Out of love and concern, the family <b>would</b> <b>hang</b> the coffins {{on the wall of the}} cave (such as Lumiang cave). However, this kind of burial procedure was similar to other fishing communities like Banton of Romblon. Another unique characteristic of this pre-colonial burial custom contains the tradition of inserting jars in the coffin. This was similar to the Manunggul jar discovered in Tabon cave, Palawan, making the custom pre-existing even before the pre-colonial era. For B’laan people, tree served as a zone of final rest, which is a unique pattern for most of the Mindanao tribes’ burial custom as well.|$|E
25|$|As Williams' {{mother worked}} several jobs to support them, Williams was a {{latchkey}} kid and often engaged in mischief on the streets. Williams recalled that, as a child, he <b>would</b> <b>hang</b> out in abandoned houses and vacant lots around his neighborhood in South Central {{where he would}} watch adults get drunk, abuse drugs, gamble and engage in pit bull fights. Williams stated that after the adults finished the dog fighting they would make the children fight each other. Williams participated in these street fights regularly as a child where adults would bet on him and give him part of the proceeds for winning his fights. Williams was often the target of older bullies in his neighborhood and, {{by the age of}} twelve, he began carrying a switchblade in order to protect himself against older street thugs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{international}} game, Scotland against England on 30 November 1872, England played with seven or eight forwards in a 1–1–8 or 1–2–7 formation, and Scotland with six, in a 2–2–6 formation. For England, one player would remain in defence, picking up loose balls, {{and one or two}} players <b>would</b> <b>hang</b> around midfield and kick the ball upfield for the other players to chase. The English style of play at the time was all about individual excellence and English players were renowned for their dribbling skills. Players would attempt to take the ball forward as far as possible and only when they could proceed no further, would they kick it ahead for someone else to chase. Scotland surprised England by actually passing the ball among players. The Scottish outfield players were organised into pairs and each player would always attempt to pass the ball to his assigned partner. Ironically, with so much attention given to attacking play, the game ended in a 0–0 draw.|$|E

25|$|A {{week or so}} later, on 21 March, Colpoys {{captured}} three Spanish luggers under {{a battery}} of six 24-pounders in the port of Avilés. Two of the captured vessels, Santa Buena Ventura and San Antonio were both armed with two guns and carried cargoes of flax and steel. The third vessel was San Real, which was in ballast. Ussher, with six men, was in the lead British boat. When {{he and his men}} arrived at the first of the three Spanish vessels their crews and some soldiers stationed on board them jumped off. Still, the British took 13 men prisoners. Apparently, he sent two men to the commander of the battery protecting the port to inform him that if the Spanish fired on British as they withdrew Ussher <b>would</b> <b>hang</b> his prisoners. Colpoys had two men wounded in the attack, one of them seriously. Ussher left his eleven remaining prisoners on San Real, which he left behind. The two luggers arrived at Penzance on 31 March, and San Antonio arrived at Plymouth in mid-April. Bon Aventura arrived there on 17 April. The Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded Ussher an honour sword valued at £50 for his feat.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September 1951, the Chinese Air Force—now {{suddenly}} {{one of the}} world's largest due to Soviet aid—kicked off {{a campaign}} to regain air superiority over North Korea. Although an inexperienced air force, flying with no set tactical doctrine, their 525 MiG-15s outnumbered FEAF's 89 F-86 Sabres by a six to one margin. MiG-15 formations emerging from their Manchurian sanctuary could number up to 90 planes. Being able to fly higher than the F-86s, MiG-15s <b>would</b> <b>hang</b> above UN aircraft before choosing to attack with an advantage. On 25 September, a UN reconnaissance plane spotted an advanced 7,000 foot long airfield for MiGs being built near Saamchan, North Korea. Two other airstrips under construction were spotted on 14 October, {{close enough to the}} original one that aircraft from one field could defend all three. If the communists succeeded in manning these fields, they would have air superiority all the way south to Pyongyang. These three fields were targeted for B-29 raids. The three airfields were cratered into disuse, but B-29 losses were severe enough that they switched to night operations to reduce casualties. By mid-December 1951, it became apparent the communists had lost their attempt at air superiority.|$|E
25|$|Following the committal hearing, the Attorney-General advised Devlin that {{he would}} not be using the {{evidence}} regarding the Hullets in the Morrell trial, but seeking a second indictment relating to Mrs Hullett, which he did on 5 March 1957. Had this been proceeded with, a second committal hearing would have been required. The trial on the indictment relating to Mrs Morrell started on 18 March 1957 at the Old Bailey, with that relating to Mrs Hullett held back for a possible second separate trial. Three days later, a new Homicide Act came into effect; a single murder by poison became a non-capital offence. Adams, having been indicted on both charges before this date, would still face the death penalty if convicted. The Home Secretary would be less likely to grant clemency in the case of a second murder conviction in the Hullett case, as this would make it far more difficult politically to sentence Adams to life imprisonment, particularly as a double murder could still be capital under the 1957 Homicide Act, and Devlin considered that the Attorney-General's aim in bringing forward a second indictment was to make it more likely that Adams <b>would</b> <b>hang.</b>|$|E
