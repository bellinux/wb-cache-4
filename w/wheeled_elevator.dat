5000|$|... #Caption: Common {{sign for}} <b>wheel</b> chair <b>elevators</b> - Seoul, South Korea ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} ways to start multiball (locking three balls, elevator, or slots). Once it is active, shoot the {{roulette}} <b>wheel,</b> sewer, or <b>elevator</b> for jackpots.|$|R
25|$|A {{parallel}} {{development to}} the PT-3 series, the XO-17 was a converted PT-3 with such refinements as improved fuselage streamlining, oleo shock absorbers, <b>wheel</b> brakes, balanced <b>elevators</b> and increased fuel capacity.|$|R
5000|$|Mk 2 Production version. Three built. Slightly higher {{aspect ratio}} wing than the prototype. Schemp - Hirth dive brakes, trim {{located on the}} right <b>elevator,</b> <b>wheel</b> and skid for the main undercarriage.|$|R
2500|$|The Griffon {{airframe}} {{is constructed}} from aluminum tubing, with {{the wings and}} tail covered with doped aircraft fabric. The wing {{is supported by a}} [...] "V" [...] strut and utilizes jury struts. It features a three tube tail that allows the pusher propeller to be located in between the tail booms. Standard features supplied included brakes, electric starting, <b>wheel</b> pants, <b>elevator</b> trim system and a plastic cockpit pod fairing with a windshield. The wings and tail surfaces can be folded for trailering or storage.|$|R
50|$|The mill was {{completed}} in 1889 and equipped by Sandycroft and Company, of Chester U.K., with three engines aggregating 54 h.p., Cornish boilers, piston jiggers, stone breakers, two pairs of rollers, two raff <b>wheels</b> and <b>elevators,</b> classifier, three sluices, six 4.9m Borleas round buddles, picking tables, three Frue vanners and a separator. Richard King remained {{as director of the}} company and Edward King as mine manager. When operations resumed in 1890, the mill ran only briefly yielding 274 tons of concentrate valued at £6,411. Soon after it closed permanently and King's mine was let to tributors but it too closed at the end of 1891 when the company abandoned its leases.|$|R
50|$|His {{airplanes}} lacked ailerons, {{relying on}} just rudder and elevators for control, via a steering wheel {{mounted on a}} tiller. The <b>wheel</b> controlled the <b>elevators</b> while sideways motion of the tiller controlled the rudder. The wheel could be temporarily locked {{with the help of}} two dowels. The low center of gravity provided by the parasol wing allowed for the lateral stability that this type of control system requires.|$|R
50|$|Primary {{flight control}} is {{achieved}} by use of dual control wheels and rudder pedals. The control <b>wheels</b> operate the <b>elevator</b> and ailerons mechanically through a system of cables, pulleys, push-pull tubes and bell cranks. Trim functions, microphone keying, autopilot override and steering system switches {{are located in the}} control wheels. The rudder pedals mechanically operate the rudder for directional yaw control. Nose wheel steering is electrically controlled via the rudder pedals.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{buildings}} constructed {{were the}} 16-room, two-story stone house measuring 34 x 40 ft with a [...] wing. Four stone and two frame five-room cottages, complemented the main dwelling {{along with an}} ice house, a cow barn, and a chicken house. The farm was divided into 200 acre portions with a foreman supervising each section. Houses and buildings were built at each area with phone lines connecting the entirety. The phone lines between the 23 cottages on the farm {{was one of the}} first two phone lines in the North West Territories. [...] In 1886 the Bell Farm owned 45 reapers, and binders, 78 ploughs, 6 mowers, 40 seeders, 80 sets of harrows and seven steam threshing outfits to plant and harvest 5000 acre of Red Fyfe wheat, oats and potatoes crop. The Bell Farm was a mixed farm enterprise, and the livestock of 1886 comprised 200 horses, 250 cattle and 900 hogs. [...] Wooden grainaries on <b>wheels,</b> grain <b>elevator</b> and flour mill also complemented the Bell Farm.|$|R
5000|$|Lee {{arrives at}} the {{exchange}} point, the Jules Verne Restaurant in the Eiffel Tower, with Carter disguised as Geneviève. Kenji challenges Lee to a sword fight, during which the two fall off the tower and into a safety net. Kenji's sword cuts the safety net open {{and the two men}} are left hanging on what remains of the net. Lee wishes to save his foster brother, but Kenji says goodbye and lets go, falling to his death as Lee tearfully watches. Meanwhile, Carter saves Soo-Young and defeats Jasmine, who is killed after getting stuck in one of the <b>elevator</b> <b>wheels.</b> After escaping the triads by using a French flag as a parachute, Carter and Lee are confronted by Reynard, holding Geneviéve hostage and threatening to kill her and frame them. However, George, who followed Lee and Carter, shoots Reynard from behind, killing him. The police arrive, with Commissioner Revi gloating and trying to get undeserved credit. After both give the commissioner a simultaneous punch to the face, knocking him out, Lee and Carter leave the scene while dancing to Edwin Starr song [...] "War".|$|R
40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the article by Jovanovic et al. on the initial validation of a new mechanical endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) training model [1]. Five trainees and five endoscopists, with and without ERCP experience, {{were involved in the}} evaluation of the model. The conclusion was that the model is a useful tool for ERCP training, particularly in improving the position of the scope, handling the <b>wheels</b> and the <b>elevator,</b> targeting the papilla, selectively cannulating the biliary and pancreatic ducts, extracting stones, and placing plastic and metal stents. ERCP is a complex procedure. Teaching the procedure is demanding, as it is difficult to explain the complexity of movements needed to maintain a correct and stable position in front of the papilla. In ERCP it is always a matter of keeping the right axis; if the axis is wrong, the chance of deep cannulation decreases dramatically. The basic issue is therefore how to teach movements to achieve a proper axis. A simple mechanical model to guide fellows on how to reach the correct position in front of the papilla, before they receive training on patients, was therefore imagined. The idea of this ERCP training model (the Boškoski-Costamagna ERCP Trainer; Cook Medical, Limerick, Ireland) arose at the end of 2010. The very first prototype was designed and then built using wires, parts from used accessories, plastic tubes, and sutures ([Fig.   1]). This prototype already had bile and pancreatic ducts, and could be assembled to present different grades of ERCP difficulty. A working team was then created, endorsed by the European Endoscopy Training Center in Rome, with the goal of implementing and further developing the prototype. ERCP training modules were organized, and feedback was collected in order to improve the model.

The ERCP simulator was immediately regarded as a useful tool by the trainees. Fellows learned how to move in front of the papilla in order to attain a proper axis and to achieve deep cannulation. Fellows became familiar with movements that are usually difficult to teach and to learn, without losing time in orientation in front of the papilla and without any risk. On the basis of these positive comments, the prototype was then further developed, produced, and distributed. The current version of the ERCP Trainer ([Fig.   2]) is light enough to be transported easily, may simulate different patient positions (prone, oblique, supine), and comes with several easily exchangeable modules featuring variations of the papillary anatomy and biliopancreatic junction. Zoom ImageZoom Image Fig.   2  The second-generation Boškoski-Costamagna ERCP Trainer, which is currently available. It was, indeed, with surprise that we read about this initial validation and the good results reported in the article by Jovanovic et al. These authors used the first generation of the Boškoski-Costamagna ERCP Trainer. The second generation of the ERCP Trainer is currently available, and a third, which will have more advanced features including fluoroscopy, is in development. Although our personal experience and that of Jovanovic et al. are encouraging, further trials are needed. For this purpose, a large multicenter study has been designed in order to identify the role of the training model and to prove the relevance of the ERCP Trainer in training programs...|$|R
