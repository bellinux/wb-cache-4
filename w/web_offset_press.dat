50|$|During World War II, {{the paper}} was reduced from a {{broadsheet}} to a tabloid and was published once {{a week on the}} campus press. In 1946, the paper returned to its former size and was published on the presses of the Manhattan Mercury-Chronicle. The frequency and size of the paper changed again in 1949, when a Cox-O Type press was installed in the basement of Kedzie Hall and the Collegian went from a semi-weekly broadsheet to a daily tabloid-sized publication.

50|$|In 1992 Student, {{which had}} been selling for 20 pence, was dropped by the student union {{as part of a}} {{cost-cutting}} exercise. A grant of £5,000 from the University Development Fund allowed it to continue as a student society for a few years. By 1997 the newspaper was under severe financial pressure, selling only around a thousand copies a week at 20 pence each, the advertising was largely ineffective. During {{the course of the year}} the newspaper stopped publishing to avoid going into debt and a relaunch was scheduled for the start of the Autumn term with a shift towards a free distribution model. This shift resulted in a wholesale change in how the newspaper was produced. For the first time the newspaper was printed on a <b>web</b> <b>offset</b> <b>press,</b> full colour printing was available and the newspaper was fully produced on computers not old fashioned light boxes. The initial circulation after the relaunch was around 5,000 copies distributed through cardboard stands around the various university campuses. To ease the transition the newspaper was published on a fortnightly basis for a year. After a successful advertising funded first year the newspaper returned to being published weekly and within two years the circulation crept up to over 12,000 copies a week aided by initiatives such as a second edition catering to the other universities within Edinburgh and a seven-day TV guide.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{movement}} of material which accumulates on the image printing blanket of a <b>web</b> <b>offset</b> <b>press</b> printing newsprint. A theory is advanced to explain this movement. It {{is based on the}} differences in velocities of the paper and blanket surfaces entering and exiting the printing nip. The designed experiment run uses three factors to test the changes in direction and rate of movement. These are: (1) the compressibility of blanket sets, (2) the relative image printing and impression blanket diameters, and (3) the printing squeeze. No other factors involved in the nip area are tested. The movement of material on the blanket surface is recorded using stroboscopic photography on 35 mm transparency film. The photographs record the positions of material on the blanket every 150 impressions. Analysis of the recorded movement is made by projection of the successive images. Results of statistical tests indicate that the relative diameters of the image printing and impression cylinders can influence the direction of movement. Movement is forward when the image printing blanket is less than the impression blanket and backwards when the image printing blanket is greater than the impression blanket. When printing with unequal diameters, the compressible blanket set produces less movement than the non-compressible set. These results support the theory advanced...|$|E
40|$|During a {{make ready}} in a <b>web</b> <b>offset</b> <b>press</b> it is {{important}} to produce as little waste as possible. Reducing the amount of waste yields savings of both time and money. One way to do faster make ready is to preset the ink keys of the press before it is started. This diploma work, carried out at Sörmlands Grafiska Quebecor AB in the city of Katrineholm, Sweden, examines how the ink key preset may be done using low- resolution digital images stored in the vendor independent data format CIP 3 PPF. The press that has been used has a control interface that is not accessible from the outside. This feature is shared with a lot of older presses. Therefore several methods of how to present and collect ink key settings using offline methods have been tested. To investigate the relationship between mean coverage over one ink zone and its corresponding ink key opening data from a 32 -page <b>web</b> <b>offset</b> <b>press</b> has been collected. The mean coverage was taken from the CIP 3 PPF files that were related to the collected print jobs. The relationship that was found between the coverage and the opening can be described with a transfer curve (one curve per printing unit and side). Using as few as three print jobs of high quality (density and dot gain within given tolerances) a first set of transfer curves may be created. These are close to the real ones and using print jobs where the ink key presettings have been calculated the transfer curves may be calibrated to perform better and better presetting calculations. To generate and calibrate the transfer curves and to extract the mean coverage values from the CIP 3 PPF files and recalculate these to presetting values a computer program called IKPS (Ink Key Presetting System) was made. IKPS was made using MATLAB from MathWorks INC. IKPS have been tested for ink key presetting during a number of print jobs. Even though the transfer curves were uncalibrated the system performed well. As comparison the results from a plate scanner was used. Even if online transfer of the presetting values is preferable the big advantage with the IKPS is that it is an offline system and therefore it is possible to implement it on any kind of offset press, old as well as new. In order to generate reliable transfer curves the print jobs used for calibration must be of high printing quality and representative for that particular press. How the ink key presettings are presented in the press control room depends on what kind of press it is. IKPS works with CIP 3 PPF files as well as low-resolution cmyk tiff files...|$|E
40|$|The {{printing}} {{industry has been}} experiencing steadily rising costs and declining profits, at times leading to the closing down, consolidation, or restructuring of printing companies. Lean Manufacturing is an effective tool that has helped printing companies to overcome these rising costs by reducing the cost of production and by improving productivity (Cooper, 2007). This research identified methods to reduce setup times, leading to savings of close to $ 60, 000 annually on one press. The average setup time was reduced by 60 %, from over two hours to less than one hour. The changes implemented on one press could be standardized on the other two presses in the offset department to provide annual savings of over $ 200, 000. The researcher worked with a packaging company {{for a period of}} six months, during which time he worked on improving the changeover time on one of the Stevens web offset presses. The method of study employed was called Action Research, which involved direct interaction with employees of the organization. The researcher used Process Cycle Efficiency (PCE) as a parameter of success, which is measure of the value added time. Small size companies often hesitate to invest in Lean consultants to help reduce costs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the existing maintenance models of <b>web</b> <b>offset</b> <b>presses,</b> and to propose the method which increases the reliability of the printing press exploitation, but does not require big investments. Doctor motors allowed constant monitoring by measuring instruments, which allowed insight in current status of motors at any time, so they could be repaired or replaced before malfunction. The effective vibration speed (vRMS) was measured a few times during the year 2006. Standard ISO 2372 - 1974 (E) defines values and boundaries of the effective vibration speed (vRMS). Results of measuring effective vibration speed indicated the emersion of nuisance energy with deterioration. To determine the state of bearings, and check if they cause the increase of effective vibration speed, an envelope analysis- FFT of the acceleration specter is conducted. This decreases the probability of motor malfunction and greatly increases the reliability of the whole system...|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposed}} {{to determine the}} most appropriate place to measure variability in dot gain and solid ink density on a form using color control bars. The study developed a form that entailed three GATF/SWOP, 133 line color control bars placed strategically at the lead, middle and trail edges of the sheet. The test set specific density standards to control to, and while these densities were being controlled, samples were obtained that represented a typical press run. Each of the control bar set-ups {{was treated as a}} separate press run, allowing the press operator to change the set densities to the next control bar once the samples were pulled. Five samples were averaged to obtain one sample for that particular sample set. That sample represented one of thirty for one entire press run. Every sample 2 ̆ 7 s average density and dot gain was determined, as well as its accuracy, precision, and range. A one-way analysis of variance was used to determine difference between control bar data. Through the statistical tools listed above, the variability in each position of the control bars was determined. The results revealed that both the density and dot gain positions at the trail edge for cyan, black, magenta, and yellow were the most consistent, most precise, most accurate, as well as containing the smallest range of data. In conclusion, based on this study, the trail edge may be the most appropriate position on a form to consistently control a <b>web</b> <b>offset</b> <b>press.</b> The data that were obtained when the middle was being controlled also showed this to be a good location for the control of the press...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a screening experiment {{designed to determine}} which of seven paper characteristics influence dot gain in <b>web</b> <b>offset</b> lithography. Dot gain is the enlargement of halftone dots during printing from plate to paper with a resultant increase in dot area. The variability of dot gain during a press run and from run to run is detrimental {{to the quality of}} black and white and color reproductions. The seven paper characteristics: gloss, smoothness, absorption, physical density, caliper, opacity, and formation are measurable characteristics used to describe the printability of a paper. Using one unit of a four-unit <b>web</b> <b>offset</b> perfecting <b>press,</b> four papers were printed and dot gain 2 ̆ 7 s two components, slur and fill-in, calculated. Correlation, regression analysis and graphic illustration were used to analyse data. The thesis concludes that smoothness is the main contributor to slur and absorption has the greatest influence on fill-in. Other paper characteristics shown to influence slur and fill-in are caliper and physical density. Also included are discussions of future experiments required to test the relationship between paper and dot gain and why certain paper properties may influence slur and fill-in...|$|R

The page makeup was still hot metal as before. But each page was now pulled on a hand operated proof press. The photo areas were masked out with black paper and this was photographed on a large Litho camera to produce a tabloid size page negative for each page. The photos were processed separately and pasted into the [...] "windows" [...] produced by the black rectangles on the proof pages. These page negatives were then burned in pairs onto hand sensitized aluminum plates with an arc exposure unit and hand developed and mounted on the <b>offset</b> <b>press</b> units.
