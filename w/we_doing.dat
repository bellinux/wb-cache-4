500|$|A finger injury {{suffered}} {{during the}} 1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs hampered Oates throughout 1994–95 and required {{surgery at the}} season's conclusion. Despite the injury, Oates finished fourth in the NHL with 41 assists in a season disrupted by a work stoppage. The Bruins signed him to a five-year, $10 million contract extension late in that season, but Oates once again became frustrated with his salary relative {{to the rest of}} the league by 1997. [...] With the Bruins struggling on the ice and out of playoff contention late in 1996–97 season, Oates publicly berated team management: [...] "You go on a [...] trip and everyone says it's a big trip. For what? So we can win five games because we're lousy and we get in the eighth spot and lose four straight and get embarrassed and then get shelled all summer? It's upstairs, baby.

500|$|During a {{court hearing}} for the murder, Parsons said, [...] "Why are <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> this? I did it and {{everyone}} knows I did it." [...] He pleaded guilty to motor vehicle theft, aggravated robbery and first-degree murder on September 18, 1987. Parsons' sentence was decided by a jury. Parsons {{said that he was}} defending himself with a four-inch knife when Ernest grabbed his leg and thought that Ernest's multiple wounds were [...] "superficial." [...] Parsons was unable to present evidence to corroborate his claim of a sexual advance by Ernest. Ernest's family and friends stated in court that Ernest was not gay or bisexual. Prosecution witnesses testified of Parsons' homosexual activity in jail. According to forensic psychiatrist David Tomb from the University of Utah, the descriptions of Parsons' sexual history indicated that he [...] "may have been the one initiating the contact and became angry when [...] turned him down." [...] A medical examiner testified that Ernest appeared to have been stabbed while sleeping and was unable to defend himself. On February 18, 1988, a jury of six men and six women sentenced Parsons to death. He was sent to Utah State Prison.|$|E

500|$|The Boys from Baghdad High was well-received {{from its}} initial screening. It was {{nominated}} for a Youth Jury Award at the 2007 Sheffield Doc/Fest, shortlisted for an Amnesty International 2008 UK Media Award in the category for Television Documentary and Docudramas, and the European Independent Film Festival named it the Best News and Current Affairs film. It {{was nominated for}} the Readers' Award in the Radio Times, and in May 2008 it won the Premiere Prize at the Sandford St. Martin Trust Awards, which acknowledges excellence in religious broadcasting. The Trust's chairman and former BBC Head of Religious Broadcasting Colin Morris said of the documentary, [...] "We saw the way faith breaks into secular life in the chaos of present-day Iraq. Coming from different ethnic and religious backgrounds the boys showed that despite the war their daily preoccupations were much the same as those of teenage boys the world over – girlfriends, parents, sport, fashion, exams, music. Would their friendship survive? Ultimately the programme confronted British viewers with the question: 'What in God's name are <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> there? The film received a standing ovation from the audience at the Traverse City Film Festival, and at the Tribeca Film Festival it was short-listed for the 2008 World Documentary Feature Competition, competing against eleven other non-fiction films for Best Documentary Film and Best New Documentary Filmmaker.|$|E

2500|$|The film's ending also changed, {{the final}} version being written halfway through filming. The {{original}} intended to depict Johnny Depp in Riggan's dressing room with a Pirates of the Caribbean poster in the back. Iñárritu grew to strongly dislike this ending, calling it [...] "so embarrassing", and rewrote it with Dinelaris and Giacobone after a new ending came {{to him in a}} dream. Iñárritu was reluctant to describe the original ending but it was leaked by Dinelaris. He said the original ending was set in the theatre instead of the hospital, and involved Depp putting on Riggan Thomson's wig, and in Jack Sparrow's voice [...] "...the poster asks Depp, 'What the fuck are <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> here, mate?' and {{it was going to be}} the satire of the endless loop of that." [...] The director and co-authors ruled out the satirical ending, and favored the new, more ambiguous, ending.|$|E

Dante claims that Randal does nothing for him but make his life miserable by getting him fined, {{offending}} his customers, and ruining his relationship. Randal loses his temper and verbally explodes, saying that Dante deserves the blame, as Dante, closed the store to play hockey, closed it again to go to the wake, and closed it yet again to try to hook up with his ex-girlfriend, cheating on his current one in the process. He then says that Dante came to work of his own free will and [...] "overcompensates for having a monkey's job". He claims Dante thinks he is more advanced than the customers and storms off with [...] "if we're so fucking advanced, what are <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> working here?" [...] leaving Dante speechless on the floor.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} {{difference from the}} original play concerned the character of Young Lucius, who {{is a much more}} important figure in the adaptation; he is present throughout Act 1, and retrieves the murder weapon after the death of Mutius; it is his knife which Titus uses to kill the fly; he aids in the capture of Chiron and Demetrius; he is present throughout the final scene. Much as Julie Taymor would do in her 1999 filmic adaptation, Howell set Young Lucius as the centre of the production to prompt the question [...] "What are <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> to the children?" [...] At the end of the play, as Lucius delivers his final speech, the camera stays on Young Lucius rather than his father, who is in the far background and out of focus, as he stares in horror at the coffin of Aaron's child (which has been killed off-screen). Thus the production became [...] "in part about a boy's reaction to murder and mutilation. We see him losing his innocence and being drawn into this adventure of revenge; yet, at the end we perceive that he retains the capacity for compassion and sympathy." ...|$|E

Thomas Tull said, 'I {{would love to see}} Hellboy 3.' He didn't say he would love to do it he just said he'd like to see it, but today, I'll ask him." [...] Ron Perlman added his support for the idea, stating: [...] "Not just anybody can make this movie. I loved working for Legendary and I know for Guillermo working on Pacific Rim was one of his greatest experiences. The reason I loved working for them is because Guillermo was so happy. I came in six months into the shoot and he seemed as fresh as a daisy, simply because he was working for someone who appreciated and supported his outlandish visions of what he wanted to put on the screen. My immediate, silent wish was, wouldn't it be great if these guys came in and helped resolve the Hellboy series." ...|$|E

[...] She further criticized him on April 26, demanding Obama [...] "step up and justify our Libyan involvement, or Americans are going to demand you pull out." [...] She continued, [...] "Simply put, what are <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> there? You’ve put us in a strategic no man’s land. If Gaddafi’s got to go, then tell NATO our continued participation hinges on this: We strike hard and Gaddafi will be gone. If, as you and your spokesmen suggest, we’re not to tell Libya what to do when it comes to that country’s leadership, and if you can’t explain to Americans why we’re willing to protect Libyan resources and civilians but not Syria’s, Yemen’s, Bahrain’s, Egypt’s, Israel’s, etc., then there is no justification for U.S. human and fiscal resources to be spent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{cast and}} crew members warned the {{audience}} of the graphic content of the episode. Prior to the episode's release, certain scenes {{were reported to have}} been cut from the official broadcast, having been deemed too disturbing. The scenes remaining in the episode have been met with comparable observations by the show's actors. Steven Yeun, who portrays Glenn Rhee, said: I remember a couple of scenes I would look over at {{what was going on in}} the scene and I would be like, ‘What the eff? What are <b>we</b> <b>doing?</b> How is this legal? It's grounded and real, too; it's not like torture or gore for no reason. It's literally, that is what would happen and we are trying to show it. It would not work on network television, let me tell you that. Lauren Cohan, who portrays Maggie Greene, made similar comments regarding the episode, saying some of the scenes were [...] "so disturbing", she did not think they would make it on TV. The series' composer, Bear McCreary, tweeted to parents of young children: [...] "Do not let children watch The Walking Dead tonight. Or ever again. I'm very serious", as he is aware of the show's younger fans. Despite his warning, McCreary said that [...] "No Sanctuary" [...] was his [...] "favorite episode in years, and, , the scariest score I've ever done." [...] Series creator and executive producer Robert Kirkman stated that the episode's opening presented to the audience the threat that the characters face, although he said, [...] " [...] actually adds a tremendous amount of value to the story, and so that’s what justifies these great lengths that we go to to, you know, disgust the audience." [...] Gimple said that there was concern of the graphic nature of the episode, but both he and the network eventually felt it was necessary for the episode's plot, and that it contained meaning within the story.
