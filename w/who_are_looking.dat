25|$|The larval saliva of B. petiolata {{contains}} many amino acids and nutrients that {{are useful for}} adult wasps. Females <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> to lay eggs solicit larvae {{in order to receive}} some salivary fluid so they can gain some nutrients before laying the eggs. To do this, females undergo trophallaxis with the larvae. The larvae are first fed masticated food by the females wasps and then in return, the larvae produce salivary fluid. Usually, the wasps prompt the larvae to produce this salivary secretion by antennating a larva's head and vibrating its body. The larva then extends its head and produces a drop of clear saliva. Adults wasps prefer to solicit older larvae for trophallaxis, likely because they expect to receive more saliva from older larvae than from younger larvae. Sometimes, body vibrations of soliciting adults become synchronized and this seems to excite the larva in a positive way.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{indigenous}} people live within the rainforest as hunter-gatherers, or subsist as part-time small scale farmers supplemented {{in large part by}} trading high-value forest products such as hides, feathers, and honey with agricultural people living outside the forest. Peoples have inhabited the rainforests {{for tens of thousands of}} years and have remained so elusive that only recently have some tribes been discovered. These indigenous peoples are greatly threatened by loggers in search for old-growth tropical hardwoods like Ipe, Cumaru and Wenge, and by farmers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> to expand their land, for cattle(meat), and soybeans, which are used to feed cattle in Europe and China. On 18 January 2007, FUNAI reported also that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005.
