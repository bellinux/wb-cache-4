40|$|AbstractA jet grout block {{created by}} {{overlapping}} columns aimed {{to convert the}} saturated silty sand soils into a safe space for breaking down four underground parking uplift piles along the tunnel alignment. Since the grouting platform was located on the mat foundation {{in the basement of}} underground parking and was under the groundwater table, a series of dewatering wells were installed before the 177 columns were constructed to prevent intrusion of the groundwater flowing upward from sandy soil to basement through grouting hole during <b>wash</b> boring <b>and</b> <b>grouting</b> stages from happening. Several quality control measures were undertaken prior to quality assurance testing. Two measurements of spoil return and spoil flow rate for each column were implemented. From a back analysis from the mean values of spoil density and spoil flow rate, the column diameter was estimated at around 1. 56 m, slightly smaller than the design diameter by 2. 5 %. In addition, a control chart with upper and lower control limits, established from a large dataset of flow rate of spoil return, was a means to recognize the likelihood of sand boiling and to serve as an early warning indicator of abnormal conditions for the jet grouting works below the groundwater table. As the mean spoil density of the infill column was larger than perimeter column, an optimal grouting sequence for clusters was suggested in this paper. The jet grout block exposed during the breakdown process of the piles showed safe working conditions as required and a shield machine then passed through as planned...|$|R

40|$|Soil-nails {{are used}} to {{stabilise}} a soil mass by exploiting the resistance generated by the skin friction between the ground <b>and</b> <b>grout</b> <b>and</b> the tensile stiffness of the reinforcing material. A load–displacement curve is obtained from in situ pullout load tests performed by considering the elastic shear modulus and ultimate skin friction capacity between the soil <b>and</b> <b>grout.</b> This study determines the shear behaviour between the soils <b>and</b> <b>grout</b> analytically, especially the soil-dilation effect during shearing {{that is one of}} the main factors affecting the ultimate skin friction, even though this estimation is rather cumbersome. Many studies assume a full bond between the <b>grout</b> <b>and</b> the steel reinforcing bar, thus neglecting their relative displacement. In this study, the net load–displacement between the ground <b>and</b> <b>grout</b> is obtained by subtracting the nail elongation from the load–displacement of the pullout tests when estimating the shear displacement. Numerous field pullout tests are performed in this study under various ground conditions and through various construction methods.

Our research examines the following: (1) material characterization, (2) analytical modeling of transmission and propagation losses inside lossy media, (3) maximum operational range of RFID wireless sensors embedded inside concrete <b>and</b> <b>grout,</b> <b>and</b> (4) best positioning of antennas for achieving longer communication range between RFID antennas and wireless sensors. Our research uses the battery-less Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform (WISP) which can be used to monitor temperature, and humidity inside complex materials. By using a commercial Agilent open-ended coaxial probe (HP 8570 B), the measurements of the dielectric permittivity of concrete <b>and</b> <b>grout</b> are performed. Subsequently, the measured complex permittivity is used to formulate analytical Debye models. Also, the transmission and propagation losses of a uniform plane wave inside grout are calculated. Our results show that wireless sensors will perform better in concrete than grout. In addition, the maximum axial and radial ranges for WISP are experimentally determined. Our work illustrates the feasibility of battery-less wireless sensors that are embedded inside concrete <b>and</b> <b>grout.</b> Also, our work provides information {{that can be used to}} optimize the power management, sampling rate, and antenna design of such sensors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this study, an {{experiment}} program {{is presented to}} study the bonding mechanism between corroded bolts <b>and</b> <b>grout</b> <b>and</b> in particular the influence on bonding behavior in terms of different corrosion sections along anchor. With respect to four groups of manufactured bolt specimens, the noncorroded and the corroded, respectively, on the front, middle and rear section along anchor, a pullout test is conducted to reveal the relationship between load and loading-end slip and to investigate the bond-stress distribution characterization along full anchor. Experimental results show that corrosion product, acting as lubricating effect at the interface between bolts <b>and</b> <b>grout,</b> can result in the degradation of bonding mechanical behavior. Meanwhile, corrosion on different sections along anchor has a different effect on the anchorage capacity of bolts. Especially, corrosion on the front section induces the greatest decrease of anchorage capacity of bolts. Thus, it is concluded that the front section along anchor is the key region affecting the bonding mechanical behavior between bolts <b>and</b> <b>grout...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{load-carrying}} {{capacity of a}} conventional micropile {{is determined by the}} adhesion between the rolled screw thread <b>and</b> the <b>grout,</b> <b>and</b> the skin friction force between the <b>grout</b> <b>and</b> the ground. One of the disadvantage of the conventional micropiles is that the boring depth can be deeper because of low {{load-carrying capacity}} and the brittle failure behavior between rolled screw thread <b>and</b> <b>grout.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to develop an advanced feature of a micropile system which efficiently increases load-carrying capacity with a reasonable cost. This study proposes an advanced type of a micropile system. The proposed micropile system consists of perfobond ribs installed steel rod to improve shear capacity between the thread <b>and</b> the <b>grout,</b> <b>and</b> partially expanded drill holes to increase resis-tance capacity between the <b>grout</b> <b>and</b> the ground. Through on-site pullout tests, it was found that load-carrying capacity increased sig-nificantly in the proposed micropile system, due to the shear keys created by the partially expanded drill hole.
