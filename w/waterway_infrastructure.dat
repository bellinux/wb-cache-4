50|$|Today, {{federal law}} {{provides}} for the waterway to be maintained at a minimum depth of 12 ft {{for most of its}} length, but inadequate funding has prevented that. Consequently, for larger ships, shoaling or shallow waters are encountered along several sections of the waterway, with these having 7 ft or 9 ft minimum depths from earlier improvements. While no tolls are charged for waterway usage, commercial users have been charged a fuel tax since 1978, which is used to maintain and improve facilities. That year, the Inland Waterways Revenue Act imposed a barge fuel tax; originally set at 4 cents per gallon in 1980, it was gradually raised to 10 cents per gallon by 1986. To hold these funds, the act also created the Inland Waterways Trust Fund under the US Treasury, which are used to cover half the cost of new construction and major rehabilitation of the inland <b>waterways</b> <b>infrastructure</b> (33 U.S.C. ch.32). The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 was a wide-ranging bill regarding all water resources utilization nationally.

A new simplified analytical method is proposed, based on the so-called super-element method.

40|$|Colombia is {{experiencing}} a historic and decisive moment {{in the development of}} the inland waterway shipping as an alternative system of transportation. The development of the main waterway in Colombia, The Magdalena River, has increased the interest of private and governmental participants. While the issues of navigability, <b>waterways</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and inland <b>waterways</b> ports (IWP) have been addressed extensively in recent plans, studies and projects, few studies deal with issues related to Inland Waterways Transport (IWT) governance structure and policy framework. In order to fill this gap, this research project explored and compared different aspects of the Colombian and the Dutch IWT model. The emphasis was on issues related to IWT policies, role of institutions {{in the development of the}} IWT and the IWT promotion plans and strategies. The research based its findings on interviews with Colombian IWT executives and experts. Weaknesses, limitations and opportunities of the Colombian inland waterway transportation system (IWS) were found. Further, applicable aspects of the Dutch IWT model to the Colombia IWS were identified. The results indicated a lack of three essential factors in the Colombian IWS model: 1) well-structured policies and regulations, 2) coordination between governmental entities at national, regional and local level and 3) innovation and support of IWT promotion policies. Thus, the conclusion reflected the importance of adopting some aspects of the Dutch IWT model in order to improve and develop an efficient IWS in Colombia. The research contributes to a better understating of the importance of a well-structured policies framework, the role played by governance and institutions in the developing of the IWS and the necessity of IWT promotion policies for both users and inland waterway shipping companies...|$|R

To support a wide range of applicability, the paper deals with the evolution of the vessel wedge compared to an analytical solution for sub-to supercritical speeds and the assessment of wave patterns from a broad range of pressure term dimensions, including cross-references to findings in other studies. The conducted numerical experiments showcase the typical response of a Boussinesq-type model to a simplified moving pressure disturbance and identify the main factors and criteria for ship-wave propagation in the far-field of a vessel.

There is a common belief that raising economic performance levels across these countries will deliver welfare gains and promote cooperation across borders.

This dissertation aims to create decision support tools for maritime stakeholders to measure the economic impacts of the {{inland waterway}} transportation systems under real world scenarios including disruptions, demand changes, port expansion decisions, and channel deepening investments. Monte Carlo simulation, system dynamics, discrete-event simulation, agent-based modeling, and multiregional input-output modeling techniques are utilized to analyze the complex relationships between inland waterway transportation system components and regional economic impact factors. The first research contribution illustrates that the expected duration of a disruption determines whether decision makers are better off waiting for the waterway system to reopen or switching to an alternative mode of transportation. Moreover, total disruption cost can be reduced by increasing estimation accuracy of disruption duration. The second research contribution shows that without future investment in inland <b>waterway</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> a sustainable system and associate economic impacts cannot be generated in the long-term. The third research contribution illustrates that investing in bottleneck system components results in higher economic impact than investing in non-bottleneck components.

40|$|International audienceThe structures, {{especially}} bridges, are strategic {{elements of}} a network of road, railway or inland <b>waterway</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> They are constantly exposed to aggressive environments, to the aging of their equipments and their constituent materials, to the degradation of their structural elements and to changes in operating conditions. These latter are characterized by an increase of the traffic, by heavier loads and by more abnormal loads. These factors amplify the effect of potential errors in design or construction, or the consequences of accidental damages such as vehicle impacts. The preservation of a long lasting patrimony of structures requires a management policy that includes not only actions of maintenance, repair, strengthening and rehabilitation, but also actions for limiting and even stopping the operation of structures, for installing a safety monitoring, or for immediate safeguarding. These actions are only relevant when appropriate procedures and methods exist to assess the residual load carrying capacity, the serviceability and durability of the structure. Structural Health Monitoring is one of the important tools available to the manager of a patrimony in order to evaluate the structural performance of the bridges, or alternatively to have an objective and relevant vision of their condition. Referring to the S 3 project initiated by Ifsttar in 2007, Structural Health Monitoring can be divided into three themes: the monitoring by itself or operational monitoring which includes instrumentation, measurement and management of information; the diagnosis which consists of processing data collected during the monitoring phase (performance indicators, discrimination tests, alert thresholds, [...] .); the structural identification whose objective is to provide predictive information on the structure behavior (resistance, life duration, [...] .) which is integrated into the management system. Although the structural health monitoring is not yet common practice, it is already applied for exceptional structures (Normandy Bridge, Millau Viaduct) or for strategic structures (dams, nuclear power plants [...] .) and it is developing for large structures. Weak maintenance budgets, often minimized to excess [...] ., do not facilitate the deployment of this approach, but a significant growth in the market for structural health monitoring has still been felt in recent years. However, recent advances in SHM concepts and technologies pave the ground to large-scale deployments by just providing increasingly affordable monitoring capabilities and services. Actually, multiscale monitoring, low(er) cost fiber optics, nanosensing construction materials or nanoelectronics as well as embedded computing for damage detection and SHM at large will change the perspective to effective deployment. Moreover, new markets for SHM technologies with higher pay-off expectations and more convincing RoI are emerging as potential key-drivers. From the theoretical point of view, potential large-scale deployments also raise new questions and opportunities at the frontier of state, data, and parameters.
