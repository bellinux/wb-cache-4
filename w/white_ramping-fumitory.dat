5000|$|The {{islands of}} Great Ganinick and Little Ganinick (Kenninek, place of wild garlic) (...) , {{are part of}} the GCR and are in an early stage of the linkage of two islands by a tombola. The sand bar is {{building}} from Little Ganinick, northwards, towards the larger island although the sand supply {{does not appear to be}} sufficient to link the two islands. On the north side of Great Ganinick a [...] "cuspate" [...] shaped beach is forming. Great Gannick has the only known oak tree in the Eastern Islands. Described by Mr and Mrs Dallas in 1938 as â€³.... about 2 ft 6in (0.76 m) tall in tangle of bracken, bramble and honeysuckle. It was still there (or possibly one like it) in 1997. Great Gannick is rich in plant species with 74 species recorded by Lousley including butcher's-broom, wood spurge, wood small-reed and <b>white</b> <b>ramping-fumitory.</b> Little Ganiinck has grassland with strandline vegetation and seabird colonies.|$|E
