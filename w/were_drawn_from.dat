5|$|By {{the time}} the {{division}} had completed its training, it was still about one third below its designated strength in both officers and NCOs, and its officer corps remained almost entirely German.

5|$|The British regulars, around 700 {{infantry}}, <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> 11 of Gage's 13 occupying infantry regiments.

5|$|About 1400 police {{personnel}} <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> various {{districts of}} Andhra Pradesh {{to provide the}} first layer of security. In addition to this, over 5000 city policemen were deployed in various places, including the event venues and all the major hotels of the city. Strict anti-sabotage measures were taken to provide security at the athlete hotels. Also, a 24-hour access control system was placed, with sniffer dogs used to sanitise the area.|$|E

5|$|Fumito Kondō {{considered}} the print revolutionary; such expressive, individualized faces are {{not seen in}} the stereotyped figures {{in the works of}} Utamaro's predecessors such as Harunobu and Kiyonaga, {{and it was the first}} time in ukiyo-e history that the beauties <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the general urban population rather than the pleasure quarters.|$|E
5|$|The first special {{police unit}} {{established}} in the 1990s was the Lučko Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU). Its ranks were largely filled through the selection of police officers trained in Zagreb in 1990. A small number of other personnel <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> a special forces unit of the Croatian Ministry of the Interior that existed before the 1990s. Marko Lukić was the first commanding officer of the Lučko ATU.|$|E

5|$|The man {{selected}} {{to lead the}} Commando force was Lieutenant Colonel Charles Newman; his No. 2 Commando would provide the largest Commandos contingent, 173 men, for the raid. The Special Service Brigade headquarters used the raid to provide experience for their other units and 92 men <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 12 Commandos.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E

5|$|Cross-fertilization between {{board games}} {{and video games}} continued. For example, some aspects of Master of Orion III <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> {{the first edition of}} the board game Twilight Imperium. Even Sins of a Solar Empire was {{inspired}} by the idea of adapting the board game Buck Rogers Battle for the 25th Century into a real-time video game. Going in the opposite direction, Eagle Games made a board game adaptation of Sid Meier's Civilization in 2002, completely different from the board game that had inspired the computer game in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Discovered {{at anchor}} off Pointe-Noire on 22 January by the British brig HMS Hazard, Topaze was {{isolated}} and attacked by two British frigates, led by Captain Samuel Pechell in HMS Cleopatra. In the ensuing engagement, the British ships outnumbered and overwhelmed their opponent, capturing {{the ship and}} her cargo, despite heavy fire from a French gun battery that overlooked the anchorage. The British ships <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> a force gathered for the impending invasion of Martinique, which was launched six days after Topaze had been captured and successfully completed in a campaign lasting just over three weeks.|$|E
5|$|First Nations peoples have lived, hunted, and {{traveled}} across {{the area for}} at least 10,000 years, as shown by archaeological evidence on Walpole Island. These peoples <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> an amalgamation of Ojibwa, Odawa, and Potowatami clans, which formed the Three Fires Confederacy, also called the Council of Three Fires, in A.D. 796. These clans came together through common links in both language and culture, developing a self-sufficient society where tasks and responsibilities were equally shared among all members.|$|E

5|$|Formed on 13 November 1939 at Redbank Camp, Brisbane, the 2/9th Battalion was {{the first}} of four {{infantry}} battalions raised in Queensland for the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). Initially assigned to the 6th Division, the battalion formed part of the 18th Brigade, along with the 2/10th, 2/11th and 2/12th Battalions. Its first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel James Eric Gifford Martin, formerly of the 42nd Battalion, a Militia battalion based in Rockhampton. The majority of the battalion's officers <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the Militia; although, like many of the 2nd AIF units, it was initially supplied with a Regular officer to serve in the role as adjutant.|$|E
5|$|Henry was {{particularly}} {{supportive of the}} mendicant orders; his confessors <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the Dominican Friars, and he built mendicant houses in Canterbury, Norwich, Oxford, Reading and York, helping to find valuable space for new buildings in what were already crowded towns and cities. He supported the military crusading orders, and became a patron of the Teutonic Order in 1235. The emerging universities of Oxford and Cambridge also received royal attention: Henry reinforced and regulated their powers, and encouraged scholars to migrate from Paris to teach at them. A rival institution at Northampton was declared by the King to be a mere school and not a true university.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the United States {{established}} military {{ties with}} Liberia by sending some five black American officers to help reorganize the force. The LFF {{in its early}} years was frequently recruited by inducing men from the interior forcibly. When dispatched to the interior to quell tribal unrest, units often lived off the areas that they were pacifying, as a form of communal punishment. The Force's officers <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> either the coastal aristocracy or tribal elites.|$|E
