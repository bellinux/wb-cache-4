5000|$|In December 1878, Hillmon and Brown set {{out west}} for their journey. They {{traveled}} {{as far as}} the southwest Kansas town of Medicine Lodge before cold weather eventually drove them back to Wichita together, and then Hillmon back to Lawrence, Kansas. In late February 1879, Hillmon set off again, meeting up with Brown in Wichita and traveling to Crooked Creek on the night of March 16, 1879. The next evening, John Brown reported to a neighbor named Philip Briley that Hillmon had been shot dead at their campsite. The neighbor called the nearest coroner, George Paddock, who inspected the scene of the death and convened an inquest. On March 18, 1879, John Brown testified that he had accidentally shot and killed Hillmon when the rifle he was unloading from their <b>wagon</b> <b>discharged,</b> shooting Hillmon in the head. The corpse was dressed in John Hillmon’s clothes and boots. [...] At the inquest, witnesses from Medicine Lodge {{who had been in the}} company of Brown and Hillmon testified that the corpse was the man they had known as Hillmon. Most of them remembered Hillmon because he had passed through their town on the earlier trip. On April 10, 1879, the Medicine Lodge inquest returned a verdict of death by misadventure, or accidental death.|$|R
50|$|In 1891, George Talbot {{developed}} {{a new type of}} wagon - the self <b>discharging</b> <b>wagon,</b> which became a major source of sales. A modern plant along North American lines was added in Jülicher Straße in the 1890s, with modern equipment including air hammers, rivetting machines, and electric power for machines. By 1900, the plant employed up to 400 workers.|$|R
50|$|The VHMY {{class was}} built to replace the then-ageing NN and QN-type ballast wagons. The new <b>wagons</b> were {{pneumatically}} <b>discharged</b> {{in lieu of the}} older system where the ballast doors were controlled by handbrake-style wheels mounted {{on the side of the}} wagons; this older method required track staff to walk alongside the train and control the ballast discharge procedure while in motion.|$|R
50|$|Vans 2, 3 and 12 also stand out; van 2 {{became a}} BB, then a crane crawler wagon QD, then a sleeper <b>discharge</b> <b>wagon</b> VZCA. Van 3 {{had a similar}} life, {{although}} it spent some time as a BA wagon between the BB and QD stages. Finally, van 12 became a BB, BA, then HD wagon despite that code normally being reserved for four-wheeled wagons, and finally it became VZAA, a fire attack wagon.|$|R
50|$|Saddle-bottomed wagons are large-volume hoppers are {{exclusively}} unloaded {{by gravity}} {{and are therefore}} classed as self-discharging hoppers. Unlike normal hopper <b>wagons,</b> however, their <b>discharge</b> cannot be controlled and the entire load must be dropped. To unload the flaps on the side swing out allowing the load to empty. This is aided by the floor which slopes downwards on both sides like a gable roof. The discharging chutes on either side are relatively high up. These wagons are frequently seen in unit trains for transporting bulk goods such as coal or mineral ore from mines or ports to steelworks or power stations.|$|R
60|$|Well, it is {{eighteen}} {{months or so}} ago since first I met Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good. It was in this way. I had been up elephant hunting beyond Bamangwato, and had met with bad luck. Everything went wrong that trip, and to top up with I got the fever badly. So soon as I was well enough I trekked down to the Diamond Fields, sold such ivory as I had, together with my <b>wagon</b> and oxen, <b>discharged</b> my hunters, and took the post-cart to the Cape. After spending a week in Cape Town, finding that they overcharged me at the hotel, and having seen everything there was to see, including the botanical gardens, which seem to me likely to confer a great benefit on the country, and the new Houses of Parliament, which I expect will do nothing of the sort, I determined {{to go back to}} Natal by the Dunkeld, then lying at the docks waiting for the Edinburgh Castle due in from England. I took my berth and went aboard, and that afternoon the Natal passengers from the Edinburgh Castle transhipped, and we weighed and put to sea.|$|R
