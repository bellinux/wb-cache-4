He was baptised at St David's Church, Brownlow Hill, Liverpool on 19 July 1832. His four uncles, {{grandfather}} and great grandfather <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medical profession.

25|$|The {{most common}} source of phosphoric acid is an 85% aqueous solution; such {{solutions}} are colourless, odourless, and non-volatile. The 85% solution is a syrupy liquid, but still pourable. Although phosphoric acid {{does not meet}} the strict definition of a strong acid, the 85% solution is acidic enough to be corrosive. Because of the high percentage of phosphoric acid in this reagent, {{at least some of the}} orthophosphoric acid is condensed into polyphosphoric acids; for the sake of labeling and simplicity, the 85% represents H3PO4 as if it <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ortho form. Dilute aqueous solutions of phosphoric acid exist in the ortho form.|$|E
25|$|This {{resulted}} in being turned back again, {{putting him in}} the class of 1851. The year 1850 brought Smith close to failing again, just short of being deficient in Chemistry and accumulating 177 demerits; but in the end he managed to pass the year and became a Firstie, or first class cadet. In his last year he accumulated the allowed 200 demerits, what made him the second worst cadet currently at the academy, and once again short of failing. But he didn't; his grades <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last quarter of his class, except engineering, and he graduated as 36th out of 42 graduates on July 1, 1851.|$|E

Charest led the party back to official party status in the 1997 election, winning 20 seats. With the exception of one seat each in Ontario and Manitoba, the rest of the seats <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Maritimes and Quebec.

Also, the region as a whole has witnessed some of the highest population growth in the United States, and according to the US Census Bureau, in 2008–2009, Utah was the fastest growing state in America. As of the 2010 Census, Nevada was the fastest growing state in the United States, with an increase of 35.1% in the last ten years.

Thousands of local people stood outside the cathedral and lined {{the route of the}} funeral procession to Gillingham Cemetery. Royal Marines guarded the coffins and acted as pall bearers and the ceremony was attended by, among others, the Second Sea Lord, the Commandant-General Royal Marines, and the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary of the Admiralty. Three of the boys who were Roman Catholics had a separate funeral at the Church of Our Lady, Gillingham, conducted by the Bishop of Southwark Cyril Cowderoy.|$|E

25|$|Late in his life, Emperor Menelik {{was confronted}} {{with the problem of}} his succession; if he did not {{explicitly}} name an heir before he died, the nation he had built would likely dissolve into civil war and be devoured by European colonial powers. He had four possible heirs. According to the traditional rules of succession, the next direct patrilineal descendant was the grandson of Menelik's uncle, Dejazmach Taye Gulilat. His other three heirs <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> female line. The first of these was his oldest grandson, Dejazmach Wosan Seged, son of his daughter Shoaregga Menelik by her first marriage to Wedadjo Gobena. The second heir of the female line was his younger grandson Lij Iyasu. Finally, the third heir of the female line was Menelik's elder daughter Woizero Zewditu, who was married to Ras Gugsa Welle, nephew of the Empress Taitu.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} he was rewarded further, first with a castle on the Tagus. The {{original}} document recording this grant, issued at Soria on 18 November 1153, has survived, and is one of possibly ten charters of Alfonso VII to have been authenticated with a seal. At the same time, Ponce was rewarded with further governorships: Cea by 1152, Castrotierra by 1153, and Gatón de Campos by 1155. His territorial lordships, however, were generally scattered, although they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> province of León and relatively near to the city itself, whose government he continued to hold throughout the period. The lordship of Cea was shared with Ermengol VI of Urgell, according to a private charter of 23 June 1152. Another charter of 27 March 1150 shows Ermengol sharing it with Lope López, suggesting that Ponce was Lope's replacement. In 1155, Ponce was with Alfonso for the capture of Andújar. The last reference to Ponce holding Cea, site of a royal castle, dates from 28 June 1156.|$|E
25|$|In 1855 Sturt applied unsuccessfully for the {{positions}} of Governor of Victoria and in 1858 for Governor of Queensland. Sturt's age, uncertain health, and comparatively small income were against him. By 1860 Sturt's three sons <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> army, and {{the remainder of his}} family went to live at Dinan to economize after the expenses of education and fitting out. Unfortunately the town was unhealthy and in 1863 a return was made to Cheltenham. In 1864 Sturt suffered a great grief in the death of one of his sons in India. In March 1869 he attended the inaugural dinner of the Colonial Society, at which Lord Granville mentioned that it was the intention of the government to extend the Order of St Michael and St George to the colonies. Sturt allowed himself to be persuaded by his friends to apply for a knighthood (KCMG), but afterwards regretted he had done so when he heard there were innumerable applications.|$|E

25|$|The match {{started with}} the first two {{competitors}} in the ring, the two wrestlers who are next in the rotation were on the apron and the remaining eight wrestlers were on the floor on their respective sides of the ring. The first elimination came at 6:14 when Volador Jr. pinned Luciferno, giving the tecnico side a six-on-five advantage. At 10:15 Bárbaro Cavernario pinned Titán to even the sides. At one point Dragon Lee and Mephisto collided mid ring, allowing Hechicero to pin Dragon Lee while Volador Jr. pinned Mephisto {{at the same time}} for a double elimination. Late in the match Volador Jr. and Carístico bumped into each other during the match and started to argue and push each other around despite being on the same team. The argument was broken up by Místico to allow the match to continue. In the final minutes of the elimination match Volador Jr., Euforia and Ángel de Oro <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ring at the same time for the final segment of the match. Euforia forced Volador Jr. to submit, followed by Ángel de Oro quickly pinning Euforia to win the match and become a three time Rey del Aire winner.|$|E

Samuel Johnson, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Edmund Burke, David Garrick, and Horace Walpole <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circle. For writers, being {{introduced}} there meant patronage, and Montagu patronized a number of authors, including Elizabeth Carter, Hannah More, Frances Burney, Anna Barbauld, Sarah Fielding, Hester Chapone, James Beattie, and Anna Williams. Samuel Johnson's hostess, Hester Thrale, was also an occasional visitor to Hill Street. Among her persistent admirers was the physician Messenger Monsey. Among the blue stockings, Elizabeth Montagu was not the dominant personality, {{but she was the}} woman of greatest means, and it was her house, purse, and power that made the society possible. As a literary critic, she was a fan of Samuel Richardson, both Fieldings (Henry Fielding and Sarah Fielding), and Fanny Burney, and she was pleased to discover that Laurence Sterne was a distant relation. She was related to Laurence Sterne through the Botham family. Sterne entrusted her with the disposition of his papers upon his departure for France. He was in ill health and the prospect of his dying abroad was real. She was a supporter of Bishop Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry.|$|E
