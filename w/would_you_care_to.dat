6000|$|SHITE [...] And this {{is merely}} wood painted, [...] And yet {{the place is}} famous because of these things. [...] <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> buy them from us? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes--yes. If {{there are}} any of them <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> tell me instead--just if you want to, mind--just {{if you are in}} a hole or anything?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and I {{cannot be}} sure {{when he will}} be back. But perhaps <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> wait. Take that chair and try one of these cigars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Smith," [...] he said, [...] "Yes. We {{have a small}} Archaeological Society. I--er--in {{a measure}} look after it. Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> become a member?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{raised his}} eyes languidly from the old {{black-letter}} volume which he had opened. [...] "It is cocaine," [...] he said,--"a seven-per-cent. solution. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> try it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'James,' says she, {{after she}} had {{finished}} what she was doing, 'I find I shall want another waiter for the coffee-room this season. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> try the place?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] I said, drawing him {{a little}} on one side, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> earn a {{sovereign}} without committing a breach of duty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{appeared}} {{considerably more}} becoming to let myself sink into oblivion. Besides, I could scarcely {{be expected to}} feel certain that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> hear from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Haven't I {{told you}} a good deal? I should have thought that Fred and I between us had told you all about Africa that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> hear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dinner in {{a private}} room, sir? Very well. John, No. 4! What wine <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> mention? Very well, sir. Will you please to order fresh horses? Not, sir? Very well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Constance," [...] he said, [...] "I {{am going}} away now. I have {{accomplished}} what I came for. But first, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> do me a small service? It {{is only a}} trifle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Sir Wingrave {{is going}} away, and doesn't want me. I must go somewhere, and I thought that I might {{go over and}} take rooms near you all. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> have me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am off to {{the upper}} muir to count the lambs," [...] said I; [...] "maybe <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> come up with me and see {{something}} of the country?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am Mr. Bullen's private secretary," [...] he announced. [...] "Mr. Bullen cannot {{leave the}} House for some time. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> {{go into the}} Strangers' Gallery, or will you wait in his room?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hear that}} you {{have never been in}} London," [...] said he. [...] "Your uncle is coming up to a supper which I am giving to the Fancy next Friday. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> make one of us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{not allowed}} to mention any names here, sir, but {{as a matter of fact}} I think that your friend knows. He met the gentleman in here one day. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> have a look at the hospital, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His," [...] {{said the}} Sage, [...] "is the only case of golfing {{garrulity}} I {{have ever known}} where a permanent cure was affected. If <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> hear about it----?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> use my barkers," [...] said my father. [...] "I've had 'em in {{fourteen}} actions, {{and up to}} thirty yards you couldn't wish a better tool." ...|$|R
6000|$|Noel {{could not}} help answering: [...] "My name is Noel Pierson; I live with my father; here's the address"--she found her case, and fished out a card. [...] "My father is a clergyman; <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> come and see him? He loves music and painting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a moment," [...] went on Owen, in a matter-of-fact voice, [...] "the dog-cart {{will not}} be round for another three-quarters of an hour. Tell me, if it were offered to you, and on {{investigation}} you proved suitable, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> take over this living?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's about {{a little}} Cockney draper's assistant, who takes a {{vacation}} on his bicycle, and falls in with a young girl very much above him. Her mother is a popular writer and all that. And the situation is very curious, and sad, too, and tragic. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> read it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There were," [...] said he, [...] "one or {{two very}} {{remarkable}} things. Perhaps when I have finished at the police-station <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> {{come out and}} give me your opinion of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> join in our advance? Pray {{consider}} yourself quite one of us," [...] said the general, bowing and smiling {{as if he}} were asking him to a dish of tea.|$|R

6000|$|... "It may {{concern you}} very much indeed. A few days ago I should have told you, as I did, that {{nothing in the world}} could stop the {{publication}} of that article. To-day I am not so sure. At any rate, I believe there is a chance. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> see the chief?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pulmonary haemorrhage!" [...] said Courthorne. [...] "Perhaps it {{was born}} in me, but I never had much trouble until after {{that night in the}} snow at the river. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> hear about it? We're not fond of each other, but after the steer-drivers I've been herding with, it's a relief to talk to a man of {{moderate}} intelligence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because----. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> come up {{and look}} at my 'ouse and 'ave a smoke and a chat. Eh?" [...] He made {{indicative}} back jerks of the head, and was smitten with a horrible doubt whether possibly this invitation might not be some hideous breach of etiquette.

6000|$|... "Well, well; {{we shall}} see, Brutus," [...] {{answered}} the Deputy, laying his hand upon the fellow's shoulder. [...] "But I {{am afraid that}} this time I am going farther than <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> come." ...|$|R

6000|$|Barbara made {{a little}} gesture that was eloquent of appreciation. [...] "It is very beautiful. A place one could dream one's life away in. We have nothing like it in Canada. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>care</b> <b>to</b> stay here always?" ...|$|R
