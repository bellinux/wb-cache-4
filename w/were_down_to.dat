A December 2016 study by the Zoological Society of London, Panthera Corporation and Wildlife Conservation Society showed that cheetahs are far closer to extinction than previously thought, with only 7,100 remaining in the wild, and crammed within only 9% of their historic range. Human pressures {{are to blame for}} the cheetah population crash, including prey loss due to overhunting by people, retaliatory killing from farmers, habitat loss and the illegal wildlife trade.|$|R

5|$|Malmö FF's average {{attendance}} at Malmö Stadion initially lay steady at around 15,000 per season from the mid-1960s {{to the early}} 1970s, before decreasing to around 10,000 spectators per season {{for the remainder of}} that decades. During the 1980s and the 1990s, attendances decreased even further down to an average of around 5,000 fans per season; the general interest in Swedish football was also very low at the time. Attendance took a sharp turn upwards during the 2001 season, Malmö FF's first season back in Allsvenskan after a season in Superettan. Average crowds then increased annually, and reached their peak during the 2004 season, when Malmö FF reached an all-time record average attendance of 20,061. Attendances afterwards decreased each year, and <b>were</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a seasonal average of 11,182 by the time of Malmö FF's final season at the ground.

5|$|Prior to the {{shortening}} of {{the main}} Bergen Line railway with the Ulriken Tunnel, the Bergen–Nesttun Line was an important commuter rail service, feeding suburban residents from Fana into the city center. In 1917, the section was the most heavily trafficked railway in the country, with a travel time between 20 and 27 minutes. There were up to 27 trains per day, of which five continued to Garnes. In 1918, the line was proposed for doubling and electrification: the latter was completed in 1954. The same year, annual ridership <b>were</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 870,000 passengers.

5|$|The {{amount of}} freight {{carried by the}} canal peaked in 1958 at 18 million long tons (20 million short tons), but the {{increasing}} size of ocean-going ships and the port's failure to introduce modern freight-handling methods resulted in that headline figure dropping steadily, and {{the closure of the}} docks in Salford in 1984.

5|$|Following the German Invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, {{the heavy}} losses of front-line {{aircraft}} endured by the VVS {{together with the}} disruption of aircraft production resulted in I-5s being removed from training units and returned to combat service as ground-attack aircraft or night bombers until early 1942. Some I-5s were used by the 605th and 606th Fighter Regiments (Istrebitel'nyye Aviatsionyye Polki (IAP)) during the defence of Moscow as night bombers until re-equipping in February 1942. The 2nd Ground Attack Regiment (Shturmovoy Aviatsionyye Polki (ShAP)) was raised in September 1941 in the Crimea from reservists and the Kachin Flying School. By 10 October thirty-two I-5s were on hand, although attrition had reduced them to sixteen serviceable. They <b>were</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a total of a dozen aircraft by 18 October. They served until 1 February 1942 when the regiment was withdrawn for conversion to Ilyushin Il-2s and redesignated as the 766th ShAP. The 11th ShAP was raised by the Air Force of the Black Sea Fleet on 22 September 1941. On 18 October it mustered eighteen serviceable and fifteen unserviceable I-5s, although this was reduced to eleven serviceable and eight unserviceable aircraft by 7 November. It kept the I-5s in service until 1 February 1942 when the regiment was reorganized.|$|E
5|$|Hollis raised {{mortgages}} {{to pay for}} improvements, but receipts <b>were</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> £1,821 in 1839, {{the last}} full year of operation before the London and Southampton Railway opened. The receipts were obtained from tolls, as all freight was moved by independent carriers. At this point, Hollis gave control of the navigation to members of his family. His son managed it until 1841, when a banker called W. W. Bulpett, who was a mortgagee, took over. In 1847 he was given notice to quit by the Hollis family, despite having done a good job, but he refused. F. W. Hollis eventually obtained most of the shares from the other family members, and started legal action to remove Bulpett. Railway competition had caused {{a sharp drop in}} receipts, from £1,012 in 1843 to £430 in 1861, and payments to shareholders and mortgagees ceased in 1850 and 1857. In 1863, Bulpett was replaced by Mr Clarke, formerly the manager of the Andover Canal, but Bulpett returned when he won the action brought by Hollis.|$|E

Sorties for the month <b>were</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 58, a number of which were carried out from Labuan against Banka Strait. The wing's last minelaying missions of the war took place in July, again in the Banka Strait. In the final months before the Japanese surrender, the Catalinas also delivered propaganda leaflets around the Dutch East Indies and South China Sea, dropping over a million in June alone. No.76 Wing and its squadrons remained at Darwin {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the war, conducting routine patrols, transporting supplies and medicine to prisoners-of-war in the South West Pacific, and assisting in the repatriation of Australian personnel. In November 1945, under a reorganisation of RAAF units at Darwin, the wing headquarters was given orders to disband. It became non-operational on 16November and was officially dissolved five days later. No.42 Squadron disbanded the same month, while Nos.20 and 43 Squadrons transferred to Rathmines, where they disbanded in 1946.|$|E
