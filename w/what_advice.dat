500|$|Tracy disliked when he {{was asked}} about his technique, or about <b>what</b> <b>advice</b> he would give to others. He often belittled the profession, for {{instance}} saying to Kanin, [...] "Why do actors think they're so God damn important? They're not. Acting is not an important job in the scheme of things. Plumbing is." [...] Tracy was humble about his abilities, telling a journalist, [...] "it's just that I try no tricks. No profile. No 'great lover' act... I just project myself as I am—plain, trying to be honest." [...] He was known to have enjoyed the quip once made by Alfred Lunt: [...] "The art of acting is—learn your lines!" [...] Katharine Hepburn, in an interview six years after Tracy's death, suggested that Tracy wished he had held a different profession.|$|E

[...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I {{think at the end of}} the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things, and if people are hurt in the process, it's their fault. His vision is the one that is most important." [...] Barber said that deep down, Rhys is sensitive and he means well. When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers, Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative. He added that the viewers are interested in seeing what Rhys does next. When asked how he felt about playing a bad boy by DNA's Matthew Myers, Barber revealed that he loved it, saying [...] "It's always exciting getting the scripts because I never know which way they are going to turn or who I'm going to be turning on!" [...] The actor quipped that he is always wondering which character he is going to manipulate or [...] "screw over" [...] next and added [...] "But at the core of things Rhys has a heart of gold." ...|$|E

The song makes reference to Louis' boxing career and his famous rivalry with Schmeling in the first person, with the lyrics such as [...] "Oh, Max Schmeling was a formidable foe / The Ambling Alp was too, at least that's what I'm told / But if you learn one thing, you've learned it well / In June, you must give fascists hell." ...|$|E
2500|$|The working title {{throughout}} her writing was The Strike, but Rand having thought this title would have revealed the mystery {{element of the}} novel prematurely, she was pleased when her husband suggested Atlas Shrugged, previously {{the title of a}} single chapter, for the book. The title is a reference to Atlas, a Titan described in the novel as [...] "the giant who holds the world on his shoulders". The significance of this reference appears in a conversation between the characters Francisco d'Anconia and Hank Rearden, in which d'Anconia asks Rearden <b>what</b> <b>advice</b> he would give Atlas upon seeing that [...] "the greater [...] effort, the heavier the world bore down on his shoulders". With Rearden unable to answer, d'Anconia gives his own response: [...] "To shrug".|$|E

2500|$|On {{the front}} page of the Texarkana Gazette on Monday, May 6, a {{headline}} stated that the entire area was fighting jitters. Captain Gonzaullas helped fuel the hysteria when he announced on the radio Tuesday evening that Texarkanians should [...] "Oil up their guns and see if they are loaded. Put them out of the reach of children. Do not use them unless it's necessary, but if you believe it is, do not hesitate." [...] When asked <b>what</b> <b>advice</b> he could give to quiet the town's fear, he responded [...] "I'd tell them to check the locks and bolts on their doors and get a double-barreled shotgun to take care of any intruder who tried to get in."

2500|$|Like {{many of his}} {{generation}} who had served in World War I, Eden was strongly anti-war, and strove {{to work through the}} League of Nations to preserve European peace. The government proposed measures, superseding the postwar Versailles Treaty, that would allow Germany to rearm (albeit replacing her small professional army with a short-service militia) and reduce French armaments. Winston Churchill criticised the policy sharply in the House of Commons on 23 March 1933, opposing [...] "undue" [...] French disarmament as this might require Britain to take action to enforce peace under the 1925 Locarno Treaty. Eden, replying for the government, dismissed Churchill's speech as exaggerated and unconstructive, commenting that land disarmament had yet to make the same progress as naval disarmament at the Washington and London treaties, and arguing that French disarmament was needed in order to [...] "secure for Europe that period of appeasement which is needed". Eden's speech was met with approval by the House of Commons. Neville Chamberlain commented shortly afterwards: “That young man is coming along rapidly; not only can he make a good speech but he has a good head and <b>what</b> <b>advice</b> he gives is listened to by the Cabinet” [...] Eden later wrote that in the early 1930s the word “appeasement” was still used in its correct sense (from the Oxford English Dictionary) of seeking to settle strife. Only later in the decade did it come to acquire a pejorative meaning of acceding to bullying demands.|$|E
