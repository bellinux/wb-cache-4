2500|$|A {{report by}} Forests Monitor and Rainforest Foundation {{published}} in 2007 [...] {{found that there}} is little evidence that industrial logging alleviates poverty, but instead actually contributes to it. [...] This is mainly due to access to forest areas becoming restricted and money not filtering down to local people. [...] “Keeping in mind that the Law only provides for conservation of 15% of the DRC’s forests and that more than 40% are earmarked for commercial logging, <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know what percentage of Congolese forests are to be returned back to the indigenous communities to enable them to practice their cultural and socio-economic activities” (Byayuwa).|$|E

One case attracted a lot of public criticism. In June 1950, the IDF and police rounded up 105 men and women believed to be infiltrators were deported to Jordan. In an open letter to the Knesset, the inhabitants of Abu Ghosh claimed that the army had [...] "surrounded our village, and taken our women, children and old folk, and thrown them over the border and into the Negev Desert, and many of them died in consequence, when they were shot [...] the borders." [...] The letter further stated that they woke up to [...] "shouts blaring over the loudspeaker announcing that the village was surrounded and anyone trying to get out would be shot....The police and military forces then began to enter the houses and conduct meticulous searches, but no contraband was found. In the end, using force and blows, they gathered up our women, and old folk and children, the sick and the blind and pregnant women. These shouted for help but there was no saviour. And we looked on and were powerless to do anything save beg for mercy. Alas, our pleas were of no avail...

In vain do we try to substitute mystical rites that cost nothing, such as circumcision, or, {{as a substitute for}} that, baptism. Our sense of justice still demands an expiation, a sacrifice, a sufferer for our sins. And this leaves the poor man still in his old difficulty; for if it was impossible for him to procure rams and goats and shekels, how much more impossible is it for him to find a neighbor who will voluntarily suffer for his sins: one who will say cheerfully [...] "You have committed a murder.

6000|$|But <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{know how}} the horse and mare came in, or why the statue of Demeter had a horse's head. 'This seems simply {{to be due to}} the fact that, quite apart from this myth, the sun had, in India at least, often been {{conceived}} as a horse [...] . and the dawn had been likened to a mare.' But how does this explain the problem? The Vedic poets cited (ii. 542) either referred to the myth which we have to explain, or they used a poetical expression, knowing perfectly well what they meant. As long as they knew what they meant, they could not make an unseemly fable out of a poetical phrase. Not till after the meaning was forgotten could the myth arise. But the myth existed already in the Veda! And the unseemliness is precisely what we have to account for; that is our enigma.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{estimates}} of a generic level phylogeny for the ubiquitous parasitoid wasp subfamily Microgastrinae (Hymenoptera) have been problematic due to short internal branches {{deep in the}} phylogeny. These short branches might {{be attributed to a}} rapid radiation among the taxa, the use of genes that are unsuitable for the levels of divergence being examined, or insuYcient quantity of data. We added over 1200 nucleotides from four nuclear genes to a dataset derived from three genes to produce a dataset of over 3000 nucleotides per taxon. While the number of well-supported short branches in the phylogeny increased, <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> obtain strong bootstrap support for every node. Parametric and nonparametric bootstrap simulations projected that an enormous, and likely unobtainable, amount of data would be required to get bootstrap support greater than 50 % for every node. However, a marked {{increase in the number of}} well-sup-ported nodes was seen when we conducted a Bayesian analysis of a combined dataset generated from morphological characters added to the seven gene dataset. Our results suggest that, in some cases, combining morphological and genetic characters may be the most practical way to increase support for short branches deep in a phylogeny...|$|R
40|$|Piccolo and bassoon {{are highly}} {{homologous}} multidomain proteins of the presynaptic cytomatrix whose function is unclear. Here, we generated piccolo knockin/knockout mice that either contain wild-type levels of mutant piccolo unable to bind Ca 2 + (knockin), ∼ 60 % decreased levels of piccolo that is C-terminally truncated (partial knockout), or < 5 % levels of piccolo (knockout). All piccolo mutant mice were viable and fertile, but piccolo knockout mice exhibited increased postnatal mortality. Unexpectedly, electrophysiology and electron microscopy of piccolo-deficient synapses failed to uncover a major phenotype either in acute hippocampal slices or in cultured cortical neurons. To unmask potentially redundant functions of piccolo and bassoon, we thus acutely knocked down expression of bassoon in wild-type and piccolo knockout neurons. Despite a nearly complete loss of piccolo and bassoon, however, <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> detect an electrophysiological phenotype in cultured piccolo- and bassoon-deficient neurons in either GABAergic or glutamatergic synaptic transmission. In contrast, electron microscopy {{revealed a significant}} reduction in synaptic vesicle clustering in double bassoon/piccolo-deficient synapses. Thus, we propose that piccolo and bassoon play a redundant role in synaptic vesicle clustering in nerve terminals without directly participating in neurotransmitter release...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{focus on}} the Czech (Czechoslovak) politician Karel Kramář and his political thought. This work describes Kramář's political career and also aims to capture the development of his political opinions. This is the first Czech attempt to bring the complete and objective political biography of the first Czechoslovak Prime Minister. Karel Kramář has always stirred emotions in Czechoslovakia, {{both positive and negative}} ones. We can study books, which praise Karel Kramář, or books, which criticize him. These books are usually from the era of the First Czechoslovak Republic. During World War II, the name of Karel Kramář was unwelcome because of his opinion on the Germans, after the year 1948 because of his attitude to the Soviet Union and the Bolsheviks. That is why we have only partial studies about some aspects of Kramář's politics. Year 1989 brought no change, except for the increased focus on Kramář's politics. In spite of this fact <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have the book about Karel Kramář and his political life and thought which would be written by a Czech author. We just had to read books from German historian Martina Winkler or Russian historian Elena Pavlovna Serapionova. Their work concentrated just on some topics of Kramář's political thought. The theses of this dissertation follow [...] ...|$|R

Collectively, these results suggest that human societies will have more choice in how they respond to sea-level rise than is often assumed.
