2500|$|At thirteen, {{his mother}} {{reported}} that John [...] "sketches quite nicely, & has a remarkably quick and correct eye. If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> {{to give him}} really good lessons, he would soon be quite a little artist." [...] At the age of thirteen, he received some watercolor lessons from Carl Welsch, a German landscape painter. Although his education was far from complete, Sargent {{grew up to be}} a highly literate and cosmopolitan young man, accomplished in art, music, and literature. He was fluent in French, Italian, and German. At seventeen, Sargent was described as [...] "willful, curious, determined and strong" [...] (after his mother) yet shy, generous, and modest (after his father). He was well-acquainted with many of the great masters from first hand observation, as he wrote in 1874, [...] "I have learned in Venice to admire Tintoretto immensely and to consider him perhaps second only to Michelangelo and Titian." ...|$|E
60|$|VIVIE. Yes. It's {{the only}} {{relation}} I care for, even if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> any other. I mean that.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And it's not as {{if there}} had been any doubt about our knowing our minds. We both cared, and we had a long time before us. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to wait.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> {{to stop a}} {{piece in}} the middle and wait fifteen years before {{continuing}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "This fellow is shamming dead," [...] {{he thought}} to himself, and lifted his gun, for in those times <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to nurse sick Kaffirs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Theos has {{no police}} now," [...] Ughtred answered. [...] "They are {{fighting}} at Althea. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> {{to leave a}} hundred able-bodied men in the city." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Contracts are {{not always}} just," [...] fumed out June, [...] "and when they're not, {{they ought to be}} broken. The Boers are much the weaker. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to be generous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Davis is mighty good, but there's {{no reason}} why he should {{back a couple of}} boys who are able to pay their own way. The rent is so cheap I was 'fraid he'd been puttin' up money on our account, so's <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to hire it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A noble example!" [...] {{the queen}} said warmly. [...] "I would that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> {{to do the}} same through all the royal domains. It is a {{pleasure}} to us to know that one at least of our fiefs has been so worthily bestowed. Well, sir, I shall see you at the court this evening." ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{was with}} {{people who did not}} drink, I never thought of drinking. Louis did not drink. Neither he nor I <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> it; but, more {{significant}} than that, we had no desire to drink. We were healthy, normal, non-alcoholic. Had we been alcoholic, we would have drunk whether or not <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>afforded</b> it.|$|R
60|$|In that {{explosion}} all our noble civilization-factories {{went up in}} the air {{and disappeared}} from the earth. It was a pity, but it was necessary. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to let the enemy turn our own weapons against us.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{never get}} into debt. It is not that, exactly. The fact is, Mr Dale, {{we have no}} right to live there without paying rent; but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to live there if we did pay rent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You see,' {{said the}} other, {{not at all}} disturbed, 'the {{advantage}} of being so frank and open. Just what I was about to add, upon my honour! I am amazingly attached to Ned--quite doat upon him, indeed--and even if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to throw ourselves away, that very objection would be quite insuperable.--I wish you'd take some wine?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Calvert's eyes twinkled. [...] "The {{same thing}} that brought you--stories of {{unlimited}} treasure. When I heard them I left my few machines--they were not working well, and humbly craved the autocratic president of the Day Spring mine's permission to join this expedition. The Day Spring was not prospering in {{such a degree that}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to ignore the rumors--eh, Geoffrey?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{commenced}} {{the relation}} of reminiscences, mostly humorous, of the affray, for <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to laugh, and all joined in the burst of merriment which rose from outside when several horsemen came up at a gallop across the prairie. A stockrider of Caledonian extraction had borrowed my banjo to amuse his comrades, and they appreciated his irony when he played the new arrivals in {{to the tune of}} [...] "The Campbells are coming." ...|$|E
60|$|However, we were yet afloat, and {{the river}} was open for {{the passage of the}} Britishers, {{therefore}} it may be understood that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to spend many minutes in speculations upon what might or might not have been done.|$|R
6000|$|... "What right {{had they}} {{to marry her}} up to him?" [...] said Claude. [...] "I don't blame poor January. I suppose none of us, gentlemen, would have refused such a pretty toy, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>afforded</b> it as he could." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How the {{instinct}} of economy lingers in us, too, {{long after the}} use of it is outgrown. It's as bad as {{the instinct}} of hospitality. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>afford</b> to pay extra for the comfort of sitting here over these broken victuals--" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Yankee {{boats were}} the first to come up with this fish, so the prize belonged to them. We were well pleased at this, as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to let them have it, seeing that we could {{scarcely}} have found room to stow away the oil in our hold. It was the Yankees' first fish, too, so they were in great spirits about it, and towed it to their ship, singing [...] "Yankee-doodle" [...] with all their might.|$|E
60|$|Seizing {{the second}} pair of oars he swung himself {{around on the}} after thwart, and {{although}} he made no claim to being a sailor, I never saw one who worked to better advantage. It seemed {{as if he had}} the strength of a dozen men in his arms, and the skiff shot forward into the gloom as if hardly touching the water, until we were come so near the shore of Noddle island as to be in the denser shadows, where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to wait until learning what course our pursuers might be taking.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> {{something}} better than a canal-boat now, and therefore we were not so restricted as in our first search for a house. But, the one thing which troubled my wife--and, indeed, caused me much anxious thought, was that scourge of almost all rural localities--tramps. It would be necessary {{for me to be}} away all day,--and we could not afford to keep a man,--so we must be careful to get a house somewhere off the line of ordinary travel, or else in a well-settled neighborhood, where there would be some one near at hand in case of unruly visitors.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>afforded</b> {{some of the}} plate, Rawdon," [...] {{the wife}} {{continued}} sentimentally. [...] "Five-and-twenty guineas was monstrously dear for that little piano. We chose it at Broadwood's for Amelia, when she came from school. It only cost five-and-thirty then." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{would still}} not go {{with us to}} Lake House, for go we did. An {{invitation}} was stimulating to Eustace, and though I much disliked the women, I knew <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to reject an advance if we were not to continue out of humanity's reach.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{next thing}} {{will be for}} you to make a bow and arrows, Luka. I did not buy the other gun for two reasons: in the first place because <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> it, and in the second because you said you liked a bow best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must get}} another crew {{just as soon}} as I can," [...] said he, [...] "and there isn't a minute to be lost! I was {{stretching}} a point when I agreed to stop over a day, but I thought <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> that and reach Kingston as soon as Shirley does, but when he gets there with his message to the Captain of the Dunkery Beacon, I want to be on hand. There's no knowing what will have to be done, or what will have to be said. I don't want Shirley to think that he's got nobody to stand by him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} how. You know you sing a little bit, Ily; you took music-lessons {{nearly two years}} in Logansport. It wasn't long, {{but it was all}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> then. And your teacher said you didn't have any voice, and it was a waste of money to keep on. Now, suppose you ask the fellers what they think of your singin', and see what each one of 'em tells you. The man that'll tell you the truth about it'll have a mighty lot of nerve, and 'll do to tie to. What {{do you think of the}} plan?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{there were}} exceptions. In the variables, {{if you wait}} long enough, {{something}} is bound to happen, and we were so plentifully stocked with food and water that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to wait. On October 26, we actually made one hundred and three miles of easting, {{and we talked about}} it for days afterwards. Once we caught a moderate gale from the south, which blew itself out in eight hours, but it helped us to seventy-one miles of easting in that particular twenty-four hours. And then, just as it was expiring, the wind came straight out from the north (the directly opposite quarter), and fanned us along over another degree of easting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our finance {{committee}} were afraid {{at first that}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to bring Mr. Leacock to our society. But fortunately through the personal generosity of two of our members who subscribed ten pounds each {{out of their own}} pocket we are able to raise the required sum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "However," [...] said Thursday, after {{a little}} reflection, [...] "there {{are two things that}} might render our {{acceptance}} impossible. I suppose you will require rent for the outfit; but for a time, until we get well started, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to pay as much as {{you have a right to}} demand." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was raining}} when we awoke Monday morning, {{but we were}} now restless to get under way. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to spend another day waiting in the rain. It was gloomy {{business}} in camp, and {{at the first sign}} of lightening sky we packed up and started promptly at twelve o'clock.|$|R
60|$|Night {{after night}} I set my burglar trap, and morning after morning I locked {{it up in}} the closet. I cannot say that I was exactly {{disappointed}} that no opportunity offered to test the value of my plan, but it did seem a pity that I should take so much trouble for nothing. It had been some weeks since any burglaries had been committed in the neighbourhood, and it was the general opinion that the miscreants had considered this field worked out and had transferred their labours to a better-paying place. The insult of having been considered unworthy the attention of the knights of the midnight jimmy remained with us, but as all our goods and chattels also remained with us <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to brook the indignity.|$|E
60|$|But {{while we}} were {{returning}} thanks to them, being all <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford,</b> two mighty creatures came from the mountains: one as it were pursuing the other with great fury, which we were the rather inclined to believe as they seldom appear but in the night: and both these swiftly passing by the Negroes, jumped into the sea, wantonly swimming about, as tho' the diversion of the waters had {{put a stop to}} their fierceness. At last one of them coming nearer to my boat than I expected or desired, I shot him directly through the head; upon which he sunk immediately, and yet rising again, would have willingly made the shore: but between the wound and the strangling of the water, he died before he could reach it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I try to {{give myself}} the air of it when I am feeling very proud. But really, we live at a most charming little hotel on a back street, out of the whirl and rush that we should prefer to be in if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> it." [...] He said it must be delightful, and he made the proper {{inquiries}} about Mrs. March. Kendricks never forgot the gentleman in the artist, and he was as true to the convenances {{as if they had}} been principles. That was what made Mrs. March like his stories so much more than the stories of some people who wrote better. He said he would drop in during the afternoon, and I went indoors on the pretext of buying a newspaper. Then, without engaging rooms for Mrs. Deering and Miss Gage, I hurried home.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is what <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> for Anna," [...] said Mrs. Gascoigne. [...] "But she, dear child, {{would ride}} Lotta's donkey {{and think it}} good enough." [...] (Anna was absorbed in a game with Isabel, who had hunted out an old back-gammon-board, and had begged to sit up an extra hour.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Scarcely any {{phase of}} the {{election}} is more sinisterly interesting [...] than {{the increase in the}} socialist vote. Before election we said [...] that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to give aid and comfort to the socialists in [...] any manner. [...] . It (socialism) must be fought in all its phases, in [...] its every manifestation."--San Francisco Argonaut.|$|R
60|$|The assault {{had come}} to an end, and we of the {{garrison}} were triumphant, but at such an expense of life that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not well <b>afford</b> many more such victories.|$|R
