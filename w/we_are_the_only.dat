500|$|Arsenal played league challengers Newcastle United in {{the sixth}} round, on 9 March 2002. The timing of the game, {{influenced}} by the television schedulers, angered Wenger, who threatened to field a weakened side, to prioritise on their Champions League progress: [...] "The BBC have put us in this position of playing at 5.35pm on Saturday night instead of a noon kick-off. I don't know whether Newcastle would have played the game earlier on the Saturday but what can I do about the BBC? I feel it's being very unfair as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> side left in all three competitions." [...] It was the second meeting between both teams in a week, {{and in spite of}} Arsenal winning the first fixture and scoring the opener in the cup tie, Newcastle found [...] "new reserves of energy and determination" [...] to draw level and created numerous opportunities to win the game outright. With the game ending in a draw, a replay was scheduled two weeks later. Arsenal won 3-0, but more concerningly lost Pirès, who was carried off and subsequently ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} season with medial knee ligament damage. An own goal by Middlesbrough's Gianluca Festa, from an Henry free-kick in the semi-finals was enough to send Arsenal to their 15th FA Cup final.|$|E

She was later said to be responsible for decoding a warning that the Persian forces were about to invade Greece; after Spartan generals could not decode a wooden tablet covered in wax, she ordered them to clear the wax, revealing the warning. [...] Plutarch's Moralia contains a collection of [...] "Sayings of Spartan Women", including a laconic quip attributed to Gorgo: when asked by a woman from Attica why Spartan women were the only women in the world who could rule men, she replied [...] "Because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> women who are mothers of men".|$|E
2500|$|A {{member of}} the Romanian Orthodox Church, Pușcariu stood out among his {{generation}} for fusing the national and religious identity into a culturally conservative mold. In his Romanian literature history tract of 1921 (Istoria literaturii române. Epoca veche), he concluded that [...] "our Orthodoxism was the most significant event {{when it came to}} our cultural development". This, he noted at the time, had both positive and negative effects: Romanians were absent from the Renaissance, but were also free to develop their own culture, one of [...] "measure and harmony". Pușcariu was to become the first president of the Romanian Orthodox Brotherhood, founded at Cluj in 1933. At its Congress in 1937, he repeated the claim that [...] "our Orthodoxy is our only criterion for differentiation, for <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> Latin people of the Orthodox faith". Istoria literaturii..., [...] "very popular with students and men of culture", and heavily influenced by Iorga, made a point of discovering or reclaiming early contributions to fine writing in the medieval principalities. According to literary historian Eugen Negrici, this effort was unconvincing: [...] "The aesthetic gamble is a meek one, and [...] critical insights and interpretative newness are both frail. [...] However, the imposing illustrations and the openness [...] toward other forms of ancient art (architecture, painting, embroidery, miniatures, etc.) are not without consequences. Such rich and motley environs become a resonance box for the hardly perceptible sound of an actual literature. We may now fool ourselves that this literature is one of force and consistency".|$|E

Since 2004, the group has participated in the medical image retrieval tasks of ImageCLEF each year. There are three types of tasks for ImageCLEFmed 2012 : modality classification, image– based retrieval and case–based retrieval. The medGIFT group participated in all three tasks. MedGIFT is developing a system named ParaDISE (Parallel Distributed Image Search Engine), which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> successor of GIFT (GNU Image Finding Tool). The alpha version of ParaDISE was used to run most of the experiments in the competition. Results show that our approach using Bag–of–Visual–Words (BoVW), Bag–of–Colors (BoC) and Lucene for <b>the</b> image captions <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best run for mixed modality classification. <b>The</b> same approach <b>is</b> also <b>the</b> best for the image retrieval task in terms of bpref.
