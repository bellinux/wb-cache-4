50|$|Gore {{supporters}} {{argued that}} had candidate Ralph Nader, a liberal, not {{run in the}} election, {{the majority of the}} 97,421 votes he received in Florida would have been cast for Gore.

Their argument is bolstered by a poll of Nader voters, asking them for whom they <b>would</b> have <b>voted</b> had Nader not run, which said 45 percent of Nader voters <b>would</b> have <b>voted</b> for Gore, 27 percent <b>would</b> have <b>voted</b> for Bush, and the rest <b>would</b> not have <b>voted.</b>|$|R

5|$|Citizens were {{organized}} {{on the basis}} of centuries and tribes, which would each gather into their own assemblies.
