40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel on the combustion, unregulated gaseous emissions and particulate emissions of a diesel engine. Experiments were carried out on a direct-injection diesel engine fueled with diesel, B 20 (20 % biodiesel on volume basis), B 50, B 75 and biodiesel, under the Japanese 13 -mode test cycle. Biodiesel increases the in-cylinder pressure, shortens the ignition delay and combustion duration, and lowers the maximum heat release rate. An increase of brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is also observed when using biodiesel. For brake thermal efficiency (BTE), no significant changes are found {{in most of the}} tested modes. Biodiesel increases the <b>weighted</b> brake <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 1, 3 -butadiene, propene, ethene, benzene, but reduces the <b>weighted</b> brake <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> of toluene and xylene. No significant changes are observed for the ozone formation potential of these unregulated gaseous emissions among the tested fuels. Biodiesel reduces the weighted particle mass concentration (PMC) and the weighted geometric mean diameter (GMD) of the particles, however, significant reductions in the weighted total number concentration (TNC) are only observed when using B 75 or biodiesel. Overall, the influence of biodiesel on the investigated emissions is proportional to the biodiesel content in the tested fuels.

40|$|Mesoscale {{simulations}} of LX- 17 incorporating different equilibrium mixture models {{were used to}} investigate the unreacted equation-of-state (UEOS) of TATB. Candidate TATB UEOS were calculated using the equilibrium mixture models and benchmarked with mesoscale {{simulations of}} isentropic compression experiments (ICE).

40|$|New {{computational}} {{procedures are}} proposed {{for evaluating the}} exhaust brake <b>specific</b> mass <b>emissions</b> of each pollutant species in internal combustion (IC) engines. The procedures start from the chemical reaction of fuel with combustion air and, {{based on the measured}} exhaust raw emissions THC, CH 4, NOx, CO, O 2, CO 2, calculate the volume fractions of the compounds in the exhaust gases, including those that are not usually measured, such as water, nitrogen and hydrogen. The molecular mass of the exhaust gases is then evaluated and the brake <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> can be obtained if the exhaust flow rate and the engine power output are measured. The algorithm can also be applied to the evaluation of air/fuel ratio from measured raw volume emissions of IC engines. The new procedures take the effects of various fuel and combustion air compositions into account, with particular reference to different natural gas blends {{as well as to the}} presence of water vapor, CO 2, Ar and He in the combustion air. In the paper, the algorithms are applied to the evaluation of air-fuel ratio and brake <b>specific</b> mass <b>emissions</b> in an automotive bi-fuel Spark Ignition (SI) engine with multipoint sequential port-fuel injection. The experimental tests were carried out in a wide range of steady-state operating conditions under both gasoline and compressed natural gas operations. The <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> calculated from the new procedures are compared to those evaluated by applying Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and International Standards Organization (ISO) recommended practices and the air-fuel ratio results are compared to those obtained either from directly measured air and fuel mass flow rates or from Universal Exhaust Gas Oxygen (UEGO) sensor data.

40|$|Carbon Footprinting is {{a method}} of {{determining}} {{the environmental impact of}} a product or service. It focuses only on pollutions to the air by greenhouse gasses. There is a strong focus on these gases caused by intergovernmental alliances that restrict the amount of emitted gas. These agreements have been made, {{as a result of the}} widely accepted idea that an increase of the emissions of the greenhouse gasses will have a negative effect on the global climate. The basis of the research is a case study situated in at the shore of Scheveningen, and concerns five different coastal protection systems to be analysed. To all of the designs an a mount of carbon dioxide per running meter will be attributed: A Carbon Footprint. The five designs concern a beach nourishment and a dike with an altering revetment of concrete columns, riprap, asphalt and elastocoast. The case study provides a broad view of some of the most common protections at the Dutch coast. The outcome makes a direct comparison between the systems, based on the same boundary conditions, possible. All activities that consume energy and that are contributing to the production of a final product, together form the emission of a product. An amount of energy is, dependent on the energy source responsible for a <b>specific</b> <b>emission.</b> Emissions linked to a certain energy source are therefore very influential in the ultimate emission of a whole product. Different databases however stick to different values for these <b>specific</b> <b>emissions.</b> The differences in <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> combined with a number of other factors cause a deviation in emissions of similar products. When the ‘Cradle-to-Grave’ principle is applied for the before mentioned five designs at Scheveningen the following ranking can be found: concrete columns, beach nourishment, riprap, asphaltic and lastly the elastocoast revetment. Because of the large range in emissions the only conclusion that can be drawn from the Carbon Footprints determined in this thesis is the ranking presented here. Because of the uncertainty in the applied emissions, established in this research, no absolute figures should be adapted from this work.
