Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have my own.|$|E
2500|$|... "Little River Band {{no longer}} had a {{recording}} contract and there was no immediate possibility of recording. I always preferred recording to 'live work' and when the future of the band appeared to be just playing the greatest hits for the rest of its life, then I knew it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> leave." ...|$|E

When I released Best Of in 2004, our country was fighting the economic crisis, so I wrote lyrics about that situation and made songs for it relationated with crisis. D. Etelvina asked me to work on a new album, and like Portugal is in crisis again, I thought that <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come back." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1970s, Danzig {{started the}} Misfits, {{releasing}} the band's records {{through his own}} label, (originally known as Blank, then later as Plan 9). Danzig had attempted to get the Misfits signed to several record labels, {{only to be told}} that he would never have a career in music. The impetus for the band's name comes from Marilyn Monroe's last film, combined with Danzig considering himself to be a [...] "social misfit." [...] In October 1983, after releasing several singles and three albums, and gaining a small underground following, Danzig disbanded the Misfits due to increasing animosity among the band members and his dissatisfaction with their musical abilities. Danzig explained his decision: “It was difficult for me to work with those guys, because they weren't prepared to put in the hours practicing. I wanted to move things forward, and they didn't seem to have the same outlook. So it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> move on.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2001, Fallon Bowman left Kittie. Bowman {{explained}} why {{she left the}} band, saying: [...] "I was unhappy with some things in the band so I felt that maybe it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> depart. I think {{it was for the}} best". On October 30, 2001, Kittie released their second album Oracle. Sounding more aggressive than [...] "Spit", the album features elements of death metal and thrash metal. Morgan Lander noted how the band members were only 14 years old when writing their debut album and said [...] "We haven't written in 4 or 5 years." [...] She acknowledged a change in influence from their early days, stating, [...] "Then we listened to bands like Nirvana, Silverchair, and Alice in Chains. Now we listen to stuff like Cannibal Corpse and Nile." [...] However, the band would continue to write in the same fashion by first composing the music and then using that [...] "as the backdrop behind the vocals." [...] The album Oracle was recorded with Morgan Lander as the sole guitarist. Fallon's position as guitarist was filled by Jeff Phillips who worked as Kittie's guitar technician. In 2002, Talena Atfield left the band and was replaced on bass by Jennifer Arroyo. In 2004, the group added guitarist Lisa Marx, and Jeff Phillips went to work full-time on his side project, Thine Eyes Bleed. On July 27, 2004, Kittie released their third studio album Until the End.|$|E
2500|$|When Narayanan {{returned}} to India in 1948, Laski {{gave him a}} letter of introduction to Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Years later, he narrated how {{he began his career}} in the public service:When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a time-slot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. We talked for a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see that it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> leave. So I said goodbye and as I left the room I handed over the letter from Laski, and stepped out into the great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give this to me earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving." [...] After a few more questions, he asked me to see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.|$|E
2500|$|On-screen, Sam's {{marriage}} to Ricky ended following {{an affair with}} a yuppie named Clive (Sean Gallagher), and she took a job on a cruise ship. Commenting on her initial departure, Westbrook has said, [...] "My contract was up for renewal and I thought it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> move on [...] As much as I enjoyed being in EastEnders [...] I was also well {{aware of the fact that}} I was in danger of being type-cast forever if I carried on playing Sam. The producers didn't have a problem with me leaving. It was felt that my character had done as much as she could in the space of three years, anyway. During that time Sam had, after all, been involved in a story about under-age sex, run off to Gretna Green to marry Ricky, been evicted from her home, become a squatter, tried her luck as a topless model, fought on a regular basis with Grant and Phil, and gone through a marriage break-up. I think we all agreed that the poor girl was in need of a break [...] In January 1993 I filmed my final scenes and Sam Mitchell, in true EastEnders style, waved goodbye to Albert Square from the back of a London taxi cab [...] Although the producers agreed that it was the right time for my character to move on, they wanted to keep the door open for her to return at a later date, as they knew how popular the Mitchell family were with viewers. I was really pleased that they decided not to kill the character off". Her departure scenes aired on 4 February 1993.|$|E
