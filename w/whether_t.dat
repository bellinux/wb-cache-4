2500|$|In the UK, {{questions}} were raised over <b>whether</b> <b>T</b> had any valid insurance in place. Those insurance companies {{which could be}} connected to T, such as Royal & Sun Alliance, alleged that their policies excluded liability for asbestos-related claims, although this was in breach of the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969. Insurers stated that instead they had an [...] "understanding" [...] that T itself would settle asbestos claims and, [...] "in return for premiums received, the insurers would, however, issue a Certificate of Insurance which complied with {{the terms of the}} Employers' Liability Act, thereby enabling T to continue trading." [...] By 2003, no payments had been received by UK claimants and a request to the government to set up an interim compensation scheme was rejected, as was a request to the US Creditors' Committee of Federal-Mogul to make hardship payments to UK victims. As further litigation ensued to test the validity of the insurers' exclusions, public demonstrations were held outside the Manchester offices of Kroll Corporate Advisory & Restructuring Group, the court-appointed Administrators for T Tony Whitston, spokesperson for North-West Asbestos Victims’ Support Groups, said: [...] "Kroll have charged £17 million in fees to date and their solicitors have charged £6 million. The charge out rate for a senior partner at Kroll is £460 per hour. The financial “killing” being made by the Administrators is reducing the resources [...] left to pay dying victims.

5000|$|If the {{algebraic}} {{group is}} the multiplicative group of a quadratic extension of N, {{the result is the}} p + 1 method; the calculation involves pairs of numbers modulo N. It is not possible to tell whether [...] is actually a quadratic extension of N without knowing the factorisation. This requires knowing <b>whether</b> <b>t</b> is a quadratic residue modulo N, and there are no known methods for doing this without knowledge of the factorisation. However, provided N does not have {{a very large number of}} factors, in which case another method should be used first, picking random t (or rather picking A with t = A2 &minus; 4) will accidentally hit a quadratic non-residue fairly quickly. If t is a quadratic residue, the p+1 method degenerates to a slower form of the p &minus; 1 method.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} studied formal logics are propositional logic, predicate logic and their modal analogs, and for these there are standard ways of presenting an interpretation. In these contexts an interpretation {{is a function}} that provides the extension of symbols and strings of symbols of an object language. For example, an interpretation function could take the predicate T (for [...] "tall") and assign it the extension {a} (for [...] "Abraham Lincoln"). Note that all our interpretation does is assign the extension {a} to the non-logical constant T, and {{does not make a}} claim about <b>whether</b> <b>T</b> is to stand for tall and 'a' for Abraham Lincoln. Nor does logical interpretation {{have anything to say about}} logical connectives like 'and', 'or' and 'not'. Though we may take these symbols to stand for certain things or concepts, this is not determined by the interpretation function.|$|E
50|$|The {{algorithm}} {{for deciding}} this is conceptually simple: it constructs (the description of) {{a new program}} t taking an argument n, which (1) first executes program a on input i (both a and i being hard-coded into the definition of t), and (2) then returns the square of n. If a(i) runs forever, then t never gets to step (2), regardless of n. Then clearly, t is a function for computing squares {{if and only if}} step (1) terminates. Since we've assumed that we can infallibly identify programs for computing squares, we can determine <b>whether</b> <b>t,</b> which depends on a and i, is such a program, and that for every a and i; thus we have obtained a program that decides whether program a halts on input i. Note that our halting-decision algorithm never executes t, but only passes its description to the squaring-identification program, which by assumption always terminates; since the construction of the description of t can also be done in a way that always terminates, the halting-decision cannot fail to halt either.|$|E

Nodes 'c' and 'g' do not need registers for the following reasons: If T is a tree leaf, then the number of registers to evaluate T is either 1 or 0 depending <b>whether</b> <b>T</b> is a left or a right subtree (since an operation such as add R1, A can handle the right component A directly without storing it into a register). Therefore we shall start to emit code for the left subtree first, because we might run into the situation that we only have 2 registers left to compute the whole expression. If we now computed the right subtree first (which needs only 1 register), we would then need a register to hold the result of the right subtree while computing the left subtree (which would still need 2 registers), therefore needing 3 registers concurrently. Computing the left subtree first needs 2 registers, but the result can be stored in 1, and since the right subtree needs only 1 register to compute, the evaluation of the expression can do with only 2 registers left.|$|E
