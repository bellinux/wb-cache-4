5|$|Lyn Wadley et al. {{have argued}} that the {{complexity}} of the skill needed to process the heat-treated compound glue (gum and red ochre) used to haft spears <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to argue for continuity between modern human cognition and that of humans 70,000 BP at Sibudu Cave.|$|E
5|$|The {{assumption}} that John of Lydus' figure of 390,000 for the Diocletian's army {{refers to the}} beginning of that emperor's reign is dubious as it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> more natural for the chronicler to report the army's peak strength under that emperor.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{indicator of}} Chnodomar's numbers is size of forces considered necessary by the Roman government {{to deal with}} the Alamanni threat in Gaul: 40,000 (Julian's 15,000 plus Barbatio's 25,000). Assuming that the Roman military planners would have sought a 2 to 1 superiority to guarantee success, that would imply an Alamannic strength in Alsace of about 20,000. On the basis of these indicators, the midpoint between the recent estimate and Ammianus' figure, 25,000, <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> plausible.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1960s {{and until}} 2008, the French Pureblood class defined the {{standard}} against which Limousins {{throughout the world}} were measured. Although it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> appropriate to preserve the French Limousin Herd Book's integrity as the international Limousin breed standard by preventing the EU-mandated entry of animals that {{do not meet the}} Full French standard, restrictions to such entries remain forbidden under EU law and subsequent interpretations by the European Court of Justice.|$|E
5|$|The clock dial {{has been}} dated {{to either the}} {{building}} phases of 1405 or 1467-83, or to {{the installation of the}} Brunner clockwork in 1527-30. Ueli Bellwald notes that the planisphere uses a southern projection, as was characteristic for 15th-century astronomical clocks; all later such clocks use a northern projection. This <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to confirm the dating of the clock to the 1405 or 1467/83 renovations.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of a}} {{permanent}} population <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to prevent the British overseas territories of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and British Antarctic Territory, the New Zealand territory of Ross Dependency and the Australian external territories of Australian Antarctic Territory, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Coral Sea Islands and Heard Island and McDonald Islands from competing.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the view}} that is {{widespread}} among the Russian music public, I am associated with the party that is antagonistic to the one living Russian composer I love and value above all others—Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.... In a word, despite our different musical identities, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> we are following a single path; and I, for my part, am proud to have such a fellow traveler.... Lyadov and Glazunov are also numbered among my opponents, yet I sincerely love and value their talent.|$|E
5|$|During 1939 and 1940, {{a fourth}} batch of ten {{locomotives}} (Nos. 6235–6244) {{was built in}} streamlined form commencing with No. 6235 City of Birmingham. The names of cities for the locomotives <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to have been adopted because the LMS was fast running out of names of Duchesses. These locomotives cost an average of £10,659 {{for the first five}} and £10,838 each for the second five. The names of the cities in this batch were in strict alphabetical order. This came to an end when No. 6244 City of Leeds was patriotically renamed King George VI in 1941.|$|E
5|$|In 1597, King James wrote a {{dissertation}} on witchcraft titled Daemonologie {{in which he}} wrote the belief that demons could possess both {{the living and the}} dead. Within his classification of demons, he explained the concept through the notion that incubi and succubae could possess the corpse of the deceased and walk the earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> so visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.|$|E

5|$|One {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the local protein synthesis hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein synthesis <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein synthesis, synapse specificity, and associativity.|$|E
5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the two moons is not well understood. Their low albedo and {{carbonaceous}} chondrite composition have been regarded as similar to asteroids, supporting the capture theory. The unstable orbit of Phobos <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to point towards a relatively recent capture. But both have circular orbits, near the equator, which is unusual for captured objects and the required capture dynamics are complex. Accretion early {{in the history of}} Mars is plausible, but would not account for a composition resembling asteroids rather than Mars itself, if that is confirmed.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} design of tender, {{which came to}} be known as Type 'A' was designed for the first ten streamlined locomotives. These were of welded tank construction and included side sheets extending from the rear of the tender, which had the effect of reducing drag from eddies between the tender and the leading coach. 28 of these were constructed to be coupled with all the 24 streamliners (Nos. 6220–6229 and Nos. 6235–6248) as well as four of the unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6249–6252). In practice, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> that the side sheets made it more difficult to access the water filler as well as the couplings.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{considered}} nominating him {{for vice}} president that year, calculating that his party loyalty and appeal to rural, agricultural and prohibitionist constituents, could balance a ticket headed by likely presidential nominee Al Smith, an urban anti-prohibitionist. When the Kentucky delegation arrived at the 1928 Democratic National Convention, they approached Smith supporters {{with a view to}} pairing Barkley to their candidate. They were received cordially, but Smith's advisors thought placing candidates with such differing views on the ticket <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> contrived to the electorate. They did not tell Barkley of their decision until after he seconded Smith's nomination for president. Smith then announced Arkansas Senator Joseph T. Robinson as his preferred running mate. The Kentuckians nominated Barkley in spite of Smith's preference, but the overwhelming majority of delegates voted for Robinson, and Barkley announced that Kentucky was changing its support {{in order to make the}} nomination unanimous.|$|E
5|$|Depending on when Salmon graduated, it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> that cricket was {{a normal}} {{activity}} at Oxford for some time before Phillips wrote his pamphlet. It was certainly well established at Oxford by October 1728 when the 19-year-old Samuel Johnson entered Pembroke College. He told James Boswell that cricket matches were played during the one year he was at Oxford and this was recorded by Boswell in his Life of Samuel Johnson. A comment by Horace Walpole confirms that cricket was being played at Eton {{during the first quarter}} of the 18th century. The earliest reference to cricket being played at Cambridge University is dated 1710 and both of those establishments were attended by William Goldwin who, in 1706, wrote a Latin poem of 95 lines on a rural cricket match. It was called In Certamen Pilae (On a Ball Game) and it was published in his Musae Juveniles.|$|E

5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of the Plants, {{the voice}} of the Poet, which <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were not meant to conjure up images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E
5|$|Section 1(3) of the 1971 Act {{specifies}} that offences {{under section}} 1, where the destruction or damage {{is caused by}} fire, shall be charged as arson. It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> that courts adopt a purposive view {{in relation to the}} lawful excuse defence in relation to arson, as in R v. Hunt (1977). The defendant, wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people's home, set fire to it to demonstrate the risks. He claimed an honest belief in that by doing this, he had a lawful excuse within section 5(2). It was held, however, that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property. Although the court assumed that his belief was honest, it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself.|$|E
5|$|The present building, {{dating from}} around 1283 to 1537, mostly {{replaced}} the earlier monastic church founded in 1093 {{which was built}} in the Norman style. It is believed that the newer church was built around the older one. That the few remaining parts of the Norman church are of small proportions, while the height and width of the Gothic church are generous <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to confirm this belief. Aspects of the design of the Norman interior are still visible in the north transept, which retains wall arcading and a broadly moulded arch leading to the sacristy, which was formerly a chapel. The transept has retained an early 16th-century coffered ceiling with decorated bosses, two of which are carved with the arms of HenryVIII and Cardinal Wolsey.|$|E

50|$|Thus it <b>would</b> <b>seems</b> {{that for}} at least some of members of the JCPC, {{geographical}} and psychological distance (often raised as necessary for greater objectivity and impartiality) {{does not seem to be}} an issue and what is more important is the need for the Caribbean (and other Commonwealth countries) to take care of its own affairs. In fact, the Privy Council has often been willing to accept findings by Caribbean courts on local matters because they recognize that such courts are more familiar with Caribbean matters.|$|R
