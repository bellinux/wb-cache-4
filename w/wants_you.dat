500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to grow and He <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to have a purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able}} to get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E

500|$|Certain {{aspects of}} Windows 8.1 were also {{cause for concern}} because of their privacy implications.

500|$|All of {{the music}} was written by Cute Is What We Aim For, while all of the lyrics were written by Hacikyan.

[...] Pitchforks Jillian Mapes felt that [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] did {{not live up to}} its significant anticipation, criticizing the song's production and Gaga's vocal performance.

500|$|Following the {{unexpected}} {{success of their}} first album, there was tremendous demand for new music from Casting Crowns. Although lead vocalist Mark Hall, who either wrote or co-wrote all the songs on the album, felt [...] "a little worried" [...] about the band's follow-up album, fellow recording artists Steven Curtis Chapman (who co-produced the band's first album) and Mac Powell of Christian rock band Third Day encouraged Hall to [...] "say what God <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to say".

500|$|Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses is Slipknot's {{first album}} {{that does not}} warrant a Parental Advisory label, mainly because the lyrics of Vol. 3, {{compared}} to other Slipknot albums, are much less explicit in terms of profanity and obscure dark themes. The special edition still has a Parental Advisory label. In a 2008 interview, guitarist Mick Thomson explained that vocalist Corey Taylor {{made a point of}} avoiding the use of profanity in response to claims that he relied on use of it. Only two instances of profanity occur; {{the use of the word}} [...] "bitched" [...] in Duality and [...] "bastards" [...] which appears in the monologue leading into [...] "Pulse of the Maggots". According to AllMusic, the lyrics of Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) include metaphors and touch on themes that include anger, disaffection, and psychosis. Taylor's diversity in his vocal delivery was praised; Burns considered tracks like [...] "Vermilion Pt. 2" [...] to have [...] "stately vocal harmonies". Taylor's performance on the closing track [...] "Danger – Keep Away" [...] was specifically praised; Stylus called it the most [...] "depressing and emotional" [...] track on the album. Burns concluded that overall [...] "the riffs have lost none of their impact, but it seems like finally the group also <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to appreciate their vocal and lyrical impact." ...|$|E

Roy's portrayer, David Denman, reported he was [...] "really grateful" [...] that executive producer Greg Daniels allowed his character to develop, [...] "where all of a sudden, he wasn’t just a complete idiot but felt bad for being a bad boyfriend and wanted to try to get the girl back. It’s so rare to have that on a television show, because so often everyone <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to be the same character every week. It was quite refreshing creatively to get to do that." [...] Referring to Jim and Pam, Denman felt it was [...] "inevitable that Romeo and Juliet had to get together" [...] and end the series' love triangle. [...] "Otherwise," [...] he explained, [...] "it gets kind of tiring and old. I think it was the appropriate time , and I had such a great experience working with all those guys." [...] Denman also added that Daniels' decision stemmed from a desire to advance the Jim–Pam storyline [...] "to the next stage," [...] rather than having anything to do specifically with Denman himself.

500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work.

500|$|The {{anniversary of}} the game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987. By that time, the NBA had grown to be a popular sports league with average {{attendance}} of 13,000 fans per game and star players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. The Warriors' PR director Harvey Pollack said an impossible 40,000 people claimed to have seen the game, and some even testified it took place in Madison Square Garden. Chamberlain later stated {{it was one of}} his favorite games, but not the favorite: that title belonged to the match in which he grabbed an NBA record 55 rebounds against perennial rival Bill Russell. He did not want to feed the criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning. Although Chamberlain won two NBA championships and was the NBA's all-time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired, he was mostly remembered as the man who had single-handedly scored 100 points in a game. Chamberlain publicly embraced the 100-point game in his final years. On a radio show commemorating the game's 31st anniversary in 1993, he said, [...] "As time goes by, I feel more a part of that 100-point game." [...] He explained that growing up on the streets, he would have been derisively labelled a gunner, a glory-hound, for attempting 63shots. [...] "You take that many shots on the playground, and no one ever <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> on their team again." [...] He said he took shots he normally would not, noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting, as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in the 100-point game. He was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball would point out the game to their kids when they saw him. [...] "I know that it has been my tag. I am definitely proud of it. But it was definitely a team effort. You had {{to see some of the}} things my teammates did to get me the ball ... It was almost like a circus out there for a while." ...|$|E
