RAIN FORECASTER is a computer program that can forecast rainfall and wet days using phases of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and anomalies in sea surface temperatures in the Niño 3. 4 region which forms part of the central equatorial Pacific Ocean. RAIN FORECASTER also incorporates the long lead forecasting model developed by Florida State University (FSU). The Florida State University model allows industry to assess early in the year (e. g. January, February) if there {{is likely to be a}} <b>wet</b> <b>finish</b> to the harvest season. Whilst RAIN FORECASTER can be used as an operational prediction tool, it is also a learning tool that can be used to understand how climate indices influence rainfall patterns. For example, by experimenting with RAIN FORECASTER, three key rules emerge common to most sugarcane growing regions located along the eastern coast of Australia. These rules are: (i) consistently positive SOI phases and/or negative Niño 3. 4 anomalies (La Niña) during the harvest season favour wetter harvest conditions; (ii) consistently negative SOI phases and/or positive Niño 3. 4 anomalies (El Niño) during the harvest season favour drier harvest conditions, and (iii) La Niña projections for the harvest season made by the FSU model early in the year, increase the risk of a <b>wetter</b> <b>finish</b> to the harvest. RAIN FORECASTER can be used for forecasting conditions outside the harvest season, but different results may appear for different regions.

40|$|Textile dyeing and <b>wet</b> <b>finishing</b> wastewaters are {{considered}} a major concern because {{of the necessity of}} removing colour and pollutants before their discharge into the environment. Their chemical composition is diverse depending mainly on fashion, material and process. After the homogenization of all the wastewaters coming from the different textile processes, the generally used multi-stage technology for their treatment and purification combines physico-chemical and biological processes. However, these techniques are not efficient enough to eliminate completely color and chemical pollutants contained. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are an attractive alternative to decolourize textile efflunts, mainly those using solar radiation. One of the main characteristics of AOPs is their scarce oxidative selectivity, {{as a result of their}} high reactivity, which makes them desirable to eliminate recalcitrant pollutants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the application of a solar-driven photo-Fenton treatment to coloured textile effluents from dyehouses in order to study their decolourization and mineralization. Furthermore, the reuse of the treated wastewaters in new laboratory exhaust dyeing processes was studied with single and a mixture of three commercial direct dyestuffs containing different chromophores. The results of 99 % decolourization, 95 % DOC decrease and 99 % COD removal were measured after no presence of hydrogen peroxide and filtration of the treated effluents.

40|$|Abstract Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is an {{aliphatic}} polyester and ecofriendly {{material of}} a natural origin with biodegradable properties. The monomer for PLA is lactic acid obtained from the fermentation of sugar and vegetables like corn and cassava. This study investigated the effect of heatsetting and wet processes on the tensile properties of treated and untreated Ingeo ™ Poly (Lactic acid) PLA knitted fabrics. PLA samples of dimension 200 mm x 200 mm were subjected to heatsetting at a temperature of 130 oC and increasing times of 15 s, 30 s, 45 s, 60 s, 90 s, 120 s and 240 s respectively using the Werner Mathis infra-red heatsetting equipment and subsequently treated to wet processes including scouring, alkaline reduction clearing, dyeing and softening. Four tensile parameters were determined in warp and weft direction using the KES-FB system of fabric evaluation. These tensile parameters were tensile extension EM [%], linearity of load extension LT [-], tensile energy WT [g. cm/cm 2] and tensile resilience RT [%]. The results showed (i) a consistent increase in tensile extension of treated PLA (unlike untreated PLA knitted fabric) with increasing time of heatsetting and <b>wet</b> <b>finishing</b> applications suggesting that treated PLA may tend to exhibit enhanced fabric hand or softness and increased formability (ii) Treated PLA to exhibit lower LT with increasing time of heatsetting and wet treatments implying a better formability and in-plane compressibility of treated PLA when compared to untreated PLA (iii) Treated PLA to display a greater tensile energy than untreated PLA, implying that treated PLA has greater flexibility, softness, gentleness and smoothness than the untreated PL...|$|E

The effluent was characterized {{in terms of}} its organic and inorganic pollutant loading and amenability to biodegradation. The major pollution indicator parameters were the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total dissolved solids (TDS), suspended solids (SS), colour and heavy metals levels. The effluent was highly turbid and coloured with average organic and inorganic loadings of 1766 kg COD. day- 1 and 964 kg TDS. day- 1 respectively. Overall mean COD, TDS and SS levels of the effluent were 5849 mgl- 1, 3193 mgl- 1 and 521 mgl- 1 respectively. Cu, Fe and Cr (VI) levels were less than 4 mgL- 1. Analysis of the BOD curves revealed an initial lag in microbial activity of between 1 - 2 days indicating the presence of non-persistent toxic substances that affect microbial activity. After the initial lag an average BOD rate constant (KL) value of 0. 55 day- 1 was obtained, which was above the acceptable sewer discharge limit of 0. 17 day- 1. BOD 5 :COD ratios ranged from 0. 2 - 0. 5 indicating that the effluent contained a large proportion of non-biodegradable organic matter. The COD and TDS levels were above the generally accepted levels for discharge into municipality sewers. Even though the concentrations of these pollutants were not far above accepted limits, high pollutant mass loadings were obtained due to high discharge volumes. Based on its overall characteristics, the effluent was considered not to be suitable for discharge into municipality sewers without pretreatment. Thus, a pre-treatment step involving coagulation and flocculation coupled with carbon adsorption was recommended...|$|E
40|$|MastersPurpose: The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the effect of {{different}} polishing systems on color stability and surface roughness of different Nano-filled resin composite compared to one microhybrid resin composite restorations and to correlate between both characteristics. Materials and Methods: The resin composites tested were Filtek Supreme XT (nanofilled), Tetric EvoCeram (nanohybrid), and Z 250 (microhybrid). A total of 45 discs (2 x 10 mm) were fabricated (15 specimens from each tested resin composite). Top & bottom surfaces of each disc were subjected to <b>wet</b> <b>finishing</b> using 600 -grit silicon carbide abrasive paper. Top surface only was polished with one of the three systems tested (n= 5) : PoGo, Astropol, and Hi-shine according to the manufacturers’ instructions, while the bottom surfaces served as a control. After storage in distilled water, the average roughness (Ra, μm) of the specimens were measured using (Surtronic 10 Tylor Hobson) profilometer. Color measurements were recorded using Color Eye 7000 A Spectrophotometer for baseline. The specimens were immersed in a mixture of an equal amount of staining solutions: coffee, green tea and berry juice, and then were incubated in the dark at 37 ° for three weeks. Color measurements were recorded again after staining. Analysis of Variance and Tukey multiple comparison tests were used for statistical analysis (p< 0. 05). Correlation between surface roughness and color stability were estimated by Spearman & Pearson correlation tests. Results: The polishing systems improved the color stability of Filtek Supreme XT and Z 250 significantly at P= 0. 000. However, they had no statistical significant effect on Tetric EvoCeram. Filtek Supreme XT showed a statistically significant color change among the resin composites used at (P= 0. 000), while it showed the smoothest surfaces after polishing (P=. 000). When the effect of polishing on color stability and surface roughness were compared for Filtek Supreme XT, Hi-Shine produced significantly the roughest surfaces at P= 0. 054 with the lowest color change (P=. 005). Meanwhile, PoGo produced significantly the smoothest surfaces (P= 0. 054) and with high color change. For Z 250, Hi-Shine recorded significantly the highest color change (P=. 001), while no significant difference in surface roughness was recorded between the polishing systems. Tetric EvoCeram recorded no significant differences in color change or surface roughness among the polishing systems tested. Negative correlation between color stability and surface roughness was recorded for Filtek Supreme XT, while no correlation was detected with Z 250 nor Tetric EvoCeram. Conclusions: Color stability and surface roughness depend mainly on the material composition and secondly on the polishing procedure. Polishing procedure is an important step for better color resistance of composite resin materials. Polished resin composites behaved differently in their ability to resist staining. Nano-composite materials did not record better color stability or surface roughness over microhybrid materials...|$|E
