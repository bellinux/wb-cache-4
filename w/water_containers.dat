5|$|Following the hurricane, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement {{launched}} an emergency appeal for Cuba. The appeal raised $217,498 (1999 CHF) to supply hygiene items, household goods, water purification tablets, and <b>water</b> <b>containers</b> to the 12,000 living in temporary shelters. The appeal asked for repair supplies {{and to improve}} the response capacity of the national society for future disasters. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized over 4,500 volunteers to the affected areas to provide first aid to injured, distribute meals and medical supplies, and collaborate with blood banks. The government-controlled media broadcast system guaranteed repair items, though many people remained in damaged houses {{in the weeks after}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|The World Food Program {{immediately}} placed 5,500Jamaicans on {{complementary food}} assistance, a daily ration of 1900kJ (450kcal) of High Energy Biscuits, for two weeks. On August 22, {{three days after}} the hurricane struck the island, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) sent US$398,000 of emergency supplies to Jamaica's Norman Manley International Airport. These supplies included mattresses, blankets, plastic sheeting, hygiene kits and <b>water</b> <b>containers.</b> The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) provided a US$200,000 grant to support the relief effort. The Chinese Red Cross, despite dealing with Typhoon Sepat, sent US$30,000 to its Jamaican counterpart for the purchase of emergency relief supplies.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of Hurricane Beta, the U.S. {{ambassador}} to Nicaragua signed a disaster declaration on October28, prompting the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to send aid. Before the storm hit, $200,000 {{was sent to}} the country for emergency relief supply distribution and helicopter fuel. On November1, USAID and OFDA airlifted 200 rolls of plastic sheeting, 5,020 ten-litre <b>water</b> <b>containers,</b> and 2,736 hygiene kits, valued at $120,877. Another $22,000 was used to supply an aircraft and Bell 204/205 helicopter to assist affected areas. On November10, another $100,000 was sent for sanitation and health activities. The United Nations sent $10,000 to the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region to cover emergency needs. Forty-five tents were sent to communities in need. The Spanish Government also sent $377,188 in aid and to Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to {{radiation}} {{sources such as}} high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to {{the immune system and}} changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, nearly the entire body would be traversed by high energy nuclei, each of which can cause ionization damage to cells. Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the shielding provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further diminished by <b>water</b> <b>containers</b> and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research will be needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 2002, President Bush {{extended}} the disaster declaration {{to include the}} Northern Mariana Islands, which allocated emergency disaster aid for the territory. The declaration provided funding for 75% of the budget for debris removal and emergency protective measures. Immediately following the typhoon, FEMA assigned various federal agencies {{to respond to the}} island of Rota. Officials airlifted about 3,600kg (8,000lbs) of emergency supplies including tents, tarps, <b>water</b> <b>containers,</b> coolers, cooking kits and electrical equipment. Military personnel were transported to assist in recovery efforts. By four months after the typhoon, 749individuals on the island registered through FEMA's teleregistration number. The United States Small Business Administration approved 147low– interest loans for $9.1million (2003USD, $ USD) to individuals and businesses and for economic injury on Rota. In all, disaster aid to Rota totaled $17.4million (2003USD, $. Additionally, President Bush authorized disaster assistance for the Federated States of Micronesia.|$|E

5|$|While Marco {{was still}} {{spinning}} {{in the western}} Caribbean, the Government of Honduras allotted 70million HNL ($5.6million 1996USD) in emergency assistance. Following the storm, several countries contributed cash toward the recovery of Honduras, including: Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States; cash donations collectively totaled slightly more than $438,000. In addition, the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs contributed an emergency grant, worth $10,000. Japan donated 40tents, 10water purifiers, 480soaps, and 3emergency health kits in lieu of money. Norway donated almost $71,000 worth of food, medicines, and clothing. Spain also contributed medicine and transportation, costing $156,250. The United States donated plastic sheeting, <b>water</b> <b>containers,</b> and family food bags. The primary contributor of non-government aid was the Red Cross. After the storm, the Red Cross set up temporary shelters in San Pedro Sula, Puerto Cortés, and El Progreso. Additionally, they distributed 3,000pounds of milk, clothing, 500sheets, chlorine boxes, 14,000pounds of rice, 15,000pounds of beans and 9,000pounds of maize, sugar, and butter.|$|E
5|$|Several nations aided {{the devastated}} archipelago. Australia {{provided}} $82,000, the United States of America donated $25,000, West Germany contributed nearly $40,000, Japan donated $33,834, Canada provided $41,320in relief, Denmark contributed $146,198, and Norway added $30,303. In addition to revenue, the Department of Social Welfare and Development provided over 3 million bottles of antibiotics. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs awarded a $25,000emergency cash grant {{for the purchase}} of medicines, canned food, and clothing to the country. The United Nations Development Programme granted $50,000worth of medicines, canned food, clothing, blankets, and cooking utensils. In addition, the UNICEF acquired $55,000 worth of medicine to the island chain. The United States federal government donated 13,000packages of relief goods. The League of Red Cross Societies donated 4,000bags of rice, 2,500containers of milk (combined worth $158,000), as well as more than $250,000in onetary contributions. Italy airlifted 3,000blanket, 30tents, and 10,000plastic folding <b>water</b> <b>containers.</b> The Catholic Relief Services donated $20,000 while the Church World Service contributed $15,000in cash for blankets. The Red Cross USSR gave $83,333 in medicine.|$|E
5|$|Jamaica, {{which was}} {{forecast}} {{to bear the}} brunt of Hurricane Dean, underwent the most extensive preparations. The Jamaican government executed long-standing evacuation plans, including converting the country's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons. Political parties in the island suspended their campaigning for the August 27 national elections, to allow residents to prepare for the storm. Curfews were put in place for parts of the island, while off-duty essential personnel were called back to work. More than 1,000 schools and churches were converted to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival. Evidently the country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4 emergency health kits and 1,000 <b>water</b> <b>containers</b> and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stocks in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed. The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team tried to reach Jamaica, but only one member arrived before all incoming flights were canceled. The United States confirmed that it would offer aid if it was needed, and the North-West Caribbean Donor Group met to decide what actions would need to be taken.|$|E

Hunter-gatherers in the Kalahari use ostrich eggshells as <b>water</b> <b>containers,</b> punching a hole in them. They also produce jewelry from it. The presence of such eggshells with engraved hatched symbols dating from the Howiesons Poort period of the Middle Stone Age at Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa suggests common ostriches were an important part of human life as early as 60,000 BP.|$|E
25|$|The {{most serious}} impact was, perhaps not surprisingly, {{on the state}} of public health in the territory. The large numbers of <b>water</b> <b>containers</b> {{standing}} open across Gibraltar provided an ideal breeding habitat for mosquitoes.

25|$|Pottery {{is a very}} {{traditional}} craft and is practices {{in many of the}} communities of the state, although most of the wares produced are basic and meant for local consumption. These items include cooking pots, <b>water</b> <b>containers,</b> pitchers, candle holders and some sculptured decorative items. Most of these items have been made the same way since the pre-Hispanic period. The best quality ware is considered {{to be made in the}} central valleys in municipalities such as Zacualpan, Nuitzalapa, Atzacualoya, and others. Some areas have become specialized for certain types of pieces. The San Juan neighborhood of Chilapa make figures of a cerarmic which is glassy after firing. Acatlán makes ceramic toys, and Ometepec specializes in the making of very large cántaro jars, traditionally used for storage.|$|E
25|$|However, some of {{the species}} of {{mosquitoes}} that are adapted to breeding in phytotelmata are dangerous disease vectors. In nature, they might occupy anything from a hollow tree trunk to a cupped leaf. Such species typically take readily to breeding in artificial <b>water</b> <b>containers.</b> Such casual puddles are important breeding places for {{some of the}} most serious disease vectors, such as species of Aedes that transmit dengue and yellow fever. Some with such breeding habits are disproportionately important vectors because they are well-placed to pick up pathogens from humans and pass them on. In contrast, no matter how voracious, mosquitoes that breed and feed mainly in remote wetlands and salt marshes may well remain uninfected, and if they do happen to become infected with a relevant pathogen, might seldom encounter humans to infect, in turn.|$|E
25|$|In any case, an {{efficient}} surveillance {{is essential to}} monitor the presence of tiger mosquitoes {{and the effect of}} control programs. Ovitraps are normally used for the monitoring of Ae. albopictus. They are black <b>water</b> <b>containers</b> with floating Styrofoam blocks or small wooden paddles that are in contact with the surface of the water. Female tiger mosquitoes lay their eggs on these surfaces. Through the identification of these eggs or of the larvae that hatch from these eggs in the laboratory, the presence and abundance of mosquito species can be estimated. Versions of these traps with an adhesive film (sticky traps) that catch the egg-depositing mosquitoes make the analysis much easier and quicker, but are more complicated in terms of handling. The results of ovitraps are often variable and depend on the availability of alternative egg-depositing waters. Due to this, it is best to use them in large numbers and in conjunction with other monitoring methods.|$|E
