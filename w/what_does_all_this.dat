We cannot continue to suffer, we cannot keep counting our dead... We cannot keep searching for peace... They are firing on anything that moves. They are firing on soldiers, they're firing on civilians, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> mean?" [...] He claimed that while Nampala had no strategic importance, it was [...] "close to the different routes and paths that take drugs across the Sahara-Sahel strip". This was a reiteration of the government contention that elements of the rebels were motivated not by political motives, but by their supposed involvement in the lucrative Saharan smuggling trade.|$|E

60|$|After {{the third}} shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I {{began to take}} courage; and yet I had not heart enough to go over my wall again, {{for fear of being}} buried alive, but sat still upon the ground greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing <b>what</b> to <b>do.</b> <b>All</b> <b>this</b> while I had not the least serious {{religious}} thought; nothing but the common “Lord have mercy upon me!” and when it was over that went away too.|$|R
6000|$|All {{the people}} of the village were at the fountain, {{standing}} about in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of {{the people of}} the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> portend, and <b>what</b> portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle (double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of the German ballad of Leonora? ...|$|R

40|$|As South Sudan {{prepares to}} mark its {{first anniversary of}} independence, hopes for {{accelerated}} progress in human development {{have given way to}} resignation. Military tensions over disputed border areas have reignited fears of renewed conflict with the Republic of Sudan. Conflicts within South Sudan continue to cause large-scale displacement.

40|$|I {{found your}} letter, which was printed in issue five of >i>Novyi mir>/i>, quite perplexing. And I {{am not the}} only one. Many of my acquaintances ask me: "Did you read it? What is it all about?" I was not {{immediately}} able to say just {{what it was in}} your letter that bothered me. After <b>all,</b> you <b>did</b> not provide material for scholarly discussion by economists. Nor did you cite facts or arguments. The only thing that could be considered an argument was your brief statement about the failure of the social democratic, "third road" in capitalist countries.

60|$|<b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> mean? It {{means that}} the {{activity}} of the lower psyche and lower body is polarized by the upper body.

If we examine the apparent extroverts, like the flaunting Italian, we shall see the same thing. It is his own sex which obsesses him.|$|E

Was it not plain that his usual course of life had lost its attraction for him, when the object of his infatuation had ceased to exist?
