25|$|This would {{reconcile}} the contradiction between our {{belief in the}} certainty of abstract deductions and the empiricist principle that knowledge comes from observation of individual instances.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the tests of the weak equivalence principle, the Einstein equivalence principle can be tested by searching for variation of dimensionless constants and mass ratios.

25|$|In {{a larger}} sense, the theory {{suggests}} that the entire universe {{can be seen as}} two-dimensional information on the cosmological horizon, the event horizon from which information may still be gathered and not lost due to the natural limitations of spacetime supporting a black hole, an observer and a given setting of these specific elements, such that the three dimensions <b>we</b> <b>observe</b> are an effective description only at macroscopic scales and at low energies.

25|$|And the Earth is not {{the only}} one that changed - the {{luminosity}} of the sun has increased over time. Because rocks record a history of relatively constant temperatures since Earth’s beginnings, there must have been more greenhouse gasses to keep the temperatures up in the Archean when the sun was younger and fainter. All these major differences in the environment of the Earth placed very different constraints on the evolution of life throughout our planet’s history. Moreover, more subtle changes in the habitat of life are always occurring, shaping the organisms and traces that <b>we</b> <b>observe</b> today and in the rock record.|$|E
25|$|It is also entirely {{possible}} that homochirality is simply {{a result of the}} natural autoamplification process of life —that either the formation of life as preferring one chirality or the other was a chance rare event which happened to occur with the chiralities <b>we</b> <b>observe,</b> or that all chiralities of life emerged rapidly but due to catastrophic events and strong competition, the other unobserved chiral preferences were wiped out by the preponderance and metabolic, enantiomeric enrichment from the 'winning' chirality choices. The emergence of chirality consensus as a natural autoamplification process has been associated with the 2nd law of thermodynamics.|$|E
