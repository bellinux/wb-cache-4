5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where two seemingly different physical systems {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some <b>way</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right <b>way</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E
5|$|Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. {{was born}} in Washington, D.C., on August 27, 1915, to Minna Bauer Ramsey, an {{instructor}} at the University of Kansas, and Norman Foster Ramsey, a 1905 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and {{an officer in the}} Ordnance Department who rose to the rank of brigadier general during World War II, commanding the Rock Island Arsenal. He was raised as an Army brat, frequently moving from post to post, and lived in France for a time when his father was Liaison Officer with the Direction d'Artillerie and Assistant Military Attaché. This allowed him to skip a couple of grades along the <b>way,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he graduated from Leavenworth High School in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, at the age of 15.|$|E

25|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, {{commissioned}} at {{the time}} of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification of England, whereas Asser's The Life of King Alfred promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities.

25|$|The {{adjustment}} {{would therefore}} rationalise any {{search for the}} city in search engines, since Foz do Iguaçu's claim to fame worldwide is due almost entirely to the falls, which are known as the Iguassu Falls. Djalma Pastorello felt that tourism {{to the city of}} Foz do Iguaçu would be improved greatly by a clarification of its association with the now-famous Iguassu Falls. However, he estimates that 70% of the city's population were against the name change because the local media anticipated the change and presented it in a distorted <b>way,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> locals were unable to see that the intention was to benefit the population.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where two seemingly different physical systems {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. Two theories related by a duality need not be string theories. For example, Montonen–Olive duality is example of an S-duality relationship between quantum field theories. The AdS/CFT correspondence is example of a duality which relates string theory to a quantum field theory. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some <b>way</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.|$|E
25|$|This {{allowed for}} {{representative}} suits {{in situations where}} {{there were too many}} individual parties (which now forms the first requirement for class action litigation, numerosity). However, this rule did not allow such suits to bind similarly situated absent parties, which rendered the rule ineffective. Within ten years, the Supreme Court interpreted Rule 48 in such a <b>way</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it could apply to absent parties under certain circumstances, but only by ignoring the plain meaning of the rule. In the rules published in 1912, Equity Rule 48 was replaced with Equity Rule 38 as part of a major restructuring of the Equity Rules, and when federal courts merged their legal and equitable procedural systems in 1938, Equity Rule 38 became Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.|$|E

25|$|In August 2005, elderly Daisy Fuller {{is on her}} deathbed in a New Orleans {{hospital}} as Hurricane Katrina approaches. She starts rambling to her daughter, Caroline, about a train station built in 1918 and Mr. Gateau, the best clockmaker {{in all of the}} South, who was hired to make a clock for it. Mr. Gateau was blind, and lost his son in World War I, which crushed him, but he continued to labor over his clock. When it was unveiled at the station, the public was surprised to see that the clock ran backwards, to which Mr. Gateau says he made it that <b>way</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the boys they lost in the war could come back again and live their lives that were ended too soon. After that, Mr. Gateau was never seen again, and people speculated he died of a broken heart or went out to sea.|$|E
25|$|In November 1840 Rose was sent, {{as one of}} a {{group of}} British {{military}} advisers, to Syria with the local rank of colonel to assist General Omar Pasha, commander of the Ottoman Army, who was seeking to secure the expulsion of the forces of Mehemet Ali from Syria during the Egyptian–Ottoman War. Rose served as deputy adjutant-general on Pasha's staff at the Battle of El Mesden in January 1841 and then became senior British officer on Pasha's staff later that year. He became British consul-general for Syria and Lebanon in August 1841 and found himself preventing feuds between the Maronites and Druzes. On one occasion in 1841, he rode between them at imminent risk to his life and by the sheer force of a stronger will stopped the conflict. On another occasion he rescued 700 American missionaries from Mount Lebanon and took them to Beirut walking himself all the <b>way</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> his horse could be available to old women. He transferred to the diplomatic service in January 1848 and Lord Palmerston appointed him secretary of the embassy at Constantinople in January 1851. He became chargé d'affaires in the absence of Sir Stratford Canning during a diplomatic crisis over Russian demands that they be allowed to give protection over all Christians in Turkey. He so strengthened the hands of the Ottoman Porte that the Russian attempt to force a secret treaty upon Turkey was foiled. He was promoted to brevet colonel on 11 November 1851.|$|E
25|$|On Flight Day 4, Stott and Barratt grappled the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) {{using the}} Canadarm2 and removed {{it from the}} {{starboard}} sill of Discovery's payload bay. Once it was grappled {{and out of the}} payload bay, the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System grappled the end of the OBSS and took a hand off from the Canadarm2. The OBSS was grappled by the space station arm, because the SRMS could not reach it due to clearance issues, and it needed to be moved out of the <b>way</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) could be removed from the payload bay. After the OBSS hand off, the entire STS-133 crew was joined by ISS Expedition 26 commander Scott Kelly and flight engineer Paolo Nespoli for a series of in-flight media interviews. The interviews were conducted with the Weather Channel, WBZ radio in Boston, Massachusetts, WSB-TV in Atlanta, Georgia, and WBTV in Charlotte, North Carolina. The crew also completed more cargo transfers to and from the ISS. Throughout the day, Drew and Bowen prepared tools that they would use on their spacewalk on Flight Day 5. Later in the day, they were joined by the shuttle crew and ISS commander Kelly and Flight Engineer Nespoli, for a review of the spacewalk procedures. After the review, Bowen and Drew donned oxygen masks and entered the crew lock of the Quest airlock for the standard pre-spacewalk campout. The airlock was lowered to 10.2 psi for the night. This was done to help the spacewalkers purge nitrogen from their blood and help prevent decompression sickness, also known as the bends.|$|E
