25|$|At 11:20 on 22 December 1989, Ceaușescu's {{personal}} pilot, Lt. Col. Vasile Maluțan, received {{instructions from}} Lt. Gen. Opruta {{to proceed to}} Palace Square {{to pick up the}} president. As he flew over Palace Square he saw it was impossible to land there. Maluțan landed his white Dauphin, #203, on the terrace at 11:44. A man brandishing a white net curtain from one of the windows <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> down.|$|E
25|$|He {{finally did}} it on lap 34 and Senna came into the pits for tyres. When he rejoined, the order was Mansell, Prost, Berger, Schumacher, Senna and de Cesaris. Senna was on a charge, passing Schumacher {{immediately}} after his stop. Berger then <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> through {{to see if he}} could attack Prost. Behind them, on lap 45, Piquet passed de Cesaris for sixth. Senna got ahead of Prost on the second chicane with seven laps remaining. Mansell won from Senna, Prost, Berger, Schumacher and Piquet.|$|E
500|$|Ine {{lived with}} her parents on Dejima until Siebold was banished on 22 October 1829 for {{allegedly}} exporting restricted information illicitly gathered from the geographer [...] [...] He was accused of smuggling items including maps which it was believed could {{fall into the hands}} of Japan's enemies, such as Russia, which posed a threat on Japan's northern borders. [...] Taki and the two-year-old Ine were not permitted to leave Japan; they <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> goodbye from a small boat in the harbour as his ship left. [...] Taki soon after married a man named Wasaburō.|$|E
60|$|The skipper <b>waved</b> <b>'im</b> away, {{and then}} 'e {{walked up and}} down the deck like a man in a dream.|$|R
6000|$|BOHUN (<b>waving</b> <b>him</b> down imperiously). No: sit down, sit down. (McComas {{sits down}} sulkily; and Crampton, much relieved, follows his example.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Freddy Galvis runs {{to first}} base and Wally Joyner <b>waves</b> <b>him</b> to go to second base in a Phillies game on September 7, 2013 ...|$|R
500|$|At 14:17 local time, a {{red flag}} was shown to {{indicate}} the race was stopped and FIA race doctor Sid Watkins arrived at the scene to treat Senna. When a race is stopped under {{a red flag}}, cars must slow down and make {{their way back to}} the pit lane or starting grid unless notified of a restart. This protects race marshals and medical staff at the crash scene, and allows easier access for medical cars to the incident. Approximately 10 minutes after Senna's crash, the Larrousse team mistakenly allowed one of their drivers, Érik Comas, to leave the pits despite the circuit being closed under red flags. Marshals frantically <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> down as he approached the scene of the accident travelling at [...] "pretty much full speed". Eurosport commentator John Watson described the incident as [...] "the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen at any time in my life". Comas avoided hitting any of the people or cars that were on the circuit but after going over towards Senna's accident scene, he was so distressed at what he saw that he withdrew from the race.|$|E
2500|$|According to Plutarch, as Caesar {{arrived at}} the Senate, Tillius Cimber {{presented}} him with a petition to recall his exiled brother. The other conspirators crowded round to offer support. Both Plutarch and Suetonius say that Caesar <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> away, but Cimber grabbed his shoulders and pulled down Caesar's tunic. Caesar then cried to Cimber, [...] "Why, this is violence!" [...] ("Ista quidem vis est!").|$|E
2500|$|Without hesitation, Mynarski {{made his}} way through the flames to Brophy's assistance. All his efforts were in vain, {{initially}} using a fire axe to try to pry open the doors before finally resorting to beating at the turret with his hands. With Mynarski's flight suit and parachute on fire, Brophy eventually <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> away. Mynarski crawled back through the hydraulic fire, returned to the rear door where he paused and saluted. He then reputedly said [...] "Good night, sir," [...] his familiar nightly sign-off to his friend, and jumped.|$|E
6000|$|The obsequious Mr Pecksniff proffered his arm. The old {{man took}} it. Turning at the door, {{he said to}} Martin, <b>waving</b> <b>him</b> off with his hand, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, not at all," [...] Martin answered, {{shaking hands}} and <b>waving</b> <b>him</b> to the solitary chair, himself {{taking to the}} bed. [...] "But {{how did you know}} where I lived?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{she went}} on, <b>waving</b> <b>him</b> back, [...] "now I know why I {{would not give}} in {{to you when you}} wanted me to be Stroke's wife. I was afraid you were masterful!" ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> peremptorily, almost contemptuously, into silence.|$|E
60|$|The lawyer {{would have}} {{answered}} her, but Dominey <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> aside.|$|E
60|$|The {{potential}} waiter <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> away, and turned, gravely, to me.|$|E
60|$|He had {{an early}} breakfast, Roger eating with him, {{and then the}} buggy, driven by Horsehair, was brought around and he got in, and a minute later he was off, the senator's son <b>waving</b> <b>him</b> an adieu from {{the porch of the}} school.|$|R
6000|$|... "May be so, sir, may be so," [...] {{returned}} the other, taking Tom upon {{his knee and}} <b>waving</b> <b>him</b> off impatiently. [...] "I don't want to argue with ladies and gentlemen. I have had enough of arguing to last one man his life." ...|$|R
60|$|The merchants {{had been}} {{examined}} {{and allowed to}} pass through the dark gate, the entrance through the wall into the City. They and their silent animals had already disappeared inside. The leader of the group of soldiers was beckoning impatiently to Erick, <b>waving</b> <b>him</b> on.|$|R
60|$|George <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> away. This {{interruption}} at such {{a moment}} was annoying.|$|E
60|$|Monmouth wearily <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> to a seat; but Grey disregarded the command.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Fentolin {{waited until}} he had finished. Then he <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> away.|$|E
60|$|After several weeks, what he {{had been}} waiting for happened. He met Ruth on the street. It was true, she was {{accompanied}} by her brother, Norman, and it was true that they tried to ignore him and that Norman attempted to <b>wave</b> <b>him</b> aside.|$|R
6000|$|Facing <b>him,</b> <b>waving</b> <b>him</b> away, she {{had taken}} another upward step; but he sprang {{to the side of}} the stairs and brought his hand, above the banister, down hard on her wrist. [...] "Do you mean to tell me that I must marry a woman I hate?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next person}} is--but hark! the bell for shore is ringing, and, shaking Snook's hand cordially, we rush {{on to the}} pier, <b>waving</b> <b>him</b> a {{farewell}} as the noble black ship cuts keenly through the sunny azure waters, bearing away that cargo of Snobs outward bound.|$|R
60|$|He {{stepped out}} {{with both feet}} on the sand, and Opee-Kwan <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> back.|$|E
60|$|Jack {{attempted}} to follow her, and look in. She <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> {{back with her}} hand.|$|E
60|$|He was on {{his feet}} in an instant, all solicitude. But she <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> wearily back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe, George," [...] she replied, <b>waving</b> <b>him</b> back, [...] "but you've got to {{stay down}} here. If the man I am going to see thought I was frightened of him I wouldn't have a chance. If I am not down {{in half an hour}} you can try number 18C." ...|$|R
60|$|Would we walk {{a little}} way with him? No, I faltered; we would not. We would follow him with the opera-glasses and <b>wave</b> <b>him</b> {{farewell}} {{when he reached the}} Kulm. He shook our hands unwillingly, and turned up the little path, looking handsomer than ever. It led ascending through a fir-wood to the rock-strewn hillside.|$|R
50|$|Jerry is {{thankful for}} the {{woodpecker}}'s help, but the mother woodpecker then flies into the scene and the baby woodpecker realizes who his mother is after all. The two fly away, much to Jerry's disappointment, but the baby woodpecker flies back to Jerry and kisses him lovingly before flying away again, as Jerry <b>waves</b> <b>him</b> off happily.|$|R
60|$|She {{rose to her}} feet. He {{approached}} her a little hesitatingly, but she <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> back.|$|E
60|$|Van Teyl <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> away, {{accepted}} his farewell salutation, {{and waited until}} the door was closed.|$|E
60|$|She <b>waved</b> <b>him</b> aside with an {{impatient}} gesture. He {{could see the}} frown gathering upon her face.|$|E
50|$|He drowned age 33 at Brunlanes, when a <b>wave</b> struck <b>him</b> while fishing.|$|R
50|$|In the 1987 parodic {{science fiction}} film Spaceballs, {{directed}} by Mel Brooks, all subordinates of Supreme leader President Skroob salute him by first bending their forearms over their opposed hands {{as though they}} are about to give him the arm of honor salute, but at the last moment, use their raised hands to <b>wave</b> <b>him</b> good bye, rather than showing him the middle finger.|$|R
60|$|They both turned involuntarily. A slender {{girl with}} {{light brown hair}} was {{standing}} there, <b>waving</b> at <b>him.</b>|$|R
