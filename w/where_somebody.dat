He noted his love of the experience, as it permitted him to grow closer with the series' actors and [...] "actually work with them on a level that [...] before and really get down there with them." [...] Wyman was originally supposed to direct several episodes the previous year and earlier in the season, but found he was too busy. He explained, [...] "Then an episode was coming up that we were thinking about writing and I really felt close to it. [...] The opportunity came up <b>where</b> <b>somebody</b> had fallen out and I felt {{that this is the}} perfect time because everything was completely under control.

[...] The sketch also noted the series' tendency to have [...] "relationship-y episodes <b>where</b> <b>somebody's</b> gran's dying, that they use to pad out {{the middle of the}} series when they run out of money for special effects", referring to [...] "that psychic girl with the crayons" [...] as a [...] "rubbish" [...] example.|$|R
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "North Hollywood" [...] is an affectionate ode to Hunt's {{community}} at the time. Its lyrics portray the district as the [...] "crown jewel of saboteurs" [...] and reference its population of misfits and low-lifes, including evicting landlords and conniving starlets. The song features abrasive funk, distorted guitar, {{and a heavy}} beat. [...] "Watching You Go Crazy Is Driving Me Insane" [...] features a melodic punk and garage rock style, with dark humor in its lyrics. It is about a couple whose financial difficulties affect their relationship. [...] "Designer Jeans" [...] features lyrics with psychedlic musings on the contemporary social climate, including criticism of [...] "mass production and consumption of opinions" [...] and the erasure of independent thought. [...] "Plum" [...] is an ode to a lover's posterior. [...] "Falls (Violet)" [...] is a ballad with a sketchy country music feel. Its narrator expresses support to a woman he is infatuated with as she dates someone else. [...] "Moving Targets" [...] is a bedroom ballad with sparse, 1980s-styled percussion and an Isley Brothers influence. Its lyrics use warfare imagery in detailing a romance. [...] "Eyes Like Pearls" [...] features hard rock guitar and earnest, romantic lyrics, which Hunt explained to The Huffington Post: [...] "It's a very passionate love, one that's rarely known in one's life. They're obviously tears of joy, but it's a passion beyond anything I've ever known. It's a relationship <b>where</b> <b>somebody</b> understands me and who I understand." ...|$|E
500|$|Attempts {{are governed}} by the Criminal Attempts Act 1981, which states that [...] "if, with intent to commit an offence to which , a person does an act {{which is more than}} merely preparatory to the {{commission}} of the offence, he is guilty of attempting to commit the offence". A required element is intent, or mens rea. In R v Pearman, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales confirmed that the definition of intent in the 1981 Act {{is the same as the}} definition in the common law. The common law gives intention [...] "its normal meaning: purpose or aim", with judges advised not to, in the majority of cases, attempt to complicate the definition. Conditional intent [...] <b>where</b> <b>somebody</b> has an intent to commit a crime only in certain circumstances [...] has also been deemed acceptable for an indictment for attempting a crime. In Attorney-General's Reference (Nos. 1 and 2 of 1979), the Court of Appeal explained that the intention to steal [...] "anything that was worth stealing could form the basis of an attempt charge if the indictment was drafted carefully". This was a procedural solution to a previous apparent contradiction, but the suggested drafting may not demonstrate sufficient proximity between the defendant's actions and what he was planning to steal. A mens rea requirement is added to the attempt of crimes of strict liability (where there is no intent or merely objective recklessness), although the ruling in Attorney General's Reference (No. 3 of 1992) makes this less certain.|$|E

2500|$|Whether or {{not someone}} is a {{fiduciary}} {{depends on their}} position. Trustees, company directors, agents and business partners are all fiduciaries, as in Yugraneft v Abramovich, but other positions may be recognised by the court if the misuse of powers in a particular circumstance renders them so, as in Reid. In Brink's Ltd v Abu-Saleh (No. 3), a security guard who was bribed to give information on a company's security systems, allowing a gang of armed robbers to burgle their warehouse, {{was found to be}} in a fiduciary position. While a security guard would not normally be a fiduciary due to not holding a senior enough role, in relation to security arrangements the guard would be found to be acting in a fiduciary capacity. Bribes may also be synonymous with [...] "secret commissions", <b>where</b> <b>somebody</b> is given an undisclosed [...] "kickback".|$|E
2500|$|Where acts lead {{to profit}} and are illegal, under either English {{criminal}} law or an established legal principle, equity puts any property acquired through these acts into a constructive trust. The {{most common type}} of trust here is one resulting from bribery; <b>where</b> <b>somebody</b> in a fiduciary office makes unlawful profit, that money will be held on constructive trust for the beneficiaries of his office. In Attorney General for Hong Kong v Reid, the Director of Public Prosecutions in Hong Kong accepted bribes to not prosecute certain people. The court held that this was a violation of fiduciary duty, and put the money on constructive trust. An issue with this principle is that the position of Director of Public Prosecutions is not normally understood to be a fiduciary one. Rather, the courts are using fiduciary duties as a method of punishing the defendant; Alastair Hudson writes that they are [...] "as concerned to punish the wrongdoer as to protect rights in property".|$|E
2500|$|On 16 April 2012, the {{day after}} the 100th anniversary of the sinking, photos were {{released}} showing possible human remains resting on the ocean floor.

The wreck of the Titanic falls under the scope of the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This means that all states party to the convention will prohibit the pillaging, commercial exploitation, sale and dispersion of the wreck and its artefacts. Because of the location of the wreck in international waters and the lack of any exclusive jurisdiction over the wreckage area, the convention provides a state co-operation system, by which states inform each other of any potential activity concerning ancient shipwreck sites, like the Titanic, and co-operate to prevent unscientific or unethical interventions.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user {{messages}} for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. [...] "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA {{also referred to as}} the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," [...] the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. [...] It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open. [...] This is becoming a bigger issue now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago. [...] In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and {{it is important to consider}} that when interacting online. [...] New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. [...] What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances. [...] Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations <b>where</b> <b>somebody</b> else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics. [...] No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.|$|E

However, in that same survey, women listed numerous things they feared. A man stated [...] "as a man, I'm afraid of very little."
