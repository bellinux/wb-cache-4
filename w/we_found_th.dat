We determined that T cells from mice deficient in the TH 17 pathway genes ROR-γ and IL- 23 R produced abundant IL- 9, and observed significant growth inhibition of B 16 F 10 melanoma tumor in these mice. IL- 9 blocking antibodies reversed this tumor growth inhibition, and enhanced tumor growth in normal mice. IL 9 R−/ − mice showed accelerated tumor growth, while administration of rIL- 9 to tumor bearing mice inhibited tumor growth. Adoptive transfer of tumor antigen-specific TH 9 cells blocked tumor growth; this was reversed by anti-IL- 9. Exogenous rIL- 9 inhibited tumor growth in Rag 1 −/ − mice, {{but not in}} mast cell deficient mice, suggesting a T cell independent process.

The physical processes involved in sediment deposition by a stiff grass buffer (hedge) at a low, subcritical, flow rate were therefore examined. Flow experiments were {{carried out in the}} Griffith University Tilting-Flume Simulated Rainfall facility using a 0. 3 m width, vetiver hedge (Vetiveria zizaniodes L., sterile cultivar Monto) at 5 % slope. Sediments comprising a sandy soil (Podzol) and red clay (Ferralsol) were introduced into the flow upstream of the buffer and the resultant hydrology, sediment deposition and outflow characteristics were measured. Flow retardation produced a backwater upstream of the vetiver hedge and sediment deposition varied with soil type in this backwater. The backwater region was greatly extended by the deposition process, increasing overall sediment trapping efficiency. Buffering action reduced mean sediment loads in the outflow to 3. 2 % and 6. 0 % of the inflow concentration for the Podzol and Ferralsol, respectively, with a significant difference (P< 0. 01) between the soils.

40|$|Background Functional {{constipation}} {{is often}} a consequence of habitual bowel elimination while sitting on common toilet seats. A considerable {{proportion of the population}} with n ormal bowel movement frequency has difficulty emptying their bowels. The principal cause of this problem may be the obstructive nature of the rectoanal angle and its relationship to the posture normally used in defecation. Objective To assess the relationship between functional constipation with the posture (sitting vs squatting) during defecation in children. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in November 2010. Participants aged 12 - 15 years were selected consecutively from a junior high school in Medan. Parents and children filled questionnaires and were interviewed. Functional constipation was assessed based on the Rome III criteria. Results Sixty-five students enrolled in the study. There was no statistically significant diffe rences in subjects' characteristics. T here was a significant correlation between functional constipation with posture during defecation in children (RR= 0. 06, 95 %CI 0. 02 to 0. 25; P= 0. 0001). Functional constipation was more likely occured in children with sitting (12 / 20) th an squatting posture (4 / 45) during defecation.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was {{investigating}} how women with a history of childhood maltreatment (CM) process non-threatening and non-trauma related olfactory stimuli. The focus on olfactory perception is based on the overlap of brain areas often proposed to be affected in CM patients and the projection areas of the olfactory system, including the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, insula and hippocampus. Methods: Twelve women with CM and 10 controls participated in the study. All participants were, or have been, patients in a psychosomatic clinic. Participants underwent a fMRI investigation during olfactory stimulation with a neutral (coffee) and a pleasant (peach) odor. Furthermore, odor threshold and odor identification (Sniffin ’ Sticks) were tested. Principal Findings: Both groups showed normal activation in the olfactory projection areas. However, in the CM-group we found additionally enhanced activation in multiple, mainly neocortical, areas that are part of those involved in associative networks. These include the precentral frontal lobe, inferior and middle frontal structures, posterior parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and the posterior cingulate cortex. Conclusions: The results indicate that in this group of patients, CM was associated with an altered processing of olfactory stimuli, but not development of a functional olfactory deficit.

Second, to evaluate the relationships between values produced by both software packages. Materials & Methods: Tc- 99 m MIBI gated myocardial perfusion SPECT were performed for 77 patients (mean age: 49. 6 ± 13. 7 y, n= 37 (M), 40 (F)) with a low likelihood ( 0. 05). In 4 DM, the mean EDV, ESV and EF for all patients were 89. 1 ± 26. 4 ml, 29. 1 ± 12. 8 ml and 68. 5 ± 6. 7 % at stress test. Most cases in 4 DM, {{there was no significant}} difference statistically between stress and rest test (p> 0. 05). But statistically significant difference was found in EF (68. 5 ± 6. 7 % at stress vs 70. 9 ± 8. 0 % at rest, p< 0. 05). Correlation coefficients between the methods for EDV, ESV and EF were comparatively high (0. 95, 0. 93, 0. 71 at stress test and 0. 95, 0. 90, 0. 69 at rest test, respectively).

40|$|In {{allogeneic}} haematopoietic {{stem cell}} transplantation (HSCT), 30 to 40 % of transplant related mortality {{is associated with}} infection complications. This includes invasive bacterial and fungal infection, and interstitial pneumonia (IP), which are two important causes of morbidity and mortality. Incidence, aetiology and risk factors of bacteraemia were studied during the pre-engraftment period after HSCT, as well as mortality and {{cause of death in}} 500 patients. Thirty-three percent of the patients had confirmed bacteraemia. Viridans streptococci and coagulase negative staphylococci accounted for approximately 90 % of all cases. Significant risk factors included prolonged neutropenia (> 1 5 days) and recipients of unrelated grafts. Mortality directly attributable to bacteraemia was low (6 %), except in gram-negative infections (3 / 7). However, the overall 60 -day mortality was significantly higher in patients with positive blood cultures, and invasive fungal infections were more frequent in these patients. Thus, bacteraemia during the aplastic phase after HSCT might be a marker for high mortality risk, possibly due to more pronounced immune deficiency, including mucosal damage. Both heat-killed bacteria and cell-free supernatants from viridans streptococcal isolates were potent stimulators of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL 1 beta IL 8). No evidence of superantigenic activity could be demonstrated in any of the studied strains, but supernatants from strains isolated from patients with severe sepsis seemed to induce higher production of IL 1 beta and IL 8 as compared to those from non-severe sepsis cases. Viridans streptococcal virulence factors may therefore play a role for development of severe sepsis. Respiratory tract viral infections are not uncommon, and associated with high morbidity and mortality in HSCT patients. To date, there is no established therapy for treatment of these infections. We studied systemic administration of ribavirin in patients with RSV, Influenza B and parainfluenza infections. Ribavirin therapy was safe, without unexpected side effects, did not affect engraftment and might reduce morbidity and mortality if given before development of pneumonia. However, mortality associated with interstitial pneumonia (IP) is still high (> 40 %) and the clinical features of this condition are similar regardless of the aetiology. Therefore, we assumed that immunopathogenesis, locally in the lung tissue, might be important for development of IP. Analyses of lung biopsies from HSCT patients with IP showed that the immune response was dominated by activated macrophages and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (II 1, TGFbeta) Furthermore, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>Th</b> 2 -type of immune response, characterised by expression of CD 86 co-stimulatory molecule and SDF- 1 and eotaxin chemokines, and the cytokines IL 4, IL 5, IL 10 and IL 13. There was lower expression of Th 1 CD 80 co-stimulatory molecule and RANTES, MIP- 1 alpha and MIP- 10 chemokines and no production of Th 1 -type of cytokines such as IL 2, IFNgamma. Consistently, we detected local production of immunoglobulins (IgM > IgA > IgG), but no evidence of T cell mediated cytotoxicity. These findings were similar between the patients irrespective of aetiology of IP, indicating that impaired adequate immune response may be a possible explanation for the severity of IP. In conclusion, improvement in prevention and treatment strategies regarding both invasive bacterial and fungal infections, as well as IP after HSCT are critical to further increase survival after HSCT Traditional prophylaxis and therapy with antimicrobial agents is mandatory but have limitations. Thus, further investigation and understanding of pathogen-host interactions, immunopathogenesis of infection and pattern of immune reconstitution is necessary in order to design better intervention procedures...|$|E

Out of these 31 stars have been observed with HARPS at La Silla in Chile and with FIES at the NOT on La Palma. Abundance analysis has been done on 23 stars. From these we can conclude that the two distinct populations of halo stars found by Nissen & Schuster are present in our sample of halo stars. We investigate the differences in these two populations, according to their orbital characteristics and abundances, both for our sample and the Nissen & Schuster sample. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> that <b>th...</b>|$|R

These learning- and equity-focused efforts build on decades of research showing that learning improvements fail to penetrate the majority of schools in a district without substantial central office support for various changes throughout district systems. What do research and experience teach about the dimensions of central office reinvention that seem to matter for expanding student learning? How can central office administrators participate productively in the reinvention process? In pursuing these questions, <b>we</b> quickly <b>found</b> that <b>th...</b>|$|R
40|$|T helper type 17 (Th 17) cells, which {{represent}} a novel subset of CD 4 + T cells, {{play an active}} role in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Recent studies have also suggested that they have an impact on solid tumours. However, the nature of Th 17 cells in haematological malignancies remains unknown. In this study, we investigated Th 17 cell frequency and secretion of related cytokines in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). First, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that <b>Th</b> 17 cell frequencies were increased significantly in peripheral blood samples from untreated patients with AML, compared with those from healthy volunteers. Moreover, increased interleukin (IL) - 17 concentrations accompanied the increased Th 17 cell frequencies in these patients. These results suggest that Th 17 cells {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of AML. Secondly, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that the increased Th 17 cell frequencies were reduced when patients achieved complete remission after chemotherapy, suggesting that measurement of Th 17 cell frequencies may have clinical value in the evaluation of therapeutic effect. In addition, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that IL- 6 and transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 concentrations increased in the untreated patients and that IL- 6 concentrations showed a positive correlation with the frequencies of Th 17 cells, suggesting that IL- 6 may play an important role in Th 17 cell differentiation in patients with AML...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPhenotypic {{plasticity}} of T helper 17 (Th 17) cells suggests {{instability of}} chromatin structure of key genes of this lineage. We identified epigenetic modifications across the clustered Il 17 a and Il 17 f and the Ifng loci {{before and after}} differential IL- 12 or TGF-β cytokine signaling, which induce divergent fates of Th 17 cell precursors. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> that <b>Th</b> 17 cell precursors had substantial remodeling of the Ifng locus, but underwent critical additional modifications to enable high expression when stimulated by IL- 12. Permissive modifications across the Il 17 a-Il 17 f locus were amplified by TGF-β signaling in Th 17 cells, but were rapidly reversed downstream of IL- 12 -induced silencing of the Rorc gene by the transcription factors STAT 4 and T-bet. These findings reveal substantial chromatin instability of key transcription factor and cytokine genes of Th 17 cells and support a model of Th 17 cell lineage plasticity in which cell-extrinsic factors modulate Th 17 cell fates through differential effects on the epigenetic status of Th 17 cell lineage factors...|$|R
40|$|SummarySpecification of the T helper 17 (Th 17) cell lineage {{requires}} a well-defined set of transcription factors, but how these integrate with posttranscriptional and epigenetic programs to regulate gene expression is poorly understood. Here <b>we</b> <b>found</b> defective <b>Th</b> 17 cell cytokine expression in miR- 155 -deficient CD 4 + T cells in vitro and in vivo. Mir 155 was bound by Th 17 cell transcription factors and was highly expressed during Th 17 cell differentiation. miR- 155 -deficient Th 17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells expressed increased amounts of Jarid 2, a DNA-binding protein that recruits the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC 2) to chromatin. PRC 2 binding to chromatin and H 3 K 27 histone methylation was increased in miR- 155 -deficient cells, coinciding with failure to express Il 22, Il 10, Il 9, and Atf 3. Defects in Th 17 cell cytokine expression and Treg cell homeostasis {{in the absence}} of Mir 155 could be partially suppressed by Jarid 2 deletion. Thus, miR- 155 contributes to Th 17 cell function by suppressing the inhibitory effects of Jarid 2...|$|R
40|$|SummaryTh 17 {{cells have}} been {{described}} as short lived, but this view is at odds with their capacity to trigger protracted damage to normal and transformed tissues. We report that Th 17 cells, despite displaying low expression of CD 27 and other phenotypic markers of terminal differentiation, efficiently eradicated tumors and caused autoimmunity, were long lived, and maintained a core molecular signature resembling early memory CD 8 + cells with stem cell-like properties. In addition, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that <b>Th</b> 17 cells had high expression of Tcf 7, a direct target of the Wnt and β-catenin signaling axis, and accumulated β-catenin, a feature observed in stem cells. In vivo, Th 17 cells gave rise to Th 1 -like effector cell progeny and also self-renewed and persisted as IL- 17 A-secreting cells. Multipotency was required for Th 17 cell-mediated tumor eradication because effector cells deficient in IFN-γ or IL- 17 A had impaired activity. Thus, Th 17 cells are not always short lived and are a less-differentiated subset capable of superior persistence and functionality...|$|R
40|$|Mother-to-infant {{transmission}} (MTIT) of HIV is {{a serious}} global health concern, with over 300, 000 children newly infected in 2011. SIV infection of rhesus macaques (RMs) results in similar rates of MTIT to that of HIV in humans. In contrast, SIV infection of sooty mangabeys (SMs) rarely results in MTIT. The mechanisms underlying protection from MTIT in SMs are unknown. In this study we tested the hypotheses that breast milk factors and/or target cell availability dictate the rate of MTIT in RMs (transmitters) and SMs (non-transmitters). We measured viral loads (cell-free and cell-associated), levels of immune mediators, {{and the ability to}} inhibit SIV infection in vitro in milk obtained from lactating RMs and SMs. In addition, we assessed the levels of target cells (CD 4 +CCR 5 + T cells) in gastrointestinal and lymphoid tissues, including those relevant to breastfeeding transmission, as well as peripheral blood from uninfected RM and SM infants. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> that frequently-transmitting RMs did not have higher levels of cell-free or cell-associated viral loads in milk compared to rarely-transmitting SMs. Milk from both RMs and SMs moderately inhibited in vitro SIV infection, and presence of the examined immune mediators in these two species did not readily explain the differential rates of transmission.

40|$|Psoriasis is a common, {{relapsing}} inflammatory {{skin disease}} characterized by erythematous scaly plaques. Histological manifestations of psoriasis include keratinocyte dysregulation and hyperproliferation, elongated rete ridges, and inflammatory infiltrates consisting of T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. Despite {{the availability of}} new effective drugs to treat psoriasis, the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis are still poorly understood. Recent {{studies have shown that}} Aldara cream, used to treat benign skin abnormalities, triggers psoriasis-like disease in humans and mice and have implicated Th 17 cells in disease initiation. Using this as a model, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> a predominant role for the Th 17 signature cytokines IL- 17 A, IL- 17 F, and IL- 22 in psoriasiform plaque formation in mice. Using gene-targeted mice, we observed that loss of Il 17 a, Il 17 f, or Il 22 strongly reduced disease the severity of psoriasis. However, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that <b>Th</b> 17 cells were not the primary source of these pathogenic cytokines. Rather, IL- 17 A, IL- 17 F, and IL- 22 were produced by a skin-invading population of γδ T cells and RORγt(+) innate lymphocytes. Furthermore, our findings establish that RORγt(+) innate lymphocytes and γδ T cells are necessary and sufficient for psoriatic plaque formation in an experimental disease model that closely resembles human psoriatic plaque formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of natural killer T (NKT) {{cells in the}} immune system {{has yet to be}} determined. There is some evidence that their defect is associated with autoimmunity, but it is still unclear how they play a role in regulating the pathogenesis of T cell–mediated autoimmune diseases. It was originally proposed that NKT cells could control autoimmunity by shifting the cytokine profile of autoimmune T cells toward a protective T helper 2 cell (Th 2) type. However, {{it is now clear that}} the major {{function of}} NKT cells in the immune system is not related to their interleukin (IL) - 4 secretion. In fact, NKT cells mainly secrete interferon (IFN) - � and, activated in the presence of IL- 12, acquire a strong inflammatory phenotype and cytotoxic function. In this study, we have focused our attention on peripheral, IFN-�–secreting NKT cells of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and their ability to immunomodulate the pathogenesis of insulindependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). <b>We</b> <b>found</b> that in NOD mice, the lack of immunoregulatory function of NKT cells in vivo correlated with a dramatic defect in proliferation and differentiation toward an IFN-�–secreting phenotype upon T cell receptor engagement and IL- 12 stimulation. Peripheral NKT cells may have a critical role balancing inflammatory immune responses and avoiding autoimmunity, such that the functional defect <b>we</b> <b>found</b> in <b>th...</b>|$|R
