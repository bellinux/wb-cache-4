25|$|I {{am proud}} of what I did and would do it again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and somebody has to perform this thankless duty. I regret that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had <b>we</b> <b>done</b> that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E

500|$|The {{story of}} [...] "I Love Lisa" [...] {{originated}} {{from a personal}} episode of Al Jean's life; when Jean was in third grade, he received a valentine from a girl that read [...] "I Choo-Choo-Choose You". Years later, Jean wondered if the girl had really liked him. He told writing partner Mike Reiss about it and they thought {{it could be an}} idea for an episode where Lisa could give such a valentine to Ralph Wiggum, who would then take it too far. At that time, Ralph and Chief Wiggum were not established as being related. Jean thought it would be funny if Ralph was Wiggum's son, considering both characters are [...] "fat and dumb". A technique the staff used to come up with stories and ideas was to think [...] "what holiday haven't <b>we</b> <b>done</b> on The Simpsons, or done lately?". As they had done several Halloween and Christmas episodes before, the staff liked the idea of doing a Valentine's Day episode.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, {{the episode}} was {{received}} positively {{by members of}} the voice cast and their families, who had attended a preview screening at Century 21 Studios. Francis Matthews, who provided the voice of Captain Scarlet, recalls that [...] "the moment we heard, 'This is the voice of the Mysterons,' my eldest son ran screaming from the room, but my other son just sat there riveted," [...] and adds, [...] "Reg [...] said, 'Oh my God, what have <b>we</b> <b>done?</b> We've made a series that no children are going to watch!'" [...] The episode was given a cinematic presentation at the Columbia Theatre on London's Shaftesbury Avenue, which Gary Files, a voice actor for later Captain Scarlet episodes, warmly remembers: [...] "I looked at [...] with total and utter amazement... Boy, you should have seen it on the wide screen! They had laid in an incredible soundtrack to go with it... We all tottered out into the night, convinced that we were on to a winner." [...] In his DVD commentary, Gerry Anderson praised Saunders' direction.|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that i think would be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had <b>we</b> <b>done</b> a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{opening weekend}} box office total stood below {{not only the}} second {{weekends}} of Blades of Glory and Meet the Robinsons, but also fell below the opening weekend gross of the poorly reviewed Are <b>We</b> <b>Done</b> Yet?. In an attempt to explain the film's disappointing opening weekend, box office analyst Brandon Gray suggested that Grindhouse [...] "suffered the usual horror comedy dilemma that afflicted Snakes on a Plane and Slither among others: too funny to be scary, too scary to be funny." [...] Box office analyst Lee Tistaert of tracking website Lee's Movie Info compared the result with what may have happened if Tarantino's Kill Bill saga had been released as one film, instead of two separate volumes. [...] "Is it possible that Tarantino got his wish this time {{as a result of}} two back-to-back $60million grosses?" [...] he asked. Others attributed the film's disappointing opening to the timing of Easter weekend, noting that the weekend is more tailored for family-oriented films or light-comedy, not exploitative horror films. The film's length—running more than three hours—also hurt, keeping away casual theater-goers and limiting the number of screenings that could be held in a day.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, as well, RKO Pictures {{entered into}} a legal battle with Wall Street Financial Associates (WSFA). Hartley and Merrill claimed that the owners of WSFA fraudulently induced them into signing an {{acquisition}} agreement by concealing their [...] "cynical and rapacious" [...] plans to purchase RKO with the intention only of dismantling it. WSFA sought a preliminary injunction prohibiting RKO's majority owners from selling their interests in the company to any third parties. The WSFA motion was denied in July 2003, freeing RKO to deal with another potential purchaser, InternetStudios.com. In 2004, that planned sale fell through when InternetStudios.com apparently folded. The company's minimal involvement in new film production continues to focus on its remake rights: Are <b>We</b> <b>Done</b> Yet?, based on Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948), was released in April 2007 to dismal reviews. Later in the year, RKO launched a horror division, Roseblood Movie Company. As of early 2010, Roseblood's mission had expanded, according to the RKO website, to encompass the [...] "popular horror/thriller genre ... youth-oriented feature-length motion pictures that are edgy, sensuous, scary and commercial." [...] The most recent RKO release are Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (2009), a remake of a 1956 RKO film directed by Fritz Lang and A Late Quartet (2012). A stage version of Top Hat toured Great Britain {{in the second half}} of 2011.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} anti-apartheid protest music often used subversive {{meanings}} hidden under innocuous lyrics, partially {{as a consequence}} of the censorship that they experienced. Purely musical techniques were also used to convey meaning. The tendency to use hidden meaning increased as the government grew less tolerant from the 1950s to the 1980s. Popular protest songs of the 1950s often directly addressed politicians. [...] "Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd" [...] by Mini told Hendrik Verwoerd to [...] "Naants'indod'emnyama, Verwoerd bhasobha" [...] (beware of the advancing blacks), while a song referring to pass laws in 1956 included the phrase [...] "Hey Strydom, Wathint'a bafazi, way ithint'imbodoko uzaKufa" [...] (Strydom, now that you have touched the women, you have struck a rock, you have dislodged a boulder, and you will be crushed). Following the Sharpeville massacre songs became less directly critical of the government, and more mournful. [...] "Thina Sizwe" [...] included references to stolen land, was described as depicting emotional desolation, while [...] "Senzeni Na" [...] (what have <b>we</b> <b>done)</b> achieved the same effect by repeating that phrase a number of times. Some musicians adapted innocuous popular tunes and modified their lyrics, thereby avoiding the censors. The Soweto uprising marked a turning point in the movement, as songs written in the 1980s again became more direct, with the appearance of musicians such as Lucey, who [...] "believed in an in‐your‐face, tell‐it‐like‐it‐is approach". Lyrics from this period included calls such as [...] "They are lying to themselves. Arresting us, killing us, won't work. We'll still fight for our land," [...] and [...] "The whites don't negotiate with us, so let's fight".|$|E

2500|$|On the night, Labour's {{candidate}} Judith Tizard {{came within}} 406 votes {{of winning the}} traditionally National-held seat of Remuera; she had been forecast as the winner by initial vote counting. Tizard's near-win fueled Lange's misgivings about the direction his government was taking. He commented, [...] "That election night was a great revelation for me. That was an apprehension on my part that we had actually abandoned our constituency. And it set me to think what on earth have <b>we</b> <b>done</b> that we come within 400 votes of winning the true-blue seat of Remuera.

That has allowed us to maintain extremely high degree of security, which is frankly our number one issue. The only way that we are aware of you can do that is to have tight configuration management and tight central control. So that is where a lot of the complaints came from. To that note, what have <b>we</b> <b>done</b> to lessen blow in future? I think the answer is we don't need to because we are already there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{attack was}} a {{surprise}} to the IRA's East Tyrone Brigade as it was different from previous loyalist attacks. Thomas Mitchell suggested that it was the [...] "most effective attack ever mounted by the loyalists against a republican target". Wright considered Cappagh to have been a successful UVF operation and took personal credit for [...] "wiping them out". He discussed this in the Guardian newspaper:"I genuinely believe that we were very successful, and that may sound morbid but they know that we hammered them into the ground and we didn't lose one volunteer. Indeed, members of the security forces had said that <b>we</b> <b>done</b> what they couldn't do, we put the East Tyrone brigade of the IRA on the run. It was the East Tyrone brigade which was carrying on the war in the North, including in Belfast. East Tyrone were decimated, the UVF wiped them out and that's not an idle boast".

2500|$|The Battle of Entrames {{started at}} 11:00 am on 28 October 1793 when Beaupuy's {{division}} accompanied by Marceau encountered the Vendeans on {{the heights of}} Entrammes. Kléber brought his division up in support of Beaupuy who had come under assault. Unfortunately, Léchelle had jammed the entire army into a single column in which the rear was unable {{to come to the}} assistance of the vanguard, nor could the army commander issue the orders required to remedy the situation. Though they were facing the army's best troops, the Vendeans mounted an extremely effective attack which steadily drove back the Republicans. Finally, seeing the rear of the column start to disintegrate, the divisions of Kléber and Beaupuy took to their heels. That evening the Republicans tried to hold Château-Gontier, but the rebels drove them from there. Troops from the Army of the West scattered as far as Nantes, Angers and Rennes. One source placed Republican losses as 12,000 men and 19 artillery pieces out of 30,000. A more modest estimate is 4,000 Republican casualties out of 25,000 against 2,100 Vendeans killed and wounded out of 31,000.
