This includes interpretation of the terminology used for the specific exposure based <b>waiving</b> according to Column 2 of Annexes VIII-X in REACH and the general exposure based <b>waiving</b> according to Annex XI. In addition, it includes exposure based triggering of testing. <b>Waiving</b> of testing {{is considered to be}} risk-based rather than exposure-based. One issue with risk-based <b>waiving</b> is that the toxicological study under discussion for <b>waiving</b> is sometimes needed in order to decide whether the exposure is negligible. In order to <b>waive</b> testing it is necessary with detailed and extensive knowledge on exposure over the whole life-cycle. Information corresponding to an exposure scenario is needed even though this is only requested if the substance is a PBT eller vPvB or fulfils the criteria for classification...|$|R
