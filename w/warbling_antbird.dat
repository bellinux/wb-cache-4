50|$|The Peruvian <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> {{is found}} {{at lower levels}} in humid forest in {{south-eastern}} Colombia, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, northern Bolivia and western Brazil. It is locally sympatric with the yellow-breasted <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Guianan <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> (Hypocnemis cantator) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. Until recently, it {{included}} the Imeri, Peruvian, yellow-breasted, Rondonia and Spix's <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> as subspecies, but based on vocal differences {{and to a lesser}} degree differences in plumages it has been recommended treating them as separate species. As presently defined, the Guianan <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> is monotypic, although the subspecies notaea sometimes has been recognized.|$|E
50|$|Spix's <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> (Hypocnemis striata) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. Until recently, it was {{considered}} a subspecies of Hypocnemis cantator, but based on vocal differences {{and to a lesser}} degree differences in plumage, it has been recommended treating them as separate species. As presently defined, Spix's <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> includes two subspecies, H. s. implicata and H. s. affinis. The westernmost population is likely to represent an undescribed subspecies. Spix's <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> is found at lower levels in humid forest in the south-eastern Amazon of Brazil.|$|E
50|$|The Rondônia <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> (Hypocnemis ochrogyna) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. Until recently, it was {{considered}} a subspecies of Hypocnemis cantator, but based on vocal differences {{and to a lesser}} degree differences in plumages it has been recommended treating them as separate species. As presently defined, the Rondonia <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> is monotypic.|$|E
50|$|The Peruvian <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> (Hypocnemis peruviana) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. It was {{considered}} a subspecies of Hypocnemis cantator, but based on vocal differences {{and to a lesser}} degree differences in plumages, it has been recommended that they be treated as separate species. As presently defined, the Peruvian <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> includes a single subspecies, saturata.|$|E
50|$|The yellow-breasted <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> {{is found}} {{at lower levels}} in humid forest, {{especially}} in association with bamboo, in south-eastern Peru, northern Bolivia and south-western Brazil (Acre). It is locally sympatric with the Peruvian <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird.</b> Its conservation status has not been assessed by BirdLife International, but as it generally is fairly common, {{it is unlikely to}} be threatened.|$|E
50|$|The Imeri <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> (Hypocnemis flavescens) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. Until recently, it was {{considered}} a subspecies of Hypocnemis cantator, but based on vocal differences {{and to a lesser}} degree differences in plumages it has been recommended treating them as separate species. As presently defined, the Imeri <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> includes a single subspecies, perflava.|$|E

50|$|Hypocnemis is a genus of bird in {{the family}} Thamnophilidae. The <b>Warbling</b> <b>Antbird</b> has {{traditionally}} been considered a single polytypic species, but recent evidence has led to it being split into six almost entirely parapatric species.|$|E

50|$|The Guianan <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> {{is found}} {{at lower levels}} in humid forest in the Guianas, far eastern Venezuela (with Guyana), and {{north-eastern}} Brazil (north of the Amazon River and east of the lower Negro River and the Branco River). Its conservation status has not been assessed following the split into several species, but as it generally is common, {{it is unlikely to}} be threatened.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} {{is characterized}} by open forests of palms and bamboos.255 species of birds {{have been found in}} the alluvial forests, and 189 species in the open forests.The first occurrence in Brazil of several species of birds was first recorded in the ecological station, including sapphire-spangled emerald (Amazilia lactea), Guianan <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> (Hypocnemis cantator), buff-fronted foliage-gleaner (Philydor rufum), wedge-billed woodcreeper (Glyphorynchus spirurus), Tschudi's woodcreeper (Xiphorhynchus ocellatus chunchotambo) and russet-backed oropendola (Psarocolius angustifrons).|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} occurrence of avian duets, their adaptive significance is poorly understood. It is generally assumed that they {{function in the}} joint defense of territories, but no study has successfully distinguished between this hypothesis, which invokes cooperation between the sexes, and mate defense, which invokes conflict. Further, most duetting {{studies have focused on}} oscine passerines, the songs of which are learnt and relatively complex. We therefore tested the mate defense hypothesis in the <b>warbling</b> <b>antbird</b> (Hypocnemis cantator), an Amazonian suboscine that produces simple sex-specific songs and duets. Acoustic analysis of songs showed (1) that solos were often produced by males, but rarely by females; (2) that duets consisted of a male song and a female reply; and (3) that, although female song was invariable, a swift reply resulted in males producing shorter songs with fewer notes. These results suggest that duetting, and the structure of duets, is chiefly a product of female behavior, a scenario more suggestive of conflict than cooperation. To investigate this idea we carried out playback experiments, which showed that (4) the response to solo songs was sex specific (i. e., male solos elicited a strong response from paired males, and female solos elicited a strong response from paired females); (5) males and females responded to same-sex solos more strongly than to duets; and that (6) females answered their partner’s songs more often, and more rapidly, in response to female solos than male solos or duets. Although {{it can be argued that}} sex-specific responses to solo song result from intrasexual territorial defense, we cannot use the same reasoning to explain (5) or (6). Instead, these observations imply that solitary intruders were more threatening than paired intruders, and thus that the perceived threat was to the partnership rather than the territory. Taken together, findings (1) to (6) suggest that females adjus...|$|E
