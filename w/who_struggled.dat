5|$|By the 1830s the British Agricultural Revolution had {{disturbed}} traditional {{society and}} created a class of labourers <b>who</b> <b>struggled</b> to support their families in rural areas. This led to an unrest known as the Swing riots which swept across southern England, consequently reaching Selborne and Liphook in September 1830. The Parliamentary Enclosure Acts of 1856 established a new land pattern for nearby Steep Marsh and Stroud, which still exists today. There was also extensive land drainage between 1860 and 1880; conduits and sluices were constructed to take water from Ashford Stream for the artificial flooding of hay meadows. In Steep, hops were grown for use in local breweries, watercress produced for commercial use, and a condensed milk factory was in operation in Steep Marsh.|$|E
