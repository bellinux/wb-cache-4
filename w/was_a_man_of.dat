5|$|Bethune {{was known}} as a strict Augustinian canon, a priest living a monastic life but not a monk. Bethune was often {{appointed}} a judge delegate by the papacy to try cases and disputes, which had been referred back to England by the popes. The historian David Knowles said of Bethune that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> wide outlook, with a great desire for reform. He was praised by contemporaries for the care with which he selected men to serve as clergy in his diocese. He also held synods in his diocese, including two {{during the first year of}} his episcopate.|$|E

He studied with the anatomist Guillaume Dupuytren during 1801–1804. Villermé then spent 10 years serving in the army room during 1804–1814 under the reign of Napoleon.

Villermé was elected to the Académie royale de médecine in 1823.|$|E
5|$|Evangelis Zappas {{was often}} {{described}} as a solitary and eccentric personality, who had no children. On the other hand, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> vision, determination and a patriot, who {{was well aware of}} the magnitude of his acts. His cousin, Konstantinos Zappas, was the executor of his will and he continued Evangelis Zappas philanthropic works through his legacy. Zappas's wish was to be initially buried in Romania, where he lived most of his life. But after four years his bones were exhumed and reinterred at the school's courtyard in Labovo where he was born, and his skull was enshrined beneath his memorial statue outside the Zappeion in Athens, Greece. A ceremony for the interment was held at 10am on 20 October 1888 at the Zappeion. Baron Pierre de Coubertin made a similar gesture by having his heart buried at Olympia.|$|E

5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, {{he must have}} been a remarkable man. He had enormous drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> honour who always kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
5|$|Largely non-religious, Heinrich <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> the Enlightenment, {{interested}} in {{the ideas of the}} philosophers Immanuel Kant and Voltaire. A classical liberal, he took part in agitation for a constitution and reforms in Prussia, then governed by an absolute monarchy. In 1815, Heinrich Marx began work as an attorney and in 1819 moved his family to a ten-room property near the Porta Nigra. His wife, Henriette Pressburg, was a Dutch Jewish woman from a prosperous business family that later founded the company Philips Electronics. Her sister Sophie Pressburg (1797–1854) married Lion Philips (1794–1866) and was the grandmother of both Gerard and Anton Philips and great-grandmother to Frits Philips. Lion Philips was a wealthy Dutch tobacco manufacturer and industrialist, upon whom Karl and Jenny Marx would later often come to rely for loans while they were exiled in London.|$|E
5|$|The Emir's brother, Prime Minister Nasrullah Khan, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> {{religious}} convictions. Unlike the Emir, he fluently spoke Pashto (the local language), {{dressed in}} traditional Afghan robes, and interacted {{more closely with}} the border tribes. While the Emir favoured British India, Nasrullah Khan was more pro-German in his sympathies. Nasrullah's views were shared by his nephew, Amanullah Khan, the youngest and most charismatic of the Emir's sons. The eldest son, Inayatullah Khan, {{was in charge of}} the Afghan army. The mission therefore expected more sympathy and consideration from Nasrullah and Amanullah than from the emir.|$|E

5|$|Whitlam was {{the most}} {{paradoxical}} of all Prime Ministers {{in the last half}} of the 20th century. A man of superb intellect, knowledge, and literacy, he yet had little ability when it came to economics.... Whitlam rivalled Menzies in his passion for the House of Representatives and ability to use it as his stage, and yet his parliamentary skills were rhetorical and not tactical. He could devise a strategy and then often botch the tactics in trying to implement that strategy.... Above all he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> grand vision with serious blind spots.|$|E
5|$|Humphrey Marshall {{was born}} in Orlean, Virginia in 1760. He {{was the son of}} John and Mary (Quisenberry) Marshall and {{apparently}} named in honor of his maternal grandfather, Humphrey Quisenberry. Marshall's father <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> meager means despite being a member of a prominent Virginia family. Little is known of Marshall's early years, but one tradition holds that he had no formal education during his childhood and that his cousin Mary (later, his wife) taught him to read. Eventually, John sent Humphrey to live with his brother, Thomas Marshall, and to be educated by the same Scottish tutors that educated Thomas' children. Among Thomas' children (Humphrey's cousins) were John Marshall, future Chief Justice of the United States; James Markham Marshall, future federal judge; and Louis Marshall, a noted educator. In addition, one of Thomas' daughters, Nancy Marshall, married Joseph Hamilton Daveiss, a future U.S. Attorney. After receiving his education, Marshall became a surveyor.|$|E
