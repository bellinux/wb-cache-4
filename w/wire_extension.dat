30|$|For a fine wire, it is {{necessary}} to use tensile testing tools and a load cell with a small capacity because such fine wires will only sustain small tensile loads. Capstan-type grippers are conventionally recommended for gripping non-metal fibers (JIS R 3420 2013) but can be applied to a fine metal wire even though the tensile strength of these fine wires is 6.3 – 7.0  GPa and is much greater than the strength of non-metal fibers (Li et al. 2012, 2014). Additionally, the amount of cross-head bending during tensile testing might be negligible in these situations. Thus, the stroke increment can be regarded as the <b>wire</b> <b>extension.</b> This investigation focused on a tensile testing method of fastening the wire to the grippers under an initial load, as it is difficult to prevent the wire from slackening without an initial force. In this case, the wire is elastically deformed, such that the genuine initial length is shorter than the superficial length. The genuine initial length, the stroke at 0  N, must therefore be calculated. The stroke at 0  N can be extrapolated using the slope of the stroke-tensile testing force. To apply this method, the validity of capstan-type gripper use must be verified, including the following conditions: no slip at the fastening between the gripper and wire, and longitudinally uniform elongation. Furthermore, the validity of regarding the stroke increment as the extension of the wire should be considered with the following conditions: negligible cross-head bending and stroke calculation accuracy at 0  N from the slope of the stroke increment and test force-stroke curve. If the validity of using capstan-type grippers and regarding the stroke increment as the <b>wire</b> <b>extension</b> are verified, it is possible to draw the nominal stress-nominal strain curve and calculate elongation. The accuracy of the elongation calculated using the stroke can be determined by comparing this value to the elongation calculated using an extensometer.|$|E

The collapsible nature of folding stands makes them small enough to slip into many instrument cases or backpacks. This feature makes folding stands more portable. As such, they are a popular stand type for rehearsals, auditions and even some types of performances.

25|$|So that {{manufacturers}} {{need not}} build, distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing {{only in the}} type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an IEC 60320 inlet on the appliance and a detachable power cord (mains flex lead) to allow connection of the appliance to the socket. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some types of appliance require the consumer to also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency.

Portable equipment such as gardening power tools may have a male power inlet compatible with the connector {{at the end of an}} extension cord; this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools, and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer. Multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a power strip, which can also include switching, surge voltage and over-current protection; a power strip equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether prolonged sacral neuromodulation (SNM) testing induces a substantial {{risk of infection}} because of the percutaneous passage of the <b>extension</b> <b>wire.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 20 patients with negative prolonged SNM testing for >or= 14 days who underwent tined-lead explantation were prospectively evaluated. The explanted tined leads were sent for microbiological examination. The tined lead, gluteal, and <b>extension</b> <b>wire</b> incision sites were investigated for clinical signs of infection according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification system. RESULTS: In all, 17 patients had bilateral and three unilateral implanted tined leads. The median (range) test period was 30 (21 - 62 days). Bacterial growth (Staphylococcus species) was detected in four of 20 (20 %) patients on seven of 37 (19 %) explanted tined leads. There were clinical signs of infection in one of 20 (5 %) patients at none of 37 tined lead, one of 20 (5 %) gluteal, and none of 20 <b>extension</b> <b>wire</b> incision sites. There were no clinical signs of infection in the remaining three of four patients with bacterial growth. CONCLUSIONS: After prolonged tined-lead testing, we found an infection rate comparable to that reported with the usual short test period.

Thus, prolonged tined-lead testing {{does not seem to}} induce clinically relevant infection, warranting randomized trials...|$|R

40|$|Antenna {{problem is}} a {{phenomenon}} of plasma induced gate oxide degradation. It directly affects manufacturability of VLSI circuits, especially in deep-submicron technology using high density plasma. Diode insertion is a very effective way to solve this problem. Ideally diodes are inserted directly under the wires that violate antenna rules. But in today's high-density VLSI layouts, there is simply not enough room for "under-the-wire" diode insertion for all wires. Thus {{it is necessary to}} insert many diodes at legal "off-wire" locations and extend the antenna-rule violating wires to connect to their respective diodes. Previously only simple heuristic algorithms were available for this diode insertion and routing problem. In this paper, we show that the diode insertion and routing problem for an arbitrary given number of routing layers can be optimally solved in polynomial time. Our algorithm guarantees to find a feasible diode insertion and routing solution whenever one exists.

30|$|The {{applicable}} standard, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 6892 - 1 (ISO 6982 - 1 2016), {{refers to}} a method for measuring the ductility of bulk metal using its elongation and reduction of area. In general, the elongation is measured from the <b>extension</b> of a <b>wire.</b> The <b>extension</b> is measured by an extensometer, not by the stroke increment of a cross-head (henceforth simply {{referred to as the}} stroke increment) which is measured by the rotation angle of a ball screw in a universal testing machine. The stroke increment should be smaller than the genuine extension. This is because cross-heads bend during tensile testing due the application of a large tensile load to the wire. Therefore, the ISO standard recommends an extensometer be placed upon the tested wire. The reduction of area is calculated from the diameter of a wire prior to tensile testing, and the diameter at the most constricted point after tensile testing is complete. These diameters are measured by joining fractured pieces.|$|R
