He discovered that Gehrig was drinking, boosted his confidence and gave him batting advice, including one of Ty Cobb's batting tricks. Gehrig started hitting again, and eventually joined the Yankees.|$|E

5|$|At the war's outset, FRELIMO {{had little}} {{hope for a}} {{conventional}} military victory, with a mere 7000 combatants against a far larger Portuguese force. Their hopes rested on urging the local populace to support the insurgency, in order to force a negotiated independence from Lisbon. Portugal fought {{its own version of}} protracted warfare, and a large military force <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>by</b> the Portuguese government to quell the unrest, with troop numbers rising from 8,000 to 24,000 between 1964 and 1967. The number of local soldiers recruited for the Portuguese cause rose to 23,000 in the same period. 860 Special Forces operatives were also being trained in Commando Instruction Centres by 1969.|$|E
5|$|Baum's {{detachment}} was a mixed {{force of}} 700 composed primarily of Hessians but also including {{small amounts of}} dismounted Brunswick dragoons, Canadians, Loyalists, and Indians. He <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>by</b> Burgoyne to raid Bennington in the disputed New Hampshire Grants area for horses, draft animals, provisions, and other supplies. Believing the town to be only lightly defended, Burgoyne and Baum were unaware that Stark and 1,500 militiamen were stationed there. After a rain-caused standoff, Stark's men enveloped Baum's position, taking many prisoners, and killing Baum. Reinforcements for both sides arrived as Stark and his men were mopping up, and the battle restarted, with Warner and Stark driving away Breymann's reinforcements with heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|Finally, the King {{arranged}} for Stephen to marry Matilda in 1125, the daughter and only heiress of the Count of Boulogne, who owned both the important continental port of Boulogne and vast estates in the north-west and south-east of England. In 1127, William Clito, a potential claimant to the English throne, seemed {{likely to become}} the Count of Flanders; Stephen <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>by</b> the King {{on a mission to}} prevent this, and in the aftermath of his successful election, William Clito attacked Stephen's lands in neighbouring Boulogne in retaliation. Eventually a truce was declared, and William Clito died the following year.|$|E

In February 1942, Aubame met colonial administrator Félix Éboué and quickly became his protégé. He served as an informant for Éboué on African affairs. Aubame's reward was {{to be one of}} several Africans promoted on 23 February 1943 into the European section of the civil service, and on 1 January 1944 Éboué appointed him president of the municipal commission for the Poto-Poto section of Brazzaville.|$|E
5|$|Hera– Zeus' jaded {{wife and}} former Queen of the Gods. In Betrayal, Hera's giant pet Argos <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>by</b> the Gods to stop Kratos' rampage across Greece.

5|$|In 1163, a {{conflict}} arose between {{the king and}} the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, over {{the rights of the}} king in the English church. At a council held at Westminster in October 1163, the king and Becket contended over the question, with the bishops supporting Becket against the king. Robert was involved in the conflict not only as a bishop-elect, but as an envoy to Becket from the pope, as he accompanied Philip of Aumone, a French abbot, who <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>by</b> Alexander to Becket in after the Council of Westminster to urge Becket not to inflame the situation. Robert went with Philip, probably because it was hoped {{he would be able to}} influence Becket.|$|E

He met with the Sioux leadership in central Minnesota to secure rights for the U.S. to an area near Saint Anthony Falls, which would later become the city of Saint Paul. Though a treaty was signed by some leaders from the Sioux tribes, its legitimacy (including whether the Sioux understood it) was dubious and ultimately his efforts did little to establish the authority of the U.S. in the area.|$|E
