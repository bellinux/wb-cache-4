5|$|Although Nash <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> that he {{was never}} prouder than {{when he was a}} soldier, always wore his Returned Services League (RSL) badge and eagerly {{attended}} reunions of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, he never marched on Anzac Day or applied for the campaign medals for which he was eligible.|$|E
5|$|A {{speech of}} Andocides {{indirectly}} concerns epikleroi, as the orator {{claimed that the}} real origin of the dispute between himself and his cousin Leagros was over which of them <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> an heiress that both were related to. Demosthenes' speech Against Macartatus includes a description of Sositheos' claiming of the epikleros Phulomakhe.|$|E

5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt failed, and Mehmed {{marched to the}} Wallachian capital of Târgovişte, where he discovered an additional 20,000 impaled Turks. The Sultan and his troops then sailed to Brăila and burned {{it to the ground}} before retreating to Adrianople. Both sides <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> victory, while Mehmed II's forces returned home with many captured slaves, horses and cattle.|$|E
5|$|The show {{consisted}} of five matches, {{with the main}} event being a Lucha de Apuestas, elimination steel cage match where all seven competitors put their mask on the line, also on the line was {{the right to use}} the name Los Infernales, the winning team <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> the name. The competitors were Último Guerrero, Rey Bucanero, Tarzan Boy, Máscara Mágica, Mephisto, Averno and El Satánico. This was the first time a CMLL Anniversary Show featured a steel cage match.|$|E
5|$|Constantine ignored {{those parts}} of Diocletian's rule that did not suit him. Diocletian's policy of {{preserving}} a stable silver coinage was abandoned, and the gold solidus became the empire's primary currency instead. Diocletian's persecution of Christians was repudiated and changed to a policy of toleration and then favoritism. Christianity eventually became the official religion in 380. Constantine <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> {{to have the same}} close relationship with the Christian God as Diocletian claimed to have with Jupiter. Most importantly, Diocletian's tax system and administrative reforms lasted, with some modifications, until the advent of the Muslims in the 630s. The combination of state autocracy and state religion was instilled in much of Europe, particularly in the lands which adopted Orthodox Christianity.|$|E

40|$|This article investigates whether exchanging Social Security delayed {{retirement}} credits, currently paid as {{increases in}} lifelong benefits, for {{a lump sum}} <b>would</b> induce later <b>claiming</b> and additional work. We show that people <b>would</b> voluntarily <b>claim</b> about 6 months later if the lump sum were paid for claiming after the early retirement age, and about 8 months later if the lump sum were paid only for those claiming after their full retirement age. Overall, people will work one-third to one-half of the additional months. Those who <b>would</b> currently <b>claim</b> at the youngest ages are most responsive to the lump sum offer...|$|R
5|$|In early September, Levene {{was fired}} from the Clash. Strummer <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> that Levene's dwindling {{interest}} in the band owed to his supposedly extravagant use of speed, a charge Levene has denied. Levene and Lydon would form Public Image Ltd. in 1978. On 21 September, the Clash performed publicly {{for the first time}} without Levene at another seminal concert: the 100 Club Punk Special, sharing the bill with the Sex Pistols, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect. Chimes left in late November; he was briefly replaced by Rob Harper as the Clash toured in support of the Sex Pistols during December's Anarchy Tour.|$|E
5|$|Kraft's {{world record}} {{initially}} came under scrunity, {{as it appeared}} that he touched the snow with his backside as {{he was forced to}} squat down on essentially flat ground. However, slow-motion replay analysis confirmed that his landing was valid, albeit with only millimetres to spare. A week later, Planica caught up to Vikersund with a plethora of more personal bests, and three athletes – including Kraft, twice – landing jumps of or beyond 250m. Kamil Stoch <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> the current hill record of 251.5m, with the season finale competition drawing an attendance of 16,500.|$|E
5|$|Little is {{recorded}} of MacGregor's childhood. After his father's death in 1794, {{he and his}} two sisters were raised primarily by his mother {{with the help of}} various relatives. MacGregor's biographer David Sinclair speculates that he would probably have spoken mainly Gaelic during his early childhood, and learned English only after starting school around the age of five-and-a-half. MacGregor <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> in later life to have studied at the University of Edinburgh between 1802 and 1803; records of this do not survive as he did not take a degree, but Sinclair considers it plausible, citing MacGregor's apparent sophistication and his mother's connections in Edinburgh.|$|E

5|$|Paul Kruger was baptised at Cradock on 19 March 1826, {{and soon}} {{thereafter}} his parents acquired a farm {{of their own}} to the north-west at Vaalbank, near Colesberg, in the remote north-east of the Cape Colony. His mother {{died when he was}} eight; Casper soon remarried and had more children with his second wife, Heiletje (née du Plessis). Beyond reading and writing, which he learned from relatives, Kruger's only education was three months under a travelling tutor, Tielman Roos, and Calvinist religious instruction from his father. In adulthood Kruger <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> to have never read any book apart from the Bible.|$|E
5|$|The IRFU {{continued}} {{under the}} larger {{auspices of the}} Canadian Rugby Union. Beginning in 1909, the CRU champion was awarded the Grey Cup, with the Big Four competing against university squads and eventually teams from Western Canada. The Argonauts first competed for the Cup in 1911, losing 14 to 7 to the University of Toronto {{in front of a}} then record 13,687 spectators at the newly opened Varsity Stadium. The team <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> their first championship in 1914, exacting revenge on U of T with a 14 to 2 victory. Their star runner and kicker in their first championship year was Jack O'Conner, who scored a league record 44 points.|$|E
5|$|William Lane Craig criticised Oppy's {{study as}} too vague for useful classification. Craig argued that an {{argument}} can be classified as ontological if it attempts to deduce the existence of God, along with other necessary truths, from his definition. He suggested that proponents of ontological arguments <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> that, if one fully understood the concept of God, one must accept his existence. William L. Rowe defined ontological arguments as those that start from the definition of God and, using only a priori principles, conclude with God's existence.|$|E

5|$|Although {{these acts}} helped empower courts to remedy {{violations}} of federal voting rights, strict legal standards {{made it difficult}} for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test, the Department needed to prove that the rejected voter-registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to the accepted applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties in a process that could last months. The Department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials, who <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> to have misplaced the voter registration records of racial minorities, remove registered racial minorities from the electoral rolls, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South improved marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|By {{the eighth}} game, the {{competition}} {{had become more}} than a battle for hockey supremacy: it was also viewed as a battle between contrasting ways of life, particularly in the Soviet Union, where success in sport was used to promote the superiority of communism over western capitalism. An estimated 50 million Soviets watched the final contest, while in Canada, offices were closed and schools suspended classes to allow students to watch the game on television in gymnasium assemblies. The two teams ended the first period tied at two goals apiece, but Canada trailed at the second intermission, 5–3, and Soviet officials stated they <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> the overall victory if the game ended in a draw {{as a result of}} scoring more goals throughout the series. Canada rallied in the third period to tie the game with seven minutes remaining.|$|E
5|$|No. 80 Squadron was re-equipped with newer model Hawker Hurricane Mk Is on 20 February 1941. That day, Pattle, flying Hurricane Mk I V7724, {{was leading}} {{a group of}} six Hurricanes escorting 16 Blenheim light bombers — eight from No. 84 Squadron RAF, six from No. 211 Squadron and three from No. 30 Squadron RAF—to Berat. Fiat G.50bis from the 361a and 395a Squadriglia, 154° Autonomo Gruppo were {{scrambled}} from Berat airfield, but they were attacked by the higher altitude Hurricanes. Pattle led his section straight towards four Fiat G.50s and selected the leading aircraft as his own target. It {{was the first time}} he had fired the eight guns of the Hurricane, and the G.50 exploded. The Fiat G.50 was from 154° Gruppo and it was the first Hurricane victory that Pattle <b>would</b> <b>claim.</b> Tenente Livio Bassi was killed in this battle. Another CR.42 fell to Pattle on 27 February 1941 — his 17th victory. His Hurricane sustained a bullet hole in the fuel tank.|$|E

5|$|The lack of patrolling by MacGregor's troops {{allowed the}} Spanish to march {{straight}} into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor {{was still in}} bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen drilling in the main square and opened fire. Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets from the window onto the beach below and jumped out after them, then attempted to paddle out to his ships on a log. He passed out and would probably have drowned {{had he not been}} picked up and brought aboard the Hero by one of his naval officers. MacGregor <b>would</b> <b>claim</b> that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the Hero, then despatched runners to Rafter ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that Rafter received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the Hero. Rafter, in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships—but to the colonel's astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about and made for the high seas. Abandoned, Colonel Rafter and the remnants of MacGregor's army {{had no choice but to}} surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity. Rafter was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape.|$|E
