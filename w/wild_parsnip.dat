5|$|Despite {{the slight}} {{morphological}} {{differences between the}} two, <b>wild</b> <b>parsnip</b> is the same taxon as the cultivated version, and the two readily cross-pollinate. Parsnip has a chromosome number of 2n=22.|$|E
5|$|Other species {{names such}} as Cicuta bolanderi, Cicuta californica, and Cicuta curtissii are older names now {{recognized}} to be varieties of the widespread, morphologically variable Cicuta maculata. Cicuta maculata is now recognized to have four varieties: var. maculata, var. augustifolia, var. victorinii, and var. bolanderi. Phylogenetic analysis using the sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) loci was not conclusive but seems to show that C.bulbifera and C.virosa are monophyletic, while C.douglasii may not be. It was also suggested a specimen from California may warrant recognition as a distinct species. Other common names for the genus in general include poison parsnip, beaver poison, wild carrot, <b>wild</b> <b>parsnip,</b> and false parsley.|$|E
5|$|The <b>wild</b> <b>parsnip</b> {{from which}} the modern {{cultivated}} varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, {{as soon as the}} ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.|$|E

Collection of achenes was performed at the habitat Sedlec near Mikulov, collection of cultivars was carried out on experimental fields in Lednice in the years 2013 and 2015. Analytical germination tests were made in germinating cupboards in the laboratory of a seed company. It has been found that achenes cultural types of carrots and parsnips are due to growing conditions significantly higher germination.

5|$|Members of {{the family}} Apiaceae bear close {{resemblance}} to each other, and have many characteristics in common. Cicuta spp. are often mistaken for edible plants such as kvanne (Angelica archangelica), wild celery (Apium graveolens), pignut (Conopodium majus), wild carrot (Daucus carota), <b>wild</b> <b>parsnip</b> (Pastinaca sativa), and water parsnip (Berula spp.). One of the more common misidentifications is between water hemlock and water parsnip; both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas, and both have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers. Differences between water parsnip and water hemlock include the water parsnip having leaves only once compound while the water hemlock has leaves which are {{two or three times}} compound. Water hemlock also has a large swelling at the stem base which water parsnip lacks. Additionally, water hemlock has bracts at the base of each small flower cluster, not {{at the base of the}} main flower head, while water parsnip has both bracts at the base of flowers and also at the main flower head.|$|E
25|$|On Nunivak, most {{indigenous}} {{plants were}} traditionally gathered {{by women and}} children when the men were harvesting other available resources (e.g., caribou, waterfowl, seal). While fresh spring greens provided a welcome addition to the diet, which in winter was based largely on dried and stored foods, other greens were harvested throughout the year as they ripened, and used {{with some of those}} stored for winter use. With the melting of the island's snow pack, local greens and berries not picked during the previous fall's harvest, begin to appear and were added to the local diet. Depending on the time the ice pack began to break up, Cup'ig families would leave their winter villages and move to spring seal camps. Cup'ig men would journey out along the ice to harvest arriving sea mammals (i.e., seals, walrus) while the women would spend much of their time harvesting available plant resources (greens and seaweeds) and shellfish. Early spring plants included: marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), sour dock (Rumex arcticus), wild celery (Angelica lucida), wild lettuce (Draba borealis or D. hyperborea), <b>wild</b> <b>parsnip</b> (Ligusticum hultonii), wild rhubarb (Polygonum viviparum), mountain sorrel (Oxyria digylla), Pallas buttercup (Ranunculus pallasii), and Labrador tea (Ledum pallustre decumbens).|$|E

She is also allergic to <b>wild</b> <b>parsnips</b> (see the Season One episode [...] "Jerk de Soleil" [...] and Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension). She is friends with Vanessa Doofenshmirtz, the daughter of Perry's nemesis, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, and has been to his lair {{on a number of}} occasions but is still unaware of where Perry goes everyday, whereas Vanessa, who knows Perry personally, is unaware of the fact that Candace is part of Perry's host family. Their friendship is primarily because both attempt to prove something about a family member to their mothers, but fail every time; Candace most likely doesn't know that the primary cause of her failures is because of Heinz and Perry, the former being the subject of Vanessa's own failed tattletale attempts.|$|R
5|$|In Eurasia, some {{authorities}} {{distinguish between}} cultivated and <b>wild</b> versions of <b>parsnips</b> by using subspecies P. s. sylvestris for the latter, or even elevating it to species status as Pastinaca sylvestris. In Europe, various subspecies {{have been named}} based on characteristics such as the hairiness of the leaves, {{the extent to which}} the stems are angled or rounded, and the size and shape of the terminal umbel.|$|R
60|$|Finally, {{every one}} must judge for himself {{whether it is}} more {{probable}} that the several forms of wheat, barley, rye, and oats are descended from between ten and fifteen species, {{most of which are}} now either unknown or extinct, or whether they are descended from between four and eight species, which may have either closely resembled our present cultivated forms, or have been so widely different as to escape identification. In this latter case we must conclude that man cultivated the cereals at an enormously remote period, and that he formerly practised some degree of selection, which in itself is not improbable. We may, perhaps, further believe that, when wheat was first cultivated the ears and grains increased quickly in size, {{in the same manner as}} the roots of the <b>wild</b> carrot and <b>parsnip</b> are known to increase quickly in bulk under cultivation.|$|R

6000|$|In the {{production}} of large, fleshy, turnip-like stems, we have a case of analogous variation in three forms which are generally considered as distinct species. But scarcely any modification seems so easily acquired as a succulent enlargement of the stem or root--that is, a store of nutriment laid up for the plant's own future use. We see this in our radishes, beet, and in the less generally known [...] "turnip-rooted" [...] celery, and in the finocchio, or Italian variety of the common fennel. Mr. Buckman has lately proved by his interesting experiments bow quickly {{the roots of the}} <b>wild</b> <b>parsnip</b> can be enlarged, as Vilmorin formerly proved {{in the case of the}} carrot. (9/79. These experiments by Vilmorin have been quoted by many writers. An eminent botanist, Prof. Decaisne, has lately expressed doubts on the subject from his own negative results, but these cannot be valued equally with positive results. On the other hand, M. Carriere has lately stated ('Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 1154), that he took seed from a wild carrot, growing far from any cultivated land, and even in the first generation the roots of his seedlings differed in being spindle-shaped, longer, softer, and less fibrous than those of the wild plant. From these seedlings he raised several distinct varieties.) ...|$|E
60|$|Outside of both {{political}} and literary circles, among Burke's correspondents was that wise and honest traveller whose name is as inseparably {{bound up with the}} preparation of the French Revolution, as Burke's is bound up with its sanguinary climax and fulfilment. Arthur Young, by his Farmer's Letters, and Farmer's Calendar, and his account of his travels in the southern counties of England and elsewhere--the story of the more famous travels in France was not published until 1792--had won a reputation as the best informed agriculturist of his day. Within a year of his settlement at Beaconsfield, we find Burke writing to consult Young on the mysteries of his new occupation. The reader may smile as he recognises the ardour, the earnestness, the fervid gravity of the political speeches, in letters which discuss the merits of carrots in fattening porkers, and the precise degree to which they should be boiled. Burke throws himself just as eagerly into white peas and Indian corn, into cabbages that grow into head and cabbages that shoot into leaves, into experiments with pumpkin seed and <b>wild</b> <b>parsnip,</b> {{as if they had been}} details of the Stamp Act, or justice to Ireland. When he complains that it is scarcely possible for him, with his numerous avocations, to get his servants to enter fully into his views as to the right treatment of his crops, we can easily understand that his farming did not help him to make money. It is impossible that he should have had time or attention to spare for the effectual direction of even a small farm.|$|E
60|$|Accustomed {{as we are}} to our {{excellent}} {{vegetables and}} luscious fruits, we can hardly persuade ourselves that the stringy roots of the <b>wild</b> carrot and <b>parsnip,</b> or the little shoots of the wild asparagus, or crabs, sloes, etc., should ever have been valued; yet, from what we know of the habits of Australian and South African savages, we need feel no doubt on this head. The inhabitants of Switzerland during the Stone-period largely collected wild crabs, sloes, bullaces, hips of roses, elderberries, beechmast, and other wild berries and fruit. (9/8. Prof. O. Heer 'Die Pflanzen der Pfahlbauten' 1866 aus dem Neujahr. Naturforsch. Geselschaft' 1866; and Dr. H. Christ in Rutimeyer's 'Die Fauna der Pfahlbauten' 1861 s. 226.)

50|$|All {{plants from}} the genus Cicuta contain cicutoxin, these plants {{are found in}} swampy, wet {{habitats}} in North America and parts of Europe. The Cicuta plants are often mistaken for edible roots such as <b>parsnip,</b> <b>wild</b> carrot or wild ginseng. All parts of the cicuta plants are poisonous, though the root is the most toxic part of the plant. 17 boys ingested parts of the plant, only those who consumed the root were experiencing seizures, the others who consumed the leaves and flowers were only unwell. The toxicity of the plants depends on various factors, such as seasonal variation, temperature, geographical location and soil conditions. Especially {{in the early spring}} the roots are the most toxic part of the plant. The roots contain their toxicity even after drying. Cicutoxin was first isolated by C.A. Jacobsen in 1915. In 1953, the structure of the toxin was determined. The first synthesis of cicutoxin was reported in 1955, the researchers had a yield of only 4 percent. Given that they had no access to modern coupling reactions, this was a great accomplishment. The absolute configuration of cicutoxin was identified in 1999, they also discovered that the plants contain multiple congeners of cicutoxin.|$|R
