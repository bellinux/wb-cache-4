The essential range of h is defined in the following way: a complex number λ is in the essential range of h if for all ε > 0, the preimage of the open ball Bε(λ) under h has strictly positive measure. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>show</b> first that σ(Th) coincides with the essential range of h and then examine its various parts.|$|E

[...] That is, we show that no matter how the rest of society votes, if Pivotal Voter ranks B over C, then that is the societal outcome.

2500|$|Deputy District Attorney Stirling Norris, {{acting as}} prosecutor, sought {{the death penalty}} for each count of murder for which Bonin was tried, stating in his opening speech to the jury: [...] "We will prove he is the Freeway Killer, as he has bragged to a number of witnesses. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>show</b> you that he enjoyed the killings. Not only did he enjoy it, and plan to enjoy it, he had an insatiable demand, an insatiable {{appetite}} - not only for sodomy, but for killing." [...] Norris further elaborated that Bonin had followed a depressingly familiar routine in his murders of luring or forcing his victim into the van, before overpowering and binding his victim. He would then repeatedly rape his captive between and throughout instances of torture, before finally reaching the [...] "climax of the orgy" [...] by killing his victim. Norris further asserted that Bonin considered murder a group sport, and would typically groom people of a low mentality to participate in many of his murders.|$|E
