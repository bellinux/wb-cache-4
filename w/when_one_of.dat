5|$|All {{daughter}} isotopes (decay products) of element 117 {{were previously}} unknown; therefore, their properties {{could not be}} used to confirm the claim of discovery. In 2011, <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the decay products (289115) was synthesized directly, its properties matched those measured in the claimed indirect synthesis from the decay of element 117. The discoverers did not submit a claim for their findings in 2007–2011 when the Joint Working Party was reviewing claims of discoveries of new elements.|$|E

30|$|To {{perform the}} homophily analysis, we defined a network where the nodes {{represent}} users, and the edges represent the connections among them. This network contained 18, 450 nodes and 795, 986 edges. There is a unidirectional follow connection between two users <b>when</b> only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them follows the other. There is unidirectional retweet connection between two users <b>when</b> only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them retweets the other, {{and there is}} a unidirectional mention connection with two users <b>when</b> only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them mentions the other. Therefore, there is a reciprocal follow connection with two users when both follow each other. There is reciprocal retweet connection between two users when both retweet each other, and there is reciprocal mention connection between two users when both mention each other.|$|R
5|$|On 7 January 1783, Concorde was {{in company}} with Nymphe. They sighted HMS Raven, which {{initially}} sailed towards them until {{she realized that}} they were not British frigates. An all-day chase ensued until about 9p.m. <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the frigates got within pistol-shot and fired a broadside that took away Ravens main topgallant-mast. The chase continued until about 10:30p.m. <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the frigates was again in range, with the other coming up rapidly. At this point, Raven, which was under the command of Commander John Wells, struck. The French Navy took Raven into service under the name Cérès, which she had born when under French colours between 1778 and 1782.|$|E
5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. <b>When</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the males approaches the female, {{he uses his}} upper jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located {{on either side of}} her body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E

Many other trophies and artifacts {{in the clubhouse}} melted or were damaged beyond repair but the Grey Cup survived by catching onto a nail when the shelf upon which it sat collapsed. The trophy has been broken on six other occasions: in 1978, when it was dropped by celebrating Edmonton Eskimos players; in 1987, when an Eskimos' player sat on it; in 1993, when Edmonton's Blake Dermott head-butted it; in 2006, when the trophy broke away from its base as the BC Lions celebrated their victory; in 2012 <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the handles broke off as the Toronto Argonauts celebrated; and finally in 2014 when trophy broke from its base again by the Calgary Stampeders after their win.
