5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur {{on the skin}} of the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, <b>which</b> <b>keeps</b> them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E
5|$|Pilots {{noted that}} in a crosswind, {{the nose of the}} plane would not point {{directly}} at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off, to compensate for the wind. Since making the beams bright enough at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to fly on the curving approach path <b>which</b> <b>keeps</b> the nose pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight-line path with the nose pointed upwind.|$|E
5|$|The {{configuration}} of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the azimuthal ring current (not an analog of Earth's ring current), which flows with rotation through the equatorial plasma sheet. The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a centripetal force, <b>which</b> <b>keeps</b> the co-rotating plasma from escaping the planet. The total ring current in the equatorial current sheet is estimated at 90–160million amperes.|$|E

5|$|The {{vestibulocochlear nerve}} (VIII) splits into the {{vestibular}} and cochlear nerve. The vestibular part {{is responsible for}} innervating the vestibules and semicircular canal of the inner ear; this structure transmits information about balance, and {{is an important component}} of the vestibuloocular reflex, <b>which</b> <b>keeps</b> the head stable and allows the eyes to track moving objects. The cochlear nerve transmits information from the cochlea, allowing sound to be heard.|$|E
5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, <b>which</b> <b>keeps</b> the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E
5|$|Computer systems {{make use}} of caches—small and fast {{memories}} located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value {{in more than one}} location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a cache coherency system, <b>which</b> <b>keeps</b> track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus snooping {{is one of the most}} common methods for keeping track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory systems do.|$|E

25|$|Politicians and {{businesses}} want the most knowledgeable and well-connected individuals working for them, <b>which</b> <b>keeps</b> {{the pool of}} potential hires quite small. The most influential lobbying strategy– access– is an advantage of the corporate media lobby.|$|E
25|$|Bikejoring is an {{activity}} where the owner bikes {{along with their}} dog while they are attached to their bike through a harness <b>which</b> <b>keeps</b> both the dog and owner safe. The dog, or team of dogs can be attached to a towline to also pull the biker.|$|E

25|$|The British {{biologist}} Alfred Russel Wallace is {{best known}} for independently proposing a theory of evolution due to natural selection that prompted Charles Darwin to publish his own theory.

25|$|Many popular vitamin {{supplements}} include copper {{as small}} inorganic molecules such as cupric oxide.

25|$|Combination pills usually work by {{preventing}} a woman's ovaries from releasing eggs (ovulation). They also thicken the cervical mucus, <b>which</b> <b>keeps</b> sperm from penetrating into the uterus and joining with an egg. The hormones in combination and progestogen-only pills also thin {{the lining of}} the uterus. This could prevent pregnancy by interfering with implantation of a blastocyst.|$|E
