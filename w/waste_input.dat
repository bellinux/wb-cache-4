Significantly higher levels of temperature and conductivity were found at the sites downstream of the point of effluent discharge. The invertebrate fauna of the two sites immediately downstream of the point of discharge was dominated by two invertebrate taxa: Baetis sp. (Fam. Baetidae) and Smicridea jamaicensis (Fam. Hydropsychidae). These taxa made up between 26 to 35 % of the numbers at these two sites. Upstream of the bauxite <b>waste</b> <b>input</b> the community was dominated by cased caddis larvae of Helicopsyche ochthephila (Fam. Helicopsychidae) and Cubanoptilia tridens (Fam.

The dioxin-like PCB fingerprints of the <b>waste</b> <b>inputs</b> show that PCB oils Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1254 late are the major dioxin-like PCB contamination source of sludge, RDF and ASR. The dioxin-like PCB fingerprints of the <b>waste</b> <b>inputs</b> are clearly different from the fingerprints of the outputs i. e. boiler and fly ash, indicating that in full scale waste incinerators dioxin-like PCBs in the <b>input</b> <b>waste</b> are destroyed and other dioxin-like PCBs are newly formed in the post combustion zone.

Data from other Bight benthic studies are included to· extend the temporal coverage from 1979 to 1989. Numbers of species and amphipods per sample, taken as relatively sensitive indicators of environmental stress, showed consistent spatial patterns. Lowest values {{were found in the}} Christiaensen Basin and other inshore areas, and numbers increased toward the outermost shelf and Hudson Shelf Valley stations. There were statistically significant decreases in species and amphipods at most stations from 1980 to 1985. (Preliminary data from a more recent study suggest numbers of species increased again between 1986 and 1989.) Cluster analysis of 1980 - 85 data indicated several distinct assemblages-sewage sludge dumpsite, sludge accumulation area, inner Shelf Valley, outer Shelf Valley, outer shelf-with little change over time. The "enriched" and "highly altered" assemblages in the Basin appear similar to those reported since sampling began there in 1968. No consistently defaunated areas have been found in any sampling programs over the past 20 years. On a gross level, therefore, recent faunal responses to any environmental changes are not evident, but the more sensitive measures used, i. e. numbers of species and amphipods, do indicate widespread recent effects.

The alternatives considered in Phase 2 were innovative thermal treatments with nine types of primary processing units.
