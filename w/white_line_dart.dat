The fresh, clear air was so delicious that she almost hoped {{she was back in}} her dear Tyrol; but the hills were not the same. She saw upon the slope quantities of cows, goats, and sheep, feeding just as on the Tyrolese Alps; but beyond was a dark row of pines, and above, in the sky as it were, rose all round great sharp points--like clouds for their whiteness, but not in their straight, jagged outlines. And here and there the deep gray clefts between seemed to spread into white rivers, or over the ruddy purple of the half-distance came sharp <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> <b>darting</b> downwards.|$|R
50|$|Under the Transport 21 Plan, the DART network {{would have}} gone through a {{fundamental}} change from the coastally-focused north/south line which currently exists, to a two-line system which crossed the city. One of these <b>lines</b> (<b>DART</b> <b>Line</b> 1) would run from Maynooth/Pace-M3 to Greystones via Connolly station, while the other (<b>DART</b> <b>Line</b> 2) would run from Balbriggan to Hazelhatch, south of Celbridge, via the <b>DART</b> Underground. Both <b>lines</b> would intersect at Pearse Street Station. A decision will be made between 2016 and 2035.|$|R

40|$|Toe Tip Necrosis Syndrome (TTNS) is a {{debilitating}} disease affecting the lower hind limb of cattle characterized by necrotic bone, wear or rounding of the hoof and {{breakdown of the}} <b>white</b> <b>line</b> region. This breakdown {{is thought to be}} the cause of TTNS, though this is unclear. The overall aim of this research was to investigate the hypothesis that mechanical damage and loading is the cause of the <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation, which could ultimately lead to TTNS. Objective 1 of this research aimed to identify if loading is associated with <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation and subsequently TTNS. Eleven diseased specimens and ten healthy specimens were loaded in a materials testing system against an acrylic plate. A camera, located underneath the hoof, imaged the apical region to identify the area of <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation. Specimens were imaged using a High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) scanner with a contrast agent to assess the volume of separation. Objective 2 investigated whether mechanical damage under a fatigue loading regime would induce <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation. Ten healthy pairs of specimens were tested (10 healthy, 10 with simulated damage) under fatigue loading for 36, 000 cycles at 1000 N. The results from Objective 1 indicated a positive association between loading and <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation in diseased hooves. However, healthy hooves showed no separation. These findings support the hypothesis that mechanical loading is involved in TTNS etiology or disease exacerbation and acceleration. Findings from Objective 2 indicate no association between cycle count and <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation. These results suggest that <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation (and subsequent TTNS) may not be due to wear or prolonged repetitive loading. These results indicate that another loading parameter or a biological event likely initiates <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation and ultimately TTNS...|$|R

40|$|The tensile {{strength}} of 576 pieces of <b>white</b> <b>line</b> horn collected over 6 mo from 14 dairy cows restricted to parity 1 or 2 was tested. None of the cows {{had ever been}} lame.

Hoof horn samples were taken from zones 2 and 3 (the more proximal and distal sites of the abaxial <b>white</b> <b>line)</b> of the medial and lateral claws of both hind feet on d 1 and on 5 further occasions over 6 mo. The samples were analyzed at 100 % water saturation. Hoof slivers were notched to ensure that {{tensile strength}} was measured specifically across the <b>white</b> <b>line</b> region. The tensile stress at failure was measured in MPa and was adjusted for the cross-sectional area of the notch site. Data were analyzed in a multilevel model, which accounted for the repeated measures within cows. All other variables were entered as fixed effects. In the final model, there was considerable variation in strength over time. Tensile strength was significantly higher in medial compared with lateral claws, and zone 2 was significantly stronger than zone 3. Where the <b>white</b> <b>line</b> was visibly damaged the tensile strength was low. Biotin supplementation did not affect the tensile strength of the <b>white</b> <b>line.</b> Results {{of this study indicate that}} damage to the <b>white</b> <b>line</b> impairs its tensile strength and that in horn with no visible abnormality the <b>white</b> <b>line</b> is weaker in the lateral hind claw than the medial and in zone 3 compared with zone 2.
