If the siege was foreseen, the castle's peacetime complement of three to twenty men could be doubled or tripled. And in an emergency, at least the higher ranks could take refuge in the main tower. A castle was only regarded as conquered when the bergfried had fallen. This could take some weeks. During this time the attacker had to continue to feed and pay his men. Sometimes, therefore, the mercenaries of the besieger just ran away or even turned against their commander, if they had to <b>wait</b> <b>too</b> long for success.|$|E

25|$|E. L. Konigsburg's {{young adult}} novel A Proud Taste for Scarlet and Miniver {{takes place in}} Heaven of the late 20th century, where Eleanor of Aquitaine, Empress Matilda, and William the Marshall are waiting for King HenryII to be {{admitted}} to eternity at last. The Abbot Suger stops to chat with Eleanor and stays to <b>wait,</b> <b>too.</b> To pass the time, the four recall Eleanor's time on Earth. The flashbacks on earth are set during the Middle Ages in France and England, with a brief trip to the Holy Land. The flashbacks trace the highlights of Eleanor's life from 1137, when she was 15 years old and about to wed Louis Capet, soon to be King LouisVII of France, to her death in 1204. Her life encompasses the rule of England by her husband Henry II and by her sons Richard and John. Originally published in 1973, the novel was put back in print by Atheneum in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Still {{trailing}} 3–0 {{and having}} only one hit {{to show for}} their outing so far, the New York bats came alive {{in the bottom of}} the sixth against Hurst. After recording the first out, pinch hitter Lee Mazzilli and Mookie Wilson recorded back to back hits and Tim Teufel drew a walk to load the bases. Keith Hernandez singled to drive in Mazzilli and Wilson, and Gary Carter followed with a liner to right that Evans dove to try to catch but could not come up with. Pinch runner Wally Backman, who came in to run for Teufel, scored the tying run but Hernandez, who had to wait and see if the ball was going to be caught by Evans, got a late jump and was thrown out as Evans was able to relay the throw to Spike Owen. Hernandez got into an argument with right field umpire Dale Ford, claiming that his delay in ruling on Evans' play caused him to <b>wait</b> <b>too</b> long before advancing. With two outs, Hurst faced Darryl Strawberry and retired him.|$|E
500|$|Noting the song's [...] "hit potential", Leng {{views the}} {{cancellation}} as [...] "ne {{of the more}} anomalous features" [...] of Harrison's musical career. Leng has speculated that the single was withdrawn because of the similarity between [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] and [...] "Give Me Love". Author Andrew Grant Jackson suggests {{that the reason for}} the cancellation was due to [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] having a similar sound to [...] "When I'm Dead and Gone", a 1970 hit song by McGuinness Flint. Although Harrison did not enjoy success with [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] as a single, Leng and Inglis comment that the song anticipated a number of radio-friendly singles by ELO during the 1970s, particularly their 1976 hit [...] "Livin' Thing".|$|E

500|$|Simon Leng {{refers to}} [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] as [...] "one of George Harrison's most perfect pop confections", while praising its guitar fills and musical arrangement. Describing it as a [...] "single-that-never-was", Leng {{suggests}} that the song {{would have been a}} [...] "certain number 1". To Huntley, [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] is [...] "a superlative slice of almost McCartney-esque pop", with Harrison's [...] "exquisite slide guitar" [...] a particular highlight.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] {{is a song}} by English rock {{musician}} George Harrison, {{released on}} his 1973 album Living in the Material World. It {{was scheduled to be}} issued as a single in September that year, as the follow-up to [...] "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)", but the release was cancelled. Music critics have traditionally viewed [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] as a highlight of the Material World album, praising its pop qualities and production, with some considering the song worthy of hit status.|$|E
500|$|Harrison biographer Simon Leng views [...] "pop-soul music" [...] as [...] "the obvious root" [...] of [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] and cites musical tension as one {{facet of}} the pop-soul style that Harrison adopts. This tension {{is evident in the}} [...] "implie dissonance" [...] during the verses, Leng adds, when Harrison moves from an F major chord to D-flat major. In {{reference}} to a lyric in the verses, Clayson suggests: [...] "Although 'Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long' betrayed that George's sublimation of lust [...] was by no means total, its consummation was, nonetheless, 'like it came from above'." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{with all}} the new songs on his 1973 album Living in the Material World, George Harrison wrote [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] in 1971–72, a period of {{heightened}} devotion to Hindu spirituality on his part. [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] is a love song, and in light of problems in Harrison's marriage to Pattie Boyd at the time, Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley remarks: [...] "it's interesting to speculate as to who it was written about..." [...] Author Jeff Walker suggests that the song's apparently non-devotional subject matter may have resulted from Harrison and Boyd's marital difficulties.|$|E
500|$|Inglis {{writes that}} the message of [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] is [...] "in the title". The theme of waiting is also central to a track that Harrison wrote in 1967 while in the Beatles, [...] "Blue Jay Way", and a similar {{sentiment}} appears in his 1970–71 solo hit [...] "My Sweet Lord", through the line [...] "I {{really want to see}} you, Lord, but it takes so long". In the latter lyric, Harrison expresses his impatience to see and know God, and Harrison biographer Geoffrey Giuliano interprets [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] as a further reflection of the singer's spiritual concerns.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the 2006 remastered album, for Mojo magazine, Mat Snow said that [...] "this long overdue reissue is worth it alone for four {{wonderful}} songs", of which [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] "reveals the lusty lad within the orange robes" [...] associated with Hare Krishna devotees. More recently, Snow has described Material World as [...] "a treat for the ears" [...] and Harrison as [...] "an old-school pop tunesmith to his marrow, [...] worked hard to ensure the choruses of 'Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long,' 'The Day the World Gets 'Round,' and 'Who Can See It' caught the ear with their deep and delicious emotion".|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} The Words and Music of George Harrison, Ian Inglis writes that [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] {{incorporates}} {{many of the}} elements of pop composition pioneered during the early 1960s at New York's Brill Building, where songwriters such as Barry Mann, Carole King and Gerry Goffin began their careers. Inglis lists these [...] "stock motifs" [...] as [...] "a repetitive and attractive melody", [...] "a stereotypical choice of language", [...] "the familiar topic of lost, or unrequited, love" [...] and [...] "the conventional form of address from a man to a woman, in the persistent use of 'baby'". These elements appear in the song's chorus, where Harrison sings: [...] "How I love you / Baby, so don't let me <b>wait</b> <b>too</b> long." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the 2014 reissue of Harrison's Apple catalogue, for Classic Rock, Paul Trynka {{writes that}} Living in the Material Word [...] "sparkles with many gems", and adds: [...] "but it's the more {{restrained}} tracks – Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long, Who Can See It – that entrance: gorgeous pop songs, {{all the more}} forceful for their restraint." [...] Writing for PopMatters, Scot Elingburg pairs the song with [...] "Be Here Now" [...] as [...] "would-be hits" [...] from Material World that [...] "offer {{much more than just}} Harrison's Hindu-inspired teachings; they also offer up the chance for larger dialogue within music." [...] Nick DeRiso, co-founder of the music website Something Else!, includes [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] among the highlights of Harrison's solo career on Apple Records, and terms it [...] " [...] masterpiece of coiled anticipation".|$|E
500|$|An upbeat Harrison {{song in the}} mould of [...] "What Is Life" [...] and [...] "You", [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] has {{regularly}} been {{singled out}} {{as one of the}} highlights of Living in the Material World. In his album review for Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden called the track [...] "a gorgeous, rollicking love song", while Billboard magazine listed it second among the album's [...] "best cuts", after the title track. In Melody Maker, Michael Watts wrote of the song's [...] "Spector touches", including [...] "a crashing two-beat on piano and a great surge of drums, straight from [...] 'Be My Baby'". While otherwise lamenting the overt religiosity of the album, Tony Tyler of the NME identified [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] as the best track, describing it as [...] "bright and hopeful" [...] with a [...] "memorable melody to commend it".|$|E

500|$|Aside from Harrison on {{acoustic}} guitars, {{the musicians}} {{on the basic}} track for [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] were Nicky Hopkins (piano), Wright (keyboards), Voormann (bass), and Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner (both on drums). The Starr–Keltner combination followed their pairing at the Concert for Bangladesh shows; this song {{was one of three}} tracks on Material World to which Starr contributed, in between his film work on That'll Be the Day and Son of Dracula. In addition, Pete Ham and Tom Evans of the Apple group Badfinger attended some of the sessions in October, playing acoustic rhythm guitar as they had on much of All Things Must Pass. As with Ham's playing on the 1971-recorded [...] "Try Some, Buy Some", however, any contribution they might have made to [...] "Don't Let Me <b>Wait</b> <b>Too</b> Long" [...] went uncredited on the official release.|$|E
500|$|Following Harrison's {{death in}} November 2001 {{at the age}} of 58, the Late B.P.

500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the main recording sessions, Harrison carried out overdubbing on the basic tracks through to the end of February 1973.
