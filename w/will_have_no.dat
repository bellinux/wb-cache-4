5|$|The {{nucleus of}} an atom <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> spin {{when it has}} even numbers of both {{neutrons}} and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of thermal equilibrium. However, for certain elements (such as xenon-129) {{it is possible to}} polarize a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called hyperpolarization. This has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E
5|$|Tahna orders Kira {{at gunpoint}} {{to return to}} the station, {{intending}} to collapse the wormhole with an explosive device, because then Bajor <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which he sees as a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this {{was the right thing to}} do someday.|$|E

6000|$|Carol was furious. [...] "I don't {{pretend that}} <b>Will</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> faults. But one thing I do know: He's as simple-hearted {{about what you}} call 'goings-on' as a babe.

25|$|In Niger, the {{government}} {{strategy was to}} continue military pressure on the MNJ, declaring them criminal gangs with whom they <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> negotiations.

25|$|This {{approach}} (called MPQS, Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve) is {{ideally suited}} for parallelization, since each processor {{involved in the}} factorization can be given n, the factor base {{and a collection of}} polynomials, and it <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> need to communicate with the central processor until it is finished with its polynomials.|$|E
50|$|The law behind wills becomes tedious {{when many}} parties are not present, {{typically}} in cases with limited family members. This mainly occurred after World War Two where many <b>wills</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> possible recipients so the assets {{went to the}} government. Wills are often confused with trust funds, but wills are only present at death whereas trust funds can be accessed {{during the time that}} the creator of the fund is still alive.|$|R

25|$|This {{technique}} involves striking {{your opponent}} as you realise he/she {{is about to}} strike. This is because their concentration will be on striking and their posture <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> flexibility to respond. Thus debana-waza is ideal. This can be to any part of your opponent's body, with valid strikes being: debana-men, debana-kote, and debana-tsuki.|$|E
25|$|Spiders do not feed {{on humans}} and {{typically}} bites {{occur as a}} defense mechanism. This can occur from unintentional contact or trapping of the spider.

5|$|Reviews {{were mixed}} for the episode.

There was acclaim for the subplot featuring Becky's (Lauren Potter) pursuit of Artie (Kevin McHale), and her mental voiceovers by Helen Mirren.|$|R
