50|$|The Canal du Centre, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Canal du Charollais, is a French canal running from Digoin, where it now joins the Canal latéral à la Loire, to the River Saône in Chalon-sur-Saône. It was opened in 1792 {{and was the first}} <b>watershed</b> <b>canal</b> allowing boats to pass from the north of France to the south. It is 112.1 km long and has 61 locks.

50|$|The Mayenne was navigable in {{its natural}} state up to Château-Gontier. Works were {{undertaken}} in the 16th century to make the river navigable upstream from here to Laval; royal decrees by François I in 1536 and 1537 authorised the necessary works, including flash locks. Economic expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries justified engineering with locks and weirs not only to Laval but also upstream to Mayenne. This extension, with 20 locks and weirs, was built {{at the same time}} as about 40 flash locks were replaced by 25 weirs and locks, some in short lock-cuts, between 1853 et 1878. The river was used by barges carrying up to 130 tonnes, and the principal traffics were construction materials (wood and stone), coal from the mines of L'Huisserie, grain, fruit and vegetables. At this time it was planned to build a <b>watershed</b> <b>canal</b> north from Mayenne to the tidal river Orne at Caen, but the project was abandoned as railways became the preferred carrier of freight. The navigation was abandoned after World War II, but restored from the 1970s as a cruising waterway. The upstream section was completed in the early 1990s.|$|E

40|$|Within {{irrigated}} agricultural <b>watersheds,</b> <b>canal</b> networks {{may play}} a crucial role as nitrogen (N) sink. This is due to the intertwined action of macrophytes and microbial communities occurring in the dense net of small watercourses. We hypothesize that vegetated canals may buffer relevant fractions of excess N from agriculture via microbial denitrification, and that vegetation provides multiple interfaces that greatly support the activity of bacteria. To test these hypotheses, we measured net dinitrogen (N 2) fluxes in bare sediments and at the reach-scale in vegetated ditches. As study areas we selected canals subjected to diffuse N pollution, laying in a lowland sub-basin of the Po River (northern Italy). Denitrification was evaluated on the basis of changes in dissolved N 2 :Ar, measured by Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry. Complementary data were obtained via upstream-downstream inorganic N balances and intact core incubations targeting sedimentary N fluxes. Denitrification was the major pathway for N removal, with rates at the reach-scale (5 - 25 mmolNm- 2 d- 1) up to one order of magnitude higher than in sediment alone (3 - 7 mmolNm- 2 d- 1). Results highlighted that N uptake by macrophyte stands was quantitatively small; however, aquatic vegetation provided multiple interfaces for microbial growth and N-related processes. Our data suggest that 1 ha of vegetated canal may remove between 150 and 560 kgNyr- 1. In the study area, an average canal density of ~ 0. 05 linear kmha- 1 of agricultural land has the potential to buffer 5 - 17 % of the excess N from agriculture (~ 60 kgNha- 1 yr- 1).

40|$|The role of {{physical}} barriers in promoting population divergence and genetic structuring is well known. While {{it is well}} established that animals can show genetic structuring at small spatial scales, less well-resolved is how {{the timing of the}} appearance of barriers affects population structure. This study uses the Panama <b>Canal</b> <b>watershed</b> as a test of the effects of old and recent riverine barriers in creating population structure in Saguinus geoffroyi, a small cooperatively breeding Neotropical primate. Mitochondrial sequences and microsatellite genotypes from three sampling localities revealed genetic structure across the Chagres River and the Panama Canal, suggesting that both waterways act as barriers to gene flow. F-statistics and exact tests of population differentiation suggest population structure on either side of both riverine barriers. Genetic differentiation across the Canal, however, was less than observed across the Chagres. Accordingly, Bayesian clustering algorithms detected between two and three populations, with localities across the older Chagres River always assigned as distinct populations. While conclusions represent a preliminary assessment of genetic structure of S. geoffroyi, this study adds to the evidence indicating that riverine barriers create genetic structure across a wide variety of taxa in the Panama <b>Canal</b> <b>watershed</b> and highlights the potential of this study area for discerning modern from historical influences on observed patterns of population genetic structure...|$|R

Biogeographic patterns of LMA freshwater fish communities at the spatial extent of LMA indicate that biological differences among species as well as regional and historical processes are quintessential to explaining the patters of turnover of community composition and species richness across the LMA Isthmus. The study of LMA freshwater fishes permits the inference that ecological interactions among species are not independent of a region's history, suggesting that regional and historical processes probably play an ongoing role in the maintenance of LMA freshwater fish communities. In addition, {{the study of the}} natural experiment of the Panama Canal provides a clear demonstration that dispersal, rather than local deterministic processes such as competition and predation, previously set the upper limit of the number of fish species coexisting in local communities.

40|$|Background: Hatchery-induced {{selection}} and direct {{effects of the}} culture environment can both cause captively bred fish populations to survive at low rates and behave unnaturally in the wild. New approaches to fish rearing in conservation hatcheries seek to reduce hatchery-induced selection, maintain genetic resources, and improve the survival of released fish. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study used acoustic telemetry to compare three years of early marine survival estimates for two wild steelhead populations to survival of two populations raised at two different conservation hatcheries located within the Hood <b>Canal</b> <b>watershed.</b> Steelhead smolts from one conservation hatchery survived with probabilities similar to the two wild populations (freshwater: 95. 8 – 96. 9 %, early marine: 10. 0 – 15. 9 %), while smolts from the other conservation hatchery exhibited reduced freshwater and early marine survival (freshwater: 50. 2 – 58. 7 %, early marine: 2. 6 – 5. 1 %). Freshwater and marine travel rates {{did not differ significantly}} between wild and hatchery individuals from the same stock, though hatchery smolts did display reduced migration ranges within Hood Canal. Between-hatchery differences in rearing density and vessel geometry likely affected survival and behavior after release and contributed to greater variation between hatcheries than between wild populations.

(1) What {{is the impact of}} mesoclimatic gradients and dispersal limitation on phylogenetic turnover and species turnover? (2) How does phylogenetic turnover between continents compare in intensity with the turnover driven by climatic gradients at a regional scale? (3) Are independent phylogenetic reconstructions of the mesoclimatic niche of clades congruent between continents? Location Panama <b>Canal</b> <b>Watershed</b> and Western Ghats (India), two anciently divergent biogeographic contexts but with comparable rainfall gradients. Methods Using floristic data for 50 1 -ha plots in each region, independent measures of phylogenetic turnover (?ST) and species turnover (Jaccard) between plots were regressed on geographic and ecological distances. Mesoclimatic niches were reconstructed for each node of the phylogeny and compared between the two continents. Results (1) The phylogenetic turnover within each region is best explained by mesoclimatic differences (environmental filtering), while species turnover depends both on mesoclimatic differences and geographic distances (dispersal limitation). (2) The phylogenetic turnover between continents (?ST = 0. 009) is comparable to that caused by mesoclimatic gradients within regions (?ST = 0. 010) and both effects seem cumulative. (3) Independent phylogenetic reconstructions of the mesoclimatic niches were strongly correlated between the two continents (r = 0. 61), despite the absence of shared species.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The Hood <b>Canal</b> <b>watershed</b> is a {{saltwater}} fjord {{that provides}} ample and diverse opportunities for tourism and recreational {{activities such as}} camping, boating, shellfishing, swimming, and hiking. The current tourism literature {{does not have a}} strong focus on local recreation trends and whether locals partake in different recreational activities than tourists who visit the same region. In order to address this gap, I collected and analyzed social spatial data using an online map survey to understand the activities of Hood Canal locals and people who visit the region. InSEAM, an online tool, was used to test if this method is useful in gathering spatial data. The survey asked various demographic questions and perception questions about the health of the Hood Canal and the impact of tourism-recreational activities. On the actual map, participants drew polygons, lines or points to represent locations of where they enjoy tourism/recreational activities. I recoded the data into seven larger categories and analyzed using ArcGIS and a Pearson  2 test. Non-motorized shore activities accounted for the most activities done in Hood Canal. Results show there are differences among the types of activities locals and tourists participated in as well as in their perception of how their activities impacted the overall health of the Hood Canal. InSEAM was effective in collecting data stored in GIS format and removed the need to digitize paper maps or convert them into GIS formats. It provided a simple way to engage stakeholders by allowing them to complete the survey at their convenience. To make the tool more effective, educational information about mapping should be sent out to users beforehand. The results provide tourism brokers, local residents, tourists and managers with visual representations of how the watershed is being used for recreation and tourism purposes by locals and by tourists...|$|R
40|$|Saccharum spontaneum L. is an {{invasive}} {{grass that}} has spread extensively in disturbed areas throughout the Panama <b>Canal</b> <b>watershed</b> (PCW), {{where it has}} created a fire hazard and inhibited reforestation efforts. Currently physical removal of aboveground biomass is the primary means of controlling this weed, which is largely ineffective and does little to inhibit spread of the species. Little is known about reproduction of this species, although it is both rhizomatous and produces abundant seed. Here we report {{a series of studies}} looking at some of the basic reproductive mechanisms and strategies utilised by S. spontaneum to provide information to support development of better targeted management strategies. We found that seed produced between September and November was germinable both in the lab and in situ. Genetic diversity of mature stands was assessed using microsatellite markers and found to be high, even at small scales. Studies of vegetative reproduction showed that buds on stems that had been dried for up to six weeks were still capable of sprouting. Separate experiments showed that stem fragments could sprout when left on the surface or buried shallowly and that larger pieces sprouted more readily than smaller pieces. Collectively these results demonstrate that S. spontaneum in the PCW has the capability to produce many propagules that can successfully recruit and it is likely that seed dispersal drives the spread of the species. Timing of management actions to reduce flowering would significantly reduce the seed load into the environment and help to prevent spread to new sites. Similarly, where biomass is cut, cutting stems into smaller pieces will allow the stems to dry out and reduce the ability of buds to sprout. Additionally, attention should be paid to prevent accidental transport to new sites on machinery...|$|R
40|$|Increased global {{awareness}} {{of the loss of}} environmental services that derive from deforestation has triggered calls to promote the recovery of tropical forests. I studied two types of community interactions in tropical forest restoration. The first two chapters present the results of applying tools from phylogenetic ecology to tropical forest restoration. I hypothesized that negative biotic interactions, driven mainly by shared deleterious symbionts, would reduce the natural recruitment of closely related species and the performance of planted seedlings beneath a small monoculture tree canopy. I found non-random phylogenetic structure among coexisting natural recruits, and between them and the overstory trees. The natural recruits beneath legume trees were composed mainly of species further related {{to each other and to}} the overstory tree than expected by chance (phylogenetically overdispersed), whereas natural recruits beneath non-legume tree species were more closely related to each other than expected (phylogenetically clustered). This pattern was due to the disproportionate recruitment of Piperaceae, an ancestral clade to all other species, under legume canopies; versus abiotic filters beneath non-legumes leading to dominance of the more recently evolved Asteraceae. In planting experiments, I found the lowest performance on seedlings of the same species as the overstory tree. It was not clear whether the decreased performance of conspecifics was driven by shared pathogens with the overstory because there was no significant phylogenetic signal in host sharing among pathogens. These results suggest that phylogenetic ecology provides some useful information about community assembly processes during tropical forest succession that can guide selection of which species to plant. Finally, I assessed a multi-stakeholder governance regime implemented by the Panamanian Government aimed at achieving sustainable development of the Panama <b>Canal</b> <b>Watershed.</b> I found the governance regime creates important spaces for environmental education and communication between the communities and government actors led by top-down power dynamics. However, tangible results are still mostly lacking. The local communities expressed frustration with the lack of projects and quality of life improvements to date, and the Panama Canal Authority struggles to achieve greater collaboration from other government institutions to solve pressing social issues in the watershed...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 A 2012 {{study that}} tested three pilot onsite denitrifying {{treatment}} systems found a Vegetated Denitrifying Woodchip Bed achieved the highest total nitrogen removal. However, denitrification {{in this system}} was also much more temperature dependent than the other systems tested. This study examined the nitrogen removal performance of two current Denitrifying Woodchip Bed systems that were recently installed in the Hood <b>Canal</b> <b>watershed.</b> Data from the Hood Canal systems, and the 2012 pilot systems, was analyzed to establish the casual basis for denitrification temperature dependence. The results of this analysis suggest three things. First, the Hood Canal systems had incomplete nitrification, but still had 50 % greater input nitrate concentration than the woodchip bed reactor tested in 2012. Second, in all three wood chip reactors tested the available carbon from the woodchips decreased with temperature, reducing the electron donor availability. Third, carbon released from the woodchips was a lower quality electron donor and therefore more sensitive to temperature fluctuations. A benchtop experiment was carried out to test denitrification rates using synthetic wastewater media and woodchip-based media as electron donors in typical summer and winter temperatures for western Washington State. This experiment showed nitrate removal in the high temperature synthetic wastewater treatment was extremely rapid with 98 % removal after only 2 days. Conversely, nitrate removal in the high temperature woodchip-based was 89 % after 12 days. In the cold synthetic wastewater treatment nitrate removal averaged 79 % after 12 days, whereas in the cold woodchip media nitrate removal averaged 39 % after 12 days. This study indicates that woodchip based carbon is a much lower quality electron donor, and the combination of low temperature, low quality organic substrates and low woodchip substrate concentrations may greatly slow nitrate removal. To alleviate these temperature constraints on cold weather nitrate removal in woodchip-based reactors I recommend supplementing the reactors with additional carbon. This can be done effectively by dosing the systems with methanol or another simple form carbon substrate. The amount of methanol required to provide additional carbon sufficient enough for complete denitrification was calculated to cost $ 5. 25 a month...|$|R
