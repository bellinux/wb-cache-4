Several SS personnel oversaw the killings at each gas chamber, while the bulk of the <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> by the mostly Jewish prisoners known as Sonderkommandos (special squads). Sonderkommando responsibilities included guiding victims to the gas chambers and removing, looting, and cremating the corpses.|$|E

5|$|Although the Act of 1975 had {{specified}} that {{a portion of}} the profits from land sales be used to maintain the remaining cemetery, little restoration <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> and the cemetery continued to revert to wilderness. With the new owners of the land interested only in redeveloping those parts of the cemetery not currently in use, the cemetery itself sank further into neglect.|$|E
5|$|Bonfiglioli often bought {{material}} from writers without an established reputation; {{he did not}} make any special effort to acquire stories from well-known names. He was known for writing long and helpful rejection letters to newcomers, {{but he also had}} a reputation for laziness, and much of the day-to-day editorial <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> by assistants—first James Parkhill-Rathbone, and then Keith Roberts.|$|E
5|$|Conversion {{planning}} {{began in}} May 1942, {{and had the}} conversion been finished, {{she would have been}} the largest German aircraft carrier, longer even than the purpose-built s. The work was canceled in November 1942, however, after design problems, including serious instability and structural weaknesses, proved to be irreconcilable. No <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> on the ship, which was eventually seized by the US Army and used as a troop transport following the end of the war.|$|E

5|$|In 1205, the Republic of Venice invaded Dalmatia {{with the}} forces of the Fourth Crusade. Ragusa was forced to pay a tribute, {{eventually}} becoming a source of supplies for Venice, thus saving itself from being sacked like Zadar in the Siege of Zara, used as Venice's naval base in the southern Adriatic Sea. In the 14th century, after liberation from Venetian supremacy, extensive <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> on the walls to ensure the republic's liberty.|$|E

Weight reduction was accomplished by removal of all gun turrets and armor plating.

This take featured Pappalardi's Mountain band mate, Leslie West, on lead guitar.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslavs re-launched Split in March 1950 {{to free up}} the slipway, but {{no other}} <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>done.</b> In 1953 there was a {{rapprochement}} with the NATO powers and the American and the British agreed to help complete the ship. The Tosi machinery ordered earlier had been used for other ships so the British agreed to furnish her propulsion machinery while the Americans provided the ship's armament, fire-control equipment and electronics.|$|E

5|$|The {{net result}} was that little <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> on the Waterloo Medal. In 1832, the Master of the Mint, Lord Auckland, noted that the dies had been long delayed. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, also complained about the delay, feeling the medal could be {{finished}} in 18 months. He offered Pistrucci extra payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci declined.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of corporate}} enterprises became {{common in the}} 11th century.

5|$|The {{publisher}} was Clark Publishing Company for {{the first}} two issues.

With the third issue, Greenleaf Publishing Company became the publisher and William Hamling took over as editor, a position he retained throughout the magazine's life.|$|E
