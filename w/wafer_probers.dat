50|$|VIEW Engineering {{was founded}} in Canoga Park, California in 1976. The next year, VIEW {{introduced}} the word's first automated, 3-axis, machine vision-based, dimensional measurement system - the RB-1. The RB-1 was the forerunner of modern machine vision-based Coordinate-measuring machines (CMMs). This was followed in 1978 {{by the introduction of}} the first pattern recognition (Template matching) system for automated Wirebonding machines and <b>Wafer</b> <b>probers</b> - the PR-1.|$|E

50|$|The <b>wafer</b> <b>prober</b> also {{exercises}} any test circuitry on the wafer scribe lines.Some companies {{get most}} of their information about device performance from these scribe line test structures.|$|R
50|$|A <b>wafer</b> <b>prober</b> is {{a machine}} {{used to test}} {{integrated}} circuits. For electrical testing a set of microscopic contacts or probes called a probe card are held in place whilst the wafer, vacuum-mounted on a wafer chuck, is moved into electrical contact. When a die (or array of dice) have been electrically tested the <b>prober</b> moves the <b>wafer</b> to the next die (or array) and the next test can start. The <b>wafer</b> <b>prober</b> is usually responsible for loading and unloading the wafers from their carrier (or cassette) and is equipped with automatic pattern recognition optics capable of aligning the wafer with sufficient accuracy to ensure accurate registration between the contact pads on the wafer and {{the tips of the}} probes.|$|R
40|$|RF {{signals from}} mobile phones or WLAN {{transmitters}} can affect DC parametric measurements. A transistor test structure inside a <b>wafer</b> <b>prober</b> can behave as a GHz receiver when the needles or the manipulators that probe these transistors pick up sufficiently strong GHz signals. This paper shows {{examples of such}} occurrences and presents a technique for assessing the vulnerability of parametric measurement systems for GHz signals...|$|R
40|$|Miniaturised amperometric {{transducers}} {{have been}} realised on silicon wafers integrating a disk ultra-microelectrode array as working electrodes, a large counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl pseudo reference electrode in a three-electrode configuration. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) {{have been evaluated}} as tools for rapid on-wafer determination of characteristic device parameters. Here, {{we report on the}} application of an automated <b>wafer</b> <b>prober</b> in combination with appropriate electroanalytical techniques to realise an automated quality control of UMA on wafer level...|$|R
50|$|Normally a {{probe card}} is {{inserted}} into an equipment called a <b>wafer</b> <b>prober,</b> inside which {{position of the}} wafer to be tested will be manipulated so {{that there should be}} a precise contact between the probe card and wafer. Once the probe card and the wafer is loaded, a camera in the prober will optically locate several tips on the probe card and several marks or pads on the wafer, and using this information it can align the pads on the device under test (DUT) to the probe card contacts.|$|R
50|$|Wafer {{testing is}} a step {{performed}} during semiconductor device fabrication. During this step, performed before a wafer is sent to die preparation, all individual integrated circuits that are present on the wafer are tested for functional defects by applying special test patterns to them. The wafer testing is performed by a piece of test equipment called a <b>wafer</b> <b>prober.</b> The process of wafer testing {{can be referred to}} in several ways: Wafer Final Test (WFT), Electronic Die Sort (EDS) and Circuit Probe (CP) are probably the most common.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} an inductive {{probe head}} suitable for noninvasive {{characterization of the}} magnetostatic and dynamic parameters of magnetic thin films and multilayers on the wafer scale. The probe {{is based on a}} planar waveguide with rearward high frequency connectors that can be brought in close contact to the wafer surface. Inductive characterization of the magnetic material is carried out by vector network analyzer ferromagnetic resonance. Analysis of the field dispersion of the resonance allows the determination of key material parameters such as the saturation magnetization M-s or the effective damping parameter a(eff). Three waveguide designs are tested. The broadband frequency response is characterized and the suitability for inductive determination of Ms-s and a(eff) is compared. Integration of such probes in a <b>wafer</b> <b>prober</b> could in the future allow wafer scale in-line testing of magnetostatic and dynamic key material parameters of magnetic thin films and multilayers...|$|R
50|$|Reliability of {{semiconductors}} is kept high {{through several}} methods. Cleanrooms control impurities,process control controls processing, and burn-in (short term operation at extremes) and probe and test reduce escapes. Probe (<b>wafer</b> <b>prober)</b> tests the semiconductor die, prior to packaging, via micro-probes connected to test equipment. Wafer testing tests the packaged device, often pre-, and post burn-in {{for a set}} of parameters that assure operation. Process and design weaknesses are identified by applying a set of stress tests in the qualification phase of the semiconductors before their market introduction e. g. according to the AEC Q100 and Q101 stress qualifications. Parts Average Testing is a statistical method for recognizing and quarantining semiconductor die that have a higher probability of reliability failures. This technique identifies characteristics that are within specification but outside of a normal distribution for that population as at-risk outliers not suitable for high reliability applications. Tester-based Parts Average Testing varieties include Parametric Parts Average Testing (P-PAT) and Geographical Parts Average Testing (G-PAT), among others. Inline Parts Average Testing (I-PAT) uses data from production process control inspection and metrology to perform the outlier recognition function.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{advances}} in the electro-optical characterization of InAs/GaSb short-period superlattice infrared photodetectors with cut-off wavelengths in the mid-wavelength and long-wavelength infrared ranges. To facilitate in-line monitoring of the electro-optical device performance at different processing stages we have integrated a semi-automated cryogenic <b>wafer</b> <b>prober</b> in our process line. The prober is configured for measuring current-voltage characteristics of individual photodiodes at 77 K. We employ it to compile a spatial map of the dark current density of a superlattice sample with a cut-off wavelength around 5 um patterned into a regular array of 1760 quadratic mesa diodes with a pitch of 370 um and side lengths varying from 60 to 350 um. The different perimeter-to-area ratios {{make it possible to}} separate bulk current from sidewall current contributions. We find a sidewall contribution to the dark current of 1. 2 × 10 (- 11) A/cm and a corrected bulk dark current density of 1. 1 × 10 - 7 A/cm², both at 200 mV reverse bias voltage. An automated data analysis framework can extract bulk and sidewall current contributions for various subsets of the test device grid. With a suitable periodic arrangement of test diode sizes, the spatial distribution of the individual contributions can thus be investigated. We found a relatively homogeneous distribution of both bulk dark current density and sidewall current contribution across the sample. With the help of an improved capacitance voltage measurement setup developed to complement this technique a residual carrier concentration of 1. 3 × 1015 cm(- 3) is obtained. The work is motivated by research into high performance superlattice array sensors with demanding processing requirements. A novel long-wavelength infrared imager based on a heterojunction concept is presented as an example for this work. It achieves a noise equivalent temperature difference below 30 mK for realistic operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) surface {{micromachining}} {{is a new}} technology for building micrometer ({micro}m) scale mechanical devices on silicon wafers using techniques and process tools borrowed from the manufacture of integrated circuits. Sandia National Laboratories has invested a significant effort in demonstrating the viability of polysilicon {{surface micromachining}} and has developed the Sandia Ultraplanar Micromachining Technology (SUMMiT V{trademark}) process, which consists of five structural levels of polysilicon. A major advantage of polysilicon surface micromachining over other micromachining methods is that thousands to millions of thin film mechanical devices can be built on multiple wafers in a single fabrication lot and will operate without post-processing assembly. However, if thin film mechanical or surface properties do not lie within certain tightly set bounds, micromachined devices will fail and yield will be low. This results in high fabrication costs to attain {{a certain number of}} working devices. An important factor in determining the yield of devices in this parallel-processing method is the uniformity of these properties across a wafer and from wafer to wafer. No metrology tool exists that can routinely and accurately quantify such properties. Such a tool would enable micromachining process engineers to understand trends and thereby improve yield of micromachined devices. In this LDRD project, we demonstrated the feasibility of and made significant progress towards automatically mapping mechanical and surface properties of thin films across a wafer. The MEMS parametrics measurement team has implemented a subset of this platform, and approximately 30 wafer lots have been characterized. While more remains to be done to achieve routine characterization of all these properties, we have demonstrated the essential technologies. These include: (1) well-understood test structures fabricated side-by-side with MEMS devices, (2) well-developed analysis methods, (3) new metrologies (i. e., long working distance interferometry) and (4) a hardware/software platform that integrates (1), (2) and (3). In this report, we summarize the major focus areas of our LDRD project. We describe the contents of several articles that provide the details of our approach. We also describe hardware and software innovations we made to realize a fully automatic <b>wafer</b> <b>prober</b> system for MEMS mechanical and surface property characterization across wafers and from wafer-lot to wafer-lot...|$|R
