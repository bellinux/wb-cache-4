500|$|Neonatal {{circumcision}} {{is usually}} {{elected by the}} parents for non-medical reasons, such as religious beliefs or personal preferences, possibly driven by societal norms. Outside the parts of Africa with high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, {{the positions of the}} world's major medical organizations on non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision range from considering it as having a modest net health benefit that outweighs small risks to viewing it as having no benefit with significant risks for harm. No major medical organization recommends universal neonatal circumcision, and no major medical organization calls for banning it either. The Royal Dutch Medical Association, which expresses some of the strongest opposition to routine neonatal circumcision, does not call for the practice to be made illegal out of their concern that parents <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> the procedure would turn to poorly trained practitioners instead of medical professionals. This argument to keep the procedure within the purview of medical professionals is found across all major medical organizations. In addition, the organizations advise medical professionals to yield to some degree to parental preferences, which are commonly based upon cultural or religious views, in their decision to agree to circumcise. The Danish College of General Practitioners states that circumcision should [...] "only [...] when medically needed, otherwise it is a case of mutilation." ...|$|E

2500|$|While yaoi {{has become}} an {{umbrella}} term in the West for women's manga or Japanese-influenced comics with male-male relationships, {{and it is the}} term preferentially used by American manga publishers for works of this kind, Japan uses the term yaoi to denote dōjinshi and works that focus on sex scenes. In both usages, yaoi / boy's love excludes gei comi (bara), a genre which also depicts gay male sexual relationships but is written for and mostly by gay men. In the West, the term hentai yaoi is sometimes used to denote the most explicit titles. The use of yaoi to denote those works with explicit scenes sometimes clashes with use of the word to describe the genre as a whole, creating confusion between Japanese and Western writers or between Western fans <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> proper usage of the Japanese terms and those who use the Westernized versions. Yaoi can also be used by Western fans as a label for anime or manga-based slash fiction. In Japan, the term yaoi is occasionally written as 801, which can be read as yaoi through Japanese wordplay: the short reading of the number eight is [...] "ya", zero can be read as [...] "o" [...] (a western influence), while the short reading for one is [...] "i".|$|E
2500|$|Marilyn Butler and Alastair Duckworth {{have made}} the case for Austen as a {{conservative}} writer. Butler argues that one measure of a conservative writer is [...] "whether the plot, broadly, suggests a victim suffering at the hands of society". Butler argues that Austen's novels are so structured, and thus conservative. She divides Austen's works into two kinds: stories involving a [...] "Heroine who is Right" [...] and a spokeswoman for conservative orthodoxy, and stories involving a [...] "Heroine who is Wrong" [...] who must learn from her mistakes by recognizing them and resolving to do better. In the novels in which the [...] "Heroine is Right", the same process of error, self-knowledge and resolve to follow reason is present, but in another principal character or characters. The [...] "Heroine who is Right" [...] helps bring about the change in these other characters. Butler contends that [...] "Austen's stress upon her heroines' subordinate role in a family, upon their dutifulness, meditativeness, self-abnegation and self-control, were codes shared with other conservative writers, especially women moralists such as Jane West and Mary Brunton. The acquiescent heroine challenges the hero or heroine of novels of the 1790s by reformists such as Bage, Godwin, Holcroft, Hays, and Wollstonecraft, <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> thinking independently and speaking out." ...|$|E

6000|$|... it {{is obvious}} that they form a gradational series from {{orthodox}} Judaism, on the extreme left, to Paganism, whether philosophic or popular, on the extreme right; and it will further be observed that, while Justin's conception of Christianity is very broad, he rigorously excludes two classes of persons who, in his time, called themselves Christians; namely, those <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> circumcision and other observances of the Law on the part of Gentile converts: that is to say, the strict Judæo-Christians (II.): and, on the other hand, those who assert the lawfulness of eating meat offered to idols--whether they are Gnostic or not (VII.).

6000|$|Let us {{consider}} {{the condition of}} affairs now (A.D. 50-60) in relation to that which obtained in Justin's time, a century later.

They then, according to Paul, simply allowed him to form his congregations of non-legal Gentile converts at Antioch and elsewhere; and {{it would seem that}} it was to these converts, who would come under Justin's fifth category, that the title of [...] "Christian" [...] was first applied. If any of these Christians had acted upon the more than half-permission given by Paul, and had eaten meats offered to idols, they would have belonged to Justin's seventh category.|$|E
60|$|She gave us good {{coffee and}} milk and bread, {{and we went}} out into the town. There was the real Monday morning {{atmosphere}} of an old, same-as-ever provincial town: the vacant feeling of work resumed after Sunday, rather reluctantly; nobody buying anything, nobody quite at grips with anything. The doors of the old-fashioned shops stood open: in Nuoro they have hardly reached the stage of window-displays. One must go inside, into the dark caves, to see what the goods are. Near the doorways of the drapers' shops stood rolls of that fine scarlet cloth, for the women's costumes. In a large tailor's window four women sat sewing, tailoring, and looking out of the window with eyes still Sunday-emancipate and mischievous. Detached men, some in the black and white, stood at the street corners, as if obstinately avoiding the current of work.

60|$|True, {{but who is}} to {{take home}} the shame? Not the {{officers}} of the company, who cannot do more than their best with the materials laid to their hands; not the directors, who cannot create profits beyond the capacity of their line--although justice requires us {{to admit that they}} might reduce expenses, by squabbling less with other companies, and ceasing unfair, because ruinous as well as ungenerous, competition. Clearly the bulk of the shame lies with the shareholders, who encourage opposition for the sake of increasing their own dividends at the expense of their neighbours, and <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> economy in directions which render the line inefficient--to the endangering of their own lives {{as well as those of}} the public. Economy in the matter of railway servants--in other words, their reduction in numbers--necessitates increase of working hours, which, beyond a certain point, implies inefficiency and danger. But the general public are not free from a modicum of this shame, and have to thank themselves if they are maimed and killed, because they descend on railways for compensation with a ruthless hand; (shame to Government here, for allowing it!) and still further, impoverish their already over-taxed coffers. Compensation for injury is just, but compensation as it is, and has been claimed and awarded, is ridiculously unfair, as well as outrageously unwise.|$|E
60|$|This {{flexibility}} {{is not to}} be found in his manner and composition. That derives its immense power from other sources; from passion, intensity, imagination, size, truth, cogency of logical reason. If any one has imbued himself with that exacting love of delicacy, measure, and taste in expression, which was until our own day a sacred tradition of the French, then he will not like Burke. Those <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> charm, on winningness in style, on subtle harmonies and exquisite suggestion, are disappointed in Burke; they even find him stiff and over-coloured. And there are blemishes of this kind. His banter is nearly always ungainly, his wit blunt, as Johnson said of it, and very often unseasonable. We feel that Johnson must have been right in declaring that though Burke was always in search of pleasantries, he never made a good joke in his life. As is usual with a man who has not true humour, Burke is also without true pathos. The thought of wrong or misery moved him less to pity for the victim than to anger against the cause. Then, there are some gratuitous and unredeemed vulgarities; some images whose barbarity makes us shudder, of creeping ascarides and inexpugnable tapeworms. But it is the mere foppery of literature to suffer ourselves to be long detained by specks like these.|$|E
60|$|Let us here {{remark that}} it was exactly what strikes us as the desperate absurdity of the {{assumptions}} of the Social Contract, which constituted the power of that work, when it accidentally fell {{into the hands of}} men who surveyed a national system wrecked in all its parts. The Social Contract is worked out precisely in that fashion which, if it touches men at all, makes them into fanatics. Long trains of reasoning, careful allegation of proofs, patient admission on every hand of qualifying propositions and multitudinous limitations, are essential to science, and produce treatises that guide the wise statesman in normal times. But it is dogma that gives fervour to a sect. There are always large classes of minds to whom anything {{in the shape of a}} vigorously compact system is irresistibly fascinating, and to whom the qualification of a proposition, or the limitation of a theoretic principle is distressing or intolerable. Such persons always come to the front for a season in times of distraction, when the party that knows its own aims most definitely is sure to have the best chance of obtaining power. And Rousseau's method charmed their temperament. A man who handles sets of complex facts is necessarily slow-footed, but one who has only words to deal with, may advance with a speed, a precision, a consistency, a conclusiveness, that has a magical potency over men <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> having politics and theology drawn out in exact theorems like those of Euclid.|$|E
