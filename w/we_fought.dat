25|$|The German was {{far more}} skilled than the Japanese. Most of the Japanese that <b>we</b> <b>fought</b> were not skilled men. Not skilled leaders. The German had a {{professional}} army....

They fought very, very hard, but they were not nearly as skillful as the Germans. But the German didn't have the tenacity of the Japanese.|$|E

500|$|After {{staying in}} Limpsfield, Surrey, {{for a few}} days, Crane and Taylor settled in Ravensbrook, a plain brick villa in Oxted. [...] Referring to {{themselves}} as Mr. and Mrs. Crane, the couple lived openly in England, but Crane concealed the relationship from {{his friends and family}} in the United States. [...] Admired in England, Crane thought himself attacked back home: [...] "There seem so many of them in America who want to kill, bury and forget me purely out of unkindness and envy and—my unworthiness, if you choose", he wrote. [...] Velestino the dog sickened and died soon after their arrival in England, on August 1. [...] Crane, who had a great love for dogs, wrote an emotional letter to a friend an hour after the dog's death, stating that [...] "for eleven days <b>we</b> <b>fought</b> death for him, thinking nothing of anything but his life." [...] The Limpsfield-Oxted area was home to members of the socialist Fabian Society and a magnet for writers such as Edmund Gosse, Ford Madox Ford and Edward Garnett.

500|$|In his prime, Smith {{was widely}} {{recognised}} by both contemporaries and rivals as a formidable negotiator. Hempstone considered him [...] "a man too principled (or short-sighted) to compromise {{with what he}} regards as wrong", while Welensky compared dealing with him to [...] "trying to nail jelly to a wall". He had an [...] "iron nerve", to quote his RF colleague PK van der Byl, and a reputation for [...] "icy calm"; he almost never got angry or raised his voice. He spoke with [...] "a nasal monologue" [...] as Peter Younghusband described it—"uninspiring even by Rhodesian oratorical standards". His open, informal association with the general public fostered the impression among white Rhodesians that their Prime Minister was still an [...] "ordinary, decent fellow", which Berlyn cites as {{a major factor in}} his enduring popularity. Welensky described him in 1978 as wielding an [...] "almost hypnotic influence" [...] over the Rhodesian electorate, which helped him to win [...] "election after election... hands down". He also had the grudging respect of at least some of his black nationalist opponents during the Bush War; one, quoted anonymously by People magazine in 1976, asserted that [...] "If we had a leader like Mr Smith, we would have won long ago." [...] Sithole, the long-time ZANU leader, said: [...] "Smith is a fighter. He put up a great fight for his people. We were like two bulls in there, the way <b>we</b> <b>fought.</b> He is a man. I respect him." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), Barcelona on October 10, 2003. Lee described {{the place of}} the filming during an interview with MTV News: [...] "We did it in a cool, old area of town. We shot some of it at this scenic point, and there was a rooftop where you could see Barcelona below. It was really neat." [...] The version of the song used on the video is different from the one off the record, with the band entering the song {{at the end of the}} bridge and a string arrangement by David Campbell. [...] Evanescence wanted the band version to be on the album as well, but [...] "the label was stuck on the demo and wouldn't let us use the version we really wanted. <b>We</b> <b>fought</b> back and forth about it and finally we gave in, but we were all so angry about it." [...] The video was filmed two weeks before Ben Moody's departure from the band. Amy Lee admitted that the visuals in the video were [...] "striking in retrospect", but added that the similarities between what was filmed and Moody's departure were coincidental: [...] "We shot it in Barcelona about a week before Ben left the band unexpectedly. I think none of us knew, including him, that he was going anywhere. And when we got the video back and watched it, it was right after he had left. And it's bizarre how much the video is about that. We all sat there with goose bumps, like, 'Holy crap. We've got to watch that again.'"
