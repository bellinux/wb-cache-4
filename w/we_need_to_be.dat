And the men who killed them were not, as in their vanity they claimed on their ludicrous videos, 'soldiers'. They were deluded, narcissistic inadequates. They were criminals. They were fantasists. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very clear about this. On the streets of London {{there is no such}} thing as a war on terror. The fight against {{terrorism}} on the streets of Britain is not a war.

500|$|The 2006 final was {{the first}} time that Arsenal had reached the showpiece match; in doing so they became the first club from London to feature in the final. Barcelona were {{appearing}} in the final for the fifth time; their last appearance had been in a 40 loss to Milan in 1994. Two more losses preceded the 1994 final (1961 and 1986), and their only success in the competition came in 1992 when they beat Sampdoria. Barcelona went into the final as domestic league champions, having won La Liga a fortnight earlier. They were regarded as being the best side on the continent because they possessed players such as Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto'o. Barcelona player Deco dismissed the notion of Barcelona being favourites, insisting they would not be complacent: [...] "Milan were winning 30 last year against Liverpool and ended up losing in the end. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> serious, calm and fully concentrated so that we don't make any errors".|$|E
