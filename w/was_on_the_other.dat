5|$|Alice in Wonderland, {{released}} in 1951, {{met with a}} lukewarm response {{at the box office}} and was a sharp critical disappointment in its initial release. Peter Pan, {{released in}} 1953, <b>was,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, a commercial success and the highest-grossing film of the year. In 1955, Lady and the Tramp was released to higher box office success than any other Disney feature from the studio since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, earning an estimated $7.5 million in rentals at the North American box office in 1955. Lady is significant as Disney's first widescreen animated feature, produced in the CinemaScope process, and was the first Disney animated feature to be released by Disney's own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution.|$|E
5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
5|$|On June15, a {{tropical}} wave with associated instability {{was observed in}} the northwestern Caribbean Sea. It moved into the central Gulf of Mexico on June16, {{and the next day}} developed a weak circulation {{at the same time that}} Tropical Storm Beulah <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the gulf. The system in the eastern gulf moved to the northeast, becoming {{a tropical}} depression by June 18 at 0000 UTC. Moving quickly to the northeast, the system moved across central Florida in less than six hours, making landfall near Tampa Bay and exiting near Cape Canaveral.|$|E
50|$|Haldenstein <b>is</b> {{a station}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Rhaetian Railway's Landquart-Chur metre gauge railway line.

5|$|In 2006, the Sooners {{competed with}} a {{relatively}} young team. Oklahoma listed 72players on the roster and only nine of them were scholarship seniors. Following the dismissal of quarterback Rhett Bomar, fifth-year senior Paul Thompson reconverted back to his former role of quarterback after spending 2005 as a wide receiver. Junior college transfer Joey Halzle was slotted as his backup. Thompson had several wide receivers to look to in 2006, including Malcolm Kelly, Manuel Johnson, and Juaquin Iglesias. Not to mention junior Adrian Peterson, the team's main running back. Most of the Sooners' experience <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the ball. The Sooner linebackers were the most experienced players on the team. The squad was anchored by Rufus Alexander and Zach Latimer. Alexander was ranked as the third best linebacker {{in the country at}} the beginning of the season by College Football News. Behind them were other key players such as Demarrio Pleasant and Lewis Baker. Sophomore Ryan Reynolds, a notable player coming out of high school, was injured in the preseason and therefore was unable to contribute in 2006. In addition to a veteran linebacker squad, Oklahoma had a number of big-name defensive ends. During the preseason, College Football News ranked Larry Birdine, Calvin Thibodeaux and C.J. Ah You in the top 25 best defensive ends for the 2006 season (ranked 14th, 20th, and 22nd, respectively). Oklahoma was the only team with three players in the top 25.|$|E
5|$|The {{station at}} Chalfont Road was built with almost all {{facilities}} {{on the up}} side (the London-bound platform). As Chalfont St Giles, the largest nearby settlement, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the tracks, most passengers travelling {{to and from the}} station were obliged to take a lengthy detour from the single exit. A footpath across the tracks was added in 1925, but an approach road giving access to the station from the southern side of the railway line was not built until 1933. The station had three platforms; one platform in each direction on the London–Aylesbury line, and a bay platform alongside the up platform for trains to Chesham. A run-around loop was built to allow locomotives reversing in the bay platform always to be at the front of their trains. It was built outside the station, meaning locomotives reversing on the Chesham line were obliged to push their trains out of the station before performing the manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|While {{the church}} in Norway {{initially}} had refused to recognise Haakon as King of Norway, it had largely turned to support his claim to the throne by the 1223 meeting, although later disagreements occurred. Despite additionally having become the undisputed ruler of Norway after 1240, Haakon had still not been approved as king by the Pope due to his illegitimate birth. He nonetheless had a strong personal desire to be approved fully as a European king. Several papal commissions were appointed to investigate the matter, and Haakon declared his legitimate son Haakon the Young his successor instead of an older living illegitimate son. Although Haakon had children with his mistress Kanga the Young prior to his marriage with Margrete, it was his children with Margrete that was designated as his successors in accordance with a papal recognition. The Catholic principle of legitimacy was thus established in the Norwegian order of succession, although Haakon's new law still maintained that illegitimate children could be designated as successor {{in the absence of}} any legitimate children or grandchildren—contrary to Catholic principles. While his strong position allowed him to set boundaries to the church's political influence, he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand prepared to give the church much autonomy in internal affairs and relations with the rural society.|$|E

25|$|The WTUL <b>was,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, mistrustful of the National Woman's Party, {{with its}} more individualistic, rights-oriented {{approach}} to woman's equality.

25|$|Following the Louisiana Purchase {{the need}} for {{additional}} roads to the West were recognized by Thomas Jefferson, who authorized the construction of the Cumberland Road in 1806. The Cumberland Road was to connect Cumberland Maryland on the Potomac River with the Wheeling (West) Virginia on the Ohio River, which <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the Alleghany Mountains. Mail roads were also built to New Orleans.|$|E
25|$|The C/30 was a single-shot {{anti-aircraft}} gun that was loaded one round {{at a time}} which dropped its effective rate of fire to a mere 30 rounds per minute, far inferior to the 80-100 rounds per minute of its contemporary, the Bofors 40 mm {{anti-aircraft gun}}. Its muzzle velocity <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand far superior (about 25% higher), which greatly eased the aiming. The SK C/30U gun was modified for use by submarines. All mountings were suitable for use against both air and soft surface targets.|$|E

25|$|Hillman <b>was,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, {{opposed to}} revolutionary {{unionism}} {{and to the}} Communist Party USA. While Hillman had maintained warm relations with the Communist Party during the early 1920s—at a time when his leadership was being challenged both by the Forward {{on the right and}} by Lithuanian and Italian syndicalists and Jewish anarchists within the union on the left—those relations cooled in 1924 when the CP withdrew its support for the Farmer-Labor Party created to support La Follette's candidacy for President. From that point forward Hillman battled the CP activists within his union, but without the massive internecine strife that nearly tore apart the ILGWU in this era.|$|E
25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} terminal of {{the line}} was the Troy station at Monmouth, {{on the line from}} Little Mill Junction, near Pontypool to Ross-on-Wye. The line left the station in an easterly direction, and immediately crossed the River Wye and adjacent low-lying ground by a viaduct. Wyesham Junction followed, where the Coleford Railway diverged. Following the east bank of the Wye, the railway reached Redbrook station, crossing then to the west bank by Redbrook Viaduct, 101 yards. There was a halt at Whitebrook, and the next station was Bigsweir, adjacent to a road bridge over the Wye, but with little population nearby. The station name was later changed to St Briavels. Next was Llandogo Halt, serving a sizable community, and then Brockweir Halt, although the village of Brockweir <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the river, requiring a ferry crossing until a bridge was built in 1906.|$|E

25|$|The Carthaginian {{victory in}} the Battle of Lake Trasimene had removed the Roman {{consular}} army which had prevented the Carthaginians from marching on Rome. The second Roman consular army in Northern Italy, under Gnaeus Servilius Geminus, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the Apennine mountains, near Ariminum, {{and it was in}} no position to hinder Hannibal from marching south. This force also had lost most of its reconnaissance capabilities as its cavalry of 4,000 men had been destroyed in an ambush by Hannibal's lieutenant Maharbal possibly near Assisi, immediately after the battle of Lake Trasimene. The Roman army retreated back to Ariminum after this debacle, and was busy checking the Gallic raids taking place near the Po valley. The initiative now rested with Hannibal, and the Romans had temporarily lost the ability to defend their Italian allies until a new army could be raised.|$|E
25|$|In 1936 {{the long}} {{wait for a}} victory in a final ended at last, with the club lifting the West Of Scotland Cup after a replay against Vale of Clyde. The club was also forced to move home in 1936 when the Glasgow Corporation {{exercised}} a compulsory purchase order on Barrowfield Park in order to construct a new housing scheme (also called Barrowfield) on the land. Waverley identified a new site at Westthorn on the boundary of Parkhead, Dalmarnock and Braidfauld adjacent to Belvidere Hospital. This ground was named New Barrowfield, meaning there were three different football venues known by that name, albeit the others no longer existed. The move brought the club into even closer proximity with Strathclyde (whose Springfield Park ground <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the hospital) and Parkhead (whose Helenslea Park was just yards away across London Road). Parkhead Stadium railway station was nearby.|$|E
25|$|Salvage efforts began immediately, and divers {{were sent}} {{down from a}} salvage tug that arrived from Coco Solo. By 10:00am, {{they were on the}} bottom {{examining}} the wreck. To search for trapped personnel, they hammered on the hull near the aft end of the ship and worked forward. Upon reaching the torpedo room, they heard answering hammer blows from inside the boat. In 1923 the only way the salvage crew could get the men out of the submarine was to lift it physically from the mud using cranes or pontoons. One of the largest crane barges in the world, Ajax, built specifically for handling the gates of the canal locks, was in the Canal Zone. However, there had been a landslide at the famous Gaillard Cut and Ajax <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the slide, assisting in clearing the Canal. The excavation shifted into high gear and by 2:00pm on the afternoon of the sinking, the crane barge Ajax squeezed through and {{was on its way to}} the O-5 site.|$|E
