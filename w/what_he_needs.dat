Impressed by his resolve and shrewdness, she reveals herself and tells him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to know in order to win back his kingdom. She disguises him as an elderly beggar so that he will not be recognized by the suitors or Penelope, and helps him to defeat the suitors.|$|E
500|$|Walter {{undergoes}} a CT scan, {{and the team}} learn Walter had three pieces of his brain tissue removed from his Hippocampus which is the primary repository for long term memory. The pieces were then apparently stored inside the brains of the cured patients fourteen years ago. Knowing only Walter could comprehend the memories concerning how to open a portal to another reality, the shapeshifters kidnap him. By the time the others find Walter, Newton has already learned <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to know and escapes. Olivia manages to stop them, but is {{forced to choose between}} seizing Newton and saving Walter, as he has been given a lethal dose of a neurotoxin that will kill him unless Newton gives them the correct directions. Olivia chooses to save Walter's life, and Newton replies [...] "Now I know how weak you are".|$|E
500|$|Writing in {{the book}} 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, author Tom Moon refers to [...] "the upbeat single 'What Is Life'" [...] {{as an example of}} how Harrison [...] "grabs <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> from his old band – that insinuating hook sense – and uses it to frame an utterly {{comfortable}} metaphysical discourse". Alan Clayson describes [...] "What Is Life" [...] as a seemingly [...] "lovey-dovey pop song" [...] that [...] "craftily renewed the simplistic tonic-to-dominant riff cliché", while Simon Leng credits Harrison's [...] "innate ability to write very fine pop-rock songs" [...] and deems the result [...] "as innovative an exercise in rock-soul as The Temptations' 'Cloud Nine'". Among Harrison biographers, only Ian Inglis is less than enthusiastic, acknowledging that Barham's orchestration and the other musicians give the track [...] "undoubted excitement and energy", but lamenting that the song offers [...] "little overall coherence between words and music".|$|E

500|$|Thalaba travels past Baghdad {{onto the}} ruins of Babylon to find Haruth and Maruth, two angels that know about magic. While searching for them, he runs across Mohareb, an evil warrior. Mohareb offers to take Thalaba through the city and they travel through the cave of Zohak. Zohak, an {{individual}} punished to have snakes constantly eat at his brain, tries to stop them before Mohareb distracts him. The two continue to travel into the dwelling of Haruth and Maruth and, when Mohareb finds out that Thalaba is not evil, attacks him. However, the ring protects Thalaba. After Mohareb claims that magic was the only reason why Thalaba lives, Thalaba decides {{to get rid of}} the ring into a pit before the two resume fighting. Soon after, Mohareb is also thrown into the pit and Thalaba is able to ask the angels <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to defeat his enemies. He is simply told [...] "faith".|$|E
500|$|The poem centres on {{humanity}} and human nature. When the poet sees the figures, {{he wants to}} know their names and laments his ignorance. Eventually, he realizes that they are representative of Love, Ambition, and Poetry. While he longs, he fears they are out of reach and therefore tries to reject them. He argues that love is <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> least and dismisses it by questioning what [...] "love" [...] actually means ("What is Love? and where is it?"). He rejects ambition, but it requires more work ("And for that poor Ambition—it springs / From a man's little heart's short fever-fit;"). Unlike the personas of Love and Ambition, the narrator is unable to find a reason to banish Poesy (Poetry), which reflects the poets' inner conflict: should he abandon poetry to focus on a career in which he can earn a decent living? Keats's sought to write great poetry but feared his pursuit of literary prominence was based on a delusional view of his own merit as a poet. Further, he was incapable of completing his epic, [...] "Hyperion". As Walter Jackson Bate explains, to Keats [...] "Neither a finished 'grand Poem' nor even the semblance of a modest financial return seemed nearer." ...|$|E
500|$|As a visibly distraught Rick hesitates {{to shoot}} Dale, Daryl takes {{the gun and}} inevitably shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl {{to pull away from}} interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up in a way he had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't {{want to be a part}} of the group and have those emotions and care about these people. So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant guy, you can do the things that no one else wants to do. He wants to step in and take that burden away from Rick for a moment. Rick is the one who stepped up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and because of his pain over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. But when he sees Rick hesitate to do the same thing with Dale he knows: this is my moment, this is where I can prove my worth, and he steps in and does <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing the {{apparent}} {{failure of the}} cinematic universe's first team-up film, , to establish a successful equivalent to the MCU, Todd VanDerWerff noted that where the MCU has a television-like [...] "showrunner" [...] in Feige, [...] "the visionary behind Marvel's entire slate", the DCEU has director Zack Snyder, whose DC films [...] "seemingly start from the assumption that people have come not to see an individual story but {{a long series of}} teases for other ones. It's like he knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to do but can't focus on the task at hand. TV certainly isn't immune to that problem, but shows that get caught up in high-concept premises and big-picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled." [...] Subsequently, in May 2016, Warner Bros. gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to [...] "unify the disparate elements of the DC movies" [...] and emulate Marvel's success. The two were made producers on the Justice League films, on top of Johns' involvement in several [...] "solo" [...] films, such as the post-production process of Suicide Squad or the writing process of a standalone Batman film. After the successful release of Wonder Woman in June 2017, DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson stating, [...] "Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn’t make sense, but there’s no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you’ll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who’s creating them." [...] Additionally, DC began focusing on films [...] "completely separate from everything else, set entirely outside the" [...] DCEU as part of a new label, with the first centered on the Joker.|$|E

[...] Stanton reported of Blend that [...] "there's loads of legal nonsense behind it. It was set up with two other people, and one of those people is causing a few problems.

2500|$|As {{their record}} {{improved}} throughout {{the second half}} of the season, the Aggies earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1987. [...] During the tournament, Kavaliauskas averaged 10.5 points and 4.0 rebounds. [...] After winning their first round match-up against Syracuse, the Aggies appeared poised to reach the Sweet 16 when, with 18 seconds left in their second-round game against LSU, teammate Acie Law hit a jumper, giving the Aggies a 57–55 lead. The dream was dashed fifteen seconds later, however, when Darrell Mitchell completed a three-point shot for LSU over the head of Kavaliauskas. Convinced that he was the reason the team lost, Kavaliauskas found a photo of Mitchell's game-winning shot and hung it in his locker as a daily reminder of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to work on.|$|E
2500|$|God {{creates the}} world in six days and consecrates the seventh as a day of rest. God creates the first humans Adam and Eve and all the animals in the Garden of Eden but instructs them not to eat {{the fruit of the}} tree of {{knowledge}} of good and evil. A talking serpent [...] portrayed as a deceptive creature or trickster, entices Eve into eating it anyway, and she entices Adam, whereupon God throws them out and curses them -- Adam to getting <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> only by sweat and work, and Eve to giving birth in pain. This is intepreted by Christians as the fall of humanity. Eve bears two sons, Cain and Abel. Cain kills Abel after God accepts Abel's offering but not Cain's. God then curses Cain. Eve bears another son, Seth, to take Abel's place.|$|E

2500|$|Souders and Peterson {{revealed}} that the theme for season ten will be [...] "facing the ghosts of your past and how [...] helps you move on in the future"; as such, the return of previous cast members will play into this. Souders and Peterson also chose not to erase Lois's memory of Clark's secret, something she discovered in the season nine finale. Instead, Lois helped Clark do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> {{to do to get}} away and fulfill his destiny without telling him that she knows. The producers explained that there would be [...] "some twists and turns" [...] before Lois tells Clark that she knows. Initially helping Clark and Oliver at Watchtower, a secret from her past will define whether Tess ultimately ends on the side of good or bad. Chloe's ending will also be told [...] "in a way that's fitting for Chloe." [...] She will [...] "sacrifice" [...] herself for Oliver, who has been informed that she was killed. As a result, Oliver will spend much of the season looking for Chloe, trying to find who is behind her murder. In addition, Oliver is [...] "literally and figuratively stripped down to his bare essence" [...] early on this season.|$|E
2500|$|Voltairine de Cleyre was an anarchist without {{adjectives}} {{who initially}} identified {{herself as an}} individualist anarchist but later espoused a collectivist form of anarchism, while refusing to identify herself {{with any of the}} contemporary schools. ("The best thing ordinary workingmen or women could do was to organise their industry to get rid of money altogether [...] [...] [...] Let them produce together, co-operatively rather than as employer and employed; let them fraternise group by group, let each use <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> of his own product, and deposit the rest in the storage-houses, and let those others who need goods have them as occasion arises.") She commented that [...] "Socialism and Communism both demand a degree of joint effort and administration which would beget more regulation than is wholly consistent with ideal Anarchism; Individualism and Mutualism, resting upon property, involve a development of the private policeman not at all compatible with my notion of freedom" [...] although she stopped short of denouncing these tendencies as un-anarchistic. ("There is nothing un-Anarchistic about any of [...] until the element of compulsion enters and obliges unwilling persons to remain in a community whose economic arrangements they do not agree to.") [...] Errico Malatesta was another proponent of anarchism without adjectives, stating that [...] "t is not right for us, to say the least, to fall into strife over mere hypotheses." ...|$|E
