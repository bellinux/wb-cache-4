25|$|In 1990, {{long before}} the current {{transfer}} window system had come to English football, {{there was still a}} transfer deadline {{a few weeks before the}} end of the season. Arsenal, who had won the league in 1989, wanted to sign Seaman, but the deal involved Arsenal's keeper John Lukic heading the opposite way on loan. Lukic did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> and the deal broke down and remained unresolved when the deadline passed. As soon as the season ended and clubs were allowed to buy players again, Arsenal manager George Graham came back for Seaman, with £1.3 million (at the time a British record for a goalkeeper) being the agreed fee.

500|$|Protection {{with respect}} to {{conviction}} for offences is guaranteed in {{the right to life}} and personal liberty. According to Article 20, no one can be awarded punishment which is more than what {{the law of the land}} prescribes at that time. This legal axiom is based on the principle that no criminal law can be made retrospective, that is, for an act to become an offence, the essential condition is that it should have been an offence legally at the time of committing it. Moreover, no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. [...] "Compulsion" [...] in this article refers to what in law is called [...] "Duress" [...] (injury, beating or unlawful imprisonment to make a person do something that he does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do).</b> <b>This</b> article is known as a safeguard against self incrimination. The other principle enshrined in this article is known as the principle of double jeopardy, that is, no person can be convicted twice for the same offence, which has been derived from Anglo Saxon law. This principle was first established in the Magna Carta.|$|E
