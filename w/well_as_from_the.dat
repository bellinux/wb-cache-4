5|$|Paleontologists Jose Bonaparte and Fernando Novas {{coined the}} name Abelisauridae in 1985 when they {{described}} the eponymous Abelisaurus.

5|$|While {{ambivalent}} about much of The Five's music, Tchaikovsky remained on friendly terms {{with most of}} its members. In 1869, he and Balakirev worked together on what became Tchaikovsky's first recognized masterpiece, the fantasy-overture Romeo and Juliet, a work which The Five wholeheartedly embraced. The group also welcomed his Second Symphony, subtitled the Little Russian. Despite their support, Tchaikovsky made considerable efforts to ensure his musical independence from the group as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> conservative faction at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.|$|E
5|$|Carter's initial {{pitch for}} The X-Files was {{rejected}} by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, leading to the commission of the pilot. Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim in further developing the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line, and the English television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration was also taken from Carter's memories of watching Kolchak: The Night Stalker and The Twilight Zone in his youth; as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> then-recently released film The Silence of the Lambs, which was the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, {{in order to provide}} the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak.

5|$|During 2011, {{the game}} {{sold more than}} 500,000 copies, 200,000 of which were for the Xbox Live Arcade. It sold over 3 million copies across all {{platforms}} by January 2015.

Opinions were mixed on {{the depth of the}} gameplay, though the variety of options in the combat system was praised.

5|$|Fossilized teeth {{belonging}} to the silky shark {{have been found in}} North Carolina: from the vicinity of two baleen whales, one in mud dating to the Pleistocene-Holocene (circa 12,000 years ago) and the other in Goose Creek Limestone dating to the Late Pliocene (circa 3.5 million years ago – Mya), as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pungo River, dating to the Miocene (23–5.3Mya).

Carcharhinus elongatus, an earlier representative of its lineage with smooth-edged teeth, is known from Oligocene (34–23Mya) deposits in the Old Church formation of Virginia, and the Ashley formation of South Carolina. A set of poorly described, Eocene (56–34Mya) teeth resembling those of this species are known from Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Goldsman took on {{the project}} as he admired the second I Am Legend film adaptation, The Omega Man. A rewrite was done to {{distance}} the project from the other zombie films inspired by the novel, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> recently released 28 Days Later, although Goldsman {{was inspired by the}} scenes of a deserted London in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City. A 40-page scene-by-scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006. When delays occurred on Smith's film Hancock, which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor's films. This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks: production was given a green light, using Goldsman's script and the outline. Elements from Protosevich's script were introduced, while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and solitary confinement. Rewrites continued throughout filming, because of Smith's improvisational skills and Lawrence's preference to keep various scenes silent. The director had watched Jane Campion's film The Piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son, and realized that silence could be very effective cinema.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{pelicans}} {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica. They primarily inhabit warm regions, although breeding ranges extend to latitudes of 45° South (Australian pelicans in Tasmania) and 60° North (American white pelicans in western Canada). Birds of inland and coastal waters, they are absent from polar regions, the deep ocean, oceanic islands (except the Galapagos), and inland South America, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> eastern coast of South America {{from the mouth}} of the Amazon River southwards. Subfossil bones have been recovered from as far south as New Zealand's South Island, although their scarcity and isolated occurrence suggests that these remains may have merely been vagrants from Australia (much as is the case today).|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky {{remained}} friendly {{but never}} intimate {{with most of}} The Five, ambivalent about their music; their goals and aesthetics did not match his. He took pains to ensure his musical independence from them as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> conservative faction at the Conservatory—an outcome facilitated by his acceptance of a professorship at the Moscow Conservatory offered to him by Nikolai Rubinstein, Anton's brother. When Rimsky-Korsakov was offered a professorship at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, it was to Tchaikovsky that he turned for advice and guidance. Later, when Rimsky-Korsakov was under pressure from his fellow nationalists for his change in attitude on music education and his own intensive studies in music, Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, {{told him that he}} fully applauded what he was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. In the 1880s, long after the members of The Five had gone their separate ways, another group called the Belyayev circle took up where they left off. Tchaikovsky enjoyed close relations with the leading members of this group—Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and, by then, Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E
