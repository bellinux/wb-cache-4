40|$|Entropy {{generation}} {{in the flow}} field subjected to a porous block situated in a vertical channel is examined. The effects of channel <b>inlet</b> <b>port</b> height (vertical height between channel <b>inlet</b> <b>port</b> and the block center), porosity, and block aspect ratio on the entropy generation rate due to fluid friction and heat transfer in the fluid are examined. The governing equations of flow, heat transfer, and entropy are solved numerically using a control volume approach. Air is used as the flowing fluid in the channel. A uniform heat flux is considered in the block and natural convection is accommodated in the analysis. It is found that entropy generation rate due to fluid friction increases with increasing <b>inlet</b> <b>port</b> height, while this increase becomes gradual for entropy generation rate due to heat transfer for the <b>inlet</b> <b>port</b> height exceeding 0. 03 m.
