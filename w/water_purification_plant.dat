5|$|Water {{utilities}} in {{the ward}} {{are under the}} responsibility of the Kobe city water bureau. The Okuhirano <b>Water</b> <b>Purification</b> <b>Plant,</b> located in Kusudani-cho in the north of the ward, was opened in 1900 and was the 7th modern waterworks plant to be constructed in Japan. It occupies a 65,000m2 site and is capable of processing 60,000m3 of water per day. The Kobe Water Science Museum is also located on the site.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century the number of {{companies}} using the railroad for shipping on Chicago's near north side declined severely. In the 1970s customers at the east end of the line included the Curtiss candy factory and the Jardine <b>Water</b> <b>Purification</b> <b>Plant.</b> The construction of the Columbus Drive Bridge in 1982 wiped out part of the right of way and the spur to Navy Pier was abandoned. Service to the Tribune Tower also ended in the 1980s, and by the 1990s traffic along the remaining section of the spur served only one customer, the Chicago Sun-Times, with only one train per day. The newspaper moved their printing plant out of downtown Chicago in early 2001 leaving no traffic across the bridge and it has since been permanently raised in the open position. On December 12, 2007 the bridge was one of 12 historic Chicago railroad bridges to be designated as Chicago Landmarks.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's C-17s {{responded to}} several other natural {{disasters}} between late 2011 and 2013. In October 2011 a Globemaster flew a <b>water</b> <b>purification</b> <b>plant</b> to Samoa, {{from where it}} was transported by Royal New Zealand Air Force aircraft to Tuvalu. C-17s also transported supplies to Fiji and Samoa in December 2012 following Cyclone Evan. In January 2013 two Globemasters flew power generators and transformers from Amberley to Hobart following the Tasmanian bushfires. Later that month C-17s were used to transport aviation fuel and other supplies into the Queensland town of Bundaberg after it was affected by heavy flooding. In November 2013 a Globemaster flew a civilian medical team and its equipment from Australia to Cebu in the Philippines {{as part of the}} relief effort following Typhoon Haiyan; an RAAF C-130 subsequently transported the medical team from Cebu to Tacloban in the disaster zone.|$|E

5|$|While Hudah {{was located}} in the Mozambique Channel, the cyclone was {{expected}} to cause flood conditions in the Mozambican provinces of Nampula, Cabo Delgado, and potentially Zambezia. Even prior to Hudah, Mozambique was already facing a widespread flood and resultant humanitarian crisis; conditions which were further exacerbated by three tropical cyclones which impacted the country within the previous four months. The Instituto Nacional de Gestão de Calamidades(INGC) warned residents in potentially affected areas to take precautionary measures and secure fishing boats. The South African National Defense Force(SANDF) maintained 50soldiers and other military personnel {{and a number of}} aircraft to monitor the ongoing floods in Mozambique and potential impacts from Hudah. An Australian contingency held operations for a hospital and <b>water</b> <b>purification</b> <b>plant</b> in Chibuto to assist potentially affected populations. Multiple other relief organizations began to supply Mozambique with relief supplies due to the threat of the impending storm. The UN World Food Programme(WFP) sent 1,000tonnes (1,100short tons) of food to Nampula Province and 500tonnes (550short tons) of food to Quelimane Province. The WFP also placed relief aircraft on standby. The Mozambican Ministry of Health sent 30tents and 10rolls of plastic to Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Zambezia provinces. The United States Agency for International Development(USAID) dispatched a group of 12-member search and rescue team to Maputo in order to train local relief crews.|$|E

25|$|New York City is {{supplied}} with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed. As {{a result of}} the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants. The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a US$3.2 billion <b>water</b> <b>purification</b> <b>plant</b> to augment New York City's water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city's current availability of water.
