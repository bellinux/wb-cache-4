2500|$|Hussein later {{stated that}} {{during one of}} his {{meetings}} with Israeli representatives: [...] "I told them I could not absorb a serious retaliatory raid, and they accepted the logic of this and promised there would never be one." [...] The Palestinian nationalist organization Fatah under the PLO started organizing cross-border attacks against Israel in January 1965, often drawing Israeli reprisals on Jordan. One such reprisal was the Samu Incident, an attack launched by Israel on 13November 1966 on the Jordanian-controlled <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>town</b> of As-Samu after three Israeli soldiers were killed by a Fatah landmine. The assault inflicted heavy Arab casualties. Israeli writer Avi Shlaim argues that Israel's disproportionate retaliation exacted revenge on the wrong party, as Israeli leaders knew from their coordination with Hussein that he was doing everything he could to prevent such attacks. The incident drew fierce local criticism of Hussein amid feelings he had been betrayed by the Israelis; Hussein also suspected that Israel had changed its attitude towards Jordan and was intending to escalate matters in order to capture the West Bank. Yitzhak Rabin, the then Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, later admitted the disproportionate reaction by Israel, and that the operation would have been better directed at Syria, which was supporting such attacks: [...] "We had neither political nor military reasons to arrive at a confrontation with Jordan or to humiliate Hussein." ...|$|E

[...] The manager of the YMCA denied this: [...] "It's not what we're about. There is no missionary activity here whatsoever. The YMCA is {{in the city to}} serve the population with financial help, sporting activities and general educational programs," [...] and pointing to the organization's employment of many Muslims, their establishment of community programs including financing a mostly Muslim soccer club that had competed in national games. [...] The town's Muslim leadership issued a petition demanding that the organization close down the Qalqiliya branch or face violence which read as follows: [...] "We the preachers of the mosques and representatives of major families in Qalqiliya ask you to close the offices of the YMCA because the population of Qalqiliya doesn't need such offices, especially since there are not many Christians in our city..." [...] It warned, [...] "The act of these institutions of the YMCA, including attempting to convert Muslims in our city, will bring violence and tension." [...] Three days before the delivery of this petitions, many imams spoke about the issue during Friday prayers; the following day Molotov cocktails were thrown at Qalqiliya's YMCA. In September 2006, the YMCA was given a [...] "final notification" [...] by local leaders. [...] On 11 September 2006, the organization's building was broken into and torched by assailants identified by members of the local government as members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad well-known to local security forces.|$|E
