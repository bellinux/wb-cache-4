25|$|The {{assassination}} of Rabin <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> the Israeli public. Rallies and memorials took place near Kings of Israel Square—later renamed Rabin Square in his honor—as well as near Rabin's home, the Knesset building, {{and the home}} of the assassin. Many other streets and public buildings around the country were named for Rabin as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{assassination}} of Ze'evi <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> the Israeli public {{and left a}} lasting impression on many Israelis. Thousands of people attended the funeral of Ze'evi that took place {{a day after the}} assassination, at the Mount Herzl cemetery in Jerusalem, where Ze'evi was buried. President Moshe Katsav and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon eulogized Ze'evi at his funeral.|$|E
30|$|The impulse {{response}} functions indicated {{that when there}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> gross fixed capital formation in industry, industrial output will respond positively in the first 7 years, and then the effect dies down after the 8 th year. However, when there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> oil price or population growth, industrial output will respond negatively over the 10 -year period. The industrial output will respond positively <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> on agricultural output. However, when there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> manufacturing exports, industrial output will respond negatively in the 2 nd year, and no significant response in the 3 rd, 4 th and 5 th years, {{and then it will}} respond positively in the following years.|$|R

25|$|In 1982, Borg {{played only}} one tournament, losing to Yannick Noah in the quarterfinals of Monte Carlo in April. Nevertheless, Borg's {{announcement}} in January 1983 {{that he was}} retiring from the game {{at the age of}} 26 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> the tennis world. McEnroe tried unsuccessfully to persuade Borg to continue. He did, however, play Monte Carlo again in March 1983, reaching the second round, and Stuttgart in July 1984.|$|E
25|$|The year 1987 {{ended in}} tragedy for Argentine rock. Luca Prodan had finally lost his {{personal}} battle {{with alcohol and}} was found dead on December 22, due to complications from his addiction. His death <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> the entire music industry and to millions of heartbroken fans. Following Prodan's death, the members of Sumo split, founding two new rock outfits: Divididos and Las Pelotas; both bands became major players of 1990s rock.|$|E
25|$|In {{the quarter}} final, Sri Lanka met South Africans. The match <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> all the fans across the globe, where Sri Lanka scored 133 runs all out. Sanga scored 45 runs {{and all the}} others were {{struggled}} by South African impressive bowling attack- Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir. South Africa won the match very easily, only one wicket fell. With this match, Sanga and Jayawardena ended their ODI career. This match gave Lankans, their first defeat without making for the semi-finals after 1999 World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Losing {{the war and}} the 13 colonies <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> Britain. The war {{revealed}} the limitations of Britain's fiscal-military state when they discovered that they suddenly faced powerful enemies with no allies, and they were dependent on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication. The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King's ministers. Inside parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an over-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and government retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption.|$|E
25|$|These {{injuries}} {{left the}} Opening Day start to Joe Saunders, who pitched a dominating {{game against the}} Oakland Athletics to start the season. Two days later, Nick Adenhart made his first start of the season, pitching six shutout innings before being pulled from the game. Hours later, he and two other friends {{were killed in a}} hit-and-run crash. Adenhart's death <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> the team and to all baseball fans nationwide. It caused the next day's game to be postponed, and the Angels' April 10 game against the Boston Red Sox became a tribute to Adenhart.|$|E
25|$|Montador's {{death at}} age 35 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> players {{throughout}} the NHL; {{many of his}} former teammates spoke positively of his influence and attitude. Daniel Carcillo reflected on his friendship with Montador in an interview for The Players' Tribune and cited Montador as a positive influence who helped him overcome his substance abuse problems. Carcillo noted that he witnessed Montador's mental state slowly deteriorate before his death and called upon the NHL community to establish a formal exit-procedure for players suffering from post-concussion syndrome. Chris Montador had also noted a change in Steve's behaviour prior to his death.|$|E

25|$|Zeno of Elea (490 c. 430BC) {{produced}} four paradoxes {{that seem}} to show the impossibility of change. The Pythagorean school of mathematics originally insisted that only natural and rational numbers exist. The discovery of the irrationality of √2, {{the ratio of the}} diagonal of a square to its side (around 5th centuryBC), <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> them which they only reluctantly accepted. The discrepancy between rationals and reals was finally resolved by Eudoxus of Cnidus (408–355BC), a student of Plato, who reduced the comparison of irrational ratios to comparisons of multiples (rational ratios), thus anticipating the definition of real numbers by Richard Dedekind (18311916).|$|E
25|$|However, {{during the}} 1947 Soviet Aviation Day display at Tushino Airport, a {{surprise}} appearance {{was put in}} by three Boeing B-29s, followed by a fourth four-engined long-range strategic bomber. It {{was an example of}} the Tupolev Tu-4, which was a bolt-for-bolt copy of the B-29 Superfortress, three examples of which were known to have been interned in the Soviet Union after having been forced to land there during bombing raids against Japan in WWII. Since the USSR was expected to have nuclear weapons sooner or later, the appearance of the Soviet Tu-4 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> U.S. military planners, since it meant that the U.S. mainland might soon be vulnerable to a potential Soviet nuclear attack from the air.|$|E
25|$|The {{deportation}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> Estonian and Latvian societies. The rate of collectivisation {{jumped from}} 8% to 64% from 20 March to 20 April in Estonia and from 11% {{to more than}} 50% from 12 March to 9 April in Latvia. By {{the end of the}} year, 80% Estonian and 93% Latvian farms joined kolkhozes. In Lithuania, which had the stronger Forest Brother movement and already experienced a mass deportation in May 1948 (Operation Vesna), the impact was not as great and the collectivisation rate was 62% by the end of 1949. Therefore, the Soviets organized another large deportation from Lithuania in April 1949 specifically targeting those who had escaped the Operation Priboi (approx. 3,000 people) and another mass deportation known as Operation Osen in fall 1951 (more than 20,000 people). Search and individual arrests of people who evaded deportation continued in Estonia until at least fall 1949.|$|E

60|$|COLONEL. 'You do, indeed,' and {{he shakes}} {{her with a}} ferocity that would have startled any sudden visitor.

25|$|During a tag team {{match on}} April 3, 1983 {{he was injured}} by Dynamite Kid; two days later, {{he was forced to}} vacate the NWA World Junior Heavyweight title after it became clear that he would need time off to recuperate. However, once the {{determined}} Tiger Mask recovered, he regained his NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship by defeating Kuniaki Kobayashi on June 2, 1983, making him a simultaneous NWA/WWF Jr. champion for the second time. By 1983, however, Sayama started feeling dissatisfied as he hated the politics behind-the-scenes. As a result, he announced his retirement from active competition on August 12, 1983. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> the wrestling world, as Tiger Mask was going to retire while he {{was at the top of}} his game and as the holder of two Junior Heavyweight Championships. Both titles were declared vacant, as he became a trainer to martial arts fighters.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eighties}} NAC relegated two times. After the second relegation, it {{appeared}} the financial situation of NAC was terrible. NAC was almost bankrupt {{and had to}} sell its belongings to survive. For years NAC struggled to survive, {{but at the end}} of the eighties NAC’s situation improved and the club began to play in the top of the Eerste Divisie. On June 7, 1989, NAC player Andro Knel died in a plane accident. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> the club, especially since Knel was one of the popular players. Hundreds of fans of both NAC Breda and Sparta Rotterdam, Knel’s former club, came together in memorial of Knel. A temporary Knel monument was revealed and the numbers of supporters visiting the monument proved his popularity. Due to the sad moments of Knel's death a special relationship between fans of NAC and Sparta was created.|$|E
25|$|In fall 2010, Norwood {{appeared}} as a contestant on season 11 of the ABC reality show Dancing with the Stars, partnered with Maksim Chmerkovskiy. She ultimately placed fourth in the competition, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> the judges, viewers, studio audience, and other contestants that considered her one of the show's frontrunners throughout the entire competition. In August 2011, {{it was confirmed that}} Norwood had signed a joint record deal with RCA Records and producer Breyon Prescott's Chameleon Records. In September, a new talent show, Majors & Minors, created by musician Evan Bogart, premiered on The Hub. It followed a group of young performers age 10–16 and their chance to be mentored by some established artists such as Norwood, Ryan Tedder and Leona Lewis. Later that same year, Norwood returned to acting roles with recurring appearances on The CW's teen drama series 90210, and in the fourth season of the Lifetime's comedy series Drop Dead Diva, in which she played the role of Elisa Shayne.|$|E
60|$|Davies pondered a moment. The offer had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> him, for it {{suggested}} that Mowbray {{had found a}} way of escape.

25|$|Bobby Valentine became steward over {{an influx}} of splendid talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A winning season in 1986 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> pundits and fans alike as the Rangers {{remained}} {{in the race for}} the American League pennant for the entire season. With a team consisting of many stellar young rookies such as Rubén Sierra, Pete Incaviglia, Mitch Williams, Bobby Witt, and Edwin Correa, the Rangers finished the season 2nd place with an 87–75 record, just five games behind the division champion California Angels. The season marked a dramatic 25-win improvement over the 1985 season, which resulted in yet another last-place finish in the West. The signing of 41-year-old star pitcher Nolan Ryan prior to the 1989 season allowed Ryan to reach his 5,000th strikeout, 300th win, and sixth and seventh no-hitters with the Rangers. Coupled with powerful batters like Juan González, Rubén Sierra, Julio Franco, and Rafael Palmeiro and a pitching staff that also included Charlie Hough, Bobby Witt, Kevin Brown, and Kenny Rogers, fans held really high expectations for the Rangers' upcoming season. However, the team never posted a finish higher than second place and Valentine was relieved of his duties during the 1992 season.|$|E
