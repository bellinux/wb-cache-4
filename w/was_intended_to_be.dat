5|$|More loosely, Syntax by Hans Eduard Meier {{is similar}} in some ways. Released in 1968 and praised by Tschichold, it <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a more dynamic, handwriting-influenced {{sans-serif}} form. Its italic is, however, more of an oblique than Gill's. Hypatia Sans, designed by Thomas Phinney and released by Adobe, <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a more characterful humanist sans design. Many other fonts are influenced by Gill Sans to some extent.|$|E

5|$|A looser {{interpretation}} of the Griffo designs is Iowan Old Style, designed by John Downer and also released by Bitstream.

It is a default font in Apple's iBooks application.|$|E

The Synod of New York and Philadelphia <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an annual gathering of the members of all presbyteries and one elder from every congregation. Over half the members, however, were frequently absent due to long travel distances, and this prevented the Synod from functioning effectively.|$|E

5|$|Maverick Hunter is the codename for a {{cancelled}} first-person shooter {{video game}} in the Mega Man franchise {{that would have been}} developed by Armature Studio and published by Capcom. It <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a darker entry in the Mega Man X series. Mega Man artist and producer Keiji Inafune was responsible for establishing the western-designed game and Adi Granov was responsible for X's new design. It <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first of a trilogy of games, where players controlled its protagonist X {{in the first two games}} and then as Zero for the third. The game would have had similar platform elements found in earlier Mega Man X titles. It had a lifespan of about six months in 2010 before it was ultimately cancelled due to the aforementioned internal disagreements around the same time as Inafune departed from Capcom and other Mega Man titles were cancelled.|$|E

5|$|Stalingrads formal keel-laying was on 31 December 1951 and it {{was hoped}} that she could be {{launched}} on 6 November 1953, the eve of the 36th anniversary of the October Revolution. But deliveries of steel, armor, machinery and other equipment were delayed or arrived out of sequence, despite extraordinary efforts by the Ministry of Shipbuilding, and slowed construction enough so that she fell about six months behind schedule and the same was more or less true for the other ships. By 1 January 1953 Stalingrad <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 42.9% complete, but was actually only 18.8% done. Moskva was planned to be 11.5% finished, but was only 7.5% done.
