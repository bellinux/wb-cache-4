This commentary will present information to support a national <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> <b>criterion</b> for selenium of 2 pg/L, based on {{a wide array of}} support from federal, state, university, and international sources. Recently, two articles have argued for a sediment-based criterion and presented a model for deriving site-specific criteria. In one example, they calculate a criterion of 31 pg/L foi a stream with a low sediment selenium toxicity threshold and low site-specific sediment total organic carbon cotitent, which is substantially higher than the national criterion of 5 pg/L.

Adult male specimens of T. carnifex were exposed daily to cadmium (44. 5 nM/L and 178 nM/L as CdCl 2, nominal concentrations), respectively, during 3 - and 9 -months; at the same time, control newts were exposed to tap water only. The accumulation of cadmium in the skin, liver and kidney, the levels of metallothioneins in the skin and the liver, the expression of metallothionein mRNA in the liver, as well as the presence of histological alterations and of apoptosis in the target organs were evaluated. The 9 -months exposure induced cadmium accumulation in all the tissues examined; moreover, histological changes were observed in all the tissues examined, irrespective of the dose or the time of exposure. Apoptosis was only detected in the kidney, whereas metallothioneins and metallothionein mRNA did not increase. This study demonstrates that the existing chronic <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> <b>criterion</b> established for cadmium induces in the newt T. carnifex cadmium accumulation and histological alterations in the target organs examined. Together with our previous results, showing that, at these same concentrations, cadmium induced endocrine disruption, the present results suggest that the existing chronic <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> <b>criterion</b> for cadmium appears to be not protective of amphibians...|$|R

40|$|Cultured marine {{microorganisms}} under copper stress produce extracellular compounds {{having a}} high affinity for copper (copper-complexing ligands). These ligands {{are similar in}} binding strength {{to those found in}} natural waters, but few studies have examined the relationship between copper, copper-complexing ligand concentrations, and natural microbial populations. A series of in situ experiments in the Elizabeth River, Virginia, revealed that an intact estuarine microbial community responded to copper stress by production of extracellular, high-affinity copper-complexing ligands. The rate of ligand production was dependent on copper concentration and resulted in a reduction of the concentration of free cupric ions, Cu 21, by more than three orders of magnitude during a 2 -week period in one experiment. We believe that this interactive response to copper stress represents a feedback system through which microbial communities can potentially buffer dissolved Cu 21 ion concentrations, thereby regulating copper bioavailability and toxicity. Copper is widely used in industrial applications, notably as the active agent in antifouling coatings on ship hulls, and meeting regulatory criteria is costly to industry.

40|$|The {{determination}} of sediment and nutrient loads is typically {{based on the}} collection and analysis of grab samples. The frequency and regularity of traditional sampling may not provide representation of constituent loading, particularly in systems with flashy hydrology. At two sites in the Little Bear River, Utah, continuous, high-frequency turbidity was used with surrogate relationships to generate estimates of total phosphorus and total suspended solids concentrations, which were paired with discharge to estimate annual loads. The high frequency records were randomly subsampled to represent hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly sampling frequencies and {{to examine the effects}} of timing, and resulting annual load estimates were compared to the reference loads. Higher frequency sampling resulted in load estimates that better approximated the reference loads. The degree of bias was greater at the more hydrologically responsive site in the upper watershed, which required a higher sampling frequency than the lower watershed site to achieve the same level of accuracy in estimating the reference load. The hour of day and day of week of sampling impacted load estimation, depending on site and hydrologic conditions. The effects of sampling frequency on the {{determination of}} compliance with a <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> <b>criterion</b> were also examined.

40|$|The {{distribution}} and transport of {{total suspended solids}} (TSS) is considered in order to propose the strategy which, when implemented, would lead to compliance with the <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> <b>criterion.</b> Currently, most {{of the water in}} Izmit bay has a TSS concentration in excess of the legal maximum of 30 mg/L TSS. Modelling and simulation shows {{that the majority of the}} TSS does not originate from the known land based sources but probably represents phytoplankton. Since excessive quantities of N and P are discharged into the bay, sometimes the growth of phytoplankton is limited by the natural silicate content of the water. However, it is found that most of the phosphorus discharged from land based sources is in fact utilized by the phytoplankton. Hence, reduction of the TSS concentration to the legal limit can be achieved by decreasing phosphorus sources. If the majority of total organic carbon emanating from land based sources were removed, this would imply a considerable decrease in phosphorus inflow. It is suggested that waste waters from residential communities and the remaining industry should be treated and released to the layer below the halocline using one outfall in the eastern part and one or several outfalls in the central part of the bay...|$|R

40|$|Phosphorus {{losses from}} {{agricultural}} soils {{is an important}} source of P in surface waters leading to surface <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> impairment. In addition to reducing P inputs, mitigation measures are needed to reduce P enrichment of surface waters. Because drainage of agricultural land by pipe drainage is an important pathway of P to surface waters, removing P from drainage water has a large potential to reduce P losses. In a field trial, we tested the performance of a pipe drain enveloped with Fe-coated sand, a side product of the drinking water industry with a high ability to bind P, to remove P from the drainage water. The results of this trial, encompassing more than one hydrological season, are very encouraging because the efficiency of this mitigation measure to remove P amounted to 94 %. During the trial, the pipe drains were below the groundwater level for a prolonged time. Nevertheless, no reduction of Fe(III) in the Fe-coated sand occurred, which was most likely prevented by reduction of Mn oxides present in this material. The enveloped pipe drain was estimated to be able to lower the P concentration in the effluent to the desired <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> <b>criterion</b> for about 14 yr. Manganese oxides are expected to be depleted after 5 to 10 yr.

40|$|Abstract—The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to develop methods for conducting chronic toxicity tests with juvenile mussels under flow-through conditions and to determine the chronic toxicity of copper and ammonia to juvenile mussels using these methods. In two feeding tests, two-month-old fatmucket (Lampsilis siliquoidea) and rainbow mussel (Villosa iris) were fed various live algae or nonviable algal mixture for 28 d. The algal mixture was the best food resulting in high survival (90 %) and growth. Multiple copper and ammonia toxicity tests were conducted for 28 d starting with two-month-old mussels. Six toxicity tests using the algal mixture were successfully completed with a control survival of 88 to 100 %. Among copper tests with rainbow mussel, fatmucket, and oyster mussel (Epioblasma capsaeformis), chronic value ([ChV], geometric mean of the no-observed-effect con-centration and the lowest-observed-effect concentration) ranged from 8. 5 to 9. 8 g Cu/L for survival and from 4. 6 to 8. 5 g Cu/L for growth. Among ammonia tests with rainbow mussel, fatmucket, and wavy-rayed lampmussel (L. fasciola), the ChV ranged from 0. 37 to 1. 2 mg total ammonia N/L for survival and from 0. 37 to 0. 67 mg N/L for growth.
