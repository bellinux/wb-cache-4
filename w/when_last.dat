5|$|During the withdraw, however, A Company {{ran into}} a sizable North Korean force and had {{scattered}} in the ensuing fight. Most of the company, including its commander were killed at close range. In this desperate action, Private First Class Luther H. Story, a weapons squad leader, fought so tenaciously that {{he was awarded the}} Medal of Honor. Badly wounded, Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape, and <b>when</b> <b>last</b> seen was still engaging North Korean at close range. Of those in the company, approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines. The next morning, under heavy fog, the group made its way by compass toward Yongsan. From a hill at 12:00, after the fog had lifted, the men looked down on the Battle of Yongsan which was then in progress. That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near Yongsan. Stragglers from this position continued to stream {{in the next few days}} as well.|$|E

40|$|A {{program was}} {{conducted}} during which test subjects evaluated the simulated {{sounds of a}} helicopter, a tilt wing aircraft, and a 15 second, 90 PNdB (indoors) turbojet aircraft used as reference. Over 20, 000 evaluations were made while the test subjects were engaged in work and leisure activities. The effects of level, exposure time, distance and aircraft design on subjective acceptability were evaluated. Some of the important conclusions are: (1) To be judged equal in annoyance to the reference jet sound, the helicopter and tilt wing sounds must be 4 to 5 PNdB lower <b>when</b> <b>lasting</b> 15 seconds in duration. (2) To be judged significantly more acceptable than the reference jet sound, the helicopter sound must be 10 PNdB lower <b>when</b> <b>lasting</b> 15 seconds in duration. (3) To be judged significantly more acceptable than the reference jet sound, the tilt wing sound must be 12 PNdB lower <b>when</b> <b>lasting</b> 15 seconds in duration. (4) The relative effect of changing the duration of a sound upon its subjectively rated annoyance diminishes with increasing duration. It varies from 2 PNdB per doubling of duration for intervals of 15 to 30 seconds, to 0. 75 PNdB per doubling of duration for intervals of 120 to 240 seconds...|$|R

25|$|The first series, set in 1981, reveals Hunt to have {{divorced}} and replaced his Ford Cortina, {{as seen in}} Life on Mars, with an imported Audi Quattro. He is also displayed to be more professional, less aggressive and calmer than <b>when</b> <b>last</b> seen in Life on Mars, set in 1973. Hunt first meets Alex Drake (Keeley Hawes), the protagonist, during a police drugs raid at a party.

25|$|In {{the same}} time, long rivalry between senior Eliya line of Alqosh and junior Shimun line of Qochanis ended in 1804 <b>when</b> <b>last</b> primate of the Eliya line, patriarch Eliya (XII) XIII Ishoyahb (1778-1804), {{died in the}} ancient Rabban Hormizd Monastery. His branch did not elect new patriarch, thus {{enabling}} patriarch Shimun XVI Yohannan (1780-1820) of the Shimun line to became the sole primate of traditionalist branches. Consolidated since 1804, reunited traditionalist line {{became known as the}} Assyrian Church of the East, with its headquarters now located in Chicago in the United States of America.|$|E

Larry Johnson would also become the featured back, after spending three seasons playing in a tailback-by-committee that had inconsistent production. Johnson will have the luxury of running behind an offensive line that returned all five starters.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} oil market, however, did not improve, {{and while}} from 1977 to 1980, the Batillus performed {{four to five}} regular trips per year, she had {{a bit more than}} two trips in 1981 and three in 1982. From early November 1982, she was in permanent waiting for cargo at the Gulf entrance, until June 1983 <b>when</b> <b>last</b> oil shipment was embarked. From August 22, 1983 to November 8, 1985 Batillus was moored at Vestnes, Norway. On October 17, 1985, Royal Dutch Shell decided to sell the ship for scrap, for less than $8million. Her last voyage was from Vestnes to Kaohsiung (Taiwan) where she arrived on December 28, 1985 to be scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Raheny {{was also}} the site of two holy wells. The first of these, St. Ann's Well, gave its name to St. Anne's Park. The site of this well is still visible under a stone cupola by the boating lake in the park, {{but it has been}} dry for several decades, despite efforts by {{municipal}} authorities to restart it. The second well, dedicated to the patron saint of the area, St. Assam, lay in the field which now holds the Church of Our Lady Mother of Divine Grace. <b>When</b> <b>last</b> recorded, it was marked by a depression in the ground but was later, in the 20th century, covered over, and its waters diverted into the Santry River.|$|E
