The producer of the Tekken video game series, Katsuhiro Harada, said that Dragon Ball {{was one of the first}} works to visually depict chi and thereby influenced Tekken and other Japanese games such as Street Fighter. Ian Jones-Quartey, a producer of the American animated series Steven Universe, is a fan of Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, and uses Toriyama's vehicle designs as a reference for his own.

60|$|I will {{conclude}} this chapter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>about</b> the natives, who swarm {{in and around}} the Transvaal. They can be roughly divided into two great races, the Amazulu and their offshoots, and the Macatee or Basutu tribes. All those of Zulu blood, including the Swazies, Mapock's Kafirs, the Matabele, the Knobnodes, and others are very warlike in disposition, and men of fine physique. The Basutus (who must not be confounded with the Cape Basutus), however, differ from these tribes in every respect, including their language, which is called Sisutu, the only mutual feeling between the two races being their common detestation of the Boers. They do not love war; in fact, they are timid and cowardly by nature, and only fight when they are obliged to. Unlike the Zulus, they are much addicted to the arts of peace, show considerable capacities for civilisation, and are even willing to become Christians. There would have been a far better field for the Missionary in the Transvaal than in Zululand and Natal. Indeed, the most successful mission station I have seen in Africa is near Middelburg, under the control of Mr. Merensky. In person the Basutus are thin and weakly when compared to the stalwart Zulu, and it is their consciousness of inferiority both to the white men, and their black brethren, that, together with their natural timidity, makes them submit as easily as they do to the yoke of the Boer.|$|E

40|$|The new {{interdisciplinary}} {{science of}} artificial life {{has had a}} connection with the arts from its inception. This paper {{provides an overview of}} artificial life, reviews its key scientific challenges, and discusses its philosophical implications. It ends <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>about</b> the implications of artificial life for the arts. Artificial life is a young interdisciplinary collection of research activities aimed at understanding the fundamental behavior of life-like systems by synthesizing that behavior in artificial systems. As befits a journal for artists who use science and developing technologies, papers discussing artificial life regularly appear in the pages of Leonardo. There is also traffic in the other direction; for example, the biennial International Conference on Artificial Life is the primary vehicle for publishing all the latest scientific developments in artificial life, but more than five percent of the articles published in the proceedings of the last conference [1] concerned the application of artificial life to art and music [2 - 5]. People in both communities believe that the arts and artificial life have much to offer each other. Given this, it would useful for the two communities to know each other better. The opportunity to counteract the hype and misleading publicity surrounding artificial life is also welcome. The truth is often more interesting and surprizing than fiction, and it is always more valuable. This paper aims primarily to provide an overview of artificial life, explaining its approach to science and technology and outlining its main open problems, and sketching its broader philosophical implications.
