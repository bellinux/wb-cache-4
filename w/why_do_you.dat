25|$|What {{are these}} flights? It's reconnaissance. And <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> conduct reconnaissance? To support {{military}} actions. Does that mean {{one of the}} sides is preparing to spill blood? Do we want that? No one wants that.|$|E
25|$|<b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{retire from}} me? I can easily follow you anywhere, and be where you are. It {{is much better}} for you to return to your own estate, and not be quitting it on my account. You see well that if I wished it I could take away all you have, but I am not {{inclined}} to do so.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> have to adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch {{a piece of the}} news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E

"Then <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{bring me}} down into that room," [...] I asked, [...] "under a false pretence? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> use that murderous cane of mine for your crime? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> insist upon it that I {{should be seen}} dining with the girl--God knows who she is!--who is in that room?" ...|$|R
60|$|GERALD. Yes, {{something}} like that. I say, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come, Anabel? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come slap-bang {{into the middle}} of us?--It's not expostulation--I want to know.|$|R

500|$|A consoling verse from a psalm {{is treated}} as a closing motet of Part I: [...] "" [...] (<b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> trouble yourself, my soul). Alfred Dürr {{analyzes}} in detail how different means of expression follow the text closely, with shifts in tempo and texture, culminating in a [...] "permutation fugue of remarkably logical structure" [...] on the final [...] "" [...] (for being the help of my countenance and my God).|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus, [...] "" [...] (<b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> wish {{to trouble}} yourself), is a chorale fantasia, with the vocal part {{embedded}} {{in an independent}} concerto of the instruments. The cantus firmus on the melody of [...] "" [...] is in long notes, partly embellished, in the soprano and horn; the lower voices are mostly set in homophony. The lines of the chorale are not rendered separately, but accenting the bar form (Stollen–Stollen–Abgesang) of the text, 1 and 2 are combined, 3 and 4 are combined, 5 is single and 6 to 8 are combined. The scoring is relatively rich in woodwinds.|$|E
500|$|In {{the album}} closer, [...] "Street Choir", Morrison repeats the questions, [...] "Why did {{you let me}} down / And now that things are better off / <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> come around". Because of these lyrics Heylin wrote that [...] "such songs [...] were spawned by an {{increasing}} awareness of just how badly ripped off he had been". Ken Brooks {{has said that the}} lyric [...] "Move On Up" [...] is another reference on the album to a Curtis Mayfield song. The track prominently features Keith Johnson's trumpet and Morrison's harmonica. Writer Brian Hinton described the lyrics as perversely bitter, while Jon Landau wrote that [...] "Street Choir" [...] was one of the [...] "two or three finest songs" [...] of Morrison's career because of its [...] "musical and poetic energy".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, Doctor, {{all that}} may be; but <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not answer my question. Did Mr. Bathurst leave the army because he showed cowardice? If he <b>did,</b> and <b>you</b> know it, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> invite him here? <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> always praise him? <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not say, 'In other respects this man {{may be good}} and estimable, but he is that most despicable thing, a coward'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] cried Mother Anastasia, [...] "you {{have seen}} her! A few days ago! She told <b>you</b> all this! <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not say so? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come to me?" ...|$|R
500|$|In September 1510, a {{group of}} Dominican friars arrived in Santo Domingo led by Pedro de Córdoba; appalled by the injustices they saw {{committed}} by the slaveowners against the Indians, they decided to deny slave owners the right to confession. Las Casas was among those denied confession for this reason. In December 1511, a Dominican preacher Fray Antonio de Montesinos preached a fiery sermon that implicated the colonists in the genocide of the native peoples. He {{is said to have}} preached, [...] "Tell me by what right of justice do you hold these Indians in such a cruel and horrible servitude? On what authority have you waged such detestable wars against these people who dealt quietly and peacefully on their own lands? Wars in which you have destroyed such an infinite number of them by homicides and slaughters never heard of before. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> keep them so oppressed and exhausted, without giving them enough to eat or curing them of the sicknesses they incur from the excessive labor you give them, and they die, or rather you kill them, in order to extract and acquire gold every day." [...] Las Casas himself argued against the Dominicans in favour of the justice of the encomienda. The colonists, led by Diego Columbus, dispatched a complaint against the Dominicans to the King, and the Dominicans were recalled from Hispaniola.|$|E
500|$|By May 1999, {{the group}} was nearing {{platinum}} status for Dude Ranch and sales targets were higher for Enema of the State. The Los Angeles Times ran a Sunday feature on the band two days prior to release, noting that [...] "The musicians are sanguine about chances to repeat or exceed the sales of Dude Ranch, noting the always-shifting sands of pop culture and that they've already done better than they'd ever anticipated." [...] Momentum began to build when US radio stations received advance copies of Enema of the State. MCA issued Enema of the State on June 1, and the release peaked at number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album chart was gripped by the Backstreet Boys' Millennium, but Enema of the State still managed to move 109,000 units that week. The band was supporting Lagwagon in Europe when MCA executives phoned the trio about rising record sales. Joey Cape, frontman of Lagwagon, remarked that [...] "They were selling, like, 90,000 records a day [...] I was saying things like, 'What are you doing here? Go home! <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{want to be on}} tour with Lagwagon right now?" [...] At a show shortly following the release of the album, DeLonge was approached by Noodles from The Offspring to congratulate him. [...] "He looks at me right in the eyes and he goes, 'You're next,'" [...] remembered DeLonge, who blushed and shook off the compliment.|$|E

2500|$|Hannah is {{the wife}} of Elkanah. Elkanah also has another wife (Peninnah) who bore him children. Peninnah, at every chance, teases and criticises Hannah about her barrenness {{to the point of}} Hannah's deep despair. Her husband sees her {{distress}} and tries to uncover her deep despair with these questions. [...] "Hannah, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> weep? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?" [...] The story indicates that Hannah gave no answer to the questions and rose and presented herself before God weeping bitterly in the temple.|$|E
