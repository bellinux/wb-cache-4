Although transmitters were of recommended weight, we found that the swimming performance of tagged <b>white</b> <b>sturgeons</b> was significantly less than that of untagged control fish. Swimming performance of tagged fish was not differentially affected by tag location. Our results suggest that data from ultrasonic telemetry studies of externally tagged juvenile <b>white</b> <b>sturgeons</b> should be interpreted with caution due to the reduced swimming performance caused by external transmitters...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to characterize caviar obtained from farmed <b>white</b> <b>sturgeons</b> (Acipenser transmontanus) subjected to different dietary treatments. Twenty caviar samples from fish fed two experimental diets containing different dietary lipid sources have been analysed for chemical composition, fatty acids and flavour volatile compounds. Fatty acid make up of caviar was only minimally influenced by dietary fatty acid composition. Irrespective of dietary treatments, palmitic acid (16 : 0) and oleic acid (OA, 18 : 1 n - 9) were the most abundant fatty acid followed by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n - 3) and eicopentaenoic (EPA, 20 : 5 n - 3). Thirty-three volatile compounds were isolated using simultaneous distillation–extraction (SDE) and identified by GC–MS.

500|$|Fishing is {{generally}} {{good on the}} middle reaches of the Kootenay River and in Kootenay Lake. Westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, kokanee salmon (the landlocked Pacific salmon), rainbow trout and <b>white</b> <b>sturgeon</b> are among the many species found in the river. [...] Kokanee and rainbows are commonly found in Lake Koocanusa. Kootenai Falls, which drops some [...] within a run {{of a few hundred}} meters, forms a natural boundary between fishes of the upper and lower river, but Libby Dam, several kilometres upstream, is an even more formidable barrier. Fish in the Kootenay have traditionally been abundant but the construction of the dam may have led to declines in the population of sturgeon, among other fishes, because of changes in water flow. The best season for fishing is from June to November. One may fish from banks, sandbars and islands, or from boats. Because of the size and strength of the river, fishing from drift boats is easier than from the shore. Also, because the Kootenay's primary sources are glaciers, fishing conditions are quite different from most rivers in Montana and Idaho, which are fed by snowmelt.|$|E

Two fragments (of 7000 and 300 base pairs in length) encompassing 3 complete and 3 partial ORFs were amplified by PCR. Sturgeon herpesvirus strains, classified into species Acipenserid herpesvirus 2 (AciHV- 2), have been isolated and partially sequenced from several regions (California, Idaho, Oregon and Canada) of North America from white (A. transmontanus) and shortnose sturgeons (A. brevirostrum). The {{sequence of}} the SbSHV strain shared highest identity with that of the Canadian strain originating from shortnose sturgeon.

2500|$|Sturgeon are {{primarily}} benthic feeders, with {{a diet of}} shells, crustaceans and small fish. Exceptionally, both Huso species, the <b>white</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> and the pallid sturgeon feed primarily on other fish as adults. They feed by extending their syphon-like mouths to suck food from the benthos. Having no teeth, {{they are unable to}} seize prey, though larger individuals and more predatory species can swallow very large prey items, including whole salmon. [...] Sturgeons feed non-visually. They are believed to use a combination of sensors, including olfactory, tactile and chemosensory cues detected by the four barbels, and electroreception using their ampullae of Lorenzini.|$|E
2500|$|Autopolyploids are polyploids with {{multiple}} chromosome sets {{derived from a}} single taxon. Two examples of natural autopolyploids are the piggyback plant, Tolmiea menzisii and the <b>white</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> Acipenser transmontanum. [...] Most instances of autopolyploidy result from the fusion of unreduced (2n) gametes, which results in either triploid (n + 2n = 3n) or tetraploid (2n + 2n = 4n) offspring. Triploid offspring are typically sterile (as in the phenomenon of 'triploid block'), {{but in some cases}} they may produce high proportions of unreduced gametes and thus aid the formation of tetraploids. This pathway to tetraploidy {{is referred to as the}} “triploid bridge”. Triploids may also persist through asexual reproduction. In fact, stable autotriploidy in plants is often associated with apomictic mating systems. In agricultural systems, autotriploidy can result in seedlessness, as in watermelons and bananas. Triploidy is also utilized in salmon and trout farming to induce sterility.|$|E

The boats of Varvakis caught <b>sturgeon,</b> <b>white</b> salmon and other valuable fish. Knowing the passion of Greeks for caviar, he tried to arrange exporting caviar to Europe. He invented a solution to preserve the freshness of the caviar eggs while being transported by ship. He produced timber boxes, which did not cause alterations in the precious eggs, were absolutely waterproof and thus were maintained in very good condition. Until then the caviar had been preserved in caves. Varvakis shipped caviar from Astrakhan to Greece by camel or by boat through the Volga river. In 1788, the business of Varvakis employed more than 3,000 workers.|$|R
