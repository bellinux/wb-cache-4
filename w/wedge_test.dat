A novel falling <b>wedge</b> <b>test</b> that was used to quantitatively characterize the impact resistance of conductive adhesives at a material level has been described and some important findings obtained from the falling <b>wedge</b> <b>test</b> are presented. This unique impact resistance testing method is not only a substitution of the conventional drop test which has several severe drawbacks, but also provides some useful information for screening adhesives at the materials level and helping formulate new conductive adhesives with improved impact performance.

Nevertheless, {{there is still a}} demand for improved quantitative characterization of bond quality. Furthermore, in service, adhesively bonded joints are subjected to complex combinations of mechanical and environmental loads, which are not covered by conventional failure and life prediction models. In a co-operative project, <b>wedge</b> <b>test</b> specimens, thick adherent specimens for shear strength determination, and bulk specimens were manufactured in order to investigate three different adhesives, a commercial epoxy adhesive and two model adhesives, a two component and a one component epoxy adhesive, respectively. Before and after combined mechanical and environmental loading, the samples were examined with ultrasonic non-destructive techniques by IZFP. In order to understand the damage mechanisms, the adhesives were analysed via IR spectroscopy by one of the project partners. The <b>wedge</b> <b>test</b> samples were made of 3 mm thick stainless steel substrates with 0. 3 mm thick adhesive layers. They were aged at 60 °C in water immersion and at 60 °C in dry air. In addition, they were loaded mechanically by wedge insertion. Two sets of <b>wedge</b> <b>test</b> samples were imaged in situ during the ageing process by high-frequency ultrasonic microscopy at 25 MHz and at 50 MHz. To this end, a special set-up was developed allowing ultrasonic imaging in immersion in water at controlled temperatures up to 60 °C.

40|$|Deployable aeroshells {{offer the}} promise of {{achieving}} larger aeroshell surface areas for entry vehicles than otherwise attainable without deployment. With the larger surface area comes the ability to decelerate high-mass entry vehicles at relatively low ballistic coefficients. However, for an aeroshell to perform even at the low ballistic coefficients attainable with deployable aeroshells, a flexible thermal protection system (TPS) is required {{that is capable of}} surviving reasonably high heat flux and durable enough to survive the rigors of construction handling, high density packing, deployment, aerodynamic loading and aerothermal heating. The Program for the Advancement of Inflatable Decelerators for Atmospheric Entry (PAIDAE) is tasked with developing the technologies required to increase the technology readiness level (TRL) of inflatable deployable aeroshells, and one of several of the technologies PAIDAE is developing for use on inflatable aeroshells is flexible TPS. Several flexible TPS layups were designed, based on commercially available materials, and tested in NASA Langley Research Center's 8 Foot High Temperature Tunnel (8 ft HTT). The TPS layups were designed for, and tested at three different conditions that are representative of conditions seen in entry simulation analyses of inflatable aeroshell concepts. Two conditions were produced in a single run with a sting-mounted dual <b>wedge</b> <b>test</b> fixture. The dual <b>wedge</b> <b>test</b> fixture had one row of sample mounting locations (forward) at about half the running length of the top surface of the wedge. At about two thirds of the running length of the wedge, a second test surface drafted up at five degrees relative to the first test surface established the remaining running length of the <b>wedge</b> <b>test</b> fixture. A second row of sample mounting locations (aft) was positioned {{in the middle of the}} running length of the second test surface. Once the desired flow conditions were established in the test section the dual <b>wedge</b> <b>test</b> fixture, oriented at 5 degrees angle of attack down, was injected into the flow. In this configuration the aft sample mounting location was subjected to roughly twice the heat flux and surface pressure of the forward mounting location. The tunnel was run at two different conditions for the test series: 1) 'Low Pressure', and 2) 'High Pressure'. At 'Low Pressure' conditions the TPS layups were tested at 6 W/cm 2 and 11 W/cm 2 while at 'High Pressure' conditions the TPS layups were tested at 11 W/cm 2 and 20 W/cm 2. This paper details the test configuration of the TPS samples in the 8 Ft HTT, the sample holder assembly, TPS sample layup construction, sample instrumentation, results from this testing, as well as lessons learned...|$|E

The main {{objective of this}} study is the comparison of the applicability of the plasma pre-treatment to wet-chemical treatments on titanium for structural bonding. In this context, an atmospheric pressure plasma device was used to deposit thin functional films from hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) precursor on titanium.

40|$|We report {{quantitative}} results from three brittle thrust wedge experiments, comparing numerical results directly {{with each other}} and with corresponding analogue results. We first test whether the participating codes reproduce predictions from analytical critical taper theory. Eleven codes pass the stable <b>wedge</b> <b>test,</b> showing negligible internal deformation and maintaining the initial surface slope upon horizontal translation over a frictional interface. Eight codes participated in the unstable <b>wedge</b> <b>test</b> that examines the evolution of a wedge by thrust formation from a subcritical state to the critical taper geometry. The critical taper is recovered, but the models show two deformation modes characterised by either mainly forward dipping thrusts or a series of thrust pop-ups. We speculate that the two modes are caused by differences in effective basal boundary friction related to different algorithms for modelling boundary friction. The third experiment examines stacking of forward thrusts that are translated upward along a backward thrust. The results of the seven codes that run this experiment show variability in deformation style, number of thrusts, thrust dip angles and surface slope. Overall, our experiments show that numerical models run with different numerical techniques can successfully simulate laboratory brittle thrust wedge models at the cm-scale. In more detail, however, we find that it is challenging to reproduce sandbox-type setups numerically, because of frictional boundary conditions and velocity discontinuities. We recommend that future numerical-analogue comparisons use simple boundary conditions and that the numerical Earth Science community defines a plasticity test to resolve the variability in model shear zones...|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} discretizations of the electric-field {{integral equation}} (EFIE) impose {{the continuity of}} the normal component current across the edges in the meshing. These edgeoriented schemes become awkward in the analysis of composite objects or of closed conductors meshed with nonconformal meshes. In this context, the nonconforming expansion of the current with facet-oriented schemes, like the monopolar-RWG set, with no imposed interelement continuity, leads to EFIEimplementations with enhanced versatility. However, the traditional Galerkin method-of-moment implementation gives rise to hypersingular Kernel contributions, which cannot be evaluated numerically. Recently, we have proposed a nonconforming monopolar-RWG discretization of the EFIE where the testing is carried out over volumetric elements attached to the surface triangulation inside the object under analysis. In this paper, we review the so-called volumetric monopolar-RWG discretization of the EFIE with testing over tetrahedral or wedge elements.
