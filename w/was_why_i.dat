Leary explained {{that he did not}} know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was [...] "more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s [...] but the really dark Batman. But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, which <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> went to Tobey Maguire ones." [...] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, [...] "said to me, 'The first time I met you, I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'" [...] Director Webb said of his casting, [...] "e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you understand him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good." ...|$|E

On 28 January the soldier announced on Georgian TV that he asked for political asylum in Georgia.|$|E
2500|$|Metcalf’s {{experience}} in libraries {{began when he}} was thirteen years old, when he worked for at the Oberlin College library. His brother-in-law, Azariah Root, was the librarian. [...] Here, he was taught how to organize the shelves and process new orders that came to the library. [...] Despite being promised pay at five cents an hour, Metcalf was never paid for his efforts. [...] He says about this oversight, “I’m inclined to believe that absent-mindedness on my employer’s part, rather than poor work on mine, <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> was never paid…but I never ventured to complain.” [...] Regardless of why he wasn’t paid, Metcalf greatly enjoyed {{what he did and}} he knew he had found his life’s work in librarianship.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is there {{anything}} in the jungle too little to be killed? No. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> teach him these things, and that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> hit him, very softly, when he forgets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had hoped}} otherwise," [...] he said. [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> slow to move. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have waited, <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have even {{committed}} the treachery of permitting Pier Luigi to suppose me ready at need {{to engage in}} his service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not. I know, to my joy, {{that you}} are {{different}} from other girls; that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> here and asking you to be my wife. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> loved you that day on the mountain-side, because you were different." ...|$|R
2500|$|Around 226, Sun Quan {{had a large}} vessel {{constructed}} in Wuchang and he named the ship [...] "Chang'an" [...] (長安). He sailed on it towards Diaotaiyi (釣臺沂) but encountered a storm along the way. Gu Li then ordered the crew to head towards Fankou (樊口; northwest of present-day Echeng District, Ezhou, Hubei). Sun Quan said, [...] "We should go to Luozhou (羅州; present-day Huazhou, Guangdong)." [...] However, Gu Li brandished his sword at the crew and threatened, [...] "I'll execute any person who does not go to Fankou." [...] Upon reaching the port at Fankou, the storm had not subsided yet so they remained there. Sun Quan then asked Gu Li, [...] "Were you afraid of the river?" [...] Gu Li knelt down and said, [...] "Your Majesty is the master of thousands. You should not venture into treacherous waters and brave the storm. The ship may be large and steady, but if you encounter danger, {{what will happen to}} the state? That <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> strongly objected (to sailing towards Luozhou)." [...] When Sun Quan heard that, he respected Gu Li even more and started calling Gu by his surname since then.|$|E
2500|$|Crazy Horse spoke {{this story}} to Flying Hawk: ‘I {{was sitting on a}} hill or rise, and {{something}} touched me on the head. [...] I felt for it and found {{it was a bit of}} grass. I took it to look at. [...] There was a trail nearby and I followed it. [...] It led to water. [...] I went into the water. There the trail ended and I sat down in the water. [...] I was nearly out of breath. I started to rise out of the water, and when I came out I was born by my mother. When I was born I could know and see and understand for a time, but afterwards went back to it as a baby. [...] Then I grew up naturally. [...] At the age of seven I began to learn, and when twelve began to fight enemies. That was the reason I always refused to wear any war-dress. [...] Only a bit of grass in the hair. [...] That <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> always was successful in battles. The first fight was with the Shoshones. The Shoshones were chasing the Sioux. [...] I, with my younger brother riding double. [...] Two of the Shoshones came for us. [...] We started to meet them. [...] I killed one of them and took his horse. [...] We jumped on him, my brother and I double, and escaped." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that year, {{there was}} an {{occasion}} when Emperor Taizong held a feast for the high-level officials at Danxiao Hall (丹霄殿), and at the feast, Zhangsun Wuji made the comment, [...] "Wang Gui and Wei Zheng were our enemies before. [...] I did not {{know at the time}} that we would get the chance to feast together." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Wang and Wei served their master faithfully, and that <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> retained them. [...] I do have a question: Every time that Wei gave me adverse advice and I did not accept it, then he refused to discuss the matter any further. [...] Why?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "I give adverse advise only when I believe that something should not be done. [...] If Your Imperial Majesty did not follow my advice, then if I continued to speak about it, the matter would be settled and would be done. [...] That is why I spoke no further." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "You can first continue planning and then try to advise me again. [...] What harm is there?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "It was written that Emperor Shun warned his officials, 'Do not obey me in my presence and make secret speeches against what I do.' [...] If I know that something is wrong, but I continue to discuss it with Your Imperial Majesty, then I would be obeying you in your presence. [...] That is not how Houji [...] and Ziqi [...] served Emperor Shun." [...] Emperor Taizong laughed and stated, [...] "Everyone says that Wei is arrogant and careless, but I call him 'delicate'; this shows it." ...|$|E
500|$|Obama's {{goal for}} his Inaugural speech was {{to stir the}} {{following}} response among Americans: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> {{want to go into}} public service and be a better politician.

6000|$|... "I {{have lived}} {{for many years}} with that other danger," [...] he went on. [...] "It has lain like a shadow always {{in front of my}} path. Perhaps that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have become what <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have never dared to hope for the other things which are dear to every one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it. I guessed it, that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> came: that <b>is</b> also <b>why</b> <b>I</b> sent a {{pleasant}} little {{note to the}} Committee of Public Safety, signed with the device they know so well: The Scarlet Pimpernel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid they're--far from well. That <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> lighted the fire; I {{wanted to}} make them some tea. I thought you wouldn't mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|That <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> {{had been}} kept {{prisoner}} for all those days. Dingaan feared lest I should reach Natal in time to warn his victims! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you called}} out before you saw me," [...] he said bluntly, [...] "as if {{something}} had frightened you. That <b>was</b> <b>WHY</b> <b>I</b> came towards you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{named the}} Cowardly Lion. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have always <b>been</b> so tame and peaceable.

6000|$|... "But it's Hector's last night," [...] pleaded Laura. [...] "It {{would be}} dreadful if they met and he noticed anything. That <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> wished him to go." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, indeed I do; that <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> {{made sure}} she would have come home with me. I was so dreadfully {{disappointed}} when I found only her note." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Ingleby, with a {{trace of}} confusion. [...] "Of course, there wasn't any reason. Still, I hoped you would. That <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> waited." ...|$|E

5000|$|Arguing that Islam {{cannot be}} reformed, Sina says, “This {{is the way}} to fight evil. I do not want to kill the enemy. I want to win them as friends and allies. That is the real victory.
