5|$|Boycott {{was educated}} at a {{boarding}} school in Blackheath, London. He <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military—and in 1848, entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in hopes of serving in the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners. He was discharged from the academy in 1849 after failing a periodic exam, and the following year his family bought him a commission in the 39th Foot regiment for £450.|$|E
5|$|Fairley was {{acutely aware}} that much {{remained}} unknown about malaria. In particular, he <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possibility that sulphaguanidine (or a related sulphonamide) might be a causal prophylactic against malaria, {{as they could be}} manufactured in Australia, unlike atebrin and plasmoquine. Fairley decided to establish a unit in Cairns to investigate malaria. The LHQ Medical Research Unit commenced work in June 1943.|$|E
5|$|Interested {{in using}} sources other than archaeology, Grinsell {{made use of}} documents, place-names, folklore, and the {{accounts}} of antiquarians {{as part of his}} research. According to later archaeologists Amy Gazin-Schwartz and Cornelius Holtfdorf, Grinsell {{was one of the few}} archaeologists of his generation who <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relationship between folklore and archaeology, comparing him in this way to continental European scholars Paul Saintyves, Horst Ohlhaver, and Karel C. Peeters.|$|E

5|$|A {{full-scale}} mockup of the Q-12 {{was ready}} by 7 December 1962, {{and had already}} undergone preliminary tests to measure its radar cross-section. Marquardt had also successfully tested the modified RJ-43 in its wind tunnel in the meantime. However, the CIA was not enthusiastic about the Q-12, mostly because the agency was overextended at the time with U-2 missions, getting the A-12 up to speed, and covert operations in Southeast Asia. The Air Force, however, <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Q-12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile, and the CIA finally decided {{to work with the}} USAF to develop the new drone. Lockheed was awarded a contract in March 1963 for full-scale development of the Q-12.|$|E
5|$|At an {{editorial}} meeting of Jyllands-Posten ("The Jutland Post", Denmark's largest daily newspaper) on 19 September, reporter Stig Olesen mooted {{the idea of}} asking {{the members of the}} newspaper illustrators union if {{they would be willing to}} draw Muhammad. This would be an experiment to see the degree to which professional illustrators felt threatened. Flemming Rose, culture editor, <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> idea and wrote to the 42 members of the union asking them to draw their interpretations of Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|Belle Vue was {{the first}} privately financed zoo in England, and grew to become the third-largest in the UK. Jennison's {{original}} idea was that the gardens should be primarily a botanical excursion, but {{it became clear that}} the public <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> animals as an attraction in their own right. The initial collection had consisted of domestic birds and a few exotic parrots, but Jennison probably also acquired those animals that could not be sold after the Manchester Zoological Gardens closed in 1842. By 1856, the Jennisons had added kangaroos, rhinos, lions, bears and gazelles.|$|E

Booth aspired {{to follow in the}} footsteps of his father and his actor brothers Edwin and Junius Brutus, Jr. He began practicing elocution daily in the woods around Tudor Hall and studying Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Carter <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{possibility}} that extraterrestrials {{were involved in}} ancient mass extinctions on Earth and used these themes in the episode. Much of the episode was also inspired by Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ, and a scene showing an operation on Mulder has been thematically compared to the Crucifixion of Jesus. For the dream sequences, casting director Rick Millikan brought back many actors and actresses who had been absent from the show for several years, including Jerry Hardin as Deep Throat, Rebecca Toolan as Teena Mulder, and Megan Leitch as Samantha Mulder.|$|E
5|$|Coghill {{attended}} Nambour State High School in Nambour, Queensland {{where his}} father was a Physics teacher, graduating in 1988. While in high school, Coghill's ambitions were not directed towards music, as he expressed an interest in football or surfing. Upon graduating, he moved to Queensland's state capital Brisbane and began studying Botany at the University of Queensland, however <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Brisbane local music scene. Before long, Coghill had begun playing drums for local bands including side project Shock Fungus.|$|E

5|$|Fowles's {{presentation}} of Sarah, {{one of the}} most enigmatic female characters in literary history, is also psychoanalytically informed. Fowles himself <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> psychology of men and women.The enigma of femininity, myth of masculinity, and impossibility of man-woman relationship are some of the crucial themes. Through Sarah's deliberate spreading of lies about herself and her relationship with Charles, Fowles brilliantly brings about the various aspects of femininity that has the potential to authenticate, threaten, and expose the vanity of the male subjects.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Smith {{moved to}} MIT as an Institute Professor with {{appointments}} {{in both the}} Departments of Humanities and Metallurgy. His focus was to transplant the techniques of metallurgy into {{the study of the}} production methods used to create artefacts discovered by archaeologists such as samurai swords. In his role of teaching the history of science, he argued that important advances were often the result of curiosity rather than the pursuit of defined goals. He <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scientific aspects of fine arts, and published several works linking the arts with the sciences. He lectured about this at the Smithsonian Institution's Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Enron {{established}} {{a joint venture}} in energy investments with CalPERS, the California state pension fund, called the Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI). In 1997, Skilling, serving as Chief Operating Officer (COO), asked CalPERS to join Enron in a separate investment. CalPERS <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> idea, but only {{if it could be}} terminated as a partner in JEDI. However, Enron did not want to show any debt from assuming CalPERS' stake in JEDI on its balance sheet. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Fastow developed the special purpose entity Chewco Investments limited partnership (L.P.) which raised debt guaranteed by Enron and was used to acquire CalPERS's joint venture stake for $383 million. Because of Fastow's organization of Chewco, JEDI's losses were kept off of Enron's balance sheet.|$|E

5|$|Information {{gathered}} in Rennes, Paris, and Eindhoven pointed to Strasbourg {{as a place}} of particular interest. Physicists Rudolf Fleischmann and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker were known to be working at the University of Strasbourg, as was Eugen von Haagen, an expert on viruses whose work was of great concern to the Alsos Mission's Biological Warfare section. The Naval section <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> torpedo research being carried out there, and jet engine development was being undertaken at Strasbourg's Junkers plant.|$|E
5|$|Michael Balcon, {{the head}} of Ealing Studios and the {{producer}} of Kind Hearts and Coronets, appointed Robert Hamer as director. Hamer <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, and thought it an interesting project with possibilities of using the English language in a unique way in the film. Filming took place from September 1948 at Leeds Castle and other locations in Kent, and at Ealing Studios. The themes of class and sexual repression run through the film, particularly love between classes.|$|E

For the project Morison bought a copy of De Aetna which he then sold to Monotype as a model.|$|E
