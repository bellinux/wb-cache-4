25|$|On 29 November 1943, AVNOJ (formed by the Partisans) {{declared}} {{themselves the}} sovereign communist government of Yugoslavia {{and announced that}} they <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> all legal rights from the Royal government. On 10 August 1945, {{less than a month}} after Alexander's birth, AVNOJ named the country Democratic Federal Yugoslavia. On 29 November 1945, the country was declared a republic and changed its name to People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.|$|E
25|$|Kjevik {{has also}} {{received}} a similar airport competitor to the east, Arendal Airport, Gullknapp. Avinor, the state-owned operator of Kjevik, has stated that both Lista and Gullknapp, should then become operative with scheduled flights, <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> patronage from Kjevik and critical mass to establish new routes from Agder. On the contrary, some have called for the closing of Kjevik and instead that Agder be served by Lista and Gullknapp.|$|E
25|$|The Holmenkollen Ski Festival {{has been}} {{regarded}} as the de facto World Championships prior to the 1924 Winter Olympics. The Norwegian Ski Federation had been an opponent of establishing World Championships and Winter Olympics because they felt it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> {{the prestige of the}} Ski Festival. Oslo was awarded the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1930; with exception of Sweden's Erik Rylandet who finished fifth, Norway had the top ten positions.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, the NBA Board of Governors {{voted on}} a {{proposed}} reform to the lottery. If {{the proposed changes}} passed, the four worst {{teams in the league}} would have been given identical odds (around 11 percent) at winning the top pick. The fifth team would have a 10 percent chance and the odds would decrease for each team picking after. The proposed changes <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> the advantage of having the worst record in the league (currently the worst team is given a 25% chance at the pick), and would work to keep teams competitive throughout the entire season.|$|E
25|$|Those in {{opposition}} of dam removal state that demolishing O'Shaughnessy Dam <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> a valuable source of clean, renewable hydroelectric {{power in the}} Kirkwood and Moccasin powerhouses; even if measures such as seasonal water diversion into the powerhouses were employed, it would only make up {{for a fraction of}} the original power production. The remaining deficit would likely have to be replaced by polluting fossil fuel generation. The removal of the dam would be extremely costly, at least $3–10 billion, and the transport of the demolished material away from the dam site along the narrow, winding Hetch Hetchy Road would be a logistical nightmare with possible environmental impacts. Most importantly, San Francisco would lose its source of high-quality mountain water, and would have to depend on lower-quality water from other reservoirs – which would require costly filtration and re-engineering of the aqueduct system – to meet its needs.|$|E
500|$|Although Roth, Gough and Millar {{knew the}} show would be action-oriented, {{they wanted to}} reach 7th Heavens [...] "middle America iconography". To create atmosphere, the team decided the meteor shower {{bringing}} Clark to Earth would be the ironic foundation of the show. The primary source of his life on Earth and the super-powered beings Clark must fight, it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> {{the parents of the}} girl he loves and start Lex Luthor down a dark path. Roth appreciated Clark's conflict in dealing with the fact that his arrival caused so much pain.|$|E

500|$|Kagama was {{the case}} that {{articulated}} Congress' plenary power over the Native American tribes in the late 19th century. It reaffirmed Congress' power to pass legislation, including the Dawes Act, that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> many of the liberties that Native Americans {{had been able to}} hold on to up until that point. [...] 19th and early 20th century U.S. lawmakers viewed the American Indians as inferior people who would benefit from being assimilated into the Euro-American culture. [...] The laws that followed the Kagama ruling were attempts to destroy the Native American cultural differences and force these tribes to share the Euro-American culture viewed by these lawmakers to be the superior culture.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} were escorted to the grandstand to collect their trophies. In an interview after the race, Szisz {{reflected on the}} [...] "anxiety" [...] he had felt as he drove the final laps: [...] "I feared something small which <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> victory {{at the moment when}} it had seemed to be won." [...] The prestige Renault gained from Szisz's victory led to an increase in sales for the company, from around 1,600cars in 1906 to more than 3,000 a year later, and increasing to more than 4,600 in 1908. But the race had not proven the superiority of the French motorcar; an Italian car had finished second and only seven of the twenty-three French cars that had started the race finished it.|$|E
500|$|John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez was the {{producer}} for the song, {{and it was}} a challenge for him, as previously he was associated with recording dance-pop songs only. Initially Warner Bros. Records did not want the song to be released as a single, since they believed that it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> the attention from Madonna's second studio album Like a Virgin (1984). In the end, Peters and Guber convinced Warner officials to greenlight its release. [...] "Crazy for You" [...] ushered a new musical direction for Madonna, as [...] she had not previously released a ballad as a single. The track features instrumentation from snare drums, harp, bass synthesizer and electric guitar. Lyrically, the song speaks of sexual desire between two lovers and consists of innuendos.|$|E

500|$|On March 8, 2008, Bush vetoed H.R. 2082, a {{bill that}} would have {{expanded}} congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations, saying that [...] "the bill Congress sent me <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror". In April 2009, the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administration's interrogation tactics. One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were mixed}} in their {{opinions}} on the gameplay; Roper said that [...] "simply see what's next" [...] was enjoyable, but acknowledged that the game's activities were limited beyond this aspect. Leadbetter went further, saying that Flow [...] "feels like a tech demo in many ways", and that its small amount of gameplay existed primarily [...] "to act as a tour guide" [...] through the visuals and audio. Freeman said that [...] "it would not be unfair to describe Flow as empty and without substance." [...] Navarro concluded that Flow was enjoyable for the few hours needed to complete it, but that it lacked [...] "a lasting gameplay experience"; he attributed this to the game's [...] "heavy emphasis on aesthetics over gameplay". Luke Mitchell of PALGN, however, felt that [...] "anything more complicated <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> from the friendly nature of an experience of this type." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{effect this}} doctrine, the United States Army Air Corps would be {{required}} to expend the majority of its resources in amassing a fleet of self-defending heavy bombers, and in the training and maintenance of a great number of airmen to fill aircrew and ground crew positions. The ACTS officers who believed in the heavy bomber doctrine realized that any other Air Corps expenditures such as for tactical bombers and fighter aircraft <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> from the proposed large fleet of heavy bombers. Moreover, the men realized that the United States government would have to reduce funding to naval and ground forces in order to establish a great air fleet. To implement these changes, the ACTS instructors began to instill a sense in their students that a separate and independent air arm of the type described earlier by Brigadier General William [...] "Billy" [...] Mitchell, to be called the United States Air Force, was the way forward. As a compromise first step, the General Headquarters (GHQ) Air Force was established within the Army Air Corps in 1935, commanded by General Frank M. Andrews, a strategic bombing advocate. Andrews staffed the command with like-minded officers such as Henry H. [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{reading the}} script, Kristin Kreuk noted {{that she had}} been [...] "entranced", believing that the main message that audiences <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> from the film was that of not judging an individual's {{personality}} based upon their physical appearances. Richardson thought that Caroline Thompson's adaptation was [...] "much more in keeping" [...] with the ethos of the Grimm tale than subsequent adaptations due to its [...] "darker" [...] nature. Praising Miranda Richardson as being perfect for the role of Elspeth, Caroline Thompson asserted {{that she had been}} [...] "a blast to work with." [...] Caroline Thompson noted that she cast the actors to play the dwarves according to their own individual personalities; she remarked that Warwick Davis was a [...] "phenomenal actor" [...] while Penny Blake was [...] "so funny" [...] and Michael J. Anderson was a [...] "genius." [...] Together, she thought that they brought an [...] "array of talents" [...] to the production. Michael J. Anderson himself claimed that he identified with his character, the [...] "philosopher of the group", and really enjoyed playing the role. Commenting on his character of Wednesday, Vincent Schiavelli noted that he was miserable because [...] "he really thinks that he's a dwarf" [...] even though he isn't.|$|E
500|$|In December 2011, Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat {{announced}} that Amy and Rory would {{leave in the}} seventh series in [...] "heartbreaking" [...] circumstances. Amy's exit was a mutual decision between Moffat and Gillan. Gillan stated {{that she wanted to}} go [...] "on a high when the character was at her prime" [...] and to [...] "go with everything that she wants". She wanted her character to have a final ending, and ruled out returning to the show in the future as she felt it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> from the impact of her final scene. Moffat stated he felt [...] "tremendous pressure" [...] writing Amy and Rory's ending. He later revealed that he [...] "completely changed" [...] the ending as he was writing it, feeling the emphasis was wrong. During rewrites Moffat went back and forth deciding whether or not Amy and Rory should live or die. He eventually decided that death would complement the storyline involving the [...] "old, sentimental" [...] and [...] "dangerous" [...] characterisation of the Doctor. At one point he considered making the story that involved the Daleks, but felt the Weeping Angels were a [...] "better fit". Moffat was also interested in coming up with a new form for the Angels, and so he introduced the cherubs. He also said that since the Angels had debuted in [...] "Blink", fans had suggested that the Statue of Liberty could be a Weeping Angel.|$|E
500|$|When {{talking about}} the overall theme, Sakaguchi said it was [...] "not enough to make 'life' the theme, you need to depict living and dying. In any event, you need to portray death". As a result of this, Nomura {{proposed}} {{the idea of having}} the heroine die. Originally, Aerith had been the only heroine, but her potential death {{led to the creation of}} Tifa. It was decided that Aerith was the one to die as her death would be the most devastating and consequential. Kitase wanted to depict it as very sudden and unexpected, leaving [...] "not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness", [...] "feelings of reality and not Hollywood". The script for the scene was written by Nojima. Kitase and Nojima then planned that most of the main cast would die shortly before the final battle, but Nomura successfully protested against the idea, thinking that it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> from the impact of Aerith's death. Several character relations and statuses underwent changes during development. Aerith was originally going to be Sephiroth's sister, which influenced the design of Aerith's hair. To bring depth to Aerith's backstory, the team then made Sephiroth a previous love interest of hers, but later changed this to Zack being her former boyfriend. Both Vincent and Yuffie were originally intended to be part of the main narrative, but due to time constraints, they were nearly cut and eventually relegated to being optional characters.|$|E
50|$|The eschatology is pretribulationist. Waldau {{expected}} that she <b>would</b> be <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> before the Rapture, {{in a manner}} reminiscent of the dormition of the Virgin or the assumption of Mary, to be united with her Bridegroom.|$|R

2500|$|The {{right to}} {{rescission}} may in four circumstances expire. Rescission {{is often a}} drastic solution, just {{as the right to}} terminate for a contractual [...] "condition" [...] can be an oppressive right when exercised.

2500|$|Heston was the {{president}} (a largely ceremonial position) and spokesman of the NRA from 1998 until he resigned in 2003. At the 2000 NRA convention, he raised a rifle {{over his head and}} declared that a potential Al Gore administration <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> his Second Amendment rights [...] "from my cold, dead hands". In announcing his resignation in 2003, he again raised a rifle over his head, repeating the five famous words of his 2000 speech. Heston became an honorary life member.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{the newer}} line-item veto {{proposal}} was much weaker than the 1996 version, it nevertheless {{failed to find}} strong support in Congress. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia called it [...] "an offensive slap at Congress," [...] asserting that the legislation would enable the president to intimidate individual members of Congress by targeting the projects of his political opponents. He also complained that the line-item veto as proposed <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> Congress’ constitutional [...] "power of the purse" [...] {{and give it to}} the Executive branch.|$|E
