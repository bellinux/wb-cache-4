50|$|The {{market for}} screens {{increased}} rapidly after World War II. Hendrick Manufacturing Company began to import fine wire screens from Aumeca, a Belgian firm. In 1953, Greening, a company located in England {{was selected to}} supply <b>wedge</b> <b>wire</b> screens for Hendrick. Greening introduced a series of mini-wedge wire screens and Hendrick abandoned the Aumeca screens from that point forward.|$|E
50|$|The {{false bottom}} in a lauter tun has thin (0.7 to 1.1 mm) slits {{to hold back}} the solids and allow liquids to pass through. The solids, not the false bottom, form a {{filtration}} medium and hold back small solids, allowing the otherwise cloudy mash to run out of the lauter tun as a clear liquid. The false bottom of today's lauter tun is made of <b>wedge</b> <b>wire,</b> which can provide a free-flow surface of up to 12% of the bottom of the tun.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{operating}} range of particle size and feed concentration for screen scroll centrifuges are 100 - 20,000 µm and 3 - 90% {{mass of the}} solids in the feed. In general, slot and screen holes size range 40 - 200 µm with open areas from 5 - 15%. Nevertheless, recent products are claimed {{to be able to}} handle the particle size as low as 50 µm. Screens are generally metallic foil or <b>wedge</b> <b>wire</b> and more recently metallic and composite screens perforated with micro-waterjet cutting.|$|E
5000|$|Instead {{of using}} a {{shearing}} action as with scissors, diagonal pliers cut by indenting and <b>wedging</b> the <b>wire</b> apart. The jaw edges are ground to a symmetrical [...] "V" [...] shape, thus the two jaws can be visualized to form the letter [...] "X", as seen end-on when fully occluded. The pliers are made of tempered steel, and inductive heating and quenching are often used to selectively harden the jaws.|$|R
30|$|The anchor slip {{displacements}} (suction) of the <b>wedge,</b> core <b>wire,</b> and helical wire were calibrated {{by subtracting}} {{the displacement of}} the anchor plate from the total measured value. At 80 % of the MUTS, the anchorage slip displacement was only approximately 3  mm, which was maintained with little variation. According to the EOTA document (EOTA 2013), the slip displacement at a fixed end (i.e., wedge draw-in) {{should be in the}} range of 3 – 5  mm. This result demonstrated the stable performance of the tendon assembly.|$|R
50|$|In <b>wedge</b> bonding, the <b>wire</b> must {{be drawn}} in a {{straight}} line according to the first bond. This slows down the process due to time needed for tool alignment. Ball bonding, however, creates its first bond in a ball shape with the wire sticking out at the top, having no directional preference. Thus, the wire can be drawn in any direction, making it a faster process.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} sizing {{process is}} screening, or passing the particles to be sized through a screen or number of screens. Screening equipment can include grizzlies, bar screens, <b>wedge</b> <b>wire</b> screens, radial sieves, banana screens, multi-deck screens, vibratory screen, fine screens, flip flop screens and wire mesh screens. Screens can be static (typically {{the case for}} very coarse material), or they can incorporate mechanisms to shake or vibrate the screen. Some considerations in this process include the screen material, the aperture size, shape and orientation, the amount of near sized particles, the addition of water, the amplitude and frequency of the vibrations, the angle of inclination, the presence of harmful materials, like steel and wood, and the size distribution of the particles.|$|E
50|$|In 1969, Hendrick {{employed}} Leon Bixby {{to serve}} as product manager for profile screens. Bixby’s father had previously worked in design and development of profile screens for the <b>Wedge</b> <b>Wire</b> Screen Corporation of Wellington, Ohio, which had been started by his father. Bixby brought new success to the profile screen business for Hendrick. In the early 1970s, he convinced ownership that profile screens would always be considered a secondary product {{as long as they}} were manufactured in Carbondale alongside the far more popular perforated metal products. Because the largest market for profile screens was the coal industry that was growing rapidly in West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, Hendrick chose Owensboro, Kentucky, for the site of the Hendrick Screen Company. This was a separate incorporation which opened up in a brand new facility in 1974.|$|E
40|$|Ideal filters have a maximised {{open area}} for {{increased}} filtration efficiency, but this can compromise the overall {{strength of the}} filter. Traditionally, metal filters are made from perforated plate, mesh and <b>wedge</b> <b>wire.</b> The capabilities of selective laser melting (SLM) additive manufacturing (AM) technology offers creation of 3 D filter designs that have combined filter and support portions with maximised open area and inherent strength for operational industrial processes. This advance in processing for the manufacture of filters also delivers further benefits in filtration efficiency saving end-users energy costs. The combination of three separate parts into a consolidated unit has significantly reduced time and cost of production of <b>wedge</b> <b>wire</b> filters and removed expensive tooling requirements. AM technology allows the production of innovative metal filters as a competitive manufacturing process and delivers high value products for customers...|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{processes}} that involve fluid usually have filters which create resistance and require more energy for pumping. Desirable characteristics of an efficient filter include maximising the open area, but this decreases overall strength. Traditionally, metal filters have been manufactured using perforated plate and mesh. We successfully used additive manufacturing (AM) to create filter designs, that cannot be manufactured using conventional methods, These filters were designed around the apertures in the filter. This filter delivers decreased resistance, therefore reduces end-users energy costs and decreases their carbon footprint. 3 D filter designs {{were created to}} deliver effective filtration by using the AM capabilities to maximise the open area (aperture size) whilst retaining strength in the filter. In effect we combined the filter portion and the support portion of a conventional filter into a single part. During the design process we had to develop new approaches in our CAD techniques to accommodate the high percentage of space compared to the relatively low percentage of material in our lattice design. Low density per unit volume also increased the slicing time for the layers to be defined for uploading to the machine. The integrated AM filter was created with incremental increases in aperture size, and the series of filters printed using the same material files. We then analysed the strands and aperture sizes within the lattice of the integrated filter using the optical techniques of SEM and X-Ray CT. Manipulation of the material files used in subsequent builds led to increased control of the quality and consistency of the lattice strands {{which in turn has}} led to increased consistency in the aperture sizes in the filters produced. We have therefore refined the AM process used to manufacture our filters to an effective process. Metal AM was used to develop a <b>wedge</b> <b>wire</b> filter that can be manufactured in a single step process. This eliminates the significant costs and time for conventional tooling requirements as well as reducing the overall lead time to delivery. The AM filter design to reflect <b>wedge</b> <b>wire</b> overcomes conventional fabrication issues. Filtration efficiency will be investigated by comparing the flow rates of a conventional and of an AM <b>wedge</b> <b>wire</b> filter. AM technology has enabled the production of innovative 3 D designed filters that have design elements which significantly increase filtration efficiency. Industrial use of these 3 D filters may reduce the end users carbon footprint...|$|E
40|$|Optimisation {{of fluid}} flow through a filter and minimising {{turbulence}} and pressure drop {{can lead to}} a more efficient filtration system. Traditionally, metal filters have been manufactured using perforated plate, mesh and <b>wedge</b> <b>wire.</b> Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology can be used to produce filters whose geometries cannot be manufactured using more conventional manufacturing technologies. Three novel filter geometries were designed for fabrication using AM to reflect three traditional filter types. A filter design, with holes in-line to the direction of fluid flow, which can be directly compared to perforated plate, was produced using AM technology with 316 L Stainless Steel (SS 316 L) as the build material. When compared to conventional filters of similar aperture size, the pressure drop across the AM filter with increasing flow rates was significantly less compared to the conventionally manufactured filter. Thus, less pumping energy is required for the in-line hole AM filter. The AM filter designed to be representative of a mesh-based filter, was created as a single part with an integrated support and filter section. This filter has a significantly increased open area and increased flow rate compared to its comparable mesh filter. The AM filter representing that fabricated from <b>wedge</b> <b>wire,</b> overcomes conventional fabrication issues and is an advance towards leaner manufacturing. AM technology has enabled the production of innovative, geometrically complex, 3 D filter designs that have significant increases in filtration efficiency. Industrial application of these filters will have a positive impact in reducing the carbon footprint of end users...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{developed}} a technique for dewatering mineral waste slurries which utilizes polymer and a static screen. A variety of waste slurries from placer gold mines and crushed stone operations have been successfully treated using the system. Depending on the waste, a number of polymers have been used successfully with polymer costs ranging from $ 0. 05 to $ 0. 15 per 1, 000 gal treated. The dewatering is accomplished using screens made from either ordinary window screen or <b>wedge</b> <b>wire.</b> The screens used are 8 ft wide and 8 ft long. The capacity of the screens varies from 3 to 7 gpm/sq. ft. The water produced is acceptable for recycling to the plant or for discharge to the environment.

40|$|Thermosonic Au {{wire bonding}} {{is the most}} widely used {{interconnection}} technology in the BGA packages. Compare with Au ball bonding, the lower wire loop and finer bond pitch of Au wedge bond makes its ideal for low profile and high I/O applications, which is the subject of the current study. As bond pad surface cleanliness, substrate materials and wire bonding process parameters play a critical role on the yield of wire bonding, this study compare Au <b>wedge</b> <b>wire</b> bondability of rigid FR- 4 and flexible polyimide (PI) substrate and examine the bonding improvements using plasma cleaning by the concept of process windows. Process windows demonstrate the bondability of the substrates at a combinations of varies bonding conditions, such as bonding temperature, bond power and with and without subjected to plasma cleaning. The plasma cleaning condition is optimized based on the process windows. Results indicated that a low plasma cleaning power with a short cleaning time resulted in the widest process window. Significant improvements of bondability were noted after plasma treatment with a substantial reduction in minimum bonding temperature for both substrates. The process window for the flexible substrate was much wider than the rigid substrates in the bonding conditions tested. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|The Lower Yellowstone Irrigation District diverts up to 1400 cfs {{into its}} main canal {{system on the}} lower Yellowstone River in Northeastern Montana. In late 2010, {{as part of a}} pallid {{sturgeon}} recovery program, the USBR and USACE began construction of a new state-of-the-art screened canal head works structure. After over 100 years of unscreened operations, the new fish screened facility was opened in spring 2012. The head works will be integrated into a major river gradient fish passage facility being proposed for construction soon. When completed, the new passage and protection facilities will reduce fish entrainment and open an additional 165 miles of river habitat for the endangered and native fishes. The new headwork facility’s fish protection system consists of twelve, 6. 5 -foot diameter and 25 feet long cylindrical fish protection screens. Each screen is designed to seal over the intake’s submerged sluice gates spaced along the 350 -foot long riverbank facility. An integrated and flush-mounted track system was built into the vertical concrete walls to raise the screens in the non-irrigation season for protection from the significant ice and flood flows common on the river. When the 71 -mile long irrigation canal is operational, each screen is lowered into position and an automatic brush cleaning system is used to keep the 1. 75 mm <b>wedge</b> <b>wire</b> slots from clogging. The new intake facility was physically modeled at the USBR Hydraulics Lab along with several river fish passage options. The on-river screen design keeps the fish and debris in the river as opposed to traditional off-river screen designs with fish bypass facilities. The cylindrical design also reduced the facility footprint and allows diversions to occur over the river’s wide-ranging water surface fluctuations. This presentation will focus on the design, construction, and hydraulics of the intake screen facility, as well as the initial season’s operational experiences...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{long-term}} operation of a full-scale municipal membrane bioreactor, focusing mainly on the membrane section. The ultrafiltration chamber, equipped with 12 130 m 2 of submerged hollow-fiber membranes, was installed after an existing alternating oxic/anoxic bioreactor. Attention is paid {{to a number of}} practical details, from the effectiveness of different sieves to the impact of the operating parameters on the membrane performances; finally, data of the energy consumptions and items of the operating costs are presented. Starting from the pretreatments, while the <b>wedge</b> <b>wire</b> sieve (openings) 1 mm) involved the visible accumulation of fibers and trash in the filtration chamber, the punched holes (holes diameter) 1. 5 mm) involved less than 100 milligrams of dry trash per liter of mixed liquor, demonstrating that they suited the following membrane system. Moving on to the off-line equalization basin, a volume of one-fifth of the bioreactor was sufficient to cope with the normal fluctuations of the municipal inloadings. As for the membrane section, a net flux of 26 LMH and chemical maintenance cleaning in place once a week with only hypochlorite (around 300 mgCl L- 1) was a sustainable practice to keep the long-term permeability (adjusted at 20 °C) stable in the range 220 - 240 LMH bar- 1. Under this operating protocol, increases of specific aeration for membrane scouring from 0. 12 to 0. 19 Nm 3 m- 2 h- 1 did not lead to permeability gains that might justify the increased power requirements. This evidence allows us to conclude that 0. 12 Nm 3 m- 2 h- 1 was sustainable for the normal operation of the hollow-fiber membranes. Irreversible membrane fouling (permeability decrease up to 150 - 160 LMH bar- 1) was observed because of irregular discharges of municipal landfill leachate, which, from one side, caused a drastic deflocculation of the activated sludge (sludge volume index (SVI) increased from 110 up to 250 mL gMLSS) and, from the other side, involved a probable incoming of recalcitrant compounds that might have acted as foulants. The power requirements of the whole treatment facility were always lower than 0. 6 kWh m- 3 thanks to the general good utilization of the air supplied.
