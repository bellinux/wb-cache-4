Dielectric properties of polyterpenol films were measured by means of split post dielectric resonators (SPDRs) operating at frequencies of 10 GHz and 20 GHz.

The scaling forms are the same that have been found to describe the aging of several fragile glass formers and that, in the case of P(f_ s, r), have been also predicted theoretically. A thorough study of the length scales involved highlights the importance of intermediate length scales.
