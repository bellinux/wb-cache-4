5|$|Records from 1801 {{show that}} at that time {{agriculture}} was {{the main component of}} Puddletown's economy, though cottage industry and artisan crafts were also an important element: 596 people in the parish were primarily employed in agriculture, with 221 employed in handicrafts, manufacture and trade. Cottage industry, often undertaken by women and children, was used to supplement agricultural income, though there <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> opportunities for this after the French Revolution.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} still very new to tourism. There <b>are</b> very <b>few</b> {{tourists}} on the island. There <b>are</b> <b>few</b> accommodations as well. There <b>are</b> <b>few</b> home stays and resorts. One {{of the most famous}} resort is Angthong Beach Resort.|$|R

5|$|The {{four main}} crusader armies left Europe around the {{appointed}} time in August 1096. They took different paths to Constantinople and gathered outside its city walls between November 1096 and April 1097; Hugh of Vermandois arrived first, followed by Godfrey, Raymond, and Bohemond. This time, Emperor Alexios was more {{prepared for the}} crusaders; there <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> incidents of violence along the way.|$|E
5|$|Butch {{women were}} not a novelty in the 1950s; even in Harlem and Greenwich Village in the 1920s some women assumed these personae. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, the roles were {{pervasive}} and not limited to North America: from 1940 to 1970, butch/femme bar culture flourished in Britain, though there <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> class distinctions. They further identified {{members of a group}} that had been marginalized; women who had been rejected by most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group of people that took a high amount of knowledge to function in. Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period. Many wealthier women married to satisfy their familial obligations, and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, {{when the}} 63rd Street Subway opened, there <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> service changes. The B and Q trains and the JFK Express were {{extended}} from 57th Street/Sixth Avenue in Manhattan to 21st Street–Queensbridge in Queens; the JFK Express {{would be eliminated}} {{less than six months}} later in 1990. The 2001 opening of the 63rd Street Connection resulted in more major service changes in the subway system, such as the reroute of the B and Q train away from the 63rd Street tunnel, the introduction of F express service between Queens Boulevard and the tunnel, the truncation of G service to Court Square during weekdays, and the creation of the V train to cover the portions of the IND Queens Boulevard Line that were formerly served by the F and G trains.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the {{industry}} {{has been criticized for}} lacking in racial diversity. For example, critics have noted that there <b>are</b> <b>few</b> Asian plus size models. Others have noted that there <b>are</b> <b>few</b> black plus-size models with darker skin tones.|$|R
30|$|In addition, there <b>are</b> <b>fewer</b> {{academics}} claiming any difficulty when sharing, {{and this}} {{could be explained by}} the fact that there <b>are</b> <b>fewer</b> algorithms in their possession and thus a lower number of people who see problems in sharing is natural.|$|R

5|$|Klotter {{wrote that}} Breckinridge's {{sale of a}} female slave and her six-week-old child in November 1857 {{probably}} ended {{his days as a}} slaveholder. Slaves were not listed among his assets in the 1860 Census, but Heck noted that he had little need for slaves at that time, since he was living in Lexington's Phoenix Hotel after returning to Kentucky from his term as vice president. Some slavery advocates refused to support him in the 1860 presidential race because he was not a slaveholder. Klotter noted that Breckinridge fared better in rural areas of the South, where there <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> slaveholders; in urban areas where the slave population was higher, he lost to Constitutional Unionist candidate John Bell, who owned 166 slaves. William C. Davis recorded that, in most of the South, the combined votes for Bell and Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas exceeded those cast for Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|Media {{controversy}} surrounded Turner in 1958 {{when her}} daughter, Cheryl Crane, stabbed Turner's lover Johnny Stompanato {{to death in}} their Beverly Hills home during a domestic struggle. Turner's next film, Imitation of Life (1959), proved {{to be one of}} the greatest financial successes of her career, but onward from the early 1960s, her roles <b>were</b> <b>fewer.</b> Turner spent most of the 1970s and early 1980s in semiretirement, only working occasionally. In 1982, she accepted a much publicized and lucrative recurring guest role in the television series Falcon Crest, affording the series the highest rating it ever achieved. Turner made her final film appearance in 1985, and died from throat cancer in 1995, aged 74.|$|E
5|$|Monson {{became the}} 16th {{president}} of the LDS Church on February 3, 2008, succeeding Hinckley, who had died seven days earlier. Monson selected Henry B. Eyring and Dieter F. Uchtdorf as his first and second counselors, respectively. When Monson was born, there <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> than 650,000 church members in the world, most of them living in the western United States. At the time he became the church's president, there were over 13 million members worldwide, with the majority living outside the United States and Canada. As of October 2012, 31 temples announced by Monson were either under construction or in planning.|$|E

5|$|Nos. 607 and 609 Squadrons {{engaged the}} Germans {{south-west}} of The Needles. The British reported 30–40 Bf 110s with 15 Do 17s in support. The tonnage of bombs dropped suggested there <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> bombers than claimed. The RAF fighters claimed four Do 17s. The {{fact remains that}} the Germans penetrated the airspace without interception and {{came very close to}} inflicting critical damage to the Spitfire factory. The radar had done its job and alerted No. 11 and 10 Group 20 minutes before the bombs started to fall. The fault lay either with the No. 10 or 11 Group controllers who were late in ordering their Squadrons to scramble.|$|E
5|$|Six {{million people}} were {{unemployed}} when the Nazis took power in 1933 and by 1937 there <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> than a million. This was {{in part due to}} the removal of women from the workforce. Real wages dropped by 25 percent between 1933 and 1938. Trade unions were abolished in May 1933 with the seizure of the funds and arrest of the leadership of the Social Democratic trade unions. A new organisation, the German Labour Front, was created and placed under NSDAP functionary Robert Ley. The average German worked 43 hours a week in 1933 and by 1939 this increased to 47 hours a week.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} {{was initially}} {{made up of}} only ten families but grew to include 50 members by 1878. By the time their second building was built in 1906, the congregation included 82 members, and Meridian as a whole had grown to include 525 Jewish residents by 1927. By the 2000s there <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> than forty, mostly elderly Jews remaining in the city, however, and the congregation no longer has a full-time rabbi. Former rabbis include Judah Wechsler, after whom the Wechsler school was named, and William Ackerman, whose wife Paula Ackerman {{became the first woman}} to perform rabbinical duties in the country after her husband's unexpected death.|$|E

5|$|The {{hospital}} ship , {{which had been}} sent out to rescue survivors from the sunken boats, was seized by the British for violating the Hague Convention rules {{on the use of}} {{hospital ship}}s. The loss of a squadron of German torpedo boats led to a drastic change in tactics in the English Channel and along the coast of Flanders. There <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> sorties into the Channel and the torpedo boat force was relegated to coastal patrol and rescuing aircrew. The British received a bonus on 30 November, when a trawler pulled up the sealed chest thrown off S119 by Captain Thiele. The chest contained a German codebook used by the German light forces stationed on the coast, allowing the British to read German wireless communication for long afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The interdiction effort during Commando Hunt VI (15 May through 31 October 1971) {{was thrown}} off by Lam Son 719 during April and May. During the offensive, 80 {{percent of all}} U.S. aerial sorties were {{directed}} to support it. This highlighted what was now rapidly becoming a dual dilemma for the Air Force: First, the gradual withdrawal of U.S. forces from Southeast Asia meant that there <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> and fewer air assets available with which to conduct more and more missions. During Commando Hunt, for example, 1,777 aircraft were utilized during the campaign. By {{the time of the}} opening of Commando Hunt VI, that figure had decreased to 1,199 aircraft and this number dropped to 953 before that phase was completed; Second, this state of affairs was exacerbated by the withdrawal of sorties to conduct missions for Operation Freedom Deal in Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|The next day, August 24, the 23rd Infantry {{continued}} {{clearing the}} rear areas and by night it {{estimated that there}} <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> than 200 North Koreans behind the forward positions. The Bowling Alley front was quiet during the day. Shortly after midnight on August 24 the North Koreans launched what had by now become their regular nightly attack down the Bowling Alley. This attack was in an estimated two-company strength supported by a few tanks. The 27th Infantry broke up the attack and two more North Korean tanks were destroyed by the supporting artillery fire. This was the last night the 27th Infantry Regiment spent in the Bowling Alley.|$|E

5|$|The season officially {{started on}} May 15, 1995, in the Eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1995, in the Central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1995. These dates {{conventionally}} delimit {{the period of}} each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The season saw eleven tropical cyclones form, of which ten became tropical storms. Seven of these storms attained hurricane status, three of them becoming major hurricanes. There <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> tropical storms than the average of 16, {{while the number of}} hurricanes and major hurricanes were slightly below average. The season marked the beginning of a multi-decade period of low activity in the Eastern Pacific.|$|E
5|$|While Gens was {{in control}} of the ghetto, he {{continued}} to oversee the sanitary and health efforts in the ghetto, running that part of the ghetto administration like a military operation. Although conditions were very crowded and often unsanitary, the ghetto never suffered a major epidemic and there <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> deaths due to disease than in other ghettos. A network of children's homes was set up in March 1942 on Gens' orders. These homes were for orphans or those with parents who could not care properly for them. A department of the ghetto administration was in charge of supervising bosses who employed {{children under the age of}} 16.|$|E
5|$|As Western Europe {{witnessed}} {{the formation of}} new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with the Sasanian Empire, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted {{throughout most of the}} 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in Eastern politics {{that they did not have}} in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort—the Codex Theodosianus—was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests.|$|E
