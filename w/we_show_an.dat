6000|$|I. Know, then, thyself, presume not God to scan; The proper {{study of}} mankind is man. Placed on this isthmus {{of a middle}} state, A being darkly wise, and rudely great: With too much {{knowledge}} for the sceptic side, With too much weakness for the stoic's pride, He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest; In doubt to deem himself a god, or beast; In doubt his mind or body to prefer; Born but to die, and reasoning but to err; Alike in ignorance, his reason such, Whether he thinks too little, or too much: Chaos of thought and passion, all confused; Still by himself abused, or disabused; Created half to rise, and half to fall; Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all; Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurled: The glory, jest, and riddle of the world! [...] Go, wondrous creature! mount where science guides, Go, measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides; Instruct the planets in what orbs to run, Correct old time, and regulate the sun; Go, soar with Plato to th' empyreal sphere, To the first good, first perfect, and first fair; Or tread the mazy round his followers trod, And quitting sense call imitating God; As Eastern priests in giddy circles run, And turn their heads to imitate the sun. Go, teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule-- Then drop into thyself, and be a fool! [...] Superior beings, when of late they saw A mortal man unfold all Nature's law, Admired such wisdom in an earthly shape And showed a Newton as <b>we</b> <b>show</b> <b>an</b> ape. [...] Could he, whose rules the rapid comet bind, Describe or fix one movement of his mind? Who saw its fires here rise, and there descend, Explain his own beginning, or his end? Alas, what wonder! man's superior part Unchecked may rise, and climb from art to art; But when his own great work is but begun, What reason weaves, by passion is undone. Trace Science, then, with Modesty thy guide; First strip off all her equipage of pride; Deduct what is but vanity or dress, Or learning's luxury, or idleness; Or tricks to show the stretch of human brain, Mere curious pleasure, or ingenious pain; Expunge the whole, or lop th' excrescent parts Of all our vices have created arts; Then see how little the remaining sum, Which served the past, and must the times to come! ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a game-theoretic bin packing problem with identical items, and we study the convergence {{time to a}} Nash equilibrium. In the model proposed, users choose their strategy simultaneously. We deal with two bins and multiple bins cases. We consider the case when users know the load of all bins and cases with less information. We consider two approaches, depending if the system can undo movements that lead to infeasible states. In the two bins case, <b>we</b> <b>show</b> <b>an</b> O(log log n) and an O(n) bounds when undo movements are allowed {{and when they are}} not allowed, resp.
