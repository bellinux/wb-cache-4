Two {{years before his}} death in 1818, he gave the collection to William Edmonds Horner, another physician. Horner expanded the collection, which became known as the Wistar and Horner Museum, and was further expanded by its next curator, Joseph Leidy, M.D., who added animal specimens and fossil and anthropological samples. By the late 1880s, the collection was beginning to show signs of neglect and <b>wear,</b> <b>compounded</b> by a fire in Logan Hall at the University of Pennsylvania, where the museum was housed.|$|R

While an engineer may have a working knowledge of G-code programming, small optimization and <b>wear</b> issues <b>compound</b> over time.

An experimental rubber compound {{has been developed}} which exhibits 2 to 3 times greater service life than standard production pad compounds. To improve the service life of the tank track pads various aspects of rubber chemistry were explored including polymer, curing and reinforcing systems.

40|$|Gear {{mechanisms}} {{are an important}} element in a variety of industrial applications and about 80 % of the breakdowns of the transmission machinery are caused by the gear failure. Efficient incipient faults detection and accurate faults diagnosis are therefore critical to machinery normal operation. The use of mechanical vibration signals for fault diagnosis is significant and effective due to advances in the progress of digital signal processing techniques. Through virtual prototype simulation analysis and experimental study, a novel method for gear multi-faults diagnosis was presented in this paper based on the wavelet-Autoregressive (AR) model and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method. The virtual prototype simulation and the experimental test were firstly carried out and the comparison results prove that the traditional Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm (FFT) analysis is not appropriate for the gear fault detection and identification. Then the wavelet-AR model was applied to extract the feature sets of the gear fault vibration data. In this procedure, the wavelet transform was used to decompose and de-noise the original signal to obtain fault signals, and the fault type information was extracted by the AR parameters. In order to eliminate the redundant fault features, the PCA was furthermore adopted to fuse the AR parameters into one characteristic to enhance the fault defection and identification. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method based on the wavelet-AR model and PCA is feasible and reliable in the gear multi-faults signal diagnosis, and the isolation of different gear conditions, including normal, single crack, single <b>wear,</b> <b>compound</b> fault of <b>wear</b> and spalling etc., has been effectively accomplished...|$|R

For example, PTFE particles compounded in the plastic form a PTFE film over the mating surface, resulting in a reduction of friction and <b>wear.</b> MoS2 <b>compounded</b> in nylon reduces wear, friction and stick-slip.

Of the many sputtering and ion plating modes and configurations the reactive magnetron sputtering and the reactive triode ion plating techniques are the preferred ones to deposit wear resistant coatings for tribological applications. Both of these techniques incorporate additional means to enhance the ionization efficiency and chemical reaction to precision tailor desirable tribological characteristics. Interrelationships between film formation, structure, and ribological properties are strictly controlled by the deposition parameters and the substrate condition.

40|$|The design, {{manufacture}} {{and testing of}} a prototype elastomeric equine boot is described in this thesis. Thoroughbred horses may suffer from a number of serious hoof disorders. These include stone bruising, navicular syndrome and hoof wall separation. Excessive concussion in the equine hoof is a major contributory factor in most of the problems horses experience in their lower limbs. Bandaging of a horses foot after injury is time consuming as well as being labour intensive. The proposed boot serves a number of purposes; by replacing bandages during poulticing it plays a part in faster healing of foot ailments. It can also provide temporary protection during light working on hard surfaces or at grass. Another unique feature of the boot is to enhance performance, through optimising shock absorption and eliminating the need for unsafe fastening devices that are typical of many designs currently available. The sides of the boot are made up of an elastic material while the sole of the boot will consist of a <b>wear</b> resilient <b>compound.</b> The {{manufacture and}} moulding of an initial prototype is described, along with a discussion on how computer simulated models of horse movement were generated. The measurement and digitising of a typical horses foot and its modelling using computer software is discussed. Thereafter, manufacture and moulding of an initial prototype is described along with a discussion on how computer simulated models of horse movement were generated. The manufacture of prototype boots culminated in a series of field tests. The field test procedures are discussed and the results of these are compared with a finite element analysis (FEA) model of the boot. Finally, conclusions identifying the significant elements of the design, production and evaluation of a novel equine boot are offered, followed by proposals and recommendations for further work...|$|R
40|$|Key Words: Corrosive wear; liquid zinc;;H 13;;Co-based alloy; Fe-based alloy Abstract: In {{continuous}} hot dip galvanizing, serving parts {{working in}} the molten zinc, such as sink roll, sleeves, etc. tend towards degradation and failure due to corrosion and wear. In this paper, corrosive wear performance of several materials, such as boronized，H 13 ，Co-based alloy and Fe-based alloy coupled with Si 3 N 4 is evaluated {{with the aid of}} a self-made test machine of block-column sliding wear. Moreover, the corrosive wear mechanism is analyzed. It has been found that these materials suffered not only considerable wear, but also the corrosion of molten zinc. For boronized layer, the wear is the main reason to cause the failure of work parts under the act of the corrosive wear. For H 13, the interaction between corrosion and wear plays a very important role on its failure. For those alloys with bad corrosion resistance such as Co-based alloy and Fe-based alloy, both corrosion of solid solution and <b>wear</b> of intermetallic <b>compound</b> act on their failure at the same time. However, the rate of wear shows no obvious relation to the hardness although wear performance is important. The failure greatly lies on the ratio of the hardness of corrosion products to matrix...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{we report on the}} film growth and {{characterization}} of thin (approximately 50 nm thick) Ti-Fe-C films deposited on amorphous quartz. The experimental studies have been complemented by first principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon annealing of as-prepared films, the composition of the metastable Ti-Fe-C film changes. An iron-rich phase is first formed close to the film surface, but with increasing annealing time this phase is gradually displaced toward the film-substrate interface where its position stabilizes. Both the magnetic ordering temperature and the saturation magnetization changes significantly upon annealing. The DFT calculations show that the critical temperature and the magnetic moment both increase with increasing Fe and C-vacancy concentration. The formation of the metastable iron-rich Ti-Fe-C compound is reflected in the strong increase of the magnetic ordering temperature. Eventually, after enough annealing time (≥ 10 minutes), nano-crystalline α-Fe starts to precipitate and the amount and size of these precipitates can be controlled by the annealing procedure; after 20 minutes of annealing, the experimental results indicate a nano-crystalline iron-film embedded in a <b>wear</b> resistant TiC <b>compound.</b> This conclusion is further supported by transmission electron microscopy studies on epitaxial Ti-Fe-C films deposited on single crystalline MgO substrates where, upon annealing, an iron film embedded in TiC is formed. Our results suggest that annealing of metastable Ti-Fe-C films can be used as an efficient way of creating a wear-resistant magnetic thin film material. Comment: 23 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|State-of-the-art {{friction}} {{materials for}} applications in disc brake systems are constituted by composite materials, specifically formulated to ensure proper friction and wear performances, under the sliding contact conditions of braking events. The bases of typical friction compound formulations usually include 10 to 30 different components bonded with a polymeric binder cross-linked in situ. Main requests {{to be fulfilled}} during braking are an adequate friction efficiency and enough mechanical resistance to withstand the torque generated by forces acting on the disc brake. Generally, each component confers distinctive properties to the mixture and their primary function can be classified in the following categories: binders confer mechanical strength to friction material guaranteeing pad compactness during use, abrasives increase friction efficiency and improve <b>compound</b> <b>wear</b> resistance, solid lubricants are responsible for stabilizing friction coefficient and contrasting the build-up effect, reinforcements increase mechanical strength improving wear minimization and stabilization. Furthermore, other modifying components such as fillers and functionalizers are involved which are {{not directly related to}} friction efficiency, e. g. cheap materials, pigments, etc. Organic brake pads for disc-brake applications are based on phenolic resin binders, generally it requires three main manufacturing steps: raw material blending, where friction compound components are mixed by blenders. Hot-molding, where blended friction mix is pressed against a metallic support at controlled high pressure (> 2 kN/cm 2), temperature (150 - 200 °C) and pressing time (3 - 10 minutes). Brake pads post-curing, to complete the hardening of polymeric binder. This last step for phenolic resin is usually performed in a batch convective oven at temperature above 150 °C for 4 - 12 h, or alternatively using a continuous process, such as IR in-line tunnel ovens where the process time is 10 - 15 min, the oven heater temperature is between 500 and 700 °C and brake pad superficial temperature is easily above 300 °C. Such kind of formulations and manufacturing process reflects the generally acknowledged state of the art as regards organic friction materials for passenger cars and light trucks. In this panorama the idea of introducing a completely inorganic binder matrix would represent nowadays an extremely appealing topic in the field considering potential improvements of this alternative approach. The complete elimination of the organic binder would reduce emission of phenol-formaldehyde hazardous derivatives generated at high-temperature e. g. volatile organic compounds, highly toxic polyaromatic hydrocarbons etc… Nature and toxicity of the organic compounds released at high temperature was investigated on brake pads manufacturing and compared with preliminary studies recently published. Introducing an inorganic hydraulically bonded matrix in place of the traditional organic-based binders would lead to a substantial reduction of the total embodied energy and water of brake pads considering low-temperature manufacturing process and inorganic binders properties. Primary production embodied energy for phenolic resin is estimated in the range of 75 - 83 MJ/kg (cradle to gate), while primary production water usage (embodied water) is in the range of 94 - 282 l/kg. As a matter of comparison, examples of the embodied energy for inorganic binders typically used for concrete construction are: Portland cements 4. 9 MJ/kg, fly ash 9. 3 MJ/kg, metakaolin 1. 4 MJ/kg, silica fume 0. 036 1. 4 MJ/kg. The embodied water for these raw materials usually is less than 0. 048 l/kg. Well-known properties of such peculiar inorganic materials exploiting the hydraulic activity of binders when exposed to water or alkaline environment. The only energy demanding compound was the alkaline solution (e. g. for sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate the embodied energy is respectively of 22 MJ/kg and 16 MJ/kg). New brake pad manufacturing process allowed the substitution of commonly implied highly energy-consuming procedures with low-temperatures steps. Friction material components except binders were blended together with conventional plow-blade blender forming a dry friction-mix, then this dry friction-mix is blended with the inorganic binder and water or alkaline activators in a planetary mixer forming a wet friction-mix. Eventually wet friction mix is cold-pressed onto a metal back-plate without the need for further treatments at high temperature. It immediately emerges the energetic benefit connected to the manufacturing process of this inorganic binder-based brake pads. After brake pad production, the behavior of these inorganic materials was compared to traditional phenolic-based friction materials. Brake pads were tested on a full scale automotive brake dynamometer and on a real vehicle (in terms of performance and particle emission) following custom and international standard procedures. The aim of this work was to produce brake pad prototypes with friction material based on an inorganic hydraulic binder at performance comparable to commercial brake pads with organic-matrix based friction materials. The results obtained so far resulted particularly promising and paved the way to further developments of these novel class of friction materials. ...|$|R
