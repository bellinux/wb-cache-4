50|$|The car {{is unique}} in that it uses Hi-Pa Drive <b>wheel</b> <b>motors</b> without any gears, the motors are {{directly}} connected to the <b>wheels</b> (<b>wheel</b> <b>motors).</b> This effectively means {{there will be no}} transmission or gear lever in the ReCharge. The removal of any transmission gears is expected to increase efficiency by 10 to 20 percent. This direct connection will require software to ensure that the motors act exactly in sync.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{method used}} is {{to replace the}} cast iron {{friction}} brake assembly with a <b>wheel</b> <b>motor</b> assembly of similar weight. This results in no net gain in unsprung weight and a car capable of braking up to 1G. [...] A {{good example of this}} is the Michelin Active <b>Wheel</b> <b>motor</b> as fitted to the Heuliez Will that results in an unsprung weight of 35 kg on the front axle which compares favorably to a small car such as a Renault Clio that has 38 kg of unsprung weight on its front axle.|$|E
50|$|The {{wheel hub}} motor (also called <b>wheel</b> <b>motor,</b> wheel hub drive, hub motor or in-wheel motor) is an {{electric}} motor that is incorporated into the hub of a wheel and drives it directly.|$|E
5000|$|When used in {{extended}} range electric vehicles the static efficiency drawback is irrelevant, since the gas turbine can be run {{at or near}} maximum power, driving an alternator to produce electricity either for the <b>wheel</b> <b>motors,</b> or for the batteries, as appropriate to speed and battery state. The batteries act as a [...] "buffer" [...] (energy storage) in delivering the required amount of power to the <b>wheel</b> <b>motors,</b> rendering throttle response of the gas turbine completely irrelevant.|$|R

30|$|As {{indicated}} in the table, the <b>wheels</b> <b>motors</b> are always engaged during the entire process as there are always {{a change in the}} location of the COM and possibility of external disturbance during the picking and/or placing of the object. For all subtasks, (a–f), the <b>wheels</b> <b>motors</b> need to develop the appropriate torque signal that is sufficient to keep the vehicle balance in an upright vertical position. The engagement of linear actuators will be as when needed during the picking, placing stages to complete both tasks. Switching mechanisms are designed to determine the period of engagement of each individual actuator.|$|R

50|$|The 2016 Indy Lights {{season was}} {{a season of}} open <b>wheel</b> <b>motor</b> racing. It was the 31st season of the Indy Lights series and the 15th sanctioned by IndyCar, acting as the primary support series for the IndyCar Series.|$|E
50|$|The major {{disadvantage}} of wheel hub motors {{are that the}} weight of the electric motors would increase the unsprung weight, which adversely affects handling and ride (the wheels are more sluggish in responding to road conditions, especially fast motions over bumps, and transmit the bumps to the chassis instead of absorbing them). Most conventional electric motors include ferrous material composed of laminated electrical steel. This ferrous material contributes most of the weight of electric motors. To minimize this weight several recent <b>wheel</b> <b>motor</b> designs have minimized the electrical steel content of the motor by utilizing a coreless design with Litz wire coil windings to reduce eddy current losses. This significantly reduces <b>wheel</b> <b>motor</b> weight and therefore unsprung weight.|$|E
50|$|Briggs & Stratton {{kept the}} motor {{that had been}} the heart of the Motor Wheel and adapted it to other {{applications}} such as lawn mowers and running small equipment. The Motor <b>Wheel</b> <b>motor</b> was the progenitor of all Briggs & Stratton motors to follow.|$|E

50|$|Eventually {{the growth}} in power of the {{gasoline}} engine overtook {{the power of the}} electric <b>wheel</b> hub <b>motors</b> and this made up for any losses through a transmission.

Cheaper alternatives are asynchronous AC or brushed DC motors.|$|R
