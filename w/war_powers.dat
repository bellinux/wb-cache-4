At this time, the USSR achieved rough nuclear parity with the United States; meanwhile, the Vietnam War both weakened America's {{influence in the}} Third World and cooled relations with Western Europe. Although indirect conflict between Cold <b>War</b> <b>powers</b> continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions were beginning to ease.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Fort Sumter, Lincoln {{realized}} {{the importance of}} taking immediate executive control {{of the war and}} making an overall Union military strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his <b>war</b> <b>powers,</b> and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} {{to questions of}} executive <b>war</b> <b>power</b> emphasize presidential-congressional relations, {{and focus on the}} meaning and implications of specific constitutional clauses. This dissertation offers an alternative approach by examining executive <b>war</b> <b>power</b> through the higher, more normative purposes to which the Constitution aims. It views executive <b>war</b> <b>power</b> from the perspective of Constitution's basic but essential goal of self-preservation, and argues that the Presidency has a unique duty to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. Presidential power, therefore, should be viewed in light of its duties to preserving the constitutional order. Presidential power, however, should not be viewed as "anything goes" for, true to republican principles, the people ultimately are sovereign and have multiple constitutional means by which to hold their leaders accountable. The dissertation focuses its analysis on the Constitution's text, examining Publius and other writings of the Founding era, to help uncover the explicit purpose and implicit principles for understanding the Constitution. Understanding "to what end" the Constitution aims provides the lens through which we should view the actions of its institutions and officers. The dissertation then offers an interpretative analysis of President Washington's words and deeds during the Whiskey Rebellion, demonstrating that his construction of the executive <b>war</b> <b>power</b> offers an important contribution to U. S. constitutionalism. It also focuses on Lincoln's construction of the executive <b>war</b> <b>power</b> during the Civil War, arguing that although Lincoln exercised extraordinary power in meeting the necessity of the situation, he did so while remaining true to both the spirit and the letter of the Constitution. This counters conventional opinions that Lincoln's conduct was un- or extraconstitutional, or that he had to act outside of the Constitution in order to save it. The dissertation suggests that the constitutionalism and statesmanship of Washington and Lincoln offer much perspective for understanding issues surrounding the executive <b>war</b> <b>power</b> today...|$|R

40|$|The {{struggle}} between the President and the Congress over the power to control {{the use of military}} force is an enduring dimension of U. S. foreign policy. In the 20 th century Arthur Schlesinger labeled the growth of Presidential <b>war</b> <b>power</b> the “Imperial Presidency. ” While some scholars have attempted to explain the expansion of Presidential power based on the Cold War or nuclear weapons, there has been little work studying the link between America’s ascending role in international legal frameworks and this domestic legal transformation. In this dissertation, I argue that America’s participation in international legal frameworks, such as the United Nations and NATO, has been a central factor in enabling the growth of Presidential <b>war</b> <b>power.</b> These international frameworks allow the President to circumvent Congress and to assert that {{the use of military force}} was something other than a ‘war’ that would need Congressional authorization. In case studies of pre-WWII aid to Great Britain, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Gulf War, I demonstrate how the rise of executive <b>war</b> <b>power</b> relied on America’s growing participation in international legal frameworks. The dissertation contributes to the nexus of International Relations and Constitutional scholarship. It offers a unique interpretation of Presidential <b>war</b> <b>power</b> while also offering new insights on the nature of the United States’ relationship with international legal frameworks. I argue that participation in international legal frameworks has been ‘democracy-undermining’ as the President utilizes those frameworks to circumvent the Constitution’s restrictions on Presidential <b>war</b> <b>power.</b> This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|R

40|$|From the Vietnam War to the present, {{there has}} been a growing {{impression}} that federal courts lack both the jurisdiction and the competence to decide <b>war</b> <b>power</b> disputes. Such a cramped view finds no support in the first century and a half, when courts regularly accepted and decided such cases. It was only with Vietnam that courts began to avoid the merits of <b>war</b> <b>power</b> cases by invoking a variety of threshold tests. Following 9 / 11, the broad and expansive justifica tions ofunilateral presidentialpowerJ by the Bush administration forced federal courts to revisit and reassert their constitutional responsibilities. The terrorist attacks of 9111, followed by the creation of a military tribunal, treat ment of detainees, and passage of the USA Patriot Act, brought to the fore again the question of what role federal courts should play in policing the <b>war</b> <b>power.</b> Contempo rary legal studies often argue that foreign affairs-and particularly issues of war and peace-lie beyond the scope of judicial jurisdiction and competence. However, the record over the past two centuries demonstrates that not only have courts decided <b>war</b> <b>power</b> issues many times, they have curbed presidential military actions in time of war.

40|$|It is {{the object}} of this {{dissertation}} to consider, as a problem of constitutional law, the nature and scope of the <b>war</b> <b>power</b> of the central government in Australia, Canada, and the United States. The <b>war</b> <b>power</b> is something of an anomaly in federal constitutional law. In exercising it the central government may transcend the federal division of powers which is described in the organic law, and, to an extent which varies with the degree of emergency which is present, may invade an area which is normally reserved to the regional governments. Under conditions of an emergency attributable to war, the central government may also enact war legislation which in normal times would be considered to fall within the prohibition of a constitutional limitation. The constitutional systems of Australia, Canada, and the United States exhibit, sufficient similarities to make a comparative study of the <b>war</b> <b>power</b> profitable. In each the wax power is entrusted to the central government; in each the regional governments possess other reserved powers which in normal times may not be exercised by the central government; in each the federal judiciary has the last word in interpreting a written constitution. But certain basic dissimilarities dictate the pattern which this comparative study must follow. [Please see pdf. for full abstract. ...|$|R

25|$|In July 1829, Mexican {{authorities}} had other concerns, as General Isidro Barradas landed 2,700 Spanish {{troops to the}} eastern coast of Mexico, near Tampico {{in an attempt to}} reclaim the country for Spain. At the request of the government, Austin mustered a local militia to help defend Texas if the invasion were to reach the northern regions of the country. Yucatan governor Antonio López de Santa Anna led a force of Mexican troops to halt the invasion. Barradas surrendered as his troops suffered greatly from tropical diseases, and Santa Anna was hailed as a hero. During the invasion, the Mexican Congress had granted <b>war</b> <b>powers</b> to President Guerrero, making him essentially a dictator. This alarmed the Anglo colonists in Texas, who were accustomed to a separation of powers.|$|E
25|$|Also {{important}} were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing {{the national}} purpose and his skill {{in keeping the}} border states committed to the Union cause. The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's <b>war</b> <b>powers.</b> The Confederate government failed {{in its attempt to}} get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was 95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and Britain's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either Britain or France would enter the war.|$|E
