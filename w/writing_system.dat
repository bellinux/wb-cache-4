5|$|The Maya <b>writing</b> <b>system</b> (often called hieroglyphs from a {{superficial}} {{resemblance to the}} Ancient Egyptian writing) is a logosyllabic <b>writing</b> <b>system,</b> combining a syllabary of phonetic signs representing syllables with logogram representing entire words. Among the writing systems of the Pre-Columbian New World, Maya script most closely represents the spoken language. At any one time, no more than around 500 glyphs were in use, some 200 of which (including variations) were phonetic.|$|E
5|$|The Maya <b>writing</b> <b>system</b> {{is one of}} the {{outstanding}} achievements of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Americas. It was the most sophisticated and highly developed <b>writing</b> <b>system</b> {{of more than a dozen}} systems that developed in Mesoamerica. The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 300–200 BC, in the Petén Basin. However, this is preceded by several other Mesoamerican writing systems, such as the Epi-Olmec and Zapotec scripts. Early Maya script had appeared on the Pacific coast of Guatemala by the late 1st century AD, or early 2nd century. Similarities between the Isthmian script and Early Maya script of the Pacific coast suggest that the two systems developed in tandem. By about AD 250, the Maya script had become a more formalized and consistent <b>writing</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-established}} <b>writing</b> <b>system</b> for ASL, written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic <b>writing</b> <b>system</b> for a sign language {{seems to be that}} of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles.|$|E

Earlier-established civilizations to the west and north of the Maya homelands that also had scripts recorded in surviving inscriptions include the Zapotec, Olmec, and the Zoque-speaking peoples of the southern Veracruz and western Chiapas area—but their scripts are as yet largely undeciphered. It is generally agreed that the Maya <b>writing</b> <b>system</b> was adapted from {{one or more of these}} earlier systems.

5|$|Although Braille was {{admired and}} {{respected}} by his pupils, his <b>writing</b> <b>system</b> was not {{taught at the}} Institute during his lifetime.

5|$|December 2012 {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of a b'ak'tun—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in Central America prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the Olmec, it has become closely associated with the Maya civilization, whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900AD. The <b>writing</b> <b>system</b> of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered, meaning that a corpus of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the European conquest.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{deciphering}} of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to understand that it was a fully functioning <b>writing</b> <b>system</b> in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe {{would have been able to}} write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.|$|E

5|$|The Eskayan <b>writing</b> <b>system</b> {{takes the}} form of a syllabary of over 1,000 characters, all modeled on parts of the human body {{including}} internal organs.

While there are no mother-tongue speakers of Eskayan, it is taught to both adults and children in volunteer-run cultural schools. The Eskayan language and script has been the object of ongoing controversy.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} writing came to Japan from the Korean kingdom of Baekje {{in the form}} of {{classical}} Chinese books likely written on paper and {{in the form of}} manuscript rolls (kansubon). This probably happened {{at the beginning of the}} 5th century (around 400), and certainly during the 6th century. According to legend the scholar Wani introduced the Chinese <b>writing</b> <b>system</b> as well as Confucianism to Japan. The oldest texts of Japanese origin, which show a clear understanding of the concept of writing, date to the 5th century and are—like most texts from before 700—inscriptions on stone or metal.|$|E
5|$|While {{the name}} Thuthmose {{had also been}} {{identified}} (but not read) by Young who realized that the first syllable was spelled with a depiction of an ibis representing Thoth, Champollion was {{able to read the}} phonetic spelling of {{the second part of the}} word, and check it against the mentioning of births in the Rosetta stone.

5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard <b>writing</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} post-Soviet states, {{the change in}} <b>writing</b> <b>system</b> and the debates {{surrounding}} it is closely intertwined with political themes.

The Persian alphabet is supported by the devoutly religious, Islamists, and by those who wish to bring the country closer to Iran and their Persian heritage. As the de facto standard, the Cyrillic alphabet is generally supported by those who wish to maintain the status quo, and not distance the country from Russia.|$|E
5|$|Because all {{languages}} have a {{very large}} number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a <b>writing</b> <b>system</b> is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.|$|E
