500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone magazine in June 2005, Yellowcard vocalist Ryan Key revealed that the song was written [...] "really late in the process" [...] when development of the album began. Key also talked about the sound featured in the song, saying: [...] "...it's got such an amazing, driving, rock-&-roll vibe to it, with none of that frickin' pop-punk and alternative rock stigma. Secondly, I hate yellowcard being tagged as an alternative rock band. It's just a great rock song. That's something we've been striving to write for a long time, so when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>done,</b> it was a relief." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 23, 2008, it was {{announced}} Solo would be the starting goalkeeper for the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. In a reversal of roles from the 2004 Olympics, Briana Scurry {{did not make the}} team, though she was an alternate. On August 21, the U.S. women's team won the gold medal by defeating Brazil 1–0 in extra time, in no small measure due to Solo's performance as she stopped an energetic Brazilian attack, making save after save. After the team won gold, Solo appeared on NBC Today Show, and she stated in a 2012 article appearing in ESPN The Magazine that she was drunk while on air. [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>done</b> partying, we got out of our dresses, got back into our stadium coats and, at 7 a.m. with no sleep, went on the Today show drunk." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 5, {{the band}} cut [...] "Black Hearted Woman" [...] and [...] "Trouble No More", {{and the group}} {{completed}} [...] "Whipping Post" [...] after another day off on August 7 (it took the entirety of that day’s session to complete the recording, {{despite the fact that}} they had performed the number countless times). The next day, the band attempted to record [...] "Statesboro Blues," [...] which was the song that influenced Duane Allman to begin slide playing. Unable to achieve the same energy as it would performed live, the band scrapped the recording and session for the day. [...] "Every Hungry Woman" [...] was recorded on August 11, and their last day in the studio on Tuesday, August 12 produced a final version of [...] "Dreams". Johanson remembered the process as only taking four days; [...] "We went in there, played our asses off, and that was it; <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>done</b> in four days and they spent the rest of the time mixing," [...] said Johanson.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{function}} of the pusdalyvis is to indicate a simultaneous, but secondary action done by the sentence subject in nominative case (it must be matched according to gender and number with the said subject): Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuodami – <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the field works while singing. In this case the present padalyvis participle {{can be used as}} well: Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuojant, but this time the sentence will mean: <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the field works while someone else was singing. A secondary action done previously by the sentence subject can be expressed with adjectival past simple participle: Lauko darbus mes dirbome padainavę – <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the field works having sung. When used with the preposition prieš (before), pusdalyvis and padalyvis denote a secondary action in future: Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuodami. – <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the field works before singing. Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuojant. – <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the field works before someone else started to sing.|$|R
500|$|Church {{explained}} that {{the core of the}} project was its [...] "dynamic creation". He noted that the team had [...] "no set of rules [...] or pre-written plan", but rather worked organically toward the general idea of creating a [...] "dungeon simulation". Church believed that the game's Ultima series heritage was extremely helpful, as it gave the team an anchor for their experiments. According to Church, because the team was young and inexperienced, they were [...] "improvising almost the whole time". He said that they would [...] "just write something" [...] that seemed interesting, but would then [...] "get it half done, and we'd say, 'Eh? That's not working.'" [...] He believed that this iterative method was useful overall, but that it entailed an abnormally large workload: it resulted in the creation of [...] "four movement systems before <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>done,</b> several combat systems, and so forth". Certain failed experiments meant that the team created [...] " [...] code for many ideas {{which turned out to be}} largely irrelevant to the actual gameplay".|$|E
500|$|... "New Slang" [...] {{achieved}} {{a new level}} of cultural significance when it was prominently featured in the film Garden State (2004). In a scene from the film, Sam (portrayed by Natalie Portman) tells Andrew Largeman (played by director Zach Braff) that the song [...] "will change your life." [...] The song [...] "changed everything" [...] for the group, leading their first two albums to sell more than twice what they had prior to the film's debut. [...] "Almost overnight, the Shins became indie-rock icons," [...] wrote Robert Levine of Spin. The band extended their tour in support of the song and its popularity. [...] "We saw a change in our audience. By the time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>done</b> touring for Chutes Too Narrow, there was this new interest," [...] said Mercer. [...] "We toured again almost as the soundtrack to that movie, and colleges were all of a sudden interested in us playing on their campuses. We wanted to consummate the new relationship by touring and having a relationship with them. I mean, it just kept growing!" [...] This additional exposure helped Oh, Inverted World move 500,000 units in the United States.|$|E
500|$|... "The Return of Harmony" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the second season. According to Thiessen, the Hub and its parent company Hasbro had [...] "approved the season two before <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>done</b> with season one; {{they knew they had}} {{something}} good on their hands." [...] He explained, [...] "they saw [...] of the show early on, which is [...] rare because usually a season will be one and aired before a network will renew it because {{they want to know what}} the numbers are, but they, I guess, a bit of a risk on their behalf, but I'm glad they did." [...] The finale scene of the episode is a parody of the ending from the 1977 movie [...] According to Thiessen, the joke was an [...] "afterthought"; originally, there was going to be a more elaborate ending, but due to time constraints, a new finale was created. During the animation stage, one of the directors noted that the scene was [...] "kind of like the ending to A New Hope" [...] and so, the decision was made to create [...] "scene for scene" [...] parody of the original.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} the band was set to perform at Summersault in August 2000, about eight songs, {{including}} [...] "Life" [...] and [...] "Everyone's a Junkie", had been recorded as demos while the band {{was on the road}} touring. Guitarist Turner noted: [...] "After <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>done</b> we brought them in for the record company to hear, with an eye to making plans for next year. They heard what we were doing and said, 'Well, let's finish the album you're working on.' And we thought, 'Album? We're just demoing.' But they told us what we had was great, so we went back into the studio with Arn and did just that." [...] Over the next two months, the band worked to complete the album with Arnold Lanni at Arnyard Studios in Toronto as well as Avatar Studios in New York City. Rumors had surfaced that, while in New York, Our Lady peace had dropped Lanni as producer to work with The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. These rumors were later debunked by Maida. The first songs to be played live were [...] "Life" [...] and [...] "Everyone's a Junkie", which debuted during Summersault in August 2000 shortly after they were first recorded. In an August 2000 interview with Chartattack Raine revealed that a song titled [...] "Yesterday" [...] (later to become [...] "Middle of Yesterday") was almost guaranteed to be the first single for Spiritual Machines.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Us Weekly, Makeba Riddick, who assisted with the song's vocal production, spoke about {{the inspiration for the}} song. Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song, and had been working with Stargate to develop it. Upon hearing it, Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed, and sent it to Riddick for completion. Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from: [...] "I was listening to the words and me and [...] and we were just laughing and talking about so many situations that have happened in the past and that happen to women everywhere. By the time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>done</b> of course, we were laughing and giggling about the lyrics [...] surprisingly everybody went nuts over the song." [...] Dean explained the development of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] in {{an interview}} with The Boom Box, and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song's lyrics. Dean praised Rihanna's ability to take risks with her music, saying [...] "I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won't say. Even if she says let's go kiss some girls, who really cares...that's Rihanna. Music is about fantasy. This is what people want to do, but are afraid to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Enigk confessed in an {{interview}} in December 2008 that because the band had already broken up during the recording of LP2, he and Hoerner never sat down to complete the lyrics; [...] "We broke up and we just felt like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>done.</b> We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren’t lyrics! In a lot of cases, we never sat down to write them, because we just wanted {{to get it out of}} the way as fast as possible. So I just sang a lot of gibberish, which makes it really quirky. My favorite is the Japanese translations".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, {{but there was no way}} he would come with enough songs to fill out the rest of the record. So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>done</b> playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E
