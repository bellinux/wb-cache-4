5|$|Hotze's force took {{relatively}} high casualties—1,000men killed, <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> missing (12.5 percent) of his entire force of 8,000—although his losses were comparable to Ney's 800 killed <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> missing, from his 7,000-man force (11.5 percent). More importantly, though, Hotze succeeded {{not only in}} pushing the French back from Winterthur, but also in uniting his force with Nauendorf's and Charles'. The unified Austrian force completed the semicircle around Masséna's positions at Zürich.|$|E
5|$|Casualty {{figures were}} {{extremely}} variable, but British casualties (killed, <b>wounded,</b> <b>or</b> captured) {{appear to have}} been in the low 30s according to press accounts (contrary to Dickinson's claim of 49 prisoners taken), while militia casualties were relatively small in number.|$|E

5|$|Operation Brevity {{failed to}} achieve most of its objectives, {{succeeding}} only in retaking the Halfaya Pass. The British lost five tanks destroyed and a further 13 were damaged but the tank regiments suffered no losses in personnel. Total casualties amounted to at least 206 men. The 1st Durham Light Infantry suffered the most during the operation losing 196 men killed, <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> captured. The 2nd Scots Guards lost one man killed and four wounded, the 3rd Coldstream Guards lost one man killed and the 11th Hussars suffered four men wounded. Losses among the 2nd Rifle Brigade are unknown. German casualties numbered three tanks (a Panzer II and two Panzer IIIs, although several more suffered minor damage) and 258 men killed, <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> captured. Jack Greene and Alessandro Massignani place total Italian losses at 395. Allied accounts record the capture of 347 of these men.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union lost around 27 {{million people}} during the war, {{including}} 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths. The largest portion of military dead were 5.7 million ethnic Russians, followed by 1.3 million ethnic Ukrainians. A quarter {{of the people in}} the Soviet Union were <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> killed. Germany sustained 5.3 million military losses, mostly on the Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} Axis forces surrendered on 13 May 1943 {{bringing the}} Tunisian campaign {{to an end}} with a cost to the 1st Parachute Brigade of 1,700 killed, <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> missing. They had nevertheless proved themselves in combat and been nicknamed the Red Devils by the German forces they had fought against.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} 700 {{inhabitants}} lost between 50 and 100 {{people who were}} either killed, <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> captured. Virtually all casualties were civilians. A year later, the Spaniards from St. Louis raided Fort St. Joseph and brought the captured British flag back to St. Louis.|$|E
5|$|To {{look after}} the regiment's horses, {{attached}} to the regimental headquarters, was a veterinary officer, a quartermaster sergeant farrier (also responsible for killing <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> sick horses), a saddler sergeant, and a saddle-tree maker. Each squadron had two saddlers, one a sergeant, and each troop had a shoeing smith. The regiment had 528 riding horses, seventy-four draught horses, six pack horses, eighteen carts or horse-drawn wagons, and fifteen bicycles.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{casualty}} {{figures for}} the battle as a whole were not produced but can be inferred by examining the two operations. The accepted toll for Operation Atlantic is 1,349, with about 300 fatalities. Operation Spring's losses were about 500 killed with a further 1,000 captured or wounded. Working from these figures, historians estimate around 800 Canadian dead and 2,000 <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> captured. The Canadian dead are buried in Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, between Caen and Falaise.|$|E
5|$|Contreras' unit {{arrived in}} Northern Africa on January 27, 1943, and {{rendered}} overseas duties in Algiers within General Dwight D. Eisenhower's theatre headquarters, dealing with nightly German air raids. Contreras remembers {{that the women}} who served abroad were not treated like the regular Army servicemen. They did not receive overseas payment nor could they receive government life insurance. They had no protection if they became ill, <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> captured. She served until 1945 and earned the European-African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with 2 Battle Stars, World War II Victory Medal, American Campaign Medal, Women's Army Corps Service Medal and the Army Good Conduct Medal.|$|E

5|$|John Fortescue's History of the British Army {{says that}} Howe's {{casualties}} numbered 214 British and 99 Hessians. However, Rodney Atwood {{points out that}} Fortescue's figure for the Hessians includes the entire Hessian casualties from 19–28 October and that in fact only 53 of these casualties were incurred at the Battle of White Plains. This revised figure would give a total of 267 British and Hessians killed, <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> missing at White Plains. Henry Dawson, on the other hand, gives Howe's loss as 47 killed, 182 wounded and 4 missing.|$|E
5|$|Macbeth did {{not survive}} the English {{invasion}} for long, for he was defeated and mortally <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> killed by the future Malcolm III ("King Malcolm Ceann-mor", son of Duncan I) {{on the north side}} of the Mounth in 1057, after retreating with his men over the Cairnamounth Pass to take his last stand at the battle at Lumphanan. The Prophecy of Berchán has it that he was wounded and died at Scone, sixty miles to the south, some days later. Macbeth's stepson Lulach was installed as king soon after.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{differ on}} the total {{casualties}} that day. By Stover's account, only 59 men of the 6th reached their destination, and the group suffered 10 killed, more than 20 seriously wounded, and several dozen more with minor injuries. By Stowell's account, only one militiaman was killed, but {{as many as half}} of their number deserted along the march. In their struggle to enter Camden Station, the 5th suffered 16 to 24 injuries, but none seriously <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> killed. Between 9 and 12 civilians were killed, and 13-40 injured.|$|E

5|$|The Union force {{suffered}} significant losses. The Union commander, Colonel Toland, was killed. The severely wounded cavalry commander, Colonel William H. Powell, {{was left}} to die and became a prisoner of the Confederates. (Powell was also second {{in command of the}} entire brigade.) Additional officers and enlisted men were killed, <b>wounded,</b> <b>or</b> missing. The Union after action report listed a total of 86 men killed, wounded, missing, or taken prisoner during the entire expedition—although Confederate leadership believed the Union casualties were much higher. (The entire expedition includes the trips to and from Wytheville.) Approximately 300 horses were lost (killed, <b>wounded,</b> <b>or</b> injured) by the brigade during the raid and retreat—including an estimated 80 killed on the streets of Wytheville. Despite significant losses, the Union brigade was eventually able to secure the town. However, the victory was costly, and the northerners retreated less than 24 hours after entering the small community. A group of soldiers and civilians, less than one third the size of the Union force they opposed, prevented a brigade from destroying vital assets of the Confederacy—a railroad line, telegraph line along the railroad, a lead mine, and possibly a salt mine. After the conflict, Union infantry leaders were critical of the Union cavalry's performance, and men from the cavalry were critical of the infantry leadership's tactics.|$|E
5|$|The average Soviet soldier {{suffered}} from inexperience. With the Soviet debacle {{of the previous}} year ameliorated only by the barest victory at Moscow, most of the original manpower of the Red Army had been killed, <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> captured by the Germans, with casualties of almost 1,000,000 just from the Battle of Moscow. The typical soldier in the Red Army was a conscript and had little to no combat experience, and tactical training was practically nonexistent. Coupled with the lack of trained soldiers, the Red Army also began to suffer from the loss of Soviet industrial areas, and a temporary strategic defense was considered necessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of 5th Mounted Brigade decided to retire towards the Suez Canal, {{and the two}} squadrons from Romani joined him, abandoning much equipment to ride overnight to Bir el Nuss. Wiggin arrived at Dueidar at 09:00 on 24 April with two squadrons. The 5th Mounted Brigade had been completely surprised; its commander and his important reserve force {{had been out of}} position at a critical time following false intelligence, and could not support his regiments. The three and a half squadrons at Oghratina and Katia were decimated—almost all were killed, <b>wounded</b> <b>or</b> captured.|$|E
