40|$|Density {{distributions}} {{of red and}} <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroos in the South Australian pastoral zone were determined for the period 1978 - 86. The habitat associations of these kangaroos were analysed using the densities on half-degree blocks, and information on landform and soil type, land use and degradation, vegetation, and climate. Red kangaroos were found throughout the pastoral zone, the highest densities being in the north-east. <b>Western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroos were restricted to the southern parts of the pastoral zone. Higher densities of red kangaroos were associated with pastoral land use, with brown calcareous and red duplex soils, and with areas dominated by low bluebush shrublands. They were not particularly closely associated with areas dominated by mulga. Habitat associations of red kangaroos were different in drought years compared to non-drought years. Changes in density distribution during drought {{appear to have been}} due to the patchiness of rainfall. The relative effect of the drought was greatest {{in the northern part of}} the pastoral zone. Outside this effect, recent rainfall was found to be of only secondary importance to the overall density distribution of red kangaroos. Climatic factors appeared to be the major determinants of the density distribution of <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroos. Low evaporation and relatively high rainfall characterised areas with high densities of <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroos. As was the case with red kangaroos, habitat heterogeneity appeared to be an important requirement of <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroos. Also, habitat associations were different in drought and non-drought years. Despite this, as was the case with red kangaroos, recent rainfall was only of secondary importance to the overall distribution of <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroos...|$|R
40|$|Densities {{of red and}} <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> {{kangaroos}} and euros {{were assessed}} by aerial survey and compared with densities obtained {{in the same area}} by drive counts. The survey area (12. 1 km 2) was long, narrow and sparsely vegetated. Lakes and a kangaroo-proof fence bounded the area on three sides facilitating the drive count. Densities from aerial surveys ranged between 38 and 54 % of the corresponding drive counts for red kangaroos, between 15 and 23 % for <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroos, and between 9 and 10 % for euros. The time of morning at which the surveys were conducted altered these percentages. About twice as many red and <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroos were counted on aerial surveys at sunrise compared to surveys 3. 5 h later...|$|R
40|$|Grey {{kangaroos}} {{are among}} {{the largest and most}} con-spicuous of our Australian marsupials. Until recently they were considered a single species (Macropus major) but Poole and others discovered important reproductive dif-ferences between the eastern (now M. giganteus) and western (now M. mginosus) forms (Poole 1973, 1975; Poole and Catling 1974). Thus in <b>Western</b> <b>Grey</b> Kanga-roos pouch occupancy, oestrus cycle length and gesta-tion are all less than those for Eastern Greys and embryonic diapause has not been found in <b>Western</b> <b>Greys.</b> Eastern Grey Kangaroos are common in the eastern states whereas M. fdiginosus occurs along souther...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{large-scale}} monitoring program linked to the management of kangaroos in the South Australian pastoral zone, the <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroo populations have been surveyed annually with fixed-wing aircraft over the 15 -years-period 1978 - 92. <b>Western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroos are restricted in their distribution to the southern regions of the pastoral zone. During {{the period of the}} study, <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroo numbers showed no long-term trends, but did show some marked fluctuations, principally in association with a severe drought. Despite this, and unlike red kangaroos in the South Australian pastoral zone, no consistent, direct association between changes in <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroo numbers and antecedent rainfall could be demonstrated. The postulated {{reason for this is that}} most of the regional <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroo populations examined in this study were low-density populations at the edge of the range of this species. Outside of drought, these populations are likely to be limited by factors other than food, such as climate and unmodified resources in the form of suitable habitat. Also, because boundary populations may well only be maintained by constant loss and recolonisation, local extinctions associated with drought may result in extended delays in the re-establishment of populations in marginal areas. Over the period 1978 - 92, these populations were harvested commercially at annual rates of 5 - 25 %, which were, on the whole, considered to be below the rates suggest to be maximum and sustainable...|$|R

40|$|<b>Western</b> <b>grey</b> {{kangaroos}} (Macropus fuliginosus melanops) are large, foregut fermenting herbivores {{common to}} Australia 2 ̆ 7 s southern woodlands and shrublands, but they extend well into semiarid habitats at the north-eastern {{edge of their}} range. At this range boundary, <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroos occupy open chenopod (saltbush) shrubland, along with Australia 2 ̆ 7 s other large native kangaroos, {{as well as with}} extensive pastoral stock, primarily the wool-breed merino sheep. In this habitat, within a large naturally vegetated enclosure (16 ha), <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroos grazing sympatrically with merino sheep spent much of the day resting under shade trees, and fed mainly during the evening and early morning, mainly on grasses and flat-leaved chenopods. On this diet, <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroos had water turnovers similar to those of red kangaroos, at 1. 1 L d− 1. Sheep, however, used 7. 7 L of water each day. Thus, although the sheep were twice the average body mass of kangaroos, the sheep used more than seven times as much water. This level of water use by sheep was almost half that previously reported for sheep at the same site feeding mainly on salt-laden chenopods (ca. 12 L d− 1), but was consistent with other studies showing lower water usage by sheep feeding on trees and low-salt shrubs; foregut (rumen) contents of our sheep comprised 35...|$|R

50|$|<b>Western</b> <b>grey</b> {{kangaroo}} {{is closely}} related to eastern grey kangaroo (M. giganteus), and their distribution overlaps extensively, especially in the Murray-Darling basin. However, the two species interbreed only rarely in the wild. Although hybridisation occurs in both directions in the overlap zone between the two species in the wild, this {{does not seem to be}} the case with captive animals. Although interbreeding between the two species does occasionally occur in captive animals, viable offspring are only produced when the mating pair consists of a female eastern grey kangaroo and a male <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> kangaroo. This is an example of unidirectional hybridisation.|$|R
