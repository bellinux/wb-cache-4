5|$|HMS <b>Whelp</b> was one {{of eight}} W-class destroyers built for the Royal Navy during the Second World War. Completed in 1944, the ship {{spent most of the}} war {{assigned}} to the Eastern and Pacific Fleets. She screened British aircraft carriers as their aircraft attacked targets in the Japanese-occupied Nicobar Islands, the Dutch East Indies, Formosa and near Okinawa. <b>Whelp</b> was present at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay in 1945 and later in Hong Kong. She was paid off in January 1946 and went into reserve.|$|E
5|$|The W-class destroyers {{were ordered}} on 3 December 1941 and <b>Whelp</b> was {{laid down by}} Hawthorn Leslie and Company at their {{shipyard}} in Hebburn on 1 May 1942. The ship was launched on 3 June 1943 and completed on 14 July 1944. She was initially assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet and was based in Scapa Flow. During her active service, her captain and first lieutenant were Commander G. A. F. Norfolk and Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten (now Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh), respectively. In mid-June, <b>Whelp</b> sailed to Spitsbergen to resupply the small Allied garrison there. <b>Whelp</b> was then assigned to the 27th Destroyer Flotilla which left for the Far East on 2 August and arrived in Trincomalee, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), on 12 September. En route, the ship covered the Allied invasion of Southern France (Operation Dragoon) in mid-August.|$|E
5|$|<b>Whelp</b> Side, between Whelpside Gill and Mines Gill, {{appears as}} a {{distinct}} shoulder of the mountain when seen from the west, largely grassy though with a few crags and boulders in places, and with coniferous plantations on its lower slopes which were planted to stabilise the land around the reservoir. North of Mines Gill are the Helvellyn Screes, a more craggy stretch of hillside, beneath the north-west ridge, with a loose scree covering in places.|$|E
50|$|A <b>whelping</b> box (also {{nesting box}} or <b>whelping</b> pen) is {{designed}} to protect puppies during birth (<b>whelping)</b> and early life by keeping them safely contained, protected from cold, and safe from the danger of crushing or smothering by the mother.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the seals}} that are hunted, are young harp seals, called beaters. They were <b>whelped</b> (born) in February or early March in <b>whelping</b> patches on the ice. Such patches vary from 20 to 200 square kilometres, and may contain {{as many as}} 2,000 adult females per square kilometre. The pups are {{abandoned}} by their mothers at two weeks of age, and remain in the <b>whelping</b> patches until the ice starts to melt in March or early April. The hunt takes place in and around these <b>whelping</b> patches.|$|R
50|$|Under the Duke's command, the Lion's <b>Whelps</b> were privateers {{dedicated}} to increasing his considerable personal fortune. The fleet of ten Lions <b>Whelps</b> was not {{taken over by}} the Navy until 1632, after Buckingham's assassination in 1628, and compensation of at least £4000 was paid to his estate.|$|R
5|$|<b>Whelp</b> {{was sold}} to the South African Navy (SAN) in 1952 and renamed Simon van der Stel. She was {{subsequently}} converted into a fast anti-submarine frigate in the early 1960s {{and served as a}} training ship from 1968 until 1972 when she went back into reserve. Simon van der Stel was recommissioned in 1975 for a refit, but that proved to be uneconomical and she was scrapped the following year.|$|E
5|$|The age {{of first}} {{breeding}} in gray wolves {{depends largely on}} environmental factors: when food is plentiful, or when wolf populations are heavily managed, wolves can rear pups at younger ages {{in order to better}} exploit abundant resources. This is further demonstrated by the fact that captive wolves have been known to breed as soon as they reach 9–10 months, while the youngest recorded breeding wolves in the wild were 2 years old. Females are capable of producing pups every year, with one litter annually being the average. Unlike the coyote, the gray wolf never reaches reproductive senescence. Estrus typically occurs in late winter, with older, multiparous females entering estrus 2–3 weeks earlier than younger females. During pregnancy, female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories, where violent encounters with other packs are more likely. Old females usually <b>whelp</b> in the den of their previous litter, while younger females typically den near their birthplace. The gestation period lasts 62–75 days, with pups usually being born in the summer period.|$|E
25|$|Promotion to {{lieutenant}} followed on 16 July 1942. In October of {{the same}} year, he became first lieutenant of HMS Wallace, at 21 years old {{one of the youngest}} first lieutenants in the Royal Navy. During the invasion of Sicily, in July 1943, as second in command of HMS Wallace, he saved his ship from a night bomber attack. He devised a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully distracted the bombers allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed. In 1944, he moved on to the new destroyer, HMS <b>Whelp,</b> where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla. He was present in Tokyo Bay when the instrument of Japanese surrender was signed. In January 1946, Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the <b>Whelp,</b> and was posted as an instructor at HMS Royal Arthur, the Petty Officers' School in Corsham, Wiltshire.|$|E

500|$|<b>Whelp</b> was {{remained}} in Hong Kong and conducted anti-piracy patrols along the Chinese coast. On 12 November, the ship departed Hong Kong for Sydney, via Darwin, and arrived {{there on the}} 24th to begin a brief refit. She sailed for Britain on 7 December and arrived at Portsmouth on 17 January 1946. <b>Whelp</b> was paid off and was in Category B reserve by 30 May. She was recommissioned on 9 August 1947 and refitted at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard in September–October preparation for the voyage to South Africa in company with her sisters, , [...] and [...] to form the South Atlantic Reserve Force in Simon's Town. <b>Whelp</b> was damaged while in dock on 8 September 1949.

When the Eastern Fleet attempted to attack the oil refinery complex at Pangkalan Brandan, Sumatra, in mid-November, <b>Whelp</b> and her sister ship [...] escorted the oiler [...] The British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was formed a few days afterwards and attacked the refinery at Belawan Deli during Operation Robson a month later, as the ship escorted {{the main body of the}} fleet. She did much the same during Operation Lentil, another attack on the refinery at Pangkalan Brandan at the beginning of January 1945. <b>Whelp</b> was then detached to tow the damaged submarine [...] to Trincomalee, arriving on 8 January. The BPF departed from the port eight days later, bound for Sydney, Australia. En route its aircraft attacked the refineries in Plaju and Sungai Gerong, Sumatra, on 24 and 29 January (Operation Meridian I & II) before arriving on 10 February. <b>Whelp</b> rescued the crew of a crashed Grumman TBF Avenger, Sub-Lieutenant Roy Halliday and his gunner, Norman Richardson, during the second attack.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} this study suggest that, besides the {{irrelevant}} role of body temperature measurement to predict the impending parturition in the bitch, progesterone and 15 -ketodihydroprostaglandin F 2 alpha plasma level records could be more suitable to detect the approaching <b>whelping</b> in this species. More interesting was the statistically significant substantial increase in body temperature beginning 12 h after the onset of parturition. Therefore, if any significant increase in body temperature is recorded at the end of pregnancy without the beginning of the expulsion of fetuses, it could indicate problems at parturition. In this study, cortisol levels increased significantly at the time of delivery and remained high 12 h after the beginning of parturition, decreasing within 36 h after the onset of <b>whelping.</b> 15 -ketodihydro-prostaglandin F 2 alpha levels increased significantly 24 h before parturition and again at the onset of <b>whelping.</b> Progesterone levels decreased significantly, starting 24 h before the onset of <b>whelping</b> and remained low after delivery...|$|R
500|$|On 28 February, the BPF sailed {{for their}} forward base at Manus Island and arrived on 7 March and {{exercised}} together before sailing for Ulithi on 18 March. The BPF joined the American Fifth Fleet there {{two days later}} {{to participate in the}} preliminary operations for the invasion of Okinawa. The British role during the operation was to neutralise airfields on the Sakishima Islands, between Okinawa and Formosa, beginning on 26 March. They later attacked airfields in Formosa before returning to the Sakishima Islands. The BPF retired to Leyte Gulf to rest and resupply on 17 April and <b>Whelp,</b> together with Wager, was tasked to escort the badly damaged carrier [...] to Sydney on 3 May. They arrived on 14 May and <b>Whelp</b> continued on to Melbourne to begin a refit that lasted until July.|$|E

Over the next few years additional Cattle Dogs arrived in the UK from the Netherlands, Kenya, Germany and Australia, although prior to relaxation of rules regarding artificial insemination, the UK gene pool was limited. In 1985 an Australian Cattle Dog Society was formed and officially recognised by the Kennel Club; before this they had to compete in the category [...] "Any Variety Not Separately Classified". Australian Cattle Dogs were competing successfully in obedience and working trials in the UK during the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|To better {{defend the}} ship against Japanese kamikaze suicide aircraft, <b>Whelp</b> had her {{searchlight}} {{replaced by a}} [...] Bofors AA gun in mid-1944. As part of her 1962–64 refit, the ship's aft torpedo tubes were removed {{to make room for}} a small flight deck and hangar for two Westland Wasp helicopters. [...] A pair of Bofors guns were added, one {{on each side of the}} hangar, but these were later replaced by the originally intended pair of American [...] Mk 32 triple-barrelled anti-submarine torpedo tubes. The main guns were replaced by two twin-gun turrets fitted with 4-inch (102mm) Mk XVI guns, one forward of the bridge and the other aft of the hangar.

500|$|Red foxes {{reproduce}} {{once a year}} in spring. Two {{months prior}} to oestrus (typically December), the reproductive organs of vixens change shape and size. By the time they enter their oestrus period, their uterine horns double in size, and their ovaries grow 1.5–2 times larger. Sperm formation in males begins in August–September, with the testicles attaining their greatest weight in December–February. The vixen's oestrus period lasts three weeks, during which the dog-foxes mate with the vixens for several days, often in burrows. [...] The male's bulbus glandis enlarges during copulation, forming a copulatory tie which may last {{for more than an}} hour. The gestation period lasts 49–58 days. Though foxes are largely monogamous, DNA evidence from one population indicated large levels of polygyny, incest and mixed paternity litters. Subordinate vixens may become pregnant, but usually fail to <b>whelp,</b> or have their kits killed postpartum by either the dominant female or other subordinates.|$|E
