5|$|A {{branch to}} Sola has been {{considered}} to allow the trains to operate to Sola and the airport. The line would branch from the Sørland Line south of Gausel, and be built so trains from the branch could run both northwards and southwards. Proposed stations include the airport, Solakrossen, Forus West, Statoil's head office and possibly the shopping center Kvadrat. This <b>would</b> <b>give</b> a travel time of 17 minutes {{from the airport to}} the city center, and 10 minutes from the airport to Sandnes. This route has, however, also been proposed as part of the light rail system. It <b>would</b> <b>give</b> about 2.5 million annual passengers.|$|E

40|$|Background : Acetaminophen {{toxicity}} caused acute liver {{failure that}} result of death. But recently {{study in the}} population showed no toxicity in the people which consuming daily acetaminophen reach toxic dose. The aim of study is to evidence of this phenomena. ALT and AST blood levels and grading of hepatocyte necrosis would be measured {{as an indicator of}} liver histopathology grading. Method : This research is a laboratory study with randomized pre and post test only control group design. Twelve wistar rat which have 400 – 450 gram body weight were divided in two groups. Kontrol (K) was group which <b>would</b> <b>given</b> physiological saline orally during 5 days. On the sixth day, K <b>would</b> <b>given</b> acetaminophen toxic dose orally. Perlakuan (P) was group which <b>would</b> <b>given</b> pretreatment acetaminophen during 5 days. On the sixth day, P <b>would</b> <b>given</b> acetaminophen toxic dose orally. AST and ALT blood levels would measured on first day, sixth day and eleventh day. Histopathology sample would be took at the end of study. Independent t test, paired t test, Pearson correlation test and Kolmogorov-smirnov test were used to data analysis. Result : There are significance difference of hepatocyte necrosis grading in central zone between K and P groups. But, no significance difference of increasing AST (p = 0, 08) and ALT (p= 0, 77) blood levels between K and P groups. Conclusion : Administering of pretreatment acetaminophen were reduced hepatocyte necrosis in central zone significantly. But totally, can not reduced hepatocyte damage in all hepatocyte area. Keywords : Pretreatment acetaminophen – AST/ALT blood levels - hepatocyte necrosis gradin...|$|R

5|$|Keith Park, with {{endorsement}} from Dowding, {{opted for}} the opposite strategy. Park maintained that it was unimportant to inflict large losses on the Germans in comparison to safeguarding his own forces. Park believed the Germans <b>would</b> <b>give</b> up if they could not achieve their aim of air superiority. This, simply put, meant avoiding the destruction and or depletion of Fighter Command was the primary factor in air defence. This would be achieved by sending small numbers of fighters to intercept, minimising losses in the air. By remaining to offer undiminished and constant air opposition, the RAF ensured the Luftwaffe could not win. As long {{as some sort of}} cost was imposed before the enemy dropped his bombs and impaired the defence system, the RAF could remain intact to meet the threat again the next day. To this end, Park favoured the 10 bomber kills before the attack, rather than the 50 shot down after it. The strategy suggested an enemy <b>would</b> <b>give</b> up if he felt he was getting nowhere. For even while his losses remained moderate, it would be senseless to suffer those casualties for no return. Park and Dowding's strategy, under the circumstances, was the wiser choice.|$|E
