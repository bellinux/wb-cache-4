5|$|Cole {{once again}} found {{himself with a}} chance in the Bayern box, but keeper Oliver Kahn hurried out of his goal to punch the ball to safety. At the other end, Basler came close with another free kick before Alexander Zickler sent a shot just wide {{from the edge of}} the box. As half time approached, United winger Ryan Giggs, playing out of {{position}} on the right, sent a weak header towards Kahn from a Cole cross, but that <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> they were to come to a goal in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Under Boyd's {{captaincy}} Birmingham {{reached the}} semifinals of the 1950–51 FA Cup, {{when they were}} defeated by the powerful Blackpool side of Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen only after a replay. They twice came close to winning promotion, missing out by three points in the 1950–51 season and then on goal average the following year. Boyd's performances were rewarded with selection for England B against Netherlands B, a match played {{in front of a}} crowd of 60,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, but this, and a selection as reserve for a Football League representative team in 1954, <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> he came to full international honours.|$|E
5|$|By 08:00, it {{was clear}} that despite his vessels speed, Stewart's plan was going to fail: the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom had not even {{attempted}} to join his advance, deliberately checking their advance towards the French, falling far behind Windham. Although Stewart now faced overwhelming odds, he had no option but to continue the attack: his ship was now too close to attempt to flee from the French frigate. Captain Dornal de Guy opened fire at 09:30, his shot repeatedly striking Windham as she approached. Stewart did not return fire, instead waiting until his ship was closer to minimise the inaccuracy of his gunnery. Unable to reach the more nimble French ship directly, Stewart absorbed the French fire until he <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> he was able before unleashing his guns. The results were disappointing: the entire broadside splashed into the sea far short of the French ship. The more manoeuvrable Manche now approached Windham at close range, and the two ships fired at one another for over an hour, Stewart still unsupported by his companions, who did no more than fire the occasional ineffective shot at extreme range.|$|E

5|$|The Helles landing {{was made}} by the 29th Division (Major General Aylmer Hunter-Weston). The {{division}} landed on five beaches in an arc about the tip of the peninsula, named 'S', 'V', 'W', 'X' and 'Y' Beaches from east to west. On 1 May, the 29th Indian Brigade (including the 1/6th Gurkha Rifles) landed, took and secured Sari Bair above the landing beaches and was joined by the 1st/5th and the 2nd/10th Gurkha battalions; the Zion Mule Corps landed at Helles on 27 April. At 'Y' Beach, during the first engagement, the First Battle of Krithia, the Allies landed unopposed and advanced inland. There were {{only a small number of}} defenders in the village but lacking orders to exploit the position, the 'Y' Beach commander withdrew his force to the beach. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> the Allies ever came to capturing the village as the Ottomans brought up a battalion of the 25th Regiment, checking any further movement.|$|E
5|$|The semi-final pitted United against Barcelona; {{the teams}} had not met since the group {{stage of the}} 1998–99 tournament, the last time United won it. The teams also had {{identical}} records going into the semi-final, each having won eight and drawn two of their 10 games, scoring 18 goals and conceding just five. The first leg at the Camp Nou saw United {{spend most of the}} game defending, while Barcelona tried to pass the ball around them. United were awarded a penalty in the first minute, but Ronaldo sent the ball wide, hitting the stanchion behind the goal. That <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> either team got to a goal in the first leg and it ended 0–0. The second leg at Old Trafford was a game of higher tempo, which United won 1–0 thanks to a goal from Paul Scholes after 14 minutes. This result increased United's consecutive home win record in the Champions League to 12 and ensured that they reached the final unbeaten.|$|E
25|$|At this point, LA {{finally managed}} to respond with Vince Ferragamo's 32-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Preston Dennard, cutting the score to 24-7. But this <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> it would get, as the Redskins added two more touchdowns before halftime, a 21-yard catch by Monk and a 1-yard run by Riggins.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Oliver fumbled a punt return that Johnston {{recovered}} {{to set up a}} Boniol field goal, cutting the deficit to 17–14. But this <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> they would get, as the Panthers kicked three more field goals over the Cowboys one. On the ensuing drive, Johnson rushed six times for 44 yards to set up Kasay's 40-yard field goal. Then after a punt, he carried the ball six times for 22 yards to set up another score on Kasay's 40-yard kick a few plays into the fourth quarter.|$|E
25|$|In the {{championship}} game, Tennessee {{was too much}} for Rutgers. The Lady Vols had an eleven-point lead at halftime, which Rutgers cut to seven, but that <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> they would get. Candace Parker scored 17 points, but Pat Summitt noted the contribution of their 5-foot 2-inch point guard Shannon Bobbitt, who hit two key three-pointers en route to scoring 13 points of her own. Tennessee won 59–46, bringing the seventh national championship to the school, and increasing the win total of Summitt to 947, which is 33 more than Bob Knight, the most victorious coach on the men's side.|$|E

25|$|The Colts {{took the}} opening kickoff and stormed down the field. James gained 39 {{yards on the}} first five plays of the drive, and then Manning {{finished}} it with a 31-yard touchdown pass to Stokley. Denver responded on their ensuing drive, advancing the ball 49 yards in 12 plays and taking 8:13 off the clock. Jason Elam capped off the drive with a 49-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 7–3, but it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> Denver would ever get {{for the rest of}} the game. After the kickoff, Harrison caught three passes for 70 yards, including a pass in which he made a diving catch around three Denver players. All of them thought Harrison was down by contact and started to leave the field, but no one had actually touched him, and Harrison got back up and ran 46 yards for a touchdown.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, {{the musicians}} of OverClocked ReMix {{were chosen to}} handle the Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix soundtrack after Capcom U.S.A. {{associate}} producer Rey Jimenez heard the site's 2006 Super Street Fighter II Turbo tribute album Blood on the Asphalt. Entitled OC ReMix: Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix Official Soundtrack, the complete 66-track album was freely released at OverClocked ReMix. The album includes new arrangements, edited versions of Blood on the Asphalt tracks, and other prior remixes from the site. The remixers arranged the music based on knowledge of the Street Fighter II series alone, as the music for the game was completed before the visuals and gameplay. OC ReMix founder David [...] "djpretzel" [...] Lloyd directed the soundtrack and served as the organization's contact with Capcom [...] "to ensure that working with a large fan community <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> possible for Capcom to working with a single composer". Jimenez praised HD Remixs music as [...] "above and beyond our expectations" [...] and OC ReMix's efforts as [...] "one of the most rewarding aspects of working on SF HD Remix". Capcom's then-Vice-President of Strategic Planning & Business Development, Christian Svensson, described the soundtrack as [...] "impactful" [...] and claimed {{in an interview that}} in demos of the game the remixed music was praised before any other aspect. In its review of HD Remix, IGN commended OC ReMix's work as [...] "a great tribute to the original soundtrack". Other entities with favorable reviews of the soundtrack include Eurogamer, GameSpot, Official Xbox Magazine, and GamesRadar, as well as long-time game composer [...] "The Fat Man" [...] George Sanger, who referred to the Capcom-OC ReMix collaboration as [...] "Game Audio 2.0".|$|E

However, the match {{was running out of}} time, and West Indies A did not seem all that keen on trying to win it. After wicket-keeper Lendl Simmons {{departed}} for 52, a total of 104 runs were hit in 55 overs – Darren Sammy making 40 not out off 166 balls. Yet, a marathon bowling effort from left-arm spinner Sajeewa Weerakoon yielded six wickets for 57 runs, and West Indies A were all out for 205 – setting a target of 218 with around 40 overs remaining. Sri Lanka A went for it positively, hitting at nearly exactly a run a ball, with Avishka Gunawardene top scoring with 49.

2500|$|Tordoff was {{especially}} passionate about peregrine falcons. He {{said this was}} because of {{his experience as a}} pilot, and that [...] "his fighter <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> a human could get to being a peregrine". Pat Redig, one of his collaborators and the founder of the Raptor Center in St. Paul, called Tordoff the [...] "heart and soul" [...] of the peregrine restoration effort. When he started his work, there were almost no breeding peregrines in the eastern United States, and the species was listed under the Endangered Species Act. As part of his work to reestablish peregrines, Tordoff raised funds for the Midwest Peregrine Restoration Project, and ringed hundreds of nestlings. As part of this project, 1286 peregrine chicks were hatched and by 2008 Tordoff and his colleagues had established a population of 128 breeding pairs and growing in the upper Mississippi region. A key part of their success his idea to put peregrine nests on the top of skyscrapers in cities like Minneapolis. This not only increased the availability of nesting sites, but also drew the public's attention, since peregrines could be seen in cities and later on captured on webcams. Season after season, he tracked the success of peregrine falcons and created a large database to analyse the statistics of the growing population. During his retirement, he devoted much of his time to peregrine falcon work.|$|E
