2500|$|Ron Eyerman and Scott Baretta {{speculate}} that: t {{is interesting}} to consider that {{had it not been}} for the explicit political sympathies of the Weavers and other folk singers or, another <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> the hysterical anti-communism of the Cold War, folk music would very likely have entered mainstream American culture in even greater force in the early 1950s, perhaps making the second wave of the revival nearly a decade later [...] redundant.The media blackout of performers with alleged communist sympathies or ties was so effective that Israel Young, a chronicler of the 60s Folk Revival, who himself was drawn into the movement through an interest in folk dancing, communicated to Ron Eyerman that he himself was unaware for many years of the movement's 1930s and early '40s antecedents in left-wing political activism.|$|E

Michael Weatherly and Cote de Pablo both point to [...] "Under Covers", the eighth episode of that season, as the catalyst for the flirtation between the characters. The episode involves Tony and Ziva being sent undercover as a married couple, an assignment that requires them to simulate sexual relations in order to solidify their cover. De Pablo commented, [...] "Michael and I talked about all of those scenes right before we did them. We had a totally different <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> In our minds, we thought the characters weren't faking anything. They just got carried away.

2500|$|The theory {{underlying}} this [...] "exemption" [...] {{is derived}} from the nature of the hearsay rule itself. The hearsay rule operates to exclude extrajudicial assertions as untrustworthy because they cannot be tested by cross-examination. When an assertion is offered into evidence against the defendant and the defendant objects, [...] "hearsay", the defendant is in essence saying [...] "I object to this statement as untrustworthy because I am not afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the person who made it. How can we trust what he said?" [...] But what if the defendant is the person who made the statement that is now being offered against him? To object, [...] "hearsay" [...] in this circumstance would be as absurd as to argue, [...] "This statement is unreliable because I cannot cross-examine myself; therefore, how can I trust what I said?" [...] In this situation the objection of the Hearsay rule falls away, because the very basis of the rule is lacking, viz. the need and prudence of affording an opportunity of cross-examination. Another <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> is that a defendant who faces his own statement being used against him has an opportunity to cross-examine himself – he can take the witness stand and explain his prior assertion, so the rule is satisfied.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{course a}} useful {{modulation}} signal m(t) will generally not {{consist of a}} single sine wave, as treated above. However, by the principle of Fourier decomposition, m(t) can be expressed as the sum {{of a number of}} sine waves of various frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. Carrying out the multiplication of [...] 1+m(t) with c(t) as above then yields a result consisting of a sum of sine waves. Again the carrier c(t) is present unchanged, but for each frequency component of m at fi there are two sidebands at frequencies fc + fi and [...] fc - fi. The collection of the former frequencies above the carrier frequency is known as the upper sideband, and those below constitute the lower sideband. In a slightly different <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> we can consider the modulation m(t) to consist of an equal mix of positive and negative frequency components (as results from a formal Fourier transform of a real valued quantity) as shown in the top of Fig. 2. Then one can view the sidebands as that modulation m(t) having simply been shifted in frequency by fc as depicted at the bottom right of Fig. 2 (formally, the modulated signal also contains identical components at negative frequencies, shown at the bottom left of Fig. 2 for completeness).|$|E
