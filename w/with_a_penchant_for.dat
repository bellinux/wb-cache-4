Following the success of Jerry's opening night in London, Jerry follows Dale to Venice, where she is visiting Madge and modelling/promoting the gowns created by Alberto Beddini (Erik Rhodes), a dandified Italian fashion designer <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> malapropisms.|$|E
5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> practical jokes.|$|E
5|$|Halvdan Koht {{was born}} on 7 August 1873 in Tromsø, {{one of the larger}} cities in Northern Norway. He was the second of four {{children}} born to Paul Steenstrup Koht (1844–1892), an educator and politician, and Betty Giæver (1845–1936), a part-time teacher <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> singing, languages and drawing. Betty's antecedents were mixed: she was maternally descended from Northern Germany, yet on her father's side she was of Norwegian origin—a distinguished forebear on that side was her great-grandfather, the civil servant Jens Holmboe from Tromsø. Through the offspring of his maternal grand-uncle, Halvdan Koht was a third cousin of the parliamentarian Ola Krogseng Giæver. In Paul Koht's lineage, Kjeld Stub was a distant ancestor. The name Koht stems from German immigrants to Norway in the 17th century.|$|E

25|$|Bobby Simpson was a {{physically}} compact, highly accomplished batsman <b>with</b> <b>a</b> striking <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> compiling high scores...He was a pleasant, personable cricketer, and <b>a</b> captain <b>with</b> genuine feeling for his players.

Basson spends his time studying natural landscapes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> the Mediterranean flora, natural hard materials and seasonal variation.|$|R
5|$|Other {{characters}} {{include the}} Soda Poppers, {{a group of}} three former child stars from the 1970s. The three, each with their own trademark catch-phrase, first appear as victims of hypnosis in the first episode, later acting as the judges on a Pop Idol parody in the second episode. By the fourth episode, they are elected the governors of the Dakotas and plunge the region into civil war over ownership of Mount Rushmore. Also making sporadic appearances is Hugh Bliss, an eccentric magician and leader of the Prismatology cult, a parody of Scientology. He is often seen attempting to promote his self-help guides based on Prismatology. Sam finds Bliss irritating, while Max almost idolizes him. Minor characters include Agent Superball, a US Secret Service agent <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> guarding doors; Chuckles, the pit manager in a mafia-run casino; and the Computer Obsolescence Prevention Society (COPS), a group of outdated computers attempting to find purpose in the technologically advanced world.|$|E
5|$|Steph was {{introduced}} as Zara Morgan's (Kelly Greenwood) bitchy friend <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> humiliating and bullying others. She was {{touted as a}} new student for Hollyoaks High {{and was the first}} character from the Dean family to be introduced into the series. Over time the character was joined by an on-screen family. She was not initially particularly close to her brothers and sister, although for many years she tried to maintain a relationship with them. Generally, her mother Frankie never had much time for Steph or her life, usually preferring to involve herself in the lives of Steph's brothers, Craig and Jake, or to boast about her daughter Debbie's professional singing prowess; in contrast Steph had a very close relationship with her father Johnno, who continually supported the family through a number of tough times over the years; however, Steph was hit very hard when he left Hollyoaks in 2005 after discovering that he had an illegitimate baby son.|$|E
5|$|Barry John {{was born}} in Cefneithin, Carmarthenshire in Wales. He was educated at Gwendraeth Grammar School in the Gwendraeth Valley, north of Llanelli. He {{attended}} Cefenithin Primary, {{and there he was}} fortunate to receive skilled rugby teaching. The headmaster, William John Jones, and teacher Ray Williams, were both former Wales international rugby players. Despite his natural talents, he never played at schoolboy level for Wales, but represented both his school and his local village team, Cefneithin RFC. He once played a game for rival team Pontyberem while still a schoolboy, but John recalls in his autobiography that the local resentment at making such a sporting faux pas ensured he never did so again. While still a teenager attending grammar school, he made his first top-flight rugby appearance for Llanelli, on 4 January 1964 in an encounter with Moseley. Although Llanelli lost the encounter, John scored a try and converted it, and played in four more matches for the Llanelli senior team {{towards the end of the}} season. He continued to represent Llanelli while at Trinity College, Carmarthen, and gained a reputation as a kicking fly-half <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> putting over dropped goals. During the 1964/65 season, John began to make an impact on the Welsh club scene. His dropped goal against Aberavon on 26 October 1964, only 17games in, was his 11th of the season.|$|E

He is also a stated fan of heavy metal music, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> the band AC/DC.

50|$|Created at {{the height}} of Beatlemania in the 1960s, the works on the album share many {{characteristics}} with the music of Peter Schickele and his alter ego P. D. Q. Bach. These characteristics include parodies of stereotypical classical music conventions, anachronistic touches, and musical in-jokes that are apparent primarily to other musicians. Rifkin also shares <b>with</b> Schickele <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> unusual names and catalog numbers for the pieces.|$|R

25|$|His {{literary}} style combines {{elements of}} magical realism, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> questioning and complicating questions of authorship by intermingling realistic autobiographical elements with unreliable narrators and fantastic events or happenings that creates irony or satirizes events to form social critiques.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Thynn, 7th Marquess of Bath (born 1932) is {{an artist}} and mural painter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> mazes and {{labyrinths}} (he created the hedge maze, the love labyrinth, the sun maze, the lunar labyrinth and King Arthur's maze on the property).|$|E
25|$|The Synod {{eventually}} cleared Atanasie of all charges, but pressured both Safirin and Atanasie into resigning. Safirin resisted coercion, {{then left}} the country. He returned to favor in 1913, {{but was unable to}} obtain the Râmnic bishopric for himself, and eventually retired to Frăsinei Monastery. He is remembered as a controversial figure: obstinate to the point of mental illness, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rare <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> politics.|$|R
5000|$|He finds two [...] "vultures of the night", enigmatic noctivague figures <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> bohemian lifestyles. The [...] "vultures" [...] (called The Master and The Hunchback) {{take the}} man on a surrealistic journey through the darkest places of the city, to [...] "enjoy the night": a funeral parlor, the {{emergency}} service of a hospital, a deluxe whorehouse and a low-level working class cabaret.|$|R
5000|$|Tamborini et al. (1990) {{considered}} it {{reasonable to expect}} that imagination would {{be an important factor}} in empathy, given these constructs. One must be able to place oneself in the shoes of another, so to speak, to become deeply involved in the plight of the character. The implication could be that individuals <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stronger <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> daydreaming might more readily form <b>an</b> empathic bond <b>with</b> <b>a</b> character, therefore experiencing a stronger emotional connection (p. 620).|$|R
25|$|You Made Me Love You (1933); {{written by}} Frank Launder, {{directed}} by Monty Banks, starring Thelma Todd and Stanley Lupino; a spoilt heiress is married off {{by her father}} to the first suitor to present himself, a songwriter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> practical jokes who must try to charm his way into her affections.|$|E
25|$|Buddy Cole is an effeminate, gay socialite, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> {{going on}} long, comedic rants about his {{personal}} life and the gay community. He also frequently drops celebrity names, insinuating that he has many close friendships with the rich and famous. He is penpals with Elizabeth II. His monologues are often delivered from the gay bar he owns, which is called Buddy's.|$|E
25|$|In January 1896 Wilson {{thought the}} Jameson Raid “very curious” and “most extraordinary”. In January 1896 he seemed {{likely to be}} {{appointed}} brigade major of the 2nd brigade at Aldershot if the current incumbent, Jack Cowans, a notorious womaniser <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> “rough trade”, resigned, although in the event this did not happen until early September. In February 1896 he submitted a 21-page paper on Italian Eritrea, and in March 1896 he briefed Wolseley on the recent Italian defeat at Adowa.|$|E
50|$|The {{unlikely}} {{protagonist of}} the series, Seina, a fifteen-year-old {{high school student}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> supernatural <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> bad luck, is mistakenly enlisted to the Galaxy Police after being coerced to fill out an application, which {{was meant to be}} given to Tenchi. His ultimate decision is to enroll, finding that, in company of others and as the captain of his own ship, his otherwise unfortunate talent proves incredibly useful in rounding up pirates and other lawbreakers.|$|R
5000|$|Humbug the Reusable Man - In {{an attempt}} to create {{artificial}} intelligence, the Department of Scientific Investigation's Darwin Jones, Annetta Kaplan, and Anton Kraft created the computer Gestalt. However, the project took on a life all its own and the trio built a humanoid body for the emerging lifeform giving birth to Humbug. Armed <b>with</b> <b>an</b> army of these artificial bodies endowed with super-strength, super-durability, and able to inflate/deflate, Humbug could jump between them at will <b>with</b> <b>a</b> murderous <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> games.|$|R
60|$|There were warnings, but I did not heed them. For instance, Mrs. Pertonwaithe and Mrs. Wickson {{exercised}} tremendous {{social power}} in the university town, and from them emanated the sentiment that I was a too-forward and self-assertive young woman <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mischievous <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> officiousness and interference in other persons' affairs. This I thought no more than natural, considering the part I had played in investigating the case of Jackson's arm. But the effect of such a sentiment, enunciated by two such powerful social arbiters, I underestimated.|$|R
25|$|Other {{contributors}} to the memorial program characteristically presented Hebard as a multi-faceted, action-driven feminist <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> history and trail marking. Furthermore, Hebard garnered recognition as the first woman admitted to the Wyoming State Bar Association (1898) followed by her being admitted to practice before the Wyoming Supreme Court (1914). Hebard's peers also recognized her involvement {{in a variety of}} civic and public affairs, such as supporting American troops in World War I by selling war bonds and planting Victory Gardens. Moreover, she successfully spearheaded passage of a 1923 Wyoming child labor law.|$|E
25|$|Marta D. Rădulescu (April 24, 1912 – 1959) was a Romanian poet, journalist, and novelist, {{made famous}} in the 1930s for her autofictional work. From an {{academic}} family <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> radical politics, she veered into fascist politics, supporting the Iron Guard. The commitment shaped part of her work, which, from a satirical rendition {{of education in the}} provinces, becomes a document of interwar radicalization and student political battles. Scandal followed the publication of her early prose works, particularly after claims that they had been largely or entirely written by her father—or, alternatively, by her friend and putative lover N. Crevedia. Her polemic with Crevedia was consumed in the national press and in books written by both participants.|$|E
25|$|In 1919 Huxley married Juliette Baillot (1896–1994). She was a French Swiss girl {{whom he had}} met at Garsington Manor, {{the country}} house of Lady Ottoline Morrell, a Bloomsbury Group socialite <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> artists and intellectuals. The newly-weds' life {{together}} included students, faculty wives, grebes and, unfortunately, another depressive breakdown, this time rather serious. From his wife's autobiography it seems his mental illness {{took the form of}} a bipolar disorder, with the depressive phases being of moderate to severe intensity. It took a long time for him to recover on this occasion, but despite this he left a legacy of students who admired him, and who became leaders in zoology for the next thirty or forty years. E. B. Ford always remembered his openness and encouragement at the start of his career.|$|E
50|$|The M'bwebwe {{group is}} less a style of art or music than a loosely-knit group of artists from the midwest <b>with</b> <b>a</b> likeminded <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> the Gabba Gabba Hey {{sensibility}} that could be heard emanating from the club CBGB located just behind the M'bwebwe space on Second Avenue. M'bwebwe the geographical location existed from 1979 to 1982. Most of the original participants still reside in New York City. One {{of the founders of}} the group, Tom Little, a painter musician and master printmaker, died in 2006 due to natural causes.|$|R
50|$|Markovits loves {{all sports}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> clear {{preference}} for the team sports of basketball, baseball, football as well as soccer. He is a devoted Manchester United and a New York Yankees fan. He also enjoys all kinds of music <b>with</b> <b>a</b> special <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> Mozart, Beethoven, Dvořák and the Grateful Dead whom—in his youth and on rare occasions—he would follow on tour on both coasts of the United States.

He lives with his wife Kiki in Ann Arbor, Michigan.|$|R
5000|$|Wiley Quixote is Webb's {{literary}} creation. Wiley Quixote {{first appeared}} as {{author of the}} regular newspaper column, [...] "Ridin' Around Listenin' to the Radio..." [...] in pages of the Sandy New Era in Williamson, West Virginia shortly after the Tug River Valley flooded in April, 1977. Using self-deprecating humor, Webb created an environmentally-aware mountain character <b>with</b> sharp wit, <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> puns, and <b>a</b> determination to bring public attention to the adverse effects of strip-mining for coal.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} alleged that Nuvolari was {{involved}} in a race-fixing scandal at the Tripoli Grand Prix. The story is that he conspired with Achille Varzi and Baconin Borzacchini to fix the race in order to profit from the Libyan state lottery, in which 30 tickets were drawn before the race—one for each starter—and the holder of the ticket corresponding to the victorious driver won 7.5 million lire. Others say the allegation was unfounded and that it originated with Alfred Neubauer, the Mercedes-Benz team manager at the time, who was well known as a raconteur <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> spicing up a story. Neubauer's version does not altogether hold true with documented records of events, which indicate that Nuvolari, Varzi, and Borzacchini agreed to pool the prize money should one of them win.|$|E
25|$|An {{orthodox}} batsman <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> forcing strokes {{in front}} of square {{on both sides of}} the wicket he was regarded as a very sound player of fast bowling. His own bowling was a brisk fast medium, with a good off cutter his main weapon. While his commitments outside of cricket limited the number of games he played he was a key member of the very strong Yorkshire sides who won 6 county championships during his career (although this did include 1901 when Jackson did not appear in the county championship). His performances in 1896 and 1898 in particular showed what his statistics could have been if he had been able to dedicate more time, scoring over 1,000 championship runs at better than 40.00 in each season and taking over 100 wickets across the two seasons at an average of under 20.|$|E

5|$|Cyril, <b>an</b> eleven-year-old <b>with</b> <b>a</b> nasty <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> making trouble, {{comes to}} stay at the Place for three months. While there, he {{frequently}} lies, sneakily torments Lad, and plays such horrible pranks on the staff that two quit. After he is caught kicking Lad in plain sight, the Master loses his temper and scolds him. Cyril goes into a rage and runs away in a snowstorm. He gets lost and falls off a high cliff, landing on a small ledge. Lad finds him there, but has to jump down to the ledge to save the boy from a bobcat. Now trapped with the boy, Lad keeps him warm until a rescue party arrives.|$|R
5000|$|The first plan, {{devised by}} the {{gardener}} Petrie of Zweibrücken, introduced one highly unusual motive, namely {{the layout of}} the main parterre as a full circle. This remains unchanged and is a prominent feature that distinguishes Schwetzingen from most contemporary creations. Other than that, the first design was fairly conventional, even somewhat antiquated, in character.It appears to have relied heavily on French theorist Dezallier d'Argenville's influential textbook Théorie et practique du jardinage, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> the less revolutionary solutions Dezallier d'Argenville proposed; as a case in point, the design of the parterre's broderie ("embroidery") plantings, pretty though it is, looks rather timid when compared to some of d'Argenville's bolder suggestions.|$|R
2500|$|Charles Burnett (2001) postulates that Herman {{collaborated with}} Robert of Ketton and Hugo of Santalla on the Liber novem iudicum (the Book of Nine Judges), a {{collection}} of translations of Arabic astrologers, notably al-Kindi. Their project may have been to supplant the current superstitious Latin astrology with Arabic astronomical science. Arabic texts cite often Hermes as an authority. Burnett postulates that Renaissance magi merely continued this Hermetic tradition begun by Herman, Robert and Hugh. Herman shares technical terminology <b>with</b> Hugh and <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> <b>for</b> evocation of the Asclepius, most notably in De essentiis (see below) ...|$|R
