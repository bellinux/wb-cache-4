5|$|Karađorđe was feared by {{enemies and}} allies alike {{because of his}} {{volatile}} temper. In 1806, he had ordered that his brother Marinko be hanged. According to one account, Marinko {{had been accused of}} raping a peasant girl. Another suggests that he had been attempting to seduce young women whose husbands <b>were</b> <b>away</b> at the front. Whatever the case, Karađorđe entertained senior rebel leaders in his home while his brother's lifeless body dangled from the front gate—a warning to others to refrain from the behaviour in which Marinko had been engaging.|$|E
5|$|Moorish {{rule over}} Gibraltar {{came to an}} end in August 1462 when a small Castilian force under the command of Alonso de Arcos, the {{governor}} of Tarifa, launched a surprise attack. The Castilians mounted their attack while Gibraltar's senior commanders and townspeople <b>were</b> <b>away</b> paying homage to the new sultan of Granada. After a short assault which inflicted heavy losses on the defenders, the garrison surrendered to Enrique de Guzmán's son Juan Alonso, now the first Duke of Medina Sidonia. The Moorish inhabitants were once again expelled en masse, to be replaced by Christians.|$|E

5|$|Only {{two ships}} {{recorded}} tropical storm-force winds, {{both of which}} <b>were</b> <b>away</b> from the center. Some higher surf was recorded along the New Jersey coastline. In September 2001, two men sought to break the record for sailing the quickest time from New York City to Melbourne, Australia; Humberto disrupted their early path slightly, but they ultimately broke the record by 28 hours. Later in its path, there were several marine warnings issued for offshore Newfoundland, although no severe weather affected coastal Atlantic Canada. Overall, there were no reports of casualties or damage from the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{responded to}} the Tea Party with the Boston Port Act, one of the {{so-called}} Coercive Acts intended to strengthen British control of the colonies. Hutchinson was replaced as governor by General Thomas Gage, who arrived in May 1774. On June 17, the Massachusetts House elected five delegates to send to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which was being organized to coordinate colonial response to the Coercive Acts. Hancock did not serve in the first Congress, possibly for health reasons, or possibly to remain in charge while the other Patriot leaders <b>were</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5|$|Radyr Cricket Club {{was founded}} in 1890 by the Earl of Plymouth, who granted a hundred-year lease for the current {{riverside}} ground to the local residents for a nominal sum. The pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1973 while the team <b>were</b> <b>away</b> on tour. Under {{the leadership of the}} new Chairman Keith Terry, a huge fund-raising effort was made and a new pavilion opened on the footprint of the old one in 1975. Radyr currently plays in the first division of the South Wales Premier Cricket League.|$|E

5|$|The final {{fight of}} Johnson's early period, {{during which the}} stake money was {{relatively}} low, was his comprehensive win over a ponderous fighter called Fry for a prize of 50guineas at Kingston. The fight, which lasted less than 30minutes, ended with Fry badly beaten up and Johnson with barely a scratch on him. This fight did not attract many supporters of the sport; it took place on 6June 1786 and was therefore during the period when the wealthy <b>were</b> <b>away</b> from London.|$|E
5|$|There were 28-30 armed militia inside Apple River Fort at {{the time}} of the attack. Another 40 women, {{children}} and other settlers were resident in the Apple River Settlement.

A few of the militia company <b>were</b> <b>away</b> from the stockade and were not present for the battle.|$|E

5|$|Young Calhoun showed {{scholastic}} talent, {{and although}} schools were scarce on the Carolina frontier, he was enrolled briefly in an academy in Appling, Georgia, which soon closed. He continued his studies privately. When his father died, his brothers <b>were</b> <b>away</b> starting business careers {{and so the}} 14-year old Calhoun took over management of the family farm and five other farms. For four years he simultaneously kept up his reading and his hunting and fishing. The family decided he should continue his education, and so he resumed studies at the Academy after it reopened.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War Britain {{suffered}} severe {{shortages of}} raw materials. While consideration {{was given to}} reopening the closed mines, this was not deemed viable and instead the few remaining mines increased their production. As many male workers <b>were</b> <b>away</b> on military service, some women were briefly employed in tin-picking at Geevor, and in ore-dressing at the Great Rock iron mine on Dartmoor, {{during and after the}} war until around 1952. Other than a very limited number of female workers after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 ended the policy of recruiting only men for underground work in the few surviving mines, the Geevor pickers were the last female manual labourers in the Cornish mining industry.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, the Allies interned {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow. The fleet rendezvoused {{with the}} British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive fleet consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. That morning, the Grand Fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and while they <b>were</b> <b>away</b> Reuter issued the order to scuttle the High Seas Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Meetings {{could take}} place either inside or outside of the formal {{boundary}} of the city (the pomerium), though the official meeting place, or curia was at {{the centre of the}} Roman forum. The president of the Senate was normally one of the consuls, but it could be called to meet by any of the praetors or tribunes, both of whom had the authority to call the Senate, though praetors rarely did so unless the consuls <b>were</b> <b>away</b> and the tribunes almost never did so. Meetings were suffused in religious ritual. Temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be taken before the meeting could commence.|$|E

5|$|The FA Cup is English football's {{primary cup}} competition. It was first held in 1871–72 with only 15 teams entering; {{the growth of}} the sport and changes to the competition's {{structure}} meant that by 2000, more than 600 teams took part. Clubs in the Premier League enter the FA Cup in the third round and are drawn randomly out of a hat with the remaining clubs. If a match is drawn it is replayed, ordinarily at the ground of the team who <b>were</b> <b>away</b> for the first game. As with league fixtures, FA Cup matches are subject to change in the event of games being selected for television coverage and this often can be influenced by clashes with other competitions. In the case of Arsenal, all but one of their ties (fourth round) was televised to the British audience.|$|E
5|$|The chronicle {{records that}} in 1228, while Óláfr and his chiefs <b>were</b> <b>away</b> from Mann, {{the island was}} {{attacked}} and devastated by Alan, his brother Thomas, Earl of Atholl (d. 1231), and Rögnvaldr. It was only when Alan left with most of his force that Óláfr was able {{to regain control of}} the island. Rögnvaldr sailed from Galloway in the winter of the same year, landed on Mann, and burnt all the ships of Óláfr and his chiefs. The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr stayed at Ronaldsway for forty days; and that he won over the hearts of the southern inhabitants of the island. Óláfr and his forces arrived at Tynwald on 14 February 1229, where they attacked Rögnvaldr and his men. The chronicle claims that Rögnvaldr was treacherously killed by his own men, without the prior knowledge of Óláfr, and also notes that Óláfr never avenged his half-brother's death.|$|E
5|$|The club spent £1,400 {{appointing}} {{designers to}} oversee the excavation and levelling of the land, and moved a one-year-old stand from Carlisle Road to the highest {{part of the new}} ground. The original ground comprised the relocated stand, a 2,000-capacity stepped enclosure with the players' changing rooms beneath the stand, the playing area, a cinder athletics track and fencing to limit the total capacity to 18,000. The playing field was made of ballast, ashes, soil and sods. The ground was officially opened on 27 September 1886 for a game against Wakefield Trinity which was watched by a capacity crowd, but construction work meant most of Manningham's early games <b>were</b> <b>away</b> fixtures.|$|E
