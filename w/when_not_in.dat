5|$|A {{small wooden}} {{platform}} was built at Hellingly railway station, opposite {{the main line}} platform. This had no connection to the station buildings and was used only for the transfer of passengers between main-line and hospital trains, and kept chained off <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> use. Coal yards and sidings were also built at Hellingly station. The hospital opened to patients, and the railway to passengers, on 20 July 1903.|$|E
5|$|Another {{removable}} roadblocking {{system used}} mines. The extant remains of such systems superficially {{resemble those of}} hedgehog or hairpin, but the pits are shallow: just deep enough to take an anti-tank mine. <b>When</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> use, the sockets were filled with a wooden plug allowing traffic to pass normally.|$|E

5|$|As in all insects, {{the body}} {{is divided into three}} sections: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The thorax is {{composed}} of three segments, each with a pair of legs. In most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed, unlike those of moths which may be threadlike or feathery. The long proboscis can be coiled <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> use for sipping nectar from flowers.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy VII, {{the player}} directs the protagonist {{throughout}} the game {{world with a}} group of three interchangeable party members, exploring areas and interacting with non-player characters. Most of Final Fantasy VII occurs within the city of Midgar for the first act, later expanding to towns, dungeons, caves, and similar areas {{for the rest of the}} game. Players can save their game at any time <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> combat to the game's single save slot for later playing.|$|E

5|$|While some of {{the laws}} from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are {{applicable}} at the present time, others are dependent upon {{the existence of a}} predominantly Bahá'í society, such as the punishments for arson or murder. The laws, <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> direct conflict with the civil laws of the country of residence, are binding on every Bahá'í, and the observance of personal laws, such as prayer or fasting, is the sole responsibility of the individual.|$|E

5|$|Born in Liverpool, England, in 1873, Hines {{served in}} the Royal Navy and King's Liverpool Regiment, and worked in several occupations. He arrived in Australia shortly before World War I began and volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force in August 1915. Although {{discharged}} due to poor health in early 1916, he rejoined in August that year and served on the Western Front from March 1917 to mid-1918, when he was discharged again for health reasons. During his period in France he {{proved to be an}} aggressive soldier, and gained fame for the collection of items that he amassed, but was undisciplined <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> combat and frequently punished. Following World War I, Hines lived in poverty on the outskirts of Sydney until his death in 1958.|$|E

She trained with Teigan Van Roosmalen, a blind and deaf S13 swimmer. Cole also mentors young athletes. <b>When</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> high school Cole was undertaking ten or more swimming sessions a week but, while at school, she reduced her load. As of 2015, her coach is Nathan Doyle.|$|E
5|$|Cow Tower formed part of {{the city}} defences during the 15th century, with the Crown {{occasionally}} issuing instructions that it should be repaired. In 1450 St Giles Hospital formally transferred any rights they had to the tower and the immediately surrounding land to the city. The population of Norwich grew significantly from 1500 onwards and the city continued to maintain the urban defences; like other towers and gatehouses belonging to the city, however, by this period the Cow Tower was probably leased out to a merchant or craftsman <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> military use.|$|E
5|$|Evolve {{features}} {{a total of}} 20 different human characters split into four classes, each class containing 5 characters. Each class has different skills and abilities, and players are required to cooperate {{with each other in}} a match. Players unlock new characters as they progress through the game, e.g. the fourth Assault character will be unlocked if the player has upgraded the previous three Assault characters. The Hunters class features first-person gameplay. The ammunition of their weapons is automatically refilled <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> use, and iron sights are used in- game. Evolve does not allow multiple players to play as the same class in a match. Gameplay variations are also present within the characters in the same class.|$|E

5|$|In The Final Fantasy Legend, {{the player}} navigates a {{character}} throughout the game {{world with a}} party of up to four characters, exploring areas and interacting with non-player characters. Most of the game occurs in towns, castles, caves, and similar areas. To aid exploration on the field screen, the game makes use of various signs within towns. The player is initially limited to the World of Continent to explore, and given access to later worlds as his or her party climbs the Tower. Players can save their game anytime and anywhere <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> combat to a save slot for later play.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to coronations, the Imperial State Crown is usually worn at State Openings of Parliament, where the Sword of State and two maces are carried in procession. Fonts are used at royal christenings, and altar plate {{is used for}} weddings, Royal Maundy, {{and a few other}} occasions. Many pieces have fallen out of use altogether, like the trumpets and banqueting plate, and some were only designed to be used once. <b>When</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> use the Jewels are on public display, mainly in the Jewel House, a vault at the Tower of London where they are seen by around 2.5million visitors from across the world every year. Although {{they are part of the}} Royal Collection and owned by the king or queen for the duration of his or her reign, the Crown Jewels do not belong to the monarch personally.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{departed}} in November 1833 for Washington, D.C., {{where the}} Twenty-third United States Congress convened its regular session on December 2. Jackson's second term was under way, and the House {{had a strong}} Democratic majority, whose primary focus was to prevent the Second Bank of the United States from being rechartered. The Democrats, including Pierce, defeated proposals supported by the newly formed Whig Party, and the bank's charter expired. Pierce broke from his party on occasion, opposing Democratic bills to fund internal improvements with federal money. He saw both the bank and infrastructure spending as unconstitutional, with internal improvements {{the responsibility of the}} states. Pierce's first term was fairly uneventful from a legislative standpoint, and he was easily re-elected in March 1835. <b>When</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> Washington, he attended to his law practice, and in December 1835 returned to the capital for the Twenty-fourth Congress.|$|E

5|$|South of {{the church}} stands a cloister {{surrounded}} by ranges of buildings on three sides, the church forming the fourth. As is known, the cloister was {{the heart of the}} abbey, where the monks spent most of their time <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> church, engaged in study, copying books and the creation of illuminated manuscripts. The monks' desks were placed in the north walk of the cloister, and a cupboard for books in current use was carved into the external wall of the south transept.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic National Convention {{opened in}} San Francisco on June 28, 1920, under a shadow cast by Woodrow Wilson, {{who wished to}} be {{nominated}} for a third term. Delegates were convinced Wilson's health would not permit him to serve, and looked elsewhere for a candidate. Former Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo was a major contender, but he was Wilson's son-in-law, and refused to consider a nomination {{so long as the}} president wanted it. Many at the convention voted for McAdoo anyway, and a deadlock ensued with Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. On the 44thballot, the Democrats nominated Governor Cox for president, with his running mate Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. As Cox was, <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> politics, a newspaper owner and editor, this placed two Ohio editors against each other for the presidency, and some complained there was no real political choice. Both Cox and Harding were economic conservatives, and were reluctant progressives at best.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{the section}} behind the metathorax, {{made up of}} a series of rings, each with a hole for {{breathing}} and respiration, called a spiracle, composing three different segmented sclerites: the tergum, pleura, and the sternum. The tergum in almost all species is membranous, or usually soft and concealed by the wings and elytra <b>when</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> flight. The pleura are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single spiracle. The sternum is the most widely visible part of the abdomen, being a more or less sclerotized segment. The abdomen itself does not have any appendages, but some (for example, Mordellidae) have articulating sternal lobes.|$|E
