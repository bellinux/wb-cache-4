25|$|There {{was further}} {{controversy}} in July 2007 when Fincham {{was accused of}} misleading BBC One viewers. The incident involved a clip from forthcoming documentary A Year with the Queen which was shown to journalists during a press conference. It apparently showed the Queen storming out of a session with American photographer Annie Leibovitz over a disagreement about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> wear, but the BBC subsequently admitted that the scenes used in the trailer had been edited out of their correct order, meaning that a false impression was given. Fincham admitted the error, but rejected calls that he should resign from his position as a result. His future was deemed uncertain following critical comments from Sir Michael Lyons, Chairman of the BBC Trust and he resigned on 5 October 2007.|$|E
500|$|For instance, Plutarch recounts, in his Sayings of Spartan Women, {{upon his}} departure, Leonidas' wife Gorgo asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> {{do if he}} did not return, to which Leonidas replied, [...] "Marry a good man and have good children." ...|$|E
500|$|Sabrina did {{not refuse}} the proposal, so Day planned the wedding while she {{considered}} it further and eventually agreed. During the preparations, Day left Sabrina with {{friends for a}} few days, giving her strict instructions on <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> wear. When he returned to find her in an outfit that did not meet his requirements, he flew into a rage and Sabrina fled for a few hours, so Day called off the engagement. Sabrina {{was sent to a}} boarding house in Birmingham and given a stipend of £50 per annum (...) [...] Day resolved never to see her again.|$|E
60|$|Gudrun did {{not know}} what to say. <b>What</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> say? <b>What</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> feel? <b>What</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> do? <b>What</b> did they expect of her? She was coldly at a loss.|$|R

60|$|Then <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> say and <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> do? Rachel {{could think}} of no plan; she could only sit still and pray while the shadow of that awful hour crept ever nearer.|$|R
500|$|Donna's costume {{initially}} involved short skirts, tight-fitting tops, multi-coloured hair extensions and a nose-stud. Jacobs, who affected a Bristolian accent for the role, {{commented that}} Donna had [...] "no sense of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> keep covered up." [...] A size 12, Jacobs was not pressured {{to lose weight}} for the role, and considered Donna's figure [...] "part of her loveable charm". In early episodes, the character was seen to partake in recreational drug use and arrive for work hungover. Jacobs described her as [...] "everything that you secretly want to be, but can't get away with in normal society", calling her [...] "very gregarious" [...] and immune to maturing. The Guardian Grace Dent deemed her [...] "weak-willed" [...] in a 2006 feature on television medics, and in 2008, the Daily Mirror Jane Simon branded her unintelligent.|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{tries to}} {{convince}} Homer and Marge that college suits her, but {{they refuse to}} listen, saying that college {{is no place for}} her. Lisa is also ridiculed by Groundskeeper Willie and all of her friends at school, saying that she is too [...] "college for them". In the meantime, Bart gets used to his bubble, as it brings him a lot of popularity. Bart tells Lisa <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> do to get her friends back: she has to pull a prank on Principal Skinner. The next day, Chalmers is dedicating the Seymour Skinner parking annex. While Martin takes pictures of Skinner posing next to a giant chocolate cake in his dress polyester, Bart rolls Lisa (inside his bubble) {{to the edge of the}} school's roof. He then pushes her over the edge, splattering the cake all over Skinner. Lisa gets her friends back, while Bart goes paranoid after being outside of his bubble for the first time in days. He stays in an air vent, but gets sucked in.|$|E
500|$|In September 2016, a live-action {{version of}} Jasmine debuted as a {{recurring}} {{character in the}} sixth season of the fantasy television series Once Upon a Time, in which she is portrayed by actress Karen David. The character makes a brief first appearance in the season's fourth episode, [...] "Strange Case", before finally starring in the fifth, [...] "Street Rats", in which Jasmine enlists the help of Aladdin to locate a powerful item known capable of interrupting Jafar's control over the Sultan. As has become custom with Once Upon a Times plots, creative liberties were taken with the original film, including Jasmine taking Aladdin to the Cave of Wonders instead of Jafar {{and the absence of}} the pair developing romantic feelings for each other, although the iconic scene in which Jasmine is imprisoned in an hour glass is retained. Jasmine's blue outfit was slightly modified for the series. David had previously expressed interest in playing an ethnic Disney heroine such as Pocahontas, Esmeralda or Jasmine on Once Upon a Time, and was finally cast as the third in July 2016. The actress described preparing for the role as exciting yet [...] "nerve-wracking" [...] because [...] "she's such an iconic and beloved character and all the fans have their idealism of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> and shouldn't be," [...] longing to please fans.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{credits include}} Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter, {{and a regular}} at Abbey Road. [...] She had worked on pop {{material}} and numerous cover albums, and after hearing one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on Wright's composition [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky". [...] She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon, but arranged to come in on the following Sunday. [...] The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> do. [...] Gilmour {{was in charge of}} the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth, and wanted to apologise to the band – only to find them delighted with her performance. [...] Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track. [...] For her contribution she was paid £30, equivalent to about £ in , but in 2004 she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky" [...] was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. [...] The High Court agreed with her, but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. [...] All post-2005 pressings therefore credit Wright and Torry jointly for the song.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2015, Huang wrote a {{controversial}} advice {{article for the}} Science Careers website. A female postdoctoral scholar asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> do in response to her advisor looking down her shirt. Huang replied, [...] "I suggest you put up with it, with good humor if you can." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fincham was {{involved}} in a further controversy in July 2007, when introducing a press conference to publicise BBC One's forthcoming autumn season programming for later in the year. The season launch tape shown to journalists included a trailer from the documentary [...] It showed the Queen apparently storming out of a session with American photographer Annie Leibovitz over a disagreement about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> wear, but the BBC subsequently admitted that one of the shots used in the trailer had been edited out of order. Fincham admitted the error, and initially rejected calls that he should resign from his position as a result. However, the publication of the Wyatt Report on 5 October led to his resignation.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had only}} {{time to make}} these general {{observations}} when Madame Pelet, coming forward with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> intended <b>should</b> be a graceful and elastic step, thus accosted me: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They always know. Don't you {{remember}} Mrs. Williams's {{going to a}} Fifth Avenue milliner in a Worth dress, and the woman's asking her instantly <b>what</b> hotel <b>she</b> <b>should</b> send her hat to?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was angry}} at herself and him. Where had her {{careless}} society manner and well-bred composure gone? She felt weak and hysterical. <b>What</b> if <b>she</b> <b>should</b> burst into tears before the whole crowd--before those coldly critical grey eyes? She almost hated him.|$|R
2500|$|It is a {{hot summer}} day. Pelléas has led Mélisande {{to one of his}} {{favourite}} spots, the [...] "Blind Men's Well". People used to believe it possessed miraculous powers to cure blindness but since the old king's eyesight started to fail, they no longer come there. Mélisande lies down on the marble rim of the well and tries to see to the bottom. Her hair loosens and falls into the water. Pelléas notices how extraordinarily long it is. He remembers that Golaud first met Mélisande beside a spring and asks if he tried to kiss her at that time but she does not answer. Mélisande plays with the ring Golaud gave her, throwing it up into the air until it slips from her fingers into the well. Pelléas tells her not to be concerned but she is not reassured. He also notes that the clock was striking twelve as the ring dropped into the well. Mélisande asks him <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> tell Golaud. He replies, [...] "the truth." ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{decided on}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> confess, and on <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> conceal, Marceline {{knocked at the}} library door. Receiving no answer, she went in.|$|E
60|$|Joan started. She {{had been}} {{thinking}} about Phillips, wondering <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> say to him when they met.|$|E
6000|$|These {{were days}} of formless imaginings and ambitions. [...] "I will do! I will do!" [...] was her ceaseless cry to herself, but <b>what</b> could <b>she</b> do? <b>What</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> do? ...|$|R
60|$|The gondolier {{laughed and}} nodded his head, {{as if he}} would give his {{companion}} to understand that he was master of her secret wishes. Annina was hesitating in <b>what</b> manner <b>she</b> <b>should</b> make him change his purpose, when the gondola touched the felucca's side.|$|R

6000|$|... "You don't {{understand}} me, Lord Fawn. If {{any claim}} be really made for these jewels by Mr. John Eustace {{on the part}} of the heir, or on behalf of the estate, a statement had better be submitted to counsel. The family deeds must be inspected, and no doubt counsel would agree in telling my cousin, Lady Eustace, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should,</b> or <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not do. In the meantime, I understand that you are engaged to marry her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little goose girl, {{who kept}} a hundred fat geese in the field," [...] said Amy, when Sallie's {{invention}} gave out. [...] "The {{little girl was}} sorry for them, and asked an old woman <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> do to help them. 'Your geese will tell you, they know everything.' said the old woman. So she asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> use for new heads, since the old ones were lost, and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed..." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{woman looked}} a little confused, {{and she did not}} answer me, until she had taken time to reflect on <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> say.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me, then, John," [...] she said, {{when she}} had {{sufficiently}} considered <b>what</b> words <b>she</b> <b>should</b> speak; and as she spoke a bright colour suffused her face, and her eyes flashed almost with anger. [...] "What leap do you mean? Do you mean a leap upwards?" ...|$|R

60|$|On the deck, however, {{she came}} to a pause. The Flyaway was a good six feet from the dock, and between lay a stretch of dark, murky water the sight of which made her shiver. <b>What</b> if <b>she</b> <b>should</b> fall in? <b>She</b> felt that she would surely be drowned.|$|R
6000|$|But with sublime {{confidence}} in {{the man who had}} saved Pierre and who had given her explicit orders as to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> do, petite maman, backed by Rosette, reiterated quietly: ...|$|E

60|$|She bowed in reply, {{and took}} a seat beside the sofa. The Doctor gave her some {{directions}} as to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> do in case her father should become conscious before his return.|$|E
6000|$|Colouring {{with shame}} and displeasure, {{she sat down}} {{with a sort of}} 'I am ready' air, and took off her walking things, laying them down deliberately, and waiting in {{complete}} silence.

60|$|The {{wife was}} very much {{surprised}} at this goodness of her husband, not dreaming after <b>what</b> manner <b>she</b> <b>should</b> dress them; but, thinking that he had ordered her to go and put on their clothes, she went up, and was strangely astonished when she perceived her seven daughters killed, and weltering in their blood.|$|R
