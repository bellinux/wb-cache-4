5|$|Sonya gives Rodya a cross {{when he goes}} to turn {{himself in}} and symbolizes the burden Raskolnikov must bear. Sonya tells him they will bear the cross {{together}} and is taking part of his burden onto herself, encouraging him to confess. Sonya and Lizaveta had exchanged crosses, so originally the cross was Lizaveta's—whom Rodya didn't intend to kill, making it an important symbol of redemption. Sonya's face reminds him of Lizaveta's face, another example of his guilty conscience and symbolizes a shared grief. Self-sacrifice, along with poverty, is a larger theme of the novel. The desperation of poverty creates a situation where the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> is through self-sacrifice, which Raskolnikov consistently rejects, as part of his philosophical reasoning. For example, he rejects Razumikhin's offer of employment and the idea of his sister's arranged marriage. Raskolnikov originally rejects Sonya's offer to accompany him to the confession but, in a feverish state of mind, sees her following him through the market, and finds power in that idealism.|$|E

25|$|The Sound of Music is a 1965 American musical drama film {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Robert Wise, and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, with Richard Haydn and Eleanor Parker. The film is an adaptation of the 1959 Broadway musical of the same name, composed by Richard Rodgers with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. The film's screenplay was written by Ernest Lehman, adapted from the stage musical's book by Lindsay and Crouse. Based on the memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria von Trapp, the film is about a young Austrian woman studying to become a nun in Salzburg in 1938 who {{is sent to the}} villa of a retired naval officer and widower to be governess to his seven children.

25|$|The {{developers}} came to {{the conclusion}} that complex battles would only serve to confuse players. One play tester helped them by pointing out the quality of the fire pit puzzle, a puzzle that has the player-character riding on a moving platform that is descending into flames, requiring players to find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> He stated that it was both dramatic and exciting, but also a difficult puzzle. Wolpaw stated that this made no sense, commenting that it was one of the easiest puzzles in the game. He added that the battle was a dramatic high-point, since it was being the first time GLaDOS directly tries to kill the player-character and the first time that players have to use the environment to their advantage. After learning about what fellow Valve developers had planned for the final boss battle in Half-Life 2: Episode Two, the Portal developers decided to implement a neurotoxin that would kill the player-character in six minutes. This made it easier on the writers, who only had to write six minutes of dialogue. As a result, they scaled the game back, intending to ensure that everyone was able to see the game to the very end.|$|E

500|$|This {{relatively}} {{early release}} was perceived {{by many to}} {{have been due to}} collaboration with his Soviet captors, something for which his fellow pilots criticized him, especially following a 1950s book by fighter ace and fellow Soviet POW, Hans Hahn, entitled [...] "I Speak the Truth" [...] (...) [...] This led to Graf's exclusion from post-war Luftwaffe veterans' associations. In 1971 Graf made his own statement to the newspaper, [...] "Bild am Sonntag", saying that he, along with others including Hartmann, had briefly joined the BDO (an anti-Nazi group of German ex-officer prisoners) as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> the psychological deprivation of the imprisonment.

2500|$|Additionally, the Northeast United States was {{saturated}} with railroads. The New York Central and the Pennsylvania were the largest railroads in the region, but competition also existed from other lines like the Erie-Lackawanna (itself a merged company from the Erie Railroad and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western), the Lehigh Valley Railroad, Reading Railroad, Delaware & Hudson, Baltimore & Ohio, Jersey Central, and Lehigh & Hudson River. All of the Northeast railroads were {{suffering from the}} changing economics of the times, the decline of manufacturing, {{the opening of the}} Saint Lawrence Seaway, and particularly damaging was the sharp drop in demand for anthracite coal that was by and large the reason many of the northeast railroads were initially created. All of this competition brought massive redundancy to an industry that needed efficiency. Management {{came to the conclusion that}} the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> was to merge with one or more complementary railroads. In theory, a merger would combine the best of each system, while elimination of redundant track, staff, and reduced taxes, would save tens of millions of dollars. Railroad mergers were happening nationwide, and the idea of merger had come to the New York Central in the late 1950s. By 1955, the New York Central was all but bankrupt. The Pennsylvania Railroad, the so-called Standard Railroad of the World, hadn't turned a profit since 1946. Both railroads had approached each other about merging, and held a series of discussions on the idea in the 1950s. The talks went nowhere.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the flawed}} {{research}} that has been conducted in the past, many stereotypes have followed ACOAs. ACOAs {{have been identified as}} having a variety of emotional and behavioral problems, such as sleep problems, aggression and lowered self-esteem. [...] When it comes to being a COA or ACOA, there is still hope. Results showed that a supportive and loving relationship with one of the parents can counterbalance the possible negative effects of the relationship with the alcoholic parent. When there is one alcoholic parent in the household, it helps if the child relies on other family members for support. It may be the second parent, siblings or members of the extended family. Having other supportive family members can help the child feel like s/he is not alone. Younger generations of ACOAs scored more positively, in terms of coping mechanisms. This may be due to fact that alcoholism is seen more as an illness nowadays, rather than a moral defect. There has been less victim blaming of alcoholism on parent’s, because it has now been declared a disease rather than a behavioral problem. Studies show that when ACOAs use positive coping mechanisms, it is related to more positive results. When an ACOA approaches their issues, rather than avoids them, it often relates to having a positive outlook. Studies have shown that ACOAs and COAs have more compulsive behaviors that may cause the need for higher achievement. Some ACOAs have shown that the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> is to fend for themselves. This causes a sense of independence that helps them become more self-reliant. Because they perceive that independence and hard work as necessary, ACOAs develop a sense of survival instinct.|$|E

60|$|The race {{seems in}} a fair <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> From fifteen islands, whose rolls I had {{occasion}} to consult, I found a proportion of 59 births to 47 deaths for 1887. Dropping three out of the fifteen, there remained for the other twelve the comfortable ratio of 50 births to 32 deaths. Long habits of hardship and activity doubtless explain the contrast with Marquesan figures. But the Paumotuan displays, besides, a certain concern for health and the rudiments of a sanitary discipline. Public talk with these free- spoken people plays {{the part of the}} Contagious Diseases Act; in- comers to fresh islands anxiously inquire if all be well; and syphilis, when contracted, is successfully treated with indigenous herbs. Like their neighbours of Tahiti, from whom they have perhaps imbibed the error, they regard leprosy with comparative indifference, elephantiasis with disproportionate fear. But, unlike indeed to the Tahitian, their alarm puts on the guise of self-defence. Any one stricken with this painful and ugly malady is confined to the ends of villages, denied the use of paths and highways, and condemned to transport himself between his house and coco-patch by water only, his very footprint being held infectious. Fe'efe'e, being a creature of marshes and the sequel of malarial fever, is not original in atolls. On the single isle of Makatea, where the lagoon is now a marsh, the disease has made a home. Many suffer; they are excluded (if Mr. Wilmot be right) from much of the comfort of society; and it is believed they take a secret vengeance. The defections of the sick are considered highly poisonous. Early in the morning, it is narrated, aged and malicious persons creep into the sleeping village, and stealthily make water at the doors of the houses of young men. Thus they propagate disease; thus they breathe on and obliterate comeliness and health, the objects of their envy. Whether horrid fact or more abominable legend, it equally depicts that something bitter and energetic which distinguishes Paumotuan man.|$|E
