500|$|Professor David Nutt, former {{chair of}} the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in the UK has said, [...] "people are better off taking ecstasy or amphetamines than those [...] we know nothing about" [...] and [...] "Who knows what's in [...] when you buy it? We don't have a testing system. It could be very dangerous, we just don't know. These {{chemicals}} have never been put into animals, let alone humans." [...] Les King, {{a former member of}} the ACMD, has stated mephedrone appears to be less potent than amphetamine and ecstasy, but that any benefit associated with this could be negated by users taking larger amounts. He also told the BBC, [...] "all we can say is [...] is probably as harmful as ecstasy and amphetamines and <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> have some better scientific evidence to support that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dixon {{had worked}} with Brian Higgins, of Xenomania, on her {{previous}} single, [...] "Knockdown", but it failed to enter the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, resulting in Dixon being dropped by her record label, Polydor Records. In early 2007, still with no recording contract, Dixon {{received a phone call}} from Higgins, who asked if she would like to continue working together. Dixon stated, [...] "The plan was to make the whole record with Brian without talking to any record labels, we were just going to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> had made something special and then approach people with a finished album." [...] However Dixon's profile was raised when she signed up to compete in Strictly Come Dancing, which she eventually won. Soon afterwards, Dixon signed a deal with Asylum Records. [...] "The Boy Does Nothing", by this time already written, was originally intended to be a jazz orientated track, but Dixon and Higgins decided to change the genre, incorporating mambo influences, due to her experience on Strictly Come Dancing. Dixon described the song as [...] "a very tongue-in-cheek record" [...] and Higgins likened the song to [...] "bottled happiness".|$|E
6000|$|... "They haven't any here. You'll have to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> {{get to the}} junction," [...] Flett told him, {{and drew}} Edgar back into the vestibule.|$|E
60|$|There is no {{good reason}} why I should not set down now the facts instead of <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> came to learn of them later.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did the Leopards {{make their}} first move now, when we could, if we wished it, retreat, instead of <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> had {{penetrated}} farther into their country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy," [...] Stanley {{said with}} a smile, [...] "if he <b>waits</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> are turned out from Rangoon, his stay at Ramoo {{will be a long}} one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> get to Norway--there {{is where}} you'll find it cold," [...] was Dave's reply. [...] "Maybe we'll {{have to invest}} in fur overcoats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> {{have seen}} him," [...] was Peter's judicious view. [...] "I {{should be so}} glad {{to think that the}} dear lady was happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Leo soothingly {{laid her}} hand on her arm. [...] "Let us not think about that just now. Let us <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> are safely out of this dreadful place." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{she only}} <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> were again {{swimming}} side by side, and I {{saw that she}} had drawn her long knife, and was holding it between her teeth.|$|R
60|$|I acquiesced, and {{got into}} a cab with my cousin. I was {{perfectly}} {{aware that he was}} almost consumed with curiosity. He scarcely <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> were off before he began.|$|R
6000|$|That night, after supper, Margery remarked: [...] "Our two guides are American citizens, and I don't see {{why they}} can't eat {{at the table with}} us instead of <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> have finished. We are all free and equal in the woods." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Say, Nat, don’t make {{a public}} {{exhibition}} of yourself,” he said, {{in a low}} tone. “If you’ve got anything against Dave, why don’t you <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> are alone?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And we {{have often}} done no better since, Paolo, {{when we have}} been on the march. Will you start on it now, or <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> get to a stream?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will soon}} destroy that which cost so much labour to put up!" [...] Hardy Baker shouted. [...] "He {{has only to}} <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> are obliged to go away." ...|$|E
5000|$|Florida state Senator Evelyn Lynn, {{who was on}} the {{committee}} to study the salvia bill, said salvia should be criminalized. [...] "I'd rather be at the front edge of preventing the dangers of the drug than <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> are the 40th or more," [...] she said.|$|R
2500|$|The biogeochemist William Schlesinger [...] thinks <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> near some {{suggested}} {{limit for}} nitrogen deposition and other pollutions will just {{permit us to}} continue {{to a point where}} it is too late. He says the boundary suggested for phosphorus is not sustainable, and would exhaust the known phosphorus reserves in less than 200 years.|$|R
2500|$|The biogeochemist William Schlesinger queries whether {{thresholds}} are a {{good idea}} for pollutions at all. He thinks <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> near some suggested limit will just permit us to continue to a point where it is too late. [...] "Management based on thresholds, although attractive in its simplicity, allows pernicious, slow and diffuse degradation to persist nearly indefinitely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon not, lad. We must <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> {{see what}} sort of place Harry is in, {{and how we can}} best help him, before we fix on any scheme." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{drop out}} here I may be frozen to death before I can free myself," [...] he thought. [...] "I will <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> pass {{a house of}} some sort." ...|$|E
6000|$|To Jennie, Curtis said: [...] "I haven't {{the heart}} to push them into doing a useless thing. They are right. I must <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> have {{the water of the}} streams for our own use." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the south}} the Dnieper runs its course through the wealthiest {{industrial}} lands; {{and it is}} wasting the prodigious weight of its pressure, playing over age-old rapids and <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> harness its stream, curb it with dams, and compel it to give lights to cities, to drive factories, and to enrich ploughland. We shall compel it! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Is it {{not enough}} that you have {{opportunity}} to work your will even here {{in the midst of}} the enemy's encampment, but that you must raise your voice to give notice of what you would do? It matters little whether Saul knows it is us who are here, or that he <b>waits</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> have effected an entrance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, I did {{not mention}} the place. I thought it was as well to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> got another letter. Of course she knew from those {{affidavits}} that the man and woman had gone down there.' ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{retelling of}} it, I have left {{out most of}} the history. What {{interested}} me was the unique character about whom the tale revolves--the visored horseman who--but let us <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> get to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll make 'em stay ashore if we can," [...] said Loggermore. [...] "Just <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> {{are ready}} to sail. I {{am not going to}} trust myself with fellows like that to bring me bad luck." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{afternoon}} was very sad and dreary. Lady Fawn had {{an interview with}} Lady Eustace, but Lizzie altogether refused to listen to any advice {{on the subject of}} the necklace. [...] "It is an affair," [...] she said haughtily, [...] "in which I must judge for myself,--or with the advice of my own particular friends. Had Lord Fawn <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> were married; then indeed--!" ...|$|R
60|$|North-east of our train, {{not more}} than four hundred yards from it, we {{discovered}} a large camp of whites behind a low rise of ground. And beyond we could see fifty or sixty saddle-horses grazing. And {{a mile or so}} away, to the north, we saw a tiny cloud of dust approaching. Jed and I <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> saw a single man, riding fast, gallop into the camp of the whites.|$|R
6000|$|The light {{died from}} his eyes and his fingers relaxed their grasp on hers. [...] "Please forgive me," [...] he murmured. [...] "I {{intended}} <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> got {{out of this mess}} and you were safe among your own people. It must have been the shock or something like that, and seeing you defending me as you did. Anyway, I couldn't help it and really it doesn't make much difference what I say now, does it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't {{hesitate}} on that ground, since we're two men short," [...] Scott answered, smiling. [...] "Well, {{suppose we}} <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> {{have talked to}} him. I guess you know this silver-lode is getting hold of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing; at least, nothing now. Of {{ourselves}} {{we cannot}} {{hope to find}} him; but must <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> have speech with Morgan. He is the one of all others in this town of York who can help us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no! Stanislas. That gun {{would be}} heard twice {{as far as}} one of these pistols. Let us <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> are pretty {{sure that they are}} near. I don't like leaving {{ourselves}} without other protection than our axes." ...|$|E
60|$|As my {{drinking}} grew heavier, I {{began to}} note {{more and more}} {{that it was in}} the drinking bouts the purple passages occurred. Drunks were always memorable. At such times things happened. Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk. The longshoremen all looked forward to their Saturday night drunk. We of the oyster boats <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> had disposed of our cargoes before we got really started, though a scattering of drinks and a meeting of a chance friend sometimes precipitated an accidental drunk.|$|R
60|$|Unhappily we made {{a stupid}} mistake at this time. Instead of <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> were near enough to be recognised, we shouted to our friends the moment we saw their canoe. I cannot say that we knew them to be our friends, but we {{had every reason to}} suppose so. The result of our shout was that they {{supposed}} us to be enemies, and paddled away as if for their lives. It was in vain that we tried to show by signs that we were not enemies.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{the horse}} down that road," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>wait</b> there <b>until</b> <b>we</b> return. We {{may be some}} time. If we are not back {{by the time the}} sun sets, you will return home." ...|$|R
