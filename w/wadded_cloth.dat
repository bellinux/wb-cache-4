40|$|Etching of {{the statue}} of Abraham Lincoln located inside the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D. C. Waite was born in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1887 and {{traveled}} to France in her youth. After returning, she made etchings using the French technique à la poupée [...] literally working with a puppet. This "puppet" is actually a small <b>wad</b> of <b>cloth</b> on a stick used to apply inks to a plate much like a brush, only with smoother results...|$|R
60|$|Behind {{the guns}} {{a number of}} artillerymen were, as the boys could hear, sitting and talking; but the guns {{themselves}} stood alone and unguarded. A clasp of the hand, and the boys parted, one going, as previously arranged, each way. Ned rose very quietly {{by the side of}} the gun, keeping his head, however, below its level, and running his hand along it until it came to the breech. The touch-hole was covered by a <b>wad</b> of <b>cloth</b> to keep the powder dry from the heavy dew. This he removed, put up his hand again with the wet sponge, gave a squeeze, and then cautiously replaced the covering.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of two {{children}} {{standing next to a}} totem of giant pumpkins at the Mayo Ranch in Compton, 1903. The children are arranged to compare to the height of the pumpkins, on standing on the ground and the other on a stump behind him. The lower child wears overalls, a spotted longsleeved shirt and the number six. The child above him wears similar clothes and the number four, holding the top of the second pumpkin which has been stacked on one below it. A <b>wad</b> of <b>cloth</b> has been placed between the two squashes. More pumkins are visible in the field behind them. The two giants are to be sent to the County Fair...|$|R
5000|$|To {{load the}} piece, the first {{left-hand}} gunner would introduce a cartridge into the barrel; the first right-hand gunner would ram {{it to the}} bottom of the barrel; the first left-hand gunner would introduce the shot and a <b>cloth</b> <b>wad,</b> which would be rammed by the right-hand gunner. Then the crew would bring the gun to bear by pulling ropes. The chief gunner would then pin the cartridge through the touch hole and pour priming powder.|$|R
2500|$|In the 20th century, the {{disposable}} diaper was conceived. In the 1930s, Robinsons of Chesterfield {{had what}} were labeled [...] "Destroyable Babies Napkins" [...] listed in their catalogue for the wholesale market. In 1944, Hugo Drangel of the Swedish paper company Pauliström suggested a conceptual design which would entail the placing of {{sheets of paper}} tissue (cellulose <b>wadding)</b> inside the <b>cloth</b> diaper and rubber pants. However, cellulose wadding was rough against the skin and crumbled into balls when exposed to moisture.|$|R
5000|$|French {{polishing}} is a wood finishing {{technique that}} results in a very high gloss surface, with a deep colour and chatoyancy. French polishing consists of applying many thin coats of shellac dissolved in denatured alcohol using a rubbing pad lubricated with one {{of a variety of}} oils (see below). The rubbing pad is made of absorbent cotton or wool <b>cloth</b> <b>wadding</b> inside of a piece of fabric (usually soft cotton cloth) and is commonly referred to as a fad, also called a rubber, tampon, or [...] (Spanish for [...] "rag doll").|$|R
50|$|New {{thatched}} roofs {{were forbidden}} in London in 1212 following a major fire, and existing roofs {{had to have}} their surfaces plastered {{to reduce the risk}} of fire. The Great Fire of London in 1666 had nothing to do with thatch. The modern Globe Theatre is one of the few thatched buildings in London (others can be found in the suburb of Kingsbury), but the Globe's modern, water reed thatch is purely for decorative purpose and actually lies over a fully waterproofed roof built with modern materials. The Globe Theatre, opened in 1997, was modelled on the Rose, which was destroyed by a fire on a dry June night in 1613 when a burning <b>wad</b> of <b>cloth</b> ejected from a special effects cannon during a performance set light to the surface of the thatch. The original Rose theatre was actually thatched with cereal straw, a sample of which was recovered by Museum of London archaeologists during the excavation of the site in the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|A {{piece of}} matte board, a plastic [...] "card", or a <b>wad</b> of <b>cloth</b> {{is often used}} to push the ink into the incised lines. The surface is wiped clean with a piece of stiff fabric known as {{tarlatan}} and then wiped with newsprint paper; some printmakers prefer to use the blade part of their hand or palm at the base of their thumb. The wiping leaves ink in the incisions. You may also use a folded piece of organza silk to do the final wipe. If copper or zinc plates are used, then the plate surface is left very clean and therefore white in the print. If steel plate is used, then the plate's natural tooth gives the print a grey background similar to the effects of aquatinting. As a result, steel plates do not need aquatinting as gradual exposure of the plate via successive dips into acid will produce the same result.|$|R
50|$|A typical firing {{procedure}} follows. A wet swab {{was used}} to mop out {{the interior of the}} barrel, extinguishing any embers from a previous firing which might set off the next charge of gunpowder prematurely. Gunpowder was placed in the barrel, either loose or in a cloth or parchment cartridge pierced by a metal 'pricker' through the touch hole, and followed by a <b>cloth</b> <b>wad</b> (typically made from canvas and old rope), then rammed home with a rammer. Next the shot was rammed in, followed by another wad to prevent the cannonball from rolling out of the barrel if the muzzle was depressed. The gun in its carriage was then 'run out'; men heaved on the gun tackles until the front of the gun carriage was hard up against the ship's bulwark, the barrel protruding out of the gun port. This took the majority of the gun crew manpower, as the weight of a large cannon in its carriage could total over two tons, and the ship would probably be rolling.|$|R
