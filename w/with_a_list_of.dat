5|$|Chapter 3 is short, {{and opens}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> eight asanas (postures), {{followed}} by the description of each one. The asanas are of two types: one set is for meditative contemplation, {{and the other for}} cleansing the body. Both are said to be important in the journey of yoga. Different asanas focus on different organ groups. Of the eight asanas, the text discusses two variations each for the Swastikasana and the Mukta Sirsasana in verses 3.3–5 and 3.13–14 respectively, with claims that each asana helps cleanse the body when these are practiced with Yamas and Niyamas.|$|E

5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists of words that young children {{should be able to}} read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa {{go fishing}} {{downstream}} of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and Springfield Shopper reporter Dave Shutton pulls {{up just as}} Bart catches a three-eyed fish, much to both the kids' and Shutton's surprise. The fish, nicknamed Blinky by the media, makes headlines around the state, and incumbent governor Mary Bailey calls in a government inspection team to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could have caused the fish to mutate. After the inspection, the plant's owner, Mr. Burns, is presented <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> 342 violations, which would cost $56 million to rectify. Distraught, Mr. Burns talks to plant employee Homer, who half-heartedly suggests Mr. Burns run for governor against Bailey {{so that he could}} change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down. Mr. Burns instantly pounces on the idea.|$|E

5|$|Choice is a {{significant}} aspect of the game, requiring a non-linear design to accommodate the customized characters. Level design began <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> factors such as Disciplines, stealth and feats. Each area had to be viable for a shooting character (sufficient ammunition), a discipline-focused character (sufficient blood sources to keep the powers fueled) and a melee specialist (to reach enemies without being killed), with stealth options and option combinations. Level design began {{with a focus on}} stealth, taking into consideration the positioning of guards and the character's potential stealth capability at that point in the game. Then direct, combat-heavy and dialog paths were added. The amusement arcade area was to feature playable versions of Activision arcade games such as Pitfall!, though the idea was abandoned due to time constraints.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 Stalin {{dispatched}} Mikoyan, {{along with}} Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> 300 names to Yerevan, {{the capital of}} the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), to oversee the liquidation of the Communist Party of Armenia (CPA), which was largely made up of Old Bolsheviks. Mikoyan tried, but failed, to save one from being executed during his trip to Armenia. That person was arrested during one of his speeches to the CPA by Beria. Over a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office. In several instances, he intervened on behalf of his colleagues; this leniency towards the persecuted may have been one reason why he was selected by Stalin to oversee the purges in the ASSR.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} {{can travel}} between {{a variety of}} locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which, when selected, will present the player <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> available destinations. The DeSoto is also used for several driving sequences, usually involving pursuing or fleeing criminals in other vehicles. In these driving sequences, the player can use Sam's gun, the car's horn, or have Max attempt to communicate with other vehicles via a megaphone. In addition, special inventory items {{may be used to}} complete specific puzzles within these sequences. Driving sequences are also used for several minigames, such as pulling innocent drivers over for fabricated felonies. In keeping with the developer's heritage from the LucasArts adventure games, Sam & Max Save the World is designed so that the player characters cannot die or reach a complete dead-end.|$|E
5|$|The duo wrote three songs while touring {{in support}} of their debut album Felt Mountain, but decided to take their work in a {{different}} direction with more rhythmic music. Goldfrapp chose to record in a studio in a Bohemian area of Bath, England, because they needed a place to put their equipment and start working. The band began working on the album in January 2002 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> songs they wanted to try to record, such as a disco song with only string instruments. The studio's walls were covered in neon lights and Alison Goldfrapp used them to write down her song ideas. They recorded early demos and worked on pre-production using a Yamaha 02R digital mixing console. Goldfrapp held jam sessions with Mark Linkous and Adrian Utley and, after they built momentum writing the album, decided not to move to another studio.|$|E

5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{similarities}} between Ernő and Auric: both were Jewish immigrants {{who came to}} Britain from Eastern Europe in the 1930s and both were Marxists, although they were physically very different. The likely model for Goldfinger was American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard, Jr., who Fleming had met in 1949. Englehard had established a company, the Precious Metals Development Company, which circumvented numerous export restrictions, selling gold ingots directly into Hong Kong. Fleming had reinforced his knowledge of gold by sending a questionnaire to an expert at the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, one of the Livery Companies of the City of London <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> queries about gold, its properties and {{the background of the}} industry, including smuggling. Fleming himself liked gold enough to commission a gold-plated typewriter from the Royal Typewriter Company, although he never actually used it. In 1995, this machine was purchased by the Bond actor, Pierce Brosnan.|$|E
5|$|With {{few options}} available, the Sounds signed a PDC with the Chicago White Sox {{who wanted to}} move their Triple-A farm club closer to home than their {{previous}} location in Vancouver. The White Sox presented Schmittou <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> complaints about the relatively poor condition of Greer Stadium. Schmittou was unable to convince mayor Phil Bredesen or the Metro Council to pay for new stadium to replace Greer. He considered moving the team to a surrounding county, and explored sites in La Vergne, Cool Springs, and Mount Juliet. He even tried, unsuccessfully, to get the Metro Council to pass a referendum to let taxpayers vote on a temporary tax increase to pay off a proposed $40million stadium in three years. In the end, Schmittou elected to keep the Sounds at Greer but make significant improvements to the stadium. One of those improvements was the addition of Greer's signature guitar-shaped scoreboard, which was installed in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Writer Howard Weinstein {{had been}} a fan of space {{exploration}} following the flight of NASA astronaut Alan Shepard on Mercury-Redstone 3. He recalled that his first experience of Star Trek was in middle school, where he mixed elements of the show up with Lost in Space. He began watching the show and was inspired to write for television after reading The Making of Star Trek by Gene Roddenberry and Stephen E. Whitfield. While in the 11th grade, he had a Star Trek short story published in the fanzine Probe, which was a yearly publication in East Meadow High School. Weinstein also wrote a script for , but the script was turned down as it was not submitted via an agent. It was returned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> suggested agents, and his father recognised Bill Cooper's name on the list from their school years together.|$|E
5|$|From mid 2006, Takahashi {{was working}} on a {{separate}} project; struck by an idea of rival civilizations emerging on the frozen bodies of two warring gods, he and Honne constructed a model of the two gods to better visualize the idea. After bringing their idea to Nintendo producer Satoshi Yamagami, the team began development in 2007. Takahashi later stated that the game's development acted as a means of boosting company morale after the failure of the Xenosaga series. The director, Koh Kojima, started his directorial debut with this game, he had previously written the scenario for Baten Kaitos Origins. This game also saw a shift away from the narrative-heavy approach of Monolith Soft's earlier work, which Takahashi stated had been called out as old-fashioned. In contrast to many earlier Monolith Soft projects, the game was designed with an international release in mind. The intended scale of the game caused problems, and Takahashi reluctantly went to Yamagami <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> proposals to cut down the game to a suitable size as he was accustomed to doing this from previous projects. Yamagami rejected all of Takahashi's suggestions, and instead, persuaded Nintendo to keep supporting the project allowing Takahashi {{and the rest of the}} team to complete their work as envisioned. Originally titled Monado: Beginning of the World, Iwata had the title changed to honor Takahashi's previous work on Xenogears and the Xenosaga franchise. The new title was Xenoblade Chronicles.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, Hernández Morales led a {{group of}} six pirates in the robbery of Cabot, Bailey & Company in Saint Thomas, making off with US$5,000. On October 26 the USS Beagle, {{commanded}} by Charles T. Platt, navigated by John Low and carrying shopkeeper George Bedford (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> plundered goods, which were reportedly near Naguabo) left Saint Thomas. Platt sailed to Vieques, following a tip about a pirate sloop. Beagle opened fire, interrupting the capture of a sloop from Saint Croix, but the pirates docked at Punta Arenas in Vieques and fled inland; one, identified as Juan Felis, was captured after a shootout. When Platt disembarked in Fajardo to contact Juan Campos, a local associate of Bedford, the authorities accused him of piracy and detained him. The officer was later freed, but the pirates escaped. Commodore Porter's reaction to what was later known as the Fajardo Affair led to a diplomatic crisis which threatened war between Spain and the United States; Campos was later found {{to be involved in}} the distribution of loot.|$|E
