However, the story takes on an unusual and very {{important}} twist. Soon {{after the start of}} his journey, the Smithy Gang invades the world. While attempting to stop the group, Mario is joined by Mallow, a cloud boy <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> is a tadpole; Geno, a doll possessed by a celestial spirit from the Star Road; Bowser, whose armies have deserted him out of fear of the Smithy Gang; and Princess Toadstool, who was lost in the turmoil that occurred when the Smithy Gang arrived. The Smithy Gang is led by Smithy, a robotic blacksmith from an alternate dimension with aspirations of world domination.|$|E
5|$|In a {{world where}} toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when humans are present, a group of toys, owned by six-year-old Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy's {{birthday}} party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother, and infant sister Molly, are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, a pull-string cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody, organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Slinky Dog, into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge, spy on the party, and report the results to the others via baby monitors.

500|$|... "t's not {{forcing the}} issue {{to suggest that the}} Holocaust hovers over Barton Fink", writes biographer Ronald Bergan. Others see a more {{specific}} message in the film, particularly Barton's obliviousness to Charlie's homicidal tendencies. Critic Roger Ebert wrote in his 1991 review that the Coens intended to create an allegory for the rise of Nazism. [...] "They paint Fink as an ineffectual and impotent left-wing intellectual, who sells out while telling himself he is doing the right thing, <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> understands the 'common man' but does not understand that, for many common men, fascism had a seductive appeal". However, he goes on to say: [...] "It {{would be a mistake to}} insist too much on this aspect of the movie...." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2000 interview, William Asher {{described}} Temperatures Rising {{as being}} about: [...] "a young black surgeon {{who was always}} into mischief and things, {{but he was a}} very competent surgeon. James Whitmore was the head surgeon and he used to drive Whitmore crazy". The pilot episode of Temperatures Rising was written by Sheldon Keller, who turned to his This is a Hospital? script for inspiration. It features Noland broadcasting a bingo game in code over the hospital's public-address system. Jack Albertson guest starred as a United States Senator. Subsequent episodes feature Noland performing a secret operation on a young baseball player while Campanelli deals with a hospital inspector (Ed Platt), and John Astin as a gangster wanting Noland to be his personal physician. In another episode, Noland hypnotizes a patient (Alice Ghostley) and, accidentally, Nurse Turner as well. This nearly costs the hospital a large donation from a potential benefactor (Charles Lane). In later episodes, Campanelli is seen having a brief romance with Nurse Turner's aunt (Beverly Garland), Noland helps out a new intern (Bernie Kopell) who has a reputation for being a jinx, and also performs a witchcraft ritual on a patient (Alan Oppenheimer) <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> has been cursed.|$|E
500|$|Adam Baldwin as Jayne Cobb– a mercenary. He and Mal {{met when}} they were on {{opposite}} sides of a dispute; Mal, while held at gunpoint, offered Jayne his own bunk and a higher cut than his current employer, so Jayne switched sides and shot his then-partners. In the original pilot, [...] "Serenity", he intimates to Mal that he did not betray him because [...] "The money wasn't good enough." [...] However, previously he had pointedly asked the Alliance agent whether he would be required to turn on the captain to help him, and in [...] "Ariel" [...] defends his actions in alerting the authorities regarding Simon and River by claiming he had not intended to betray Mal. He is someone who can be depended on in a fight. He tends to act like a [...] "lummox" [...] <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> is the smartest person in space, but occasional hints of intelligence peek through this façade, giving the impression that he acts dumber than he is. As Whedon states several times, Jayne is the man who will ask the questions that no one else wants to. Even though he is a macho character, he has shown a particularly intense fear of Reavers, more so {{than the rest of the}} crew. Despite his amoral mercenary persona, he sends a significant portion of his income to his mother, again suggesting that there is more to his character than what he presents to the rest of the crew.|$|E
500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] he said. As for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there was nothing to do except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E
5000|$|Je t'aime John Wayne (2000) is a ten-minute {{short film}} parody {{directed}} by Toby MacDonald {{about a young}} man in London obsessed with imitating Jean-Paul Belmondo in the film Breathless, who in turn was pretending to be Humphrey Bogart. One of the film's writers, Luke Ponte, describes it as, [...] "an Englishman <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he's</b> a French man <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he's</b> an American." [...] It was distributed on DVD as part of the collection Cinema 16: British Short Films and in the U.S. as Cinema 16: European Short Films.|$|R

2500|$|His {{first film}} as a {{director}} was Murder Without Crime (1950), made at ABPC, who put Thompson under contract. 'The film was about a man <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> has committed murder; Thompson also wrote the screenplay, based on his own play, Double Error. In the words of Thompson's Screenonline profile [...] "this well structured film went largely unnoticed but contained many of the themes which were to characterise Lee Thompson's work: a good person's struggle with their conscience, an external force of evil, and an out-of-character moment of violence which has long-term consequences. Believing people can [...] "commit crimes without being criminals", he sought to make his audiences condone or at least understand behaviour that they would normally condemn." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carpenter {{envisioned the}} film as an inverse of {{traditional}} scenarios in action films with a Caucasian protagonist helped by a minority sidekick. In Big Trouble in Little China, Jack Burton, despite his bravado, is constantly portrayed as rather bumbling; in one fight sequence, he knocks himself unconscious before the fight begins. Wang Chi, on the other hand, is constantly portrayed as highly skilled and competent. On a commentary track for the DVD release, Carpenter said the film is really about a sidekick (Burton) <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> is a leading man. According to Carpenter, the studio [...] "didn't get it" [...] and made him write something that would explain the character of Jack Burton. Carpenter {{came up with the}} prologue scene between Egg Shen and the lawyer.|$|E

2500|$|Hearings {{began at}} Oeo, South Taranaki, in February, but were {{immediately}} boycotted by Te Whiti's followers when the commission refused {{to travel to}} Parihaka to hold discussions. Historian Dick Scott has claimed Fox, who had already expressed in writing his wish that the Waimate Plains be sold and settled, was appointed chairman of the commission on the proviso that he support the government's land policies {{in the area and}} secure central Taranaki for white settlement. Correspondence to Premier John Hall shows that Fox thought it futile to give a hearing to [...] "every Native <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> has a grievance" [...] and was keen to ensure commission hearings did not delay road-building works in the Waimate Plains that could be carried out in summer.|$|E

However, in the season 6 finale [...] "The Bon Voyage Reaction", Lucy feels too pressured by Raj to meet his friends, and a dinner between Lucy, Raj, and Amy does not go well. Raj apologizes for his behavior and asks Lucy to come to Leonard's goodbye party before his departure for the North Sea on Professor Stephen Hawking's expedition. However, Lucy text messages him at the party saying {{she will not be}} there and does not want to see him again. [...] The next day, Penny goes to comfort a heartbroken Raj, <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> is completely unlovable. Penny suggests that this lament is attributed to alcohol, but Raj says he that he has not had a drink since the night before: he is finally cured of his selective mutism.|$|E
