5|$|The {{works of}} American author Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809– October 7, 1849) include many poems, short stories, and one novel. His fiction spans {{multiple}} genres, including horror fiction, adventure, science fiction, and detective fiction, a genre he {{is credited with}} inventing. These works are generally {{considered part of the}} Dark romanticism movement, a literary reaction to Transcendentalism. Poe's writing reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with didacticism and allegory. Meaning in literature, he said in his criticism, should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface; works whose meanings are too obvious cease to be art. Poe pursued originality in his works, and disliked proverbs. He often included elements of popular pseudosciences such as phrenology and physiognomy. His most recurring themes deal <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning. Though known as a masterly practitioner of Gothic fiction, Poe did not invent the genre; he was following a long-standing popular tradition.|$|E

Just as each color is modified by its relation to adjacent colors {{within the context of}} Neo-Impressionist color theory, so too the object is modified by the geometric forms adjacent to it within the context of Cubism.

For instance, the Islamic personal status laws are inspired by the Sharia law. For Muslims, these tribunals deal <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance and wills. For non-Muslims, personal status jurisdiction is split: the law of inheritance and wills falls under national civil jurisdiction, while Christian and Jewish religious courts are competent for marriage, divorce, and custody. Catholics can additionally appeal before the Vatican Rota court.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the debates}} {{surrounding}} the United States federal budget center around competing macroeconomic schools of thought. In general, Democrats favor the principles of Keynesian economics to encourage economic growth via a mixed economy of {{both private and public}} enterprise, a welfare state, and strong regulatory oversight. Conversely, Republicans generally support applying the principles of either laissez-faire or supply-side economics to grow the economy via small government, low taxes, limited regulation, and free enterprise. Debates have surrounded the appropriate size and role of the federal government since the founding of the country. These debates also deal <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> morality, income equality, and intergenerational equity. For example, Congress adding to the debt today may or may not enhance {{the quality of life for}} future generations, who must also bear the additional interest and taxation burden.|$|E
25|$|Wildlife {{conservation}} in Canada was {{sparked by the}} protection of animals for tourism and recreation. Howard Douglas, an appointed superintendent of Rocky Mountains Park in 1897 first began to expand and preserve wildlife to attract more visitors to the park. However, between 1900 and 1920 Canada saw {{a dramatic change in}} national attitudes from focus in tourism {{to the creation of the}} National Parks Branch, world's first governmental organization dedicated to parks, and the development of other governmental organizations like the Commission of Conservation. Canadian Commission of Conservation that established in 1909 was intended to be an independent body dealing <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> natural resource {{conservation in}} Canada. In the early years of the Commission, wildlife investigations were mostly focused on resource-commodity species such as fish and fur-bearing animals and later developed to include greater variety of species.|$|E
25|$|In 1923 Metzinger {{moved away}} from Cubism towards realism, while still {{retaining}} elements of his earlier Cubist style. In subsequent stages of his career another important change is noticeable, from 1924 to 1930: a development that paralleled the 'mechanical world' of Fernand Léger. Throughout these years Metzinger continued to retain his own marked artistic individuality. These firmly constructed pictures are brightly colored and visually metaphoric, consisting of urban and still-life subject-matter, with clear references to science and technology. At {{the same time he}} was romantically involved with a young Greek woman, Suzanne Phocas. The two were married in 1929. After 1930, until his death in 1956, Metzinger turned towards a more classical or decorative approach to painting with elements of Surrealism, still concerned <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> form, volume, dimension, relative position and relationship of figures, along with visible geometric properties of space. Metzinger was commissioned to paint a large mural, Mystique of Travel, which he executed for the Salle de Cinema in the railway pavilion of the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne, Paris 1937.|$|E

25|$|Reima Pietilä {{had also}} {{been active in the}} {{activities}} of the Museum of Finnish Architecture as well as publishing theoretical articles in Le Carré Bleu and Arkkitehti. Pietilä even attended a meeting of the Team X group of architects, held in 1972 at Cornell University in the USA, who were very much concerned <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> structuralism in architecture, that is emphasising the elements of culture, somewhat in reaction to the universalising tendencies of modernism, especially as originally promoted by Team X's instigators, the older generation of CIAM. Pietilä took a diametric viewpoint to that of the rationalist school, and though the works (designed in partnership with his wife Raili Pietilä) had much of the organic idiosyncrasies of Aalto, they were far more abstract and nebulous. In arguing that nature is the apotheosis of plasticity, he demanded a morphological analysis of architectural products, considering Euclidean geometry as an inadequate instrument of analysis. His first major work, the Finnish Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels Expo did in fact take a modular approach akin to the theories of Blomstedt; however, the wooden rectangular box-like units as a whole gave a foretaste of Pietilä's later surfaces based entirely on free form; the most notable of these organic works being Kaleva Church, Tampere (1959–66), Dipoli student assembly building, Espoo (1961–66), Metso Library, Tampere (1978–86) and culminating in his final work, the Official Residence of the President of Finland, Mäntyniemi, Helsinki (1983–93). All these buildings had been the result of open architectural competitions.|$|E

Many of his works are generally {{considered part of the}} dark romanticism genre, a literary reaction to transcendentalism which Poe strongly disliked. He referred to followers of the transcendental movement as [...] "Frog-Pondians", after the pond on Boston Common, and ridiculed their writings as [...] "metaphor—run mad," [...] lapsing into [...] "obscurity for obscurity's sake" [...] or [...] "mysticism for mysticism's sake". Poe once {{wrote in a letter to}} Thomas Holley Chivers that he did not dislike Transcendentalists, [...] "only the pretenders and sophists among them".|$|E

500|$|In 1894 Busoni {{settled in}} Berlin, which he {{henceforth}} regarded as his home base, except {{during the years}} around World War I. His earlier feelings about the city had been unsympathetic: in an 1889 letter to Gerda he had described it as [...] "this Jewish city that I hate, irritating, idle, arrogant, parvenu". The city was swiftly growing in population and influence at this period and determined to stake itself as the musical capital of the united Germany; but as Busoni's friend the English composer Bernard van Dieren points out [...] "international virtuosi who for practical reasons chose Berlin as their abode were not so much concerned <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> prestige", and for Busoni the city's development as [...] "the centre of the musical industry [...] develop an atmosphere which [...] detested more than the deepest pool of stagnant convention".|$|E
500|$|Some {{film critics}} were {{polarized}} with Star Trek. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the film a 'B+' grade, and asserted {{that it was}} [...] "a reconsideration of what constitutes Star Trek, one that deemphasizes heady concepts and plainly stated humanist virtues in favor of breathless action punctuated by bursts of emotion. It {{might not even be}} immediately recognizable to veteran fans." [...] In concurrence, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "the Gene Roddenberry years, when stories might play <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> science, ideals or philosophy, have been replaced by stories reduced to loud and colorful action." [...] Ebert ultimately gave it a [...] 2.5 out of 4 stars. Similarly, Marc Bain of Newsweek opined: [...] "The latest film version of Star Trek [...] is more brawn than brain, and it largely jettisons complicated ethical conundrums in favor of action sequences and special effects. Slate journalist Juliet Lapidos argued that the new film, with its [...] "standard Hollywood torture scene", {{failed to live up to}} the intellectual standard set by the 1992 Next Generation episode [...] "", whose treatment of the issue she found both more sophisticated and pertinent to the ongoing debate over the United States' use of enhanced interrogation techniques.|$|E
500|$|Although {{none of his}} {{features}} display graphic sex scenes, sexuality in Kubrick's films is usually depicted outside matrimonial relationships in hostile situations. Baxter states that Kubrick explores the [...] "furtive and violent side alleys of the sexual experience: voyeurism, domination, bondage and rape" [...] in his films. He further points out that films like A Clockwork Orange are [...] "powerfully homoerotic", from Alex walking about his parents' flat in his Y-fronts, one eye being [...] "made up with doll-like false eyelashes", to his innocent acceptance of the sexual advances of his post-corrective adviser Deltroid (Aubrey Morris). British critic Adrian Turner notes that Kubrick's films appear to be [...] "preoccupied <b>with</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> universal and inherited evil", and Malcolm McDowell referred to his humor as [...] "black as coal", questioning his outlook on humanity. Although {{a few of his}} pictures were obvious satires and black comedies, such as Lolita and Dr. Strangelove, many of his other films also contained less visible elements of satire or irony. His films are unpredictable, examining [...] "the duality and contradictions that exist in all of us". Ciment notes how Kubrick often tried to confound audience expectations by establishing radically different moods from one film to the next, remarking that he was almost [...] "obsessed with contradicting himself, with making each work a critique of the previous one".|$|E
