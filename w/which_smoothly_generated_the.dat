Além disso, os 5 -organoteluro- 1 H- 1, 2, 3 -triazóis foram funcionalizados na posição 5 do anel triazólico por reação de acoplamento cruzado de Sonogashira. A regioquímica dos produtos de cicloadição foram descritas com base em experimentos de RMN, cálculos teóricos e cristalografia de raio-x. Apresentamos uma proposta mecanística para a cicloadição mediada por cobre, baseada em experimentos de espectrometria de massas de alta resolução. No capítulo 2, investigamos a eficiência de reações one-pot com indol, cloreto de oxalila e diferentes nucleófilos para obtermos derivados do indol- 3 -glioxila em condições adequadas. Do mesmo modo, envolvendo a adição de azidas orgânicas, levando à síntese de indol- 3 -glioxil- 1, 2, 3 -triazóis, os produtos foram obtidos com rendimentos que variaram de 59 a 85 %. In chapter 1 {{we present}} an {{efficient}} synthesis of 5 -organotelluro- 1 H- 1, 2, 3 -triazole compounds that was accomplished via the [3 + 2]-cycloaddition reaction of organoazides and organotelluro alkynes. Additionally, 5 -organotelluro- 1 H- 1, 2, 3 -triazoles were readily functionalized at the 5 -position via the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction, leading to highly functionalised triazoles. The regiochemistry {{of the products}} was assessed by bidimensional NMR experiments, theoretical calculations and x-ray crystallography. We presented a mechanistic proposal for the cycloaddition mediated by copper, based on high resolution mass spectrometry experiments. In chapter 2 we investigated a general and efficient reaction of indole with oxalyl chloride and nucleophiles providing indole- 3 -glyoxyl derivatives which has been developed in mild conditions. In the same fashion, the other reaction involved the addition of organic azides leading to the synthesis of indole- 3 -glyoxyl- 1, 2, 3 -triazoles, <b>which</b> proceeds <b>smoothly</b> <b>generating</b> <b>the</b> products in moderate to high yields...|$|R

30|$|This paper proposes Residue Theorem based soft sliding mode {{control for}} wind power {{generation}} systems to improve the energy conversion ratio and the dynamic performance with a better ability to handle the uncertainties. There are two controllers developed with different boundary definition in this paper. The main idea is to set a soft dynamic boundary for controlled variables around a reference point, so that controlled variables lie on a point inside the boundary. The soft dynamic boundary will keep the control signal continuous. The soft changing manner of the boundary allows the speed to settle in reduced damping, and this prevents the WPGS from a mechanical shaft stress and damage. During transient state, as a PMSG accelerating <b>the</b> <b>generated</b> control boundary decreases <b>smoothly,</b> since <b>the</b> <b>generated</b> control boundary depends on {{the difference between the}} actual and reference speeds.
