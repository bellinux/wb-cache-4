We never stop writing. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> {{the studio with}} all the best laid plans then what {{we end up with}} is not what we intended. It's just {{exciting}} to wonder what will come out the speakers in a year's time. We have very exciting things lined up. It's time to take our music down different directions and really explore other avenues.|$|E
500|$|Fleury {{remained}} {{embroiled in}} controversy at the 2005 Allan Cup tournament. The Thunder were repeatedly accused of paying players despite being an amateur team, and Fleury angrily denied rumours {{that he was}} secretly being paid $100,000. Tournament fans were extremely hostile towards the Thunder, and after it was eliminated in the semi-finals Fleury accused them of racism and threatened to return his 2002 Olympic gold medal: [...] "The one thing that's really bothered me through {{this whole thing is}} the prejudice, still, in this country when it comes to native people. I've seen it first-hand in every building <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into,</b> how these people are treated, and it's absolutely embarrassing to be a Canadian and know that stuff is still going on." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the film came as a {{surprise}} to many fans who were expecting Thanos, the mastermind behind the events of the first film, to be the main villain in the sequel, with Whedon saying, [...] "Thanos was never meant to be the next villain. He's always been the overlord of villainy and darkness." [...] Commenting on finding the right balance between technology- and fantasy-based heroes in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Feige said [...] "Iron Man is a very technological hero; his movies are always technologically based. The first Thor was all about introducing Asgard and Thor in that more fantastical realm into the more reality-based MCU… As <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> Ultron clearly he does come out of technology, but we're using all of our tools at our disposal that we've established so far as part of the MCU to build the storyline of Age of Ultron." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] {{made its}} concert debut on 2 April 1987 in Tempe, Arizona {{on the opening}} night of The Joshua Tree Tour. A version {{featuring}} an extended introduction {{was performed on the}} closing nights of the third leg of The Joshua Tree tour, again in Tempe, Arizona, on December 19 & 20, 1987, and footage from the performance was featured in the Rattle and Hum film. [...] The song has since been played at nearly every full-length concert that U2 has headlined, totaling upwards of 900 performances [...] The song is widely {{regarded as one of the}} group's most popular live songs. Bono said of it, [...] "We can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives, but when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> that song, everything changes. The audience is on its feet, singing along with every word. It's like God suddenly walks through the room." ...|$|E
500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t really thinking ahead in terms of who we are. When <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. So we got into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where we wanted to hear strings, choir where we wanted choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because we knew it was all going to be replaced with real players." [...] Once the album's arrangements were complete, they were performed and recorded in studios around the world, with Campbell conducting and leading the sessions from Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|... {{trying to}} make it as big as possible... my band gets {{involved}} in some of the choreography. It's amazing that everybody sort of gets involved. We're all such teammates with each other when we're on that stage and we just all have such fun together. [...] And then <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> sort of a juke joint feel where we kind of you know, slash that with going to church [...] And then we open it up to a circus element (scene), so there's a – so there's quite a journey that goes on, on stage for my audience and as a performer. [...] But it all does have a tie together, so it all kind of makes sense. [...] You really just got to come see the show, all right. It's so much fun to put on and we have a blast with it".|$|E
2500|$|Press {{was drafted}} to the Washington Freedom as the fourth overall {{pick in the}} 2011 WPS Draft. Under new ownership, the team moved to Florida and was renamed magicJack. She scored her first goal in the 64th minute of magicJack's 2–0 defeat of the Atlanta Beat in May 2011. Of the goal, Press said, [...] "It was so good to finish. Being a forward, <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> every game {{thinking}} {{our job is to}} score, so it’s nice to finally get that accomplished." [...] During a 4–0 win against the Boston Breakers in July 2011, Press scored a hat trick improving the team's league record to 6–6–2 overall. She was awarded the US Soccer Federation's Rookie of the Year award for the first-ever hat trick scored by a rookie. Press finished the 2011 season having started in 16 of the 19 games in which she appeared for magicJack. Her eight goals ranked third in the league. During the postseason, Press signed with the Atlanta Beat; however, the league suspended operations before the season began.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first story}} arc of The Fearless Defenders {{came to a}} close with issue #6 in July 2013. Bunn said, [...] "The first arc has {{definitely}} been very Asgardian. That's just the nature of doing a story about Valkyrie. As <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the next arc, I take the opportunity to show that there are stories for this team in any number of environments... Issues #7-#12, while they tell a complete story, we're going to do a series of done-in-one stories with those issues. Each of those issues will be pretty good jumping-on points for anybody." [...] Issue #6 also featured the death of Annabelle Riggs, who Newsarama called [...] "one of Marvel's few prominent lesbian characters", which drew a strong reaction from fans. In response Bunn wrote, [...] "the fact that she was a lesbian didn’t even enter the equation for me, except that it was part of what made her who she was — just one part of many" [...] with Pyle adding, [...] "I feel very strongly that her sacrifice was very true to everything we love about her. As to whether {{the fact that she is}} a lesbian should have kept us from telling a story in which she died… in this particular case, not having this specific character sacrifice herself would have made for a story in which we were less emotionally invested." ...|$|E
