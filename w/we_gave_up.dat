2500|$|Upon {{touring the}} Mediterranean with Lina in 1904, the couple stopped over in Palestine, expecting {{it to be}} but one stop of many. He wrote, [...] "On {{reaching}} Jerusalem, we changed our plans. All {{that we saw in}} the Holy Land made such a deep impression on us that <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> the idea of going to other places. Visiting the holy sights of which one hears and reads since childhood, watching the scenes in life as pictured in the Bible, was most soul-stirring.

He built soup kitchens for the aged and the blind and the physically defective in 1917. He supported workrooms so that unskilled laborers could find employment. He built health stations which ministered to the victims of malaria and trachoma. He believed strongly in palliative care. He provided $250,000 for the establishment of the Jerusalem Health Center and made possible the founding of a Pasteur Institute. He lent moral and material support to the farmers and colonists of Israel and labored {{in the interests of the}} Hebrew University.|$|E
