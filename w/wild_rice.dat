5|$|Asian rice was domesticated 8,200–13,500 {{years ago}} in China, with a single genetic origin from the <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> Oryza rufipogon, in the Pearl River valley region of China. Rice {{cultivation}} then spread to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Neolithic people {{experienced}} {{an economy that}} included hunting, gathering, fishing and animal rearing. Paddy husk impressions in some potsherds indicate Neolithic involvement in cultivating rice and cereals such as wheat, moong, masoor, and barley. Both cultivated and <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> was harvested during summer and again during winter. The wild forms of rice are Oryza rifipogon and Oryza perennis, from which Oryza sativa (Asian rice) originated.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} found that rice rats {{assimilate}} 88% to 95% of the energy in their food. They lose weight when fed on Spartina, fiddler crabs, or sunflower seeds alone, but a diet consisting of several of those items or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight. In an experiment, marsh rice rats did not show hoarding behavior, but <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> rats have been observed carrying food to a nest. Even when they live in uplands, they mostly eat water plants and animals, although they consume some upland plants.|$|E
50|$|Humans have {{independently}} domesticated {{two different}} rice species. African rice was domesticated from <b>wild</b> African <b>rice,</b> Oryza barthii, while Asian rice (Oryza sativa), was domesticated from <b>wild</b> Asian <b>rice,</b> Oryza rufipogon.|$|R

50|$|Shortly {{after buying}} the land, Jane and Heman {{discovered}} an Indian trail running through it. Soon they found {{some of the}} same Dakotah who Jane had grown up with used the trail on their annual migration North to their <b>wild</b> <b>ricing,</b> hunting and fishing grounds in present-day Forest Lake, Minnesota.|$|R
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{people of the}} Eastern U.S.A. domesticated numerous crops. Sunflowers, tobacco, varieties of squash and Chenopodium, as well as crops no longer grown, including marsh elder and little barley, were domesticated. Wild foods including <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> and maple sugar were harvested. The most common varieties of strawberry were domesticated from Eastern North America. Two major crops, pecans and Concord grapes, were utilized extensively in prehistoric times but {{do not appear to}} have been domesticated until the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Written by Lewis Greifer, {{this story}} was {{commissioned}} in July 1974. The story would involve museum keepers being chased out of the British Museum by a mummy. It would turn out that a group was scaring people away {{in order to gain}} access to a sarcophagus which would contain <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> from thousands of years ago. The group wanted to use the rice to seed Mars and make a fortune. It was replaced by Robert Holmes' Pyramids of Mars when Griefer fell ill and the scripts came in late and were not what the production team wanted.|$|E
5|$|In poor conditions, {{the weight}} of the adrenal gland may {{increase}} up to 200%, and rice rats are unable to conserve water well when dehydrated, and in water contaminated with oil, they swim less and their mortality increases. The median amount of radiation needed to kill a marsh rice rat is 5.25Gy and the lethal dose of potassium cyanide is 7.20mg/kg; both values are relatively low for cricetid rodents. In one study, <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> rats in radioactively contaminated areas did not show signs of disease. Exposure to more daylight and higher food availability cause increased development of the gonads in both adult and juvenile rice rats. When the pineal gland is removed or melatonin is administered in male rice rats, the testes are reduced and tend to regress into the body.|$|E

40|$|Scientists at IRRI (International Rice Research Institute) {{are using}} {{biotechnology}} {{to transfer the}} natural pest resistance found in <b>wild</b> <b>rices</b> into domesticated varieties, and thus develop improved cultivars that require few or no pesticides. Up till now these valuable genes {{could not be used}} because <b>wild</b> <b>rices</b> (Oryza spp.) were so different geneticaIly from the cultivated varieties, but the problem has been overcome by using a technique called 'embryo rescue'. To transfer a trait from a wild Oryza species, a cultivated variety is first fertilized with pollen from the wild one. Hybrid seeds do not survive, so they are harvested after 14 days and their embryos are 'rescued' under sterile laboratory conditions. The embryos are cultured in vitro in the dark until they germinate,they are then brought into the light, and when they have developed sufficiently are transferred to a nutrient solution and grown in a controlled environment. The sterile hybrid is then back-crossed to its domestic parent. The progeny are also back-crossed several times to improve plant type and fertility. The process can incorporate desirable traits of the wild species, such as pest resistance, into a good plant type. Each generation is screened for the desired trait. The final product will be similar to the domesticated parent but will have the pest resistance of the wild species.

5|$|After a {{gestation}} {{of about}} 25 days, {{three to five}} young are usually born, although litter sizes vary from one to seven. Females may have up to six litters a year. Newborns weigh 3 to 4g (about 0.10 to 0.15oz) and are blind and almost naked. About as many males as females are born. The external ears (pinnae) soon unfold and on the first day, claws are visible and the young emit high-pitched squeaks. On the second day, {{they are able to}} crawl, and during the third to fifth days, the whiskers and eyelids develop. On the two subsequent days, the mammae and incisors become visible and the animals become more active. Between the eighth and 11th days, the eyes open, the fur develops, and the young begin to take solid food. Weaning occurs on the 11th to 20th day, according to different studies. Considerable variation is reported in body masses at different ages, perhaps because of geographic variation. Sexual activity commences when the animals are about 50 to 60days old. In the <b>wild,</b> <b>rice</b> rats usually live for less than a year; one study suggested that the average lifespan is only seven months.|$|E
25|$|Morphological {{studies of}} rice phytoliths from the Diaotonghuan archaeological site clearly show the {{transition}} from the collection of <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> to the cultivation of domesticated rice. The large number of <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> phytoliths at the Diaotonghuan level dating from 12,000–11,000 BP indicates that <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> collection was part of the local means of subsistence. Changes in the morphology of Diaotonghuan phytoliths dating from 10,000–8,000 BP show that rice had by this time been domesticated. Soon afterwards the two major varieties of indica and japonica rice were being grown in Central China. In the late 3rd millennium BC, there was a rapid expansion of rice cultivation into mainland Southeast Asia and westwards across India and Nepal.|$|E

50|$|The rising {{temperature}} poses as threats for ecosystems {{because it}} harms the livelihoods of certain tree and plant species. The {{combination of the}} rise in temperatures and change in precipitation levels affects plant growth locations. Climate change has wiped out much of the salmonids and acorns which make up {{a significant portion of}} the Karuk people's food. The increase in temperatures has stunted the <b>wild</b> <b>rice's</b> ability to grow and that has a negative influence on the Anishinaabe people's lifestyle. The Ojibwe people are also affected by the rising temperature's effect on rice growth.|$|R
30|$|This {{represents}} the first northward dispersal of rice from the Yangtze (and/or Huai) region. This {{is an important}} expansion event in which rice reached north of the Qinling Mountains quite separated from the <b>wild</b> <b>rices</b> of the Yangtze watershed. This happened from about 6, 000  years ago, and much more extensively by 5, 000  years ago, and judging by grain size (Qin and Fuller 2009) {{is likely to have}} involved evolution of an early form of short-grained temperate japonica. This probably implies a genetic bottleneck in rice, secondary to a bottleneck of initial cultivation and any bottlenecks involved with post-Pleistocene expansion.|$|R

5|$|The {{reservations}} in Wisconsin {{were named}} the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation, and Lac du Flambeau Indian Reservation. The La Pointe Band {{was given a}} reservation at Bad River around the Band's traditional <b>wild</b> <b>ricing</b> grounds on the south shore of Lake Superior, and some reserved land for fishing grounds at the eastern tip of Madeline Island. In Minnesota, the reservations for the Fond du Lac and the Grand Portage bands were established, with pending negotiations promised for the Bois Forte Band. In Michigan, reservations for the Lac Vieux Desert, Ontonagon and L'Anse bands were established.

25|$|Rice is {{the main}} export of Thailand, {{especially}} white jasmine rice 105 (Dok Mali 105).

In each region of the country there are different rice seed types. Their use depends on weather, atmosphere, and topography.|$|E
25|$|The Ojibwe are {{historically}} {{known for}} their crafting of birch bark canoes, use of copper arrow points, and cultivation of <b>wild</b> <b>rice.</b> In 1745, they adopted guns from the British for use against the Dakota nation of the Sioux, whom they pushed to the south.

25|$|At {{the time}} of European arrival in the region, the river valley and the {{surrounding}} area was occupied by the semi-nomadic Ojibwe, Dakota and nine other American Indian tribes. The Indians lived mainly on <b>wild</b> <b>rice,</b> fish, and game. By the 18th century, the Ojibwe and Dakota were the two primary tribes that inhabited the area, until around 1745, when the Dakota were forever driven from the St. Croix Valley {{as a result of the}} Battle of Kathio.|$|E
30|$|Cultivated rice, Oryza sativa, {{belongs to}} the tribe Oryzeae which {{consists}} of 12 genera. In the genus Oryza, there are 22 species of which only two, O. sativa and Oryza glaberrima, are cultivated. The remaining species within the Oryza are commonly designated as <b>wild</b> <b>rices</b> (Vaughan 1994). The Oryza grow in diverse locations and conditions, from the wettest areas {{in the world to}} the driest deserts, expanding from 53 ° north to 40 ° south, from sea level to an altitude of 3, 000  m above sea level (Childs 2004; Juliano 2004). Due to their long history of growing under diversified climatic and environmental conditions, a wide range of diversity exists in the Oryza genus (Childs 2004). This diversity is particularly abundant amongst the wild species which have not undergone human selection (Vaughan 1994).|$|R

30|$|Additionally, a TreeMix {{model for}} {{inferring}} {{the set of}} population splits and mixtures {{in the history of}} a set of populations was performed using genome-wide allele frequency data in TreeMix (Pickrell and Pritchard 2012). In the collection, four (African cultivated and wild, Asian cultivated and wild, as well as the four groups of Asian rice) and six subpopulations (African <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>rice,</b> Asian <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>rice,</b> and the indica and japonica groups in Asian cultivated rice) were implemented to identify the relationships among the populations.|$|R
25|$|The {{land was}} divided into townships and plots for settlement. Logging and {{agriculture}} on these plots eliminated surrounding forests and prairies, which interrupted the Dakota's annual cycle of farming, hunting, fishing and gathering <b>wild</b> <b>rice.</b> Hunting by settlers dramatically reduced wild game, such as bison, elk, whitetail deer and bear. Not only did this decrease the meat available for the Dakota in southern and western Minnesota, but it directly reduced their ability to sell furs to traders for additional supplies.|$|E
25|$|As {{the name}} implies, the {{division}} {{focuses on the}} enforcement of Minnesota’s natural resource laws. Originally part of the Fish and Game Division, the Enforcement Division’s goal has not changed much: keep the public safe. Conservation Officers employed by this division enforce laws regarding hunting, fishing, trapping, recreational vehicles, State Parks and <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> harvesting. A second focus is educating the public about safety. Classes are taught by trained volunteers and are often related to the enforced laws. The division also enforces air and water quality laws..|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many debates {{on the origins of}} the domesticated rice. Genetic {{evidence}} published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) shows that all forms of Asian rice, both indica and japonica, spring from a single domestication that occurred 8,200–13,500 years ago in China of the <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> Oryza rufipogon. A 2012 study published in Nature, through a map of rice genome variation, indicated that the domestication of rice occurred in the Pearl River valley region of China based on the genetic evidence. From East Asia, rice was spread to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
50|$|Aromatic rice {{is one of}} {{the major}} types of rice. It is a medium- to long-grained rice. It is known for its nut-like aroma and taste, which is caused by the {{chemical}} compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline. Varieties of aromatic rice include basmati, jasmine, Texmati, Tulaipanji, Wehani, and <b>wild</b> pecan <b>rice.</b> When cooked, the grains have a light and fluffy texture.|$|R
30|$|The {{effects of}} salt are dynamic, {{depending}} both upon relative growth rates and ion delivery and root:shoot ratios (Munns et al. 2016). Non-destructive measurements of growth {{showed that the}} relationship between control and salt-treated plants varied substantially over the time-course of treatment in all genotypes. This was partly due to the different developmental programs of each genotype, with Pokkali characterised by vigorous early growth and an early transition to flowering in non-saline conditions, when vegetative growth arrested; the transition to flowering was delayed in salt-treated plants. Such developmental effects are likely to be a factor in the impact of salinity on yield (Khatun et al. 1995). Among the <b>wild</b> <b>rices,</b> we have observed strong contrasts in photoperiod sensitivity between accessions, resulting in large differences in duration of vegetative growth. We speculate that this would affect the time-course of NaCl accumulation and its impact on biomass and grain yield.|$|R
30|$|Over recent years, {{several studies}} in cereals and legumes have {{utilised}} high-throughput phenotyping technology under controlled environments {{to gain a}} better understanding of the genetic architecture and the physiological processes associated with salinity stress (Hairmansis et al. 2014; Campbell et al. 2015, 2017; Atieno et al. 2017). However, this approach had not been applied to crop wild relatives. In a large-scale, non-destructive phenotyping facility (‘The Plant Accelerator’) we assembled shoot images of O. sativa, O. meridionalis and O. australiensis exposed to a range of salt treatments for five weeks during the early vegetative stage. We sought to examine developmentally specific salinity responses, growth dynamics and the complex relationship between different traits under salt stress in Australian <b>wild</b> <b>rices</b> pre-selected for inherent tolerance to salinity. Comparisons were made between these genotypes and O. sativa genotypes Pokkali (salt-tolerant) and IR 29 (salt-sensitive). The broader context of this work was to gain insights into abiotic stress tolerance of exotic Australian genotypes with the aim of identifying key genes in subsequent research.|$|R
