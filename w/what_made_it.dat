25|$|The {{creation}} of cities before 1983 was solely {{at the discretion}} of the national legislature; there were no requirements for achieving 'city' status other than an approved city charter. No income, population or land area requirements had to be met in order to incorporate cities before Batas Pambansa Bilang 337 (Local Government Code of 1983) became law. This is <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> possible for several current cities such as Tangub or Canlaon to be conferred such a status despite their small population and locally generated income, which do not meet current standards. The relatively low income standard between 1992 and 2001 (which was 20 million) also allowed several municipalities, such as Sipalay and Muñoz, to become cities despite not being able to meet the current 100 million local income standard.|$|E
25|$|England had a {{good time}} between the Fourth and Fifth Tests. Mike Denness {{returned}} to form with 157 not in their innings victory over Tasmania and 99 in a 187 run win over New South Wales. Dennis Amiss made 52 and 124 in the Sydney game and Chris Old took 7/59. Denness therefore returned to the team as England captain, replacing the injured vice-captain John Edrich who was still recovering from his damaged ribs, which had in fact been broken, not just bruised as previously thought. Australia dropped the batsman Ross Edwards in favour of the local leg-spinner Terry Jenner. There was a storm the night before the first day, which ripped the covers off the field and flooded the ground. The nightwatchman had not called the curator, so the damage could not be repaired in time for the first day's play, which had to be abandoned. The ex-Australian umpire Col Egar thought that play might not even start on the second day. <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> more distressing was that a record crowd appeared despite the series having already been won, but had to be turned away. Jim Laker and Ken Barrington were part of the crowd, escorting travel groups of British cricket fans. As it was there was a steady wind which helped dry out the ground overnight, except at the River Torrens end, but the famously long boundary was pulled in with ropes marking a now egg shaped Adelaide Oval. Denness called heads {{and for the first time}} England won the toss. With the pitch still worse for wear he chose to field, the third time the winning captain had taken this unusual course in the series.|$|E

Aubuchon added that Tom Mason's capture helped the writer's change the character slightly. He stated: [...] "Tom comes away from that experience feeling used and manipulated.

500|$|Jackson Benson {{writes in}} [...] "Ernest Hemingway: The Life as Fiction and the Fiction as Life" [...] that critics should refrain from finding {{connections}} between Hemingway's life and fiction and instead {{focus on how}} he uses biographical events to transform life into art. He believes the events in a writer's life have only a vague relationship to the fiction, like a dream from which a drama emerges. Of Hemingway's earliest stories, Benson claims [...] "his early fiction, his best, has often been compared to a compulsive nightmare". In his essay [...] "On Writing", Hemingway wrote that [...] "Indian Camp" [...] was a story in which imaginary events were made to seem real: [...] "Everything good he'd ever written he'd made up....

500|$|Varietys Brian Lowry {{called it}} [...] "clever, irreverent, satirical and outfitted" [...] {{but that it}} was [...] "just barely" [...] capable of {{sustaining}} a running time longer than a television episode. Lisa Schwarzbaum praised the voice cast but stated that the [...] "'action' sequences sometimes falter". When comparing the film to the early episodes of the show, Stephen Rowley concluded that the film [...] "has more going for it than the show in its later years, but {{is still a long way}} short of <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> so invigorating". The Monthly critic Luke Davies echoed Lowry's concerns about the length: [...] "everything moves with the whip-crack speed of a half-hour episode. And that's the paradox: it makes the film feel like three episodes strung together. We're in a cinema, and we expect something epic." [...] He opined that [...] "in the great arc that is the history of The Simpsons, this film will come to be seen as oddity rather than apotheosis." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics later {{frequently}} praised {{both the}} film's aesthetic quality and its power. Observing that it {{managed to be}} [...] "horrifying without being a bloodbath (you'll see more gore in a Steven Seagal film)", Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle called it [...] "a backwoods masterpiece of fear and loathing". TV Guide thought it was [...] "intelligent" [...] in its [...] "bloodless depiction of violence", while Anton Bitel felt {{the fact that it}} was banned in the United Kingdom was a tribute to its artistry. He pointed out how the quiet sense of foreboding at the beginning of the film grows, until the viewer experiences [...] "a punishing assault on the senses". In Hick Flicks: The Rise and Fall of Redneck Cinema, Scott Von Doviak commended its effective use of daylight shots, unusual among horror films, such as the sight of a corpse draped over a tombstone in the opening sequence. Mike Emery of The Austin Chronicle praised the film's [...] "subtle touches"—such as radio broadcasts heard in the background describing grisly murders around Texas—and said that <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> so dreadful was that it never strayed too far from potential reality.|$|E
500|$|... "The Call of the Simpsons" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, both criticized and praised the episode saying: [...] "This episode is a bit less {{than the sum of its}} parts. The early stuff at the RV Round-Up is much better than the main camping story, although there's some nice Marge-Lisa bonding, and who could resist Maggie and the bears?" [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 1.5/5, adding [...] "the surrealism of Homer as bigfoot is a major misstep. This type of gag would be very different today, if done at all." [...] Jon Bonné at MSNBC called the episode [...] "a perfect example of the first season’s bizarre and fruitful balance between edgy humor and softly-drawn neuroses" [...] and stated that [...] "it was this combination that made Groening’s shorts for the Ullman show so compelling, and ultimately <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> possible for The Simpsons to break the molds of network television." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "while [...] doesn’t offer the continuous highs of the best Simpsons, it’s a generally solid show" [...] and added that [...] "the episode uses a wackier tone than usual for this era, but it works, and the program is consistently fun".|$|E

Scott of At The Movies also {{compared}} his {{viewing of}} the film to {{the first time he}} viewed Star Wars and he said [...] "although the script is a little bit... obvious," [...] it was [...] "part of <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> work". Todd McCarthy of Variety praised the film, saying [...] "The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in Avatar, and it's very much a place worth visiting." [...] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review. [...] "The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention," [...] he stated. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded Avatar a three-and-a-half out of four star rating and wrote in his print review [...] "It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just be as big as his dreams." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine thought that the film was [...] "the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times thought the film has [...] "powerful" [...] visual accomplishments but [...] "flat dialogue" [...] and [...] "obvious characterization". James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars; he wrote [...] "In 3-D, it's immersive– but the traditional film elements– story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc.– are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2½-hour experience." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Volcano" [...] {{episode was}} in {{production}} when South Park debuted on August 13, 1997. Comedy Central executives did {{not object to}} most of the content of the episode, but said the scene in which Kyle farted while talking to Stan should have been removed because nothing happened after the fart, and they said it was not funny. Parker and Stone, however, insisted it stay in the episode, and they said the lack of any reaction whatsoever to the fart was <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> funny. During close-ups of Cartman's face while telling the story of Scuzzlebutt around the campfire, the flames from the fire stop moving. Parker and Stone noticed the consistency error after the episode was filmed, but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before the broadcast date, so it was left in. A cat featured in the background of one of the outdoor scenes was designed to look exactly like Parker's cat, Jake. The scene in which Ned catches fire was based on an experience Parker had during a Colorado camping trip where he tried to do an [...] "Indian Fire Trick", in which one pours gasoline onto a fire to create large flames. Although nobody caught fire, Parker said the trick misfired and he nearly burned down the forest. After finishing the episode, Parker and Stone realized [...] "Volcano" [...] was about two minutes shorter than the time length required for the episode. In order to add time to the episode, Parker and Stone added the scene with Ned singing the song [...] "Kumbaya" [...] around the fire, as well as the long freeze-frame on a shocked Chef and Mayor McDaniels reacting to the news of the volcano's imminent eruption.|$|E
