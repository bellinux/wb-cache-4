40|$|There is a {{considerable}} recent literature concerned with the impacts of factory closure. Much of this literature is based on closures in the 1980 s and 1990 s and on closures affecting heavy industry – coal, steel and shipbuilding. It also tends to focus on employment and labour market impacts assessed through the subsequent experience of <b>workers</b> <b>made</b> <b>redundant</b> following closures and, perhaps justifiably, {{to assume that the}} impacts are localized. Because of this much of the discussion of policy implications relates to the <b>workers</b> <b>made</b> <b>redundant</b> and to a very local economy. This paper refers to the closure of the MG Rover factory in Longbridge, Birmingham, UK. This closure attracted considerable media and policy interest. It was regarded as presenting a crisis for government and the local community. The paper responds to arguments in the research literature and explores the spatial and economic impact of the MG Rover closure in more detail. It complements other research which has focused on the experience of those <b>made</b> <b>redundant</b> in 2005 by referring to the loss of employment over a longer time period and identifying a wider impact spatially and socially.

50|$|The European Commission {{proposed}} that, {{in addition}} to its current scope, the Fund should be able to support <b>workers</b> <b>made</b> <b>redundant</b> {{as a result of the}} global financial and economic crisis on 16 December 2008. In addition, it proposes to reduce the threshold of redundancies from the current 1,000 to 500, to extend the period of each case from 12 months to 24 months, and to increase its contribution from 50% of total cost to 75% (the rest being contributed by the member state). This proposal was submitted to the Council and the European Parliament in December 2008. It is expected that the amendment will be adopted in mid-2009. There is a need of this fund because the difference in labour costs at the international level remains an important determinant of the geographical distribution of production, because the large apparel companies are constantly seeking production bases lower labour costs. Additionally, the ongoing globalisation of trade has intensified this situation. The search for lower labour costs have led to significant changes in the image of global apparel industry. The production of clothing gradually moved from Europe to Asia, which now accounts for nearly 45% of global garment production.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{experiences}} {{of a group of}} women <b>made</b> <b>redundant</b> from public sector institutions in Sudan. It aims to explore the consequences of privatisation and redundancy on women's employment, and economic and social positions. It also considers whether the women's experiences varied according to their occupations, as the study sample comprised women professionals and women <b>workers</b> <b>made</b> <b>redundant</b> from the banking and manufacturing sectors respectively. This research is of particular importance, because it primarily sets out to investigate the changes that happened in women's employment status, as well as women's economic and social positions, as a result of privatisation policies that emerged in a fast-track process implemented in public sector institutions in the early 1990 s. In addition to the socio-cultural factors that are structurally rooted in that society, particular aspects undermine women's position in society, including patriarchal structures that were historically institutionalised at the household, society, labour market, and state level, and the discriminatory gender inequalities practised against women in the domestic domain. The collective interactions among these have seriously undermined women's employment, and their economic and social positions in Sudan. The findings from this study indicate that women, <b>made</b> <b>redundant</b> as a result of privatisation, experienced adverse impacts on their employment status, as well as their livelihoods. Constraints within the context where women experienced redundancy due to privatisation, still do not consider the changing positions of women in public sector institutions, and at the household level as well. xiEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the issue of preferential rights in relation to the increased practice of hiring temporary staff. The object is illuminated from a diversity perspective by seeing what a circumvention of the preferential rights may have consequences for vulnerable groups on the Swedish labor market.   The question of preferential rights to reinstatement is controlled in  The Employment Protection Act. The preferential right is for the protection of <b>workers</b> <b>made</b> <b>redundant</b> due to redundancy. The use of agency workers has increased significantly in the Swedish labor market since the industry's legalization in 1993. This has created some problems in terms of preferential rights.   To a circumvention of the law, shall exist requires that the measures constitute circumvention is justified, measures should have been sought to circumvent the law and been unfair in view of the particular case. Hiring of staff is not considered as a new employment, which is the requirement to invoke preferential rights, thus causing it to staff hiring is legitimate action under the preferential time.   To reduce the abuse of the right of priority, I believe that the application of law should be changed so that it takes into account the triangular available on today's labor market...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a preliminary comparative longitudinal {{analysis of the}} impact on <b>workers</b> <b>made</b> <b>redundant</b> due to {{the closure of the}} Mitsubishi plant in Adelaide and the MG Rover plant in Birmingham. Longitudinal surveys of ex-workers from both firms were undertaken over a 12 month period in order to assess the process of labour market adjustment. In the Mitsubishi case, given the skills shortage the state of Adelaide was facing, together with the considerable growth in mining and defence industries, it would have been more appropriate if policy intervention had been redirected to further training or re-skilling opportunities for redundant workers. This opportunity was effectively missed and as a result more workers left the workforce, most notably for retirement, than could have otherwise been the case. The MG Rover case was seen as a more successful example of policy intervention, with greater funding assistance available and targeted support available, and with more emphasis on re-training needs to assist adjustment. However, despite the assistance offered and the rhetoric of successful adjustment in both cases, the majority of workers have nevertheless experienced deterioration in their circumstances – particularly in the Australian case where casual and part-time work were often the only work that could be obtained. Even in the UK case, where more funding assistance was offered, a majority of workers reported a decline in earnings and a rise in job insecurity. This suggests that a reliance on the flexible labour market is insufficient to promote adjustment, and that more active policy intervention is needed especially in regard to further up-skilling. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Employment Ordinance {{provides}} {{the framework for}} a comprehensive code of employment. It governs the payment of wages, the termination of employment contracts and the operation of employment agencies. The law provides statutory holidays with pay, sick leave, maternity protection, rest days, paid annual leave and employment protection for employees. All employees have statutory protection against anti-union discrimination. The law also provides for severance pay to <b>workers</b> <b>made</b> <b>redundant,</b> and long service payment to workers with long service who are dismissed {{for reasons other than}} redundancy, or on disciplinary grounds, who die in service, or who resign on grounds of ill health or old age. Employees who are owed wages, wages in lieu of notice and/or severance payments by insolvent employers may apply for ex-gratia payment from the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund which is financed by an annual levy on business registration certificates. The Employment of Children Regulations prohibit the employment of children aged under 15 in all industrial undertakings. Subject to certain protective restrictions, children aged 13 and 14 who are attending school may take up part-time employment in the non-industrial sectors. The Employment of Young Persons (Industry) Regulations govern the employment conditions of young persons aged 15 to 17 in industrial undertakings. These young persons are not allowed to work more than eight hours a day and 48 hours a week. Overtime work for them is prohibited. Eight special enforcement teams of labour inspectors are responsible for monitoring employers' compliance with various labour legislation to safeguard the rights and benefits of local and imported workers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{liberalisation}} {{of trade}} laws {{and the growth of}} factories had increased the gulf between master tradesmen, and journeymen and apprentices, whose numbers increased disproportionately by 93% between 1815 and 1848 in Germany. Significant proletarian unrest had occurred in Lyon in 1831 and 1834, and Prague in 1844. Jonathan Sperber has suggested that in the period after 1825, poorer urban workers (particularly day labourers, factory workers and artisans) saw their purchasing power decline relatively steeply: urban meat consumption in Belgium, France and Germany stagnated or declined after 1830, despite growing populations. [...] The economic crisis of 1847 increased urban unemployment: 10,000 Viennese factory <b>workers</b> were <b>made</b> <b>redundant</b> and 128 Hamburg firms went bankrupt over the course of 1847.

40|$|On Saturday 14 February 1998, South Korea passed new labour {{legislation}} which gives employers {{the right to}} lay off <b>workers</b> <b>made</b> <b>redundant</b> for business reasons, including mergers and acquisitions. Similar legislation, introduced unexpectedly {{at the end of}} 1996, had been reversed in 1997 after substantial public protest. That a restoration of the 1996 legislation has been possible is contingent on the circumstances of South Korea in the global economy, the election of an opposition president, and the 1997 - 98 Asian financial crisis, of which South Korea was a serious casualty. Unlike in Singapore, Hong Kong and, to some extent, Taiwan, The Korean labour movement had never been completely subordinated to the industrialising elite, here comprising an alliance of army officers and chaebol families. Suppression of militant trade unionism was begun under the American Military Government (AMG) as the cold war set in and labour activists operated only clandestinely. Vigilance of labour was maintained by the repressive dictatorships of presidents Park Chung-Hee and Chun Doo-Wan, who oversaw the rapid industrialisation and economic restructuring of the country in the 1970 s and 1980 s. However, when, in 1987, Korea, under external pressure from trading nations, began to democratise, the suppressed independent labour movement became openly active in promoting workers' rights and securing better pay and conditions. The new unions faced the opposition of mostly hostile chaebol employers, the initial complacency of the official trade union federation and a government reluctant to abandon its authoritarian ways. Nevertheless, rapid changes took place in employment relations in Korea over the following decade, and it is demonstrated in this paper, that these have been indirectly in response to increasing globalisation and its regional manifestation in the Asia Pacific. ...|$|R
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} Royal Mail's {{modernisation}} drive involved {{the introduction of the}} walk sequencing machine that organises mail into the order the postman will deliver them on his round.

The Communication Workers Union argued that although it had signed up to this part of the agreement in 2007 and that the plans would make it necessary for some jobs to be lost, it had not understood the exact nature of Royal Mail's plan. Furthermore, the union said that when Royal Mail stopped talking to staff about the long-term effects of job security, there had been no choice other than to threaten a strike to restart discussions. Royal Mail, on the other hand, said that it had not stopped talking to the union and continued to involve it in its modernisation strategy.|$|R
