5|$|No {{immediate}} action {{had been taken}} after the 1880 act authorizing coins, but King KalƒÅkaua was interested and government officials saw {{a way to get}} out of a financial bind by getting coins issued in exchange for government bonds. Businessman Claus Spreckels was willing to make the arrangements <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>in</b> exchange for profits from the coin production, and contracted with the US Mint to have $1,000,000 struck. Originally, a 12 cent piece was planned and a few specimens were struck, but it was scrapped in an effort to have uniformity between US and Hawaiian coins, and a dime was substituted. The coins were struck at San Francisco in 1883 and 1884, though all bear the earlier date.|$|E

5|$|In May 1940, during World War II, the United Kingdom {{initiated}} {{an invasion}} of politically neutral Iceland, fearing it would otherwise fall to the forces of Nazi Germany which had recently conquered Denmark. Iceland's indigenous population was generally opposed to the British occupation, instead preferring troops of the United States, which was neutral at that phase in the war. Iceland signed a defense agreement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>in</b> which United States troops would be stationed on the island nation. The U.S. Marine Corps hastily assembled the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade in Charleston, South Carolina, to move to Iceland {{as part of the}} agreement. The brigade was first activated on 14 July 1941. Its elements were taken from the 2nd Marine Division, which was training at Marine Corps Base San Diego and Camp Elliott, both in San Diego, California. This brought the force up to a strength of 4,095 men. They were the first of 28,000 men occupying Iceland under Major General Holland M. Smith and his 1st Marine Division. While the 1st Marine Division was building its forces, though, the Provisional Brigade would hold Iceland. However, priorities soon changed and the 1st Marine Division was moved elsewhere. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was instead joined by units of the United States Army.|$|E
