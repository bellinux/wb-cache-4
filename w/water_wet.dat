40|$|Internal {{corrosion}} occurs {{only when}} corrosive <b>water</b> <b>wets</b> the pipe inner wall. However, <b>water</b> <b>wetting</b> {{is one of}} most important missing links of our current overall understanding of internal corrosion {{of oil and gas}} pipelines. In this study, extensive experimental studies on <b>water</b> <b>wetting</b> in large diameter horizontal oil-water pipe flows were carried out. Four main techniques (wall conductance probes, Fe 2 + concentration monitoring, wall sampling and flow pattern visualization) were used to determine phase wetting on the internal wall of pipe at different superficial oil and water velocities. Four flow patterns were observed: stratified flow, stratified flow with mixed layer, semi-dispersed and dispersed flows. Three types of phase <b>wetting</b> regimes (<b>water</b> <b>wetting,</b> intermittent wetting and oil wetting) were determined. A comprehensive phase wetting map was obtained based on the overlapping information from these techniques. 1 Based on the results of corrosion monitoring, it was found that a complete absence of corrosion is guaranteed only when oil wetting occurs. At the same superficial oil velocity, the corrosion rate under <b>water</b> <b>wetting</b> is much higher than that under intermittent wetting. Phase wetting significantly affects the corrosion rate. A comparison was carried out between the mechanistic water entrainment and separation model 8 - 9 and experimental results. A good agreement was achieved...|$|R

Four types of oil, one model oil and three crude oils, {{have been used in}} conjunction with a 1 wt % NaCl brine as working fluids. Flow pattern visualization, wall conductance probes, corrosion monitoring and wall fluid sampling were successfully applied in this investigation. Based on the overlapping information from these four techniques, three types of phase <b>wetting</b> regimes (stable <b>water</b> <b>wetting,</b> intermittent wetting and stable oil wetting) were observed. Comprehensive phase wetting maps were constructed where and the boundaries between these <b>water</b> <b>wetting</b> regimes are identified. It was found that the oil type has a significant effect on the transition from stable oil wetting to intermittent wetting and that much of the influence can be ascribed to the physical properties of the oil: density, viscosity and surface/interfacial tension. No corrosion was detected in the stable oil wetting regime, while the corrosion rate in the full <b>water</b> <b>wetting</b> regime was typically twice that observed for the intermittent wetting...|$|R

The {{results indicate that the}} morphologies of ZnO on the Zn foils relate to the CuSO 4 concentration of in solutions. The morphologies on the specimens with dual-scale (nano and micro) structure have higher wetting angles than those with flat structure. The <b>water</b> <b>wetting</b> angles can reduce with the increase in annealing temperatures of immersed specimens. The <b>water</b> <b>wetting</b> angles increase with keeping immersed specimens at room temperatures. The change of the wetting angle is explained by absorption of organic carbon on specimen surface and the geometric structure of the surface...|$|R

40|$|Surface wetting on {{polyelectrolyte}} multilayers (PEMs), {{prepared by}} alternating deposition of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) and poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS), was investigated mainly in water‐solid‐oil systems. The surface‐wetting behavior of as‐prepared PEMs was well correlated to the molecular {{structures of the}} uncompensated ionic groups on the PEMs as revealed by sum frequency generation vibrational and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopies. The orientation change of the benzenesulfonate groups on the PSS‐capped surfaces causes poor <b>water</b> <b>wetting</b> in oil or air and negligible oil <b>wetting</b> in <b>water,</b> while the orientation change of the quaternized pyrrolidine rings on the PDDA‐capped surfaces hardly affects their wetting behavior. The underwater oil repellency of PSS‐capped PEMs was successfully harnessed to manufacture highly efficient filters for oil‐water separation at high flux. Wet surfaces: Liquid wetting on charged surfaces is well correlated with the molecular nature of surface ionic groups. The orientation change of surface ionic groups either hardly affects <b>water</b> <b>wetting</b> if their configuration is isotropic, or markedly transforms poor <b>water</b> <b>wetting</b> in oil to poor water de‐wetting in water if their configuration is anisotropic, thus leading to excellent underwater oil repellency...|$|R

50|$|One {{study used}} the water {{advancing}} contact angle {{to estimate the}} wettability of fifty five oil reservoirs.

Although the range of wettabilities was divided into three regions, these are arbitrary divisions. The wettability of different reservoirs can vary within the broad spectrum from strongly-water wet to strongly-oil wet. Another study described two initial conditions as reference and non-reference for calculating cut-off values by using advancing and receding contact angles and spontaneous imbibition data.
