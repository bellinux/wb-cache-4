5|$|In August 2017 MLSE {{announced}} that it had reached an agreement with Scotiabank to rename the ACC Scotiabank Arena, effective July 1 2018, for a reported CAD $800 million over 20 years, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it the largest such deal in North American sports history.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{remained}} well ahead {{when the state}} conventions concluded, leaving his opponents' only hope the Republican National Committee (RNC), <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> initial rulings on which delegates would be seated; there were contested seats or rival delegations in several states, and rulings against McKinley could still deprive him of a first-ballot majority. When the RNC met in mid-June, {{just prior to the}} convention, McKinley was easily victorious in almost all cases.|$|E
5|$|There {{were about}} 100 {{reliably}} reported deaths from spider bites in the 20th century, compared to about 1,500 from jellyfish stings. Many alleged cases of spider bites may represent incorrect diagnoses, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> {{it more difficult}} to check the effectiveness of treatments for genuine bites.|$|E

5|$|A relict species nearly exterminated by {{the last}} ice age, box {{huckleberry}} is self-sterile, and is found in isolated colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots. One colony in Pennsylvania was once estimated to {{be as many as}} 13,000 years old; more recent estimates have an upper bound of about 8,000 years, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it the oldest woody plant east of the Rocky Mountains. Another colony in Pennsylvania, about 1,300 years old, has been protected by the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option was}} to {{relocate}} to Anaheim, in the Greater Los Angeles area. The Houston Rockets had looked into relocation to Anaheim the previous season, with Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now Honda Center) as the home venue. However, the NHL team then known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had an agreement that any other tenant at the Pond should share revenues with their then-owner, The Walt Disney Company, although Disney stated {{they were willing to}} negotiate the terms. There are also two existing clubs in Los Angeles, the Lakers and the Clippers, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> the media market small and limit revenue.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its limited}} release, English-language copies of Panzer Dragoon Saga are rare and sell for high prices. It {{has not been}} re-released. In 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for the game-downloading service GameTap stated that GameTap had non-exclusive rights to distribute the game, but as Saturn emulation is difficult, there was not enough demand to make it a priority. In the same year, Futatsugi stated that Sega had lost the game's source code, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> porting the game difficult.|$|E

50|$|Colin was {{the oldest}} son of Sir Neil Campbell and his first wife, likely Alyse Crawford. His {{stepmother}} was Mary Bruce, sister of king Robert the Bruce. It has been theorized that Cailean of Carrick was Colin's great-great grandfather, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> also <b>make</b> Robert the Bruce his second cousin once removed. Tradition has it that William Wallace's mother was Margaret Crawford, <b>which</b> if accurate, <b>would</b> <b>make</b> Wallace and Colin first cousins once removed.|$|R

5|$|Game of Thrones has an {{ensemble}} cast {{estimated to be}} the largest on television; during its third season, 257 cast names were recorded. In 2014, several actor contracts were renegotiated to include a seventh-season option, with raises which reportedly made them among the highest-paid performers on cable TV. In 2016, it was reported that several actor contracts were again renegotiated, with five of the main cast members having increased their salary to £2 million per episode for the last two seasons, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> them the highest paid actors on television. The main cast is listed below.|$|E
5|$|Later {{installations}} {{faced the}} opposite dilemma of having too few stations: one Streetsblog writer {{noted that the}} stations in the expansions were spaced further apart than the stations in the original service area, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> the Citi Bike stations in these areas harder to access. In September 2017, a reporter for Time Out magazine wrote that the system did not serve the outer boroughs adequately, with stations only located in wealthier areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens that were closer to the Manhattan central business districts.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, the {{dusky shark}} is viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are initially nourished by a yolk sac, which is {{converted into a}} placental connection to the mother once the yolk supply is exhausted. Mating occurs during spring in the northwestern Atlantic, while {{there appears to be}} no reproductive seasonality in other regions such as off South Africa. Females are capable of storing masses of sperm, possibly from multiple males, for months to years within their nidamental glands (an organ that secretes egg cases). This would be advantageous given the sharks' itinerant natures and low natural abundance, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> encounters with suitable mates infrequent and unpredictable.|$|E

5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge. This method involved using a collar, into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|E
5|$|The King's School, Canterbury claims Augustine as its founder, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it the world's oldest {{existing}} school, but {{the first}} documentary records of the school date from the 16th century. Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the East Anglian mission. Augustine received liturgical books from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They {{may have been some}} of the new mass books that were being written at this time. The exact liturgy that Augustine introduced to England remains unknown, {{but it would have been}} a form of the Latin language liturgy in use at Rome.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{size of the}} {{heterogeneous}} group {{gathered by}} Alboin is impossible to know, and many different estimates have been made. Neil Christie considers 150,000–500,000 to be a realistic size, a number <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> the Lombards a more numerous force than the Ostrogoths {{on the eve of}} their invasion of Italy. Jörg Jarnut proposes 100,000–150,000 as an approximation; Wilfried Menghen in Die Langobarden estimates 150,000 to 200,000; while Stefano Gasparri cautiously judges the peoples united by Alboin to be somewhere between 100,000 and 300,000.|$|E
2500|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis caused further budgetary constraints. After Gyurcsány's resignation, the Socialists {{put forward a}} [...] "government of experts" [...] under Gordon Bajnai in March 2009, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> only <b>make</b> essential macroeconomic decisions.|$|R

5|$|The {{tawny owl}} {{is a member}} of the wood-owl genus Strix, part of the typical owl family Strigidae, which {{contains}} all species of owl other than the barn owls. Within its genus, the tawny owl's closest relatives are Hume's owl, Strix butleri, (formerly considered to be conspecific), the Himalayan owl, Strix nivicolum, (sometimes considered conspecific), its larger northern neighbour, the Ural owl, S. uralensis, and the North American barred owl, S. varia. The Early–Middle Pleistocene Strix intermedia is sometimes considered a paleosubspecies of the tawny owl, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it that species' immediate ancestor.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} safety of the {{merchant}} ships gathering at Macau in the winter of 1797–98, the British commander in the East Indies, Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier, sent a convoy to China escorted by the frigates HMS Sybille and HMS Fox and commanded by Captain Edward Cooke. After completing his mission Cooke decided to investigate the state of readiness of Spanish forces in Manila himself. He was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from Manila, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> a valuable prize. Sailing in Sybille and accompanied by Captain Pulteney Malcolm in Fox, Cooke reached the Spanish capital on 13 January 1798.|$|E
5|$|While Dürr {{assumes that}} Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 15 July 1714, other scholars arrive at different dates. John Eliot Gardiner and others assume Oculi that year <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it the earliest cantata performed after the promotion. It {{is his first}} extant church cantata for a solo voice, followed by , for soprano. The cantata {{is the first of}} four written for a single alto soloist, the others, all composed in 1726, being , Vergnügte Ruh, beliebte Seelenlust, BWV 170, and , BWV 169, two of which also have texts by Lehms.|$|E

5|$|Ajay {{encounters}} Pagan, who chastises him for fleeing at {{the start}} of the game, claiming that he only ever intended to help Ajay. Pagan offers Ajay a final decision: shoot him now, or listen to him. If Ajay shoots Pagan, the game ends immediately and the credits roll. If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Ajay's father sent Ishwari to spy on Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together, Lakshmana, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> her Ajay's half-sister. Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale, killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before leaving the country with the infant Ajay. Pagan shows Ajay to a shrine containing Lakshmana's ashes, and Ajay places Ishwari's ashes inside. Pagan then boards a helicopter and departs peacefully, leaving the country in Ajay's hands.|$|E
5|$|Allosauridae {{is one of}} four {{families}} in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae, Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae. Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (<b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it paraphyletic), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria. Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review. Another genus, Epanterias, is a potential valid member, but it and Saurophaganax {{may turn out to be}} large examples of Allosaurus. Recent reviews have kept the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|At E3 2003, Nintendo showcased two Zelda games <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> {{use of the}} Game Boy Advance connectivity, Four Swords and Tetra's Trackers. In December of {{the same}} year, it was {{announced}} that both games would be together in a single disc, Four Swords +, along with a third, Shadow Battle. Four Swords Adventures was released in Japan with Hyrule Adventure, Shadow Battle, and Navi's Trackers as three individual games bundled together. It was later announced on June 7, 2004, however, that Hyrule Adventures and Navi's Trackers would be sold as two separate titles in the United States, while the retail status of Shadow Battle was still unknown. This decision was later changed to bundle Hyrule Adventure with Shadow Battle, and to not release Navi's Trackers in the United States.|$|E
