5|$|Chrysippus of Cnidos wrote a {{treatise}} on cabbage, which Pliny knew, {{but it has}} not survived. The Greeks <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> that cabbages and grapevines were inimical, and that cabbage planted too near the vine would impart its unwelcome odor to the grapes; this Mediterranean sense of antipathy survives today.|$|E
5|$|Galileo's {{dispute with}} Grassi {{permanently}} alienated {{many of the}} Jesuits who had previously been sympathetic to his ideas, and Galileo and his friends <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> that these Jesuits were responsible for bringing about his later condemnation. The evidence for this is at best equivocal, however.|$|E
5|$|Seidler thought Paul Bettany {{would be}} a good choice to play King GeorgeVI, Tom Hooper {{preferred}} Hugh Grant, though both actors refused the offer. Once they met with Firth and heard him read for the part, Seidler and Hooper <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> of his suitability for the role.|$|E

40|$|Chang and Lyuu [Chang and Lyuu, 2008] {{study the}} {{spreading}} {{of a message}} in an Erdős-Rényi random graph G(n, p) starting from a set of vertices that <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> of the message initially. In their strictmajority scenario, whenever {{more than half of}} the neighbors of a vertex v <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> of a message, v itself also becomes convinced. The spreading proceeds asynchronously until no more vertices can <b>be</b> <b>convinced.</b> Following Chang and Lyuu [Chang and Lyuu, 2008], we derive lower bounds on the minimum number min-seed(n, p) of vertices that need to <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> initially so that all vertices will <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> at the end. Our main results are that min-seed(n, p) = Ω (min { n, p 2 n 2 }) and min-seed(n, p) = Ω (n 2 / 3) hold with high probability. We also consider the case of random seeds. For any sufficiently large constant d> 0 and any s ≤ n/(d ln n), we show that if one picks the set of seeds uniformly at random from the family of all s-sized sets, then with high probability, not all vertices will <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> at the end. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{impact of}} Graffham was minimal. The Swedish {{government}} agreed to {{few of the}} concessions requested during the meetings, and few high-level officials <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> that the Allies would invade Norway. Overall, the influence of Graffham and Fortitude North on German strategy in Scandinavia is disputed.|$|E
5|$|The {{researchers}} Frank Podmore (1910), Milbourne Christopher (1970), Trevor H. Hall (1984) and Gordon Stein (1993) <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> that Home was a {{fraud and}} {{have provided a}} source of speculation on {{the ways in which}} he could have duped his séance sitters.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of Old School {{leaders in the}} North <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> of the orthodoxy of the New School. Some within the Old School, chiefly Princeton theologian Charles Hodge, claimed that there were still ministers within the New School who adhered to New Haven theology. Nevertheless, the Old and New School General Assemblies in the North and a {{majority of}} their presbyteries approved the reunion in 1869 of the PCUSA.|$|E
5000|$|Jesus doesn’t {{guarantee}} everlasting life {{to those}} who are 60% “sure” that He guarantees their eternal destiny. Jesus said, “He who believes in Me has everlasting life” (John 6:47). He guarantees everlasting life {{to those who}} <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> that He fulfills that promise to everyone who believes in Him. When He asked Martha, “Do you believe this?” He was asking her if she <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that the person who lives and believes in Him will never die spiritually. <b>Being</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>is</b> certainty, not some percentage of certainty.

5|$|The Stargazer was to {{originally}} {{be represented}} by the movie-era Enterprise model, but producers <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> to use a design which had appeared on a model in Picard's ready room in the series pilot. Several camera and compositing techniques were used by Bowman in filming the scenes aboard {{the bridge of the}} Stargazer, which was also a re-dressed movie-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge set.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the battle for the Donets, as the spring rasputitsa (mud) season came to an end in 1943, both the German and Soviet commands considered their plans for future operations. The Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union, but they <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> by a number of key commanders, including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgiy Zhukov, to assume a defensive posture instead. This would allow the German side to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions, after which the Soviet forces would be able to respond with a counter-offensive.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{manifesto}} was published, the FBI held many {{press conferences}} asking {{the public to}} help identify the Unabomber. They <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> that the bomber was from the Chicago area (where he began his bombings), had worked or had some connection in Salt Lake City, and by the 1990s {{was associated with the}} San Francisco Bay Area. This geographical information, as well as the wording in excerpts from the manifesto that were released before the entire manifesto was published, persuaded David Kaczynski's wife, Linda, to urge her husband to read the manifesto.|$|E
50|$|Edward <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> the {{phenomenon}} <b>was</b> a sign from God against his endeavors.

5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} similar casualties {{during the}} previous day. Russian victories gave their artillery a clear line of fire into the suburbs of Czyste and Wola. They also strengthened the morale of Russian soldiers, who <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> that the battle was over once Fort 54 fell. The battle was far from lost for the Polish side though: although the Russians could now attack the third line of Polish defences in Wola (Forts 23 and 24) or Czyste (Forts 20–22), their attacks could easily be flanked by forts of the second line still in Polish hands. Also, {{in order to support}} the advance with artillery, the Russian guns would have to be stationed in open field.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1147, the Pope {{authorized}} {{the expansion of the}} crusade into the Iberian peninsula, {{in the context of the}} Reconquista. He also authorized Alfonso VII of León and Castile to equate his campaigns against the Moors with the rest of the Second Crusade. In May 1147, the first contingents of crusaders left from Dartmouth in England for the Holy Land. Bad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast, at the northern city of Porto on 16 June 1147. There they <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> to meet with King Afonso I of Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Mary Wilson's {{brother died}} {{unexpectedly}} {{that night in}} Hull; although {{she and her husband}} did not attend for a second day's racing, they asked all the other guests not to interrupt the plans, and the remainder of the party attended, watching the St. Leger Stakes. During the journey to the racecourse, Lycett Green asked Edward Somerset his advice, telling the peer that several members of the party <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> of Gordon-Cumming's guilt. Edward Somerset decided to consult his cousin, Arthur Somerset, and the two men suggested that Lycett Green inform the prince's senior courtier, Lord Coventry.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{innovations}} of the Dewey Decimal system {{was that of}} positioning books on the shelves {{in relation to other}} books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons, so shelf browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons.|$|E
5|$|Planning for the {{operation}} began in February 1944. In contrast to the other aspects of Bodyguard, Graffham was planned and executed by the British, with no American involvement. Graffham's aim was to convince German intelligence that the Allies were actively building political ties with Sweden, in preparation for an upcoming invasion of Norway. It involved meetings between several British and Swedish officials, {{as well as the}} purchase of Norwegian securities and the use of double agents to spread rumours. During the war, Sweden maintained a neutral stance and it was hoped that if the government <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> of an imminent Allied invasion of Norway this would filter through to German intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Colony did {{not have}} a royal charter authorizing it to form a government, yet some means of {{governance}} was needed. The Mayflower Compact was the colony's first governing document, signed by the 41 able-bodied Separatists aboard the Mayflower upon their arrival in Provincetown Harbor on November 21, 1620. Formal laws were not codified until 1636. The colony's laws were based on a hybrid of English common law and religious law as laid out in the Bible. The colonial authorities were deeply influenced by Calvinist theology, and <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> that democracy was the form of government mandated by God.|$|E

5|$|The British, Americans and Soviet Union {{discussed}} the proposal. British Foreign Secretary (later Prime Minister) Anthony Eden wrote a memo on 26 June outlining the options. The British <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> {{they were dealing}} with a Himmler trick, perhaps an attempt to broker a peace deal without the Soviet Union. If the deal had gone ahead and large numbers of Jews had been released in central Europe, Allied airborne and possibly land-based military operations might have had to stop. Bauer believes the British feared this was Himmler's motive– to turn the Jews into human shields– because it would have allowed the Germans to devote their forces to fighting the Red Army.|$|E
5|$|The Liberals made no new, radical {{proposals}} {{during their}} campaign, but instead ran a quiet campaign with occasional {{attacks on the}} opposition parties. They <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> that the public still supported their party, and that no expensive promises need be made to voters. St. Laurent was made {{the image of the}} nation's prosperity, and the Liberals refused to admit any reason for discontent existed. When Minister of Finance Harris proposed raising the upcoming increase in old age pension by an additional four dollars a month, St. Laurent refused to consider it, feeling that the increase had been calculated {{on the basis of the}} available facts, and those facts had not changed.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Anderson was {{institutionalized}} in {{a mental}} hospital after a suicide attempt in Berlin. At first, she went by the name Fräulein Unbekannt (German for Miss Unknown) as she refused to reveal her identity. Later she used the name Tschaikovsky and then Anderson. In March 1922, claims that Anderson was a Russian grand duchess first received public attention. Most members of Grand Duchess Anastasia's family {{and those who had}} known her, including court tutor Pierre Gilliard, said Anderson was an impostor but others <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> she was Anastasia. In 1927, a private investigation funded by the Tsarina's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, identified Anderson as Franziska Schanzkowska, a Polish factory worker with a history of mental illness. After a lawsuit lasting many years, the German courts ruled that Anderson had failed to prove she was Anastasia, but through media coverage, her claim gained notoriety.|$|E
