5000|$|The {{second type}} of {{steering}} used is steered <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> AGV. This type of steering can be similar to a cars steering. But this is not very manoeuvrable. It is more common to use a three-wheeled vehicle similar to a conventional three wheeled forklift. The drive wheel is the turning wheel. It is more precise in following the programmed path than the differential speed controlled method. This type of AGV has smoother turning. Steered <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> AGV {{can be used in}} all applications; unlike the differential controlled. [...] Steered <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> is used for towing and can also at times have an operator control it.|$|E

50|$|On {{a vehicle}} with {{longitudinal}} leaf springs, {{such as a}} Hotchkiss drive suspension, the springs themselves provide some longitudinal <b>wheel</b> <b>control.</b> One or more torque arms may be added to provide supplementary <b>wheel</b> <b>control,</b> particularly for vehicles with strong torque such as drag racers. On some leaf spring-equipped vehicles, such as 1960s Chrysler Corporation cars, the springs are mounted so that a lesser portion of the spring's length is forward of the wheels, improving <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> on acceleration. A side effect of such positioning is that the longer, aft portion of the springs may not be stiff enough to control wheel movement under braking forces, {{which can lead to}} pronounced wheel hop in hard stops.|$|E

50|$|All <b>Wheel</b> <b>Control</b> (AWC) is {{the brand}} name of a four-wheel drive (4WD) system {{developed}} by Mitsubishi Motors. The system was first incorporated in the 2001 Lancer Evolution VII. Subsequent developments have led to S-AWC (Super All <b>Wheel</b> <b>Control),</b> developed specifically for the new 2007 Lancer Evolution. The system is referred by the company as its unique 4-wheel drive technology umbrella, cultivated through its motor sports activities and long history in rally racing spanning almost half a century.|$|E

50|$|The {{suspension}} is {{a double}} wishbone system with an unusual design. Longitudinal wheel compliance is included without loss of <b>wheel</b> <b>control,</b> which allows the wheel to travel backwards when it hits a bump - increasing {{the comfort of the}} ride.|$|E

The downside is added unsprung weight which can impact handling performance.|$|E
50|$|High {{unsprung}} mass also exacerbates <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> issues under hard acceleration or braking. If the vehicle {{does not have}} adequate wheel location in the vertical plane (such as a rear-wheel drive car with Hotchkiss drive, a live axle supported by simple leaf springs), vertical forces exerted by acceleration or hard braking combined with high {{unsprung mass}} can lead to severe wheel hop, compromising traction and steering control.|$|E

50|$|The revolutionary {{monocoque}} transverse engined {{front wheel}} drive 1959 Austin Mini, that set the template for modern {{front wheel drive}} cars, used front and rear subframes to provide accurate road <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> while using a stiff lightweight body. The 1961 Jaguar E-type or XKE used a tubular spaceframe type front subframe to mount the engine gearbox and long bonnet / hood, to a monocoque 'tub' passenger compartment.|$|E
50|$|Two {{versions}} of the car are offered in the U.S. The Lancer Evolution MR, with 6-speed Twin Clutch Sportronic Shift Transmission (TC-SST). The other version is the GSR which has a 5-speed manual transmission system. The car also has a new full-time four-wheel drive system named S-AWC (Super All <b>Wheel</b> <b>Control),</b> an advanced version of Mitsubishi's AWC system used in previous generations. The S-AWC uses torque vectoring technology to send different amounts of torque to the rear wheels.|$|E
50|$|Wheel speed {{transducers}} in each {{main wheel}} axle induce an AC frequency on the DC voltage input proportionate to the wheel speed as they are driven by the wheels. This frequency is compared to a normal deceleration curve and if it deviates it activates a small torque motor in the affected <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> valve which shunts braking pressure to the return line {{by means of a}} spool valve. As the wheel rotation speed accelerates to normal tolerance limits, normal braking pressure is restored.|$|E

5000|$|S-AWC (Super All <b>Wheel</b> <b>Control)</b> is {{the brand}} name of an {{advanced}} full-time four-wheel drive system developed by Mitsubishi Motors. The technology, specifically developed for the new 2007 Lancer Evolution, is an advanced version of Mitsubishi's AWC system. Mitsubishi first exhibited S-AWC integration control technology in the Concept-X model at the 39th Tokyo Motor Show in 2005. According to Mitsubishi, [...] "the ultimate embodiment of the company's AWC philosophy is the S-AWC system, a 4WD-based integrated vehicle dynamics control system".|$|E
50|$|The third concept i Miev {{based on}} the {{platform}} of the Mitsubishi i, and exhibited at the 40th Tokyo Motor Show in late 2007. In-wheel motors made a return in the front wheels, while a single motor powers the rears. Designed to showcase the sporting potential of zero-emissions vehicles, the i's space efficient exterior design was heavily modified into a more aerodynamic 2+2 fastback silhouette. The company's Super All <b>Wheel</b> <b>Control</b> (S-AWC) system developed for the new Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X was also utilized.|$|E
50|$|The {{house was}} built in 1908; its {{architect}} is not known. It was built for Alvin O. Lombard, a Waterville native, who lived there for {{the last third of}} his life. Lombard is credited with developing an early version of caterpillar tracks, a vehicular propulsion mechanism that eventually saw broad application in a variety of application, most notably in military vehicles and earthmoving equipment. The Lombard Steam Log Hauler was Lombard's effort to capitalize on this invention. He also patented a turbine water <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> mechanism.|$|E

50|$|First {{flown in}} 1923, the OL was a {{high-performance}} amphibian {{with a large}} single hull and stabilizing floats fitted underneath each lower wing. The landing gear was retractable by use of a hand crank in the cockpit, and the plane was equipped with a tailskid for operations on land. It had a tandem open cockpit for a crew of two. The aircraft could be flown from either cockpit, with a <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> in the forward cockpit and a removable stick control in the rear. Navigation and engine instruments were located in the forward cockpit.|$|E
50|$|Inside the Series III {{the changes}} were more evident. Rootes stylists {{completely}} redesigned the seats and interior panels and specified that they be trimmed in single colour vinyl with contrasting piping. For the first time, deep pile carpets were fitted as standard in the foot-wells (previous versions had rubber mats). The steering <b>wheel,</b> <b>control</b> knobs and switches were in black plastic instead of beige. The dashboard, instead of being, as in the earlier cars, padded metal and plastic, was covered in burr walnut veneer surmounted by a padded crash roll fitted with black-faced British Jaeger instruments.|$|E
5000|$|The trucks {{sold for}} US$1,500 {{and had a}} {{planetary}} or selective transmission system complete with [...] "lubrication by splash and oil mixed with the gasoline." [...] As with most early models, the seat was over the engine. The wheelbase was 88 in with standard tread and the vehicle had a Holley carburetor with gravity feed and steering <b>wheel</b> <b>control.</b> It also had a Bosch ignition, fixed control, air-cooling with belt-driven fan, cone clutch and double chain drive from countershaft to dead, rectangular section axle and Brown-Lipe steering gear included. The tires were 36 in by 3 in.|$|E

However, few studies analyse individual <b>wheel</b> torque <b>control</b> integrated with electric vehicle efficiency considerations. The possibilities and {{benefits of}} energy efficient torque vectoring control for electric vehicles with multiple drivetrains are discussed. In particular, energy consumption reductions can be obtained through specific design of the <b>wheel</b> torque <b>control</b> allocation algorithm and the reference yaw rate characteristics.
