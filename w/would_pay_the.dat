5|$|For the {{purposes}} of the program, the traditional 36-month nurse training program was accelerated to a 30-month program. Senior nursing students were required to work for a six-month period in a federal or non-federal hospital, or in other health agency. In return, the federal government <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> schools for the related tuition and fees of the students.|$|E
5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners {{to do something with}} the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. At the time of its demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 Kujau {{visited his}} family in East Germany and {{discovered}} {{that many of the}} locals held Nazi memorabilia, contrary to the laws of the communist government. He saw an opportunity to buy the material cheaply on the black market, and make a profit in the West, where the increasing demand among Stuttgart collectors was raising memorabilia prices up to ten times the amount he <b>would</b> <b>pay.</b> <b>The</b> trade was illegal in East Germany, and the export of what were deemed items of cultural heritage was banned. Among the items smuggled out of East Germany were weapons.|$|E

5|$|In November 1874, several {{shipowners}} were contracted for {{two years}} from the South Australian government to provide ten round trips between the colonial capital of Adelaide and its furthest outpost, Port Darwin. Port Darwin was feeling {{the effects of a}} gold rush at Pine Creek and growing quickly as a trade post with the Dutch East Indies. However, all the local banks sent their money, together with government paperwork and the Royal Mail, around the east coast to Adelaide. On successful completion of each voyage, the South Australian government <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> owners £1000 sterling.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after his death, a legal battle arose over Banks' estate and the {{disposition}} of his body. His estranged widow Elizabeth {{said that he had}} amended his will in October without her knowledge. The new will left all of Banks' assets to his longtime caregiver, Regina Rice. Banks had been diagnosed with dementia shortly before the change in his will. A Chicago funeral home sent Elizabeth a bill for $35,000 in funeral costs, but the bill went unpaid as Elizabeth challenged the legality of Banks' new will. In March 2015, the Chicago Cubs announced that they <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> funeral home costs.|$|E
5|$|The second rule of privity, that a {{third party}} cannot claim {{benefits}} from a contract, was widely criticised by academics, members of the judiciary and legal professionals. One {{problem was that the}} rule made no exceptions for cases where it was obviously intended for the third party to claim a benefit, such as in Beswick v Beswick, where an uncle gave his nephew a business, on the condition that the nephew <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> uncle a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} fine varied {{according}} to the caste in which one belonged. A Shudra <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> eight times <b>the</b> amount of the damage, a Vaishya <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> sixteen times <b>the</b> amount, and a Kshatriya <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> thirty-two times <b>the</b> amount. A Brahmin <b>would</b> generally <b>pay</b> sixty-four times <b>the</b> amount; however, a Brahmin {{could be made to}} pay up to a hundred times the amount of damage. The multiplier was different for each caste, because the mental capacity of the offender and the offender's ability to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> fine were taken into consideration.|$|R

5|$|In Beswick v Beswick {{an uncle}} gifted his nephew a business, on the {{condition}} that the nephew <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> uncle (Mr Beswick) a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow (Mrs Beswick). When the uncle died the nephew refused to pay the widow the money required, arguing that as she was not party to the original agreement she could not benefit from it. The Court of Appeal under Lord Denning tried to use {{this as an opportunity to}} claim that the doctrine of privity was invalid, something the House of Lords rejected. However, the Lords did agree that Mrs Beswick could sue, not as a third party to the contract but as the executrix of her husband's estate. As executrix she would be acting as a representative of Mr Beswick, and the doctrine of privity would not apply.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Green Atlas Shipping and its insurer, Britannia Steam Ship Insurance Association, {{sued the}} United States for US$96million, {{claiming}} negligence {{on the part}} of the Coast Guard due to faulty nautical charts. They also alleged failure {{on the part of}} the local bar pilots to advise the ship's crew not to anchor in the area, and that dredging by the United States Army Corps of Engineers had exacerbated the problems with the anchor. The U.S. countersued for US$7million in damages. In 2004, the two sides reached an agreement in which Green Atlas <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> U.S. US$10.5million to assist with cleanup costs, and the U.S. paid Green Atlas US$4million in settlement of the faulty charts claim. The net result of the settlement was payment of US$6.5million to the U.S. Although this was far less than the damages claimed by the U.S. for environmental cleanup and restoration costs, government officials still saw the settlement as a victory since the shipping company was forced to pay for part of the damage. Some Coos County officials were dissatisfied with the settlement, however, stating that it should have instead been paid to local business owners who were negatively impacted by the closure of the beach.|$|E
5|$|In May 1987, Smith was {{appointed}} manager at Sunderland, {{who had just}} been relegated into the Third Division {{for the first time in}} their history. York were unwilling to release him from his contract for less than £20,000 compensation, and Sunderland would only go as far as pay £10,000. Smith agreed to a £40,000-a-year contract that meant if he failed to win promotion with Sunderland in his first season he <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> extra £10,000 compensation himself. He brought his York coaching staff with him: Viv Busby, Malcolm Crosby, and Roger Jones. He also signed former York player John MacPhail to shore up the defence, who captained the team and scored 16 goals (including 10 penalties) in his maiden season at Roker Park. He signed right-back John Kay, whilst remaining satisfied with existing left-back Reuben Agboola, centre-back Gary Bennett and goalkeeper Iain Hesford. In midfield he played a youthful combination of Gordon Armstrong, Paul Lemon, Gary Owers and Paul Atkinson, alongside the more experienced defensive midfielder Steve Doyle. He sold Mark Proctor to Sheffield Wednesday for £275,000. He signed young and pacey York striker Marco Gabbiadini for £80,000 and played him alongside the experienced Eric Gates; the pair scored 42 goals between them in 1987–88. A 7–0 win over Southend United started a run of 15 league matches unbeaten, though in the second half of the campaign a run of just 2 wins in 10 matches set them back. Smith bought Swansea City winger Colin Pascoe in March 1988, and oversaw a run of seven wins in the final eight matches to secure the Third Division championship and promotion with a record 101 points.|$|E

Old Mr Thorne of Ullathorne offered again to open his arms to him; but he had {{conceived}} a foolish idea that his cousin's severity had driven his brother on to his bad career, and he would consequently accept no kindness from Ullathorne. Miss Thorne, the old squire's daughter--a cousin considerably older than himself, to whom he had at one time been much attached--sent him money; and he returned it to her under a blank cover. He had still enough for those unhappy purposes which he had in hand. As to what might happen afterwards, he was then mainly indifferent.|$|R
