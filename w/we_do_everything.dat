500|$|Lyrical {{themes in}} the song include love, life, and belief. Lead singer Bart Millard {{intended}} the song {{to refer to the}} birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus in each verse. Guitarist Mike Scheuchzer said the song is [...] "a picture of the change we want to see in our own lives. Without love like this, everything <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>everything</b> we are, is in vain." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a {{point of}} honour the band refuses to use playback; they always play live and rehearse before every appearance, {{ensuring}} that no two performances are the same. This was clearly demonstrated in 2002, when the band was booked to appear on UK national TV channel GMTV, where they were to play [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] before being interviewed. The producer was astounded when the band arrived at 5am (three hours early) expecting {{to set up and}} rehearse; it had been assumed they would just mime to playback. Joanne Catherall explained why on air during the interview: [...] "We simply don't sound like we did 20 years ago; it would be wrong if we used tapes, so <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> live." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2014, rapper M.I.A. posted several {{videos on}} her Instagram account during which a remix of [...] "Flawless" [...] was played. Two months later, on May 13, she {{released}} an officially commissioned remix {{of the song}} titled [...] "Baddygirl 2". M.I.A.'s version was produced by Party Squad, contained modified lyrics and samples of Beyoncé's [...] "Diva" [...] and [...] "Run the World (Girls)". It explored elements of trap and EDM music. Some of the reworked lines contained feminist messages and elements of the original song were completely altered. John Walker, writing for MTV News remarked that except the opening lines [...] "I woke up like this/ I went to bed like this/ <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> just like this", the remix doesn't contain [...] "any easily recognizable bits" [...] of the original. Similarly, a writer of Fact magazine noted that Beyoncé {{did not want to}} release the remix as it only contained the same feminist elements of the original. Zach Frydenlund of Complex felt that the reworked version contained M.I.A.'s [...] "intense energy" [...] while Sharan Shetty found a [...] "manic", high-energy sound similar to the rapper's diverse influences. However the latter concluded that the remix [...] "doesn't quite measure up to the original, but... regardless, it's an interesting and head-bopping take". The Guardian editor Alexandra Khan-Anselmo felt that the remix is [...] "good enough to make you want to smash the window of a cop car, pull a Wynona or sneak on to the underground".|$|E

Philosophy complains that Custom has hoodwinked us, from the first; that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> by Custom, even Believe by it; that our very Axioms, let us boast of Free-thinking as we may, are oftenest simply such Beliefs as we have never heard questioned. Nay, what is Philosophy throughout but a continual battle against Custom; an ever-renewed effort to transcend the sphere of blind Custom, and so become Transcendental? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has lived}} to tell it a great many times. She can hardly be kept from telling it yet. But it is my belief that, {{although}} she brought to the work all the anguish of a quickened conscience, {{under the influence of}} the American conditions she had returned to, she suffered far less in her encounters with either of those furnished houses than she now does with our own furniture when she shuts up our house in the summer, and opens it for the winter. But if there had been a clause in the lease, as there should have been, forbidding her to put those houses in order when she left them, life would have been simply a rapture. Why, in Europe custom almost supplies the place of statute in such cases, and you come and go so lightly in and out of furnished houses that you do not mind taking them for a month, or a few weeks. We are very far behind in this matter, but I have no doubt that if we once came to do it on any extended scale we should do it, as <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> else we attempt, more perfectly than any other people in the world.

6000|$|This idea, {{that there}} is some law which makes an {{indirect}} speech more easy than a direct one, is greatly borne out by the cross-correspondences, where circumlocution continually takes the place of assertion. Thus, in the St. Paul correspondence, which is treated in the July pamphlet of the S.P.R., the idea of St. Paul was to be conveyed from one automatic writer to two others, both of whom were at a distance, one of them in India. Dr. Hodgson was the spirit who professed to preside over this experiment. You would think that the simple words [...] "St. Paul" [...] occurring in the other scripts would be all-sufficient. But no; he proceeds to make all sorts of indirect allusions, to talk all round St. Paul in each of the scripts, and to make five quotations from St. Paul's writings. This is beyond coincidence, and quite convincing, but none the less it illustrates the curious way in which they go round instead of going straight. If one could imagine some wise angel on the other side saying, [...] "Now, don't make it too easy for these people. Make them use their own brains a little. They will become mere automatons if <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> for them"--if we could imagine that, it would just cover the case. Whatever the explanation, it is a noteworthy fact.|$|E
6000|$|... "This race of man," [...] {{said the}} old chestnut-tree, [...] "is never ceasing in its restless warfare on Nature. In our forest solitudes {{hitherto}} how peacefully, how quietly, how regularly has everything gone on! Not a flower has missed its appointed time of blossoming, or failed to perfect its fruit. No matter how hard has been the winter, how loud the winds have roared, and how high the snow-banks have been piled, all has come right again in spring. Not the least root has lost itself under the snows, {{so as not to}} be ready with its fresh leaves and blossoms when the sun returns to melt the frosty chains of winter. We have storms sometimes that threaten to shake everything to pieces,--the thunder roars, the lightning flashes, and the winds howl and beat; but, when all is past, everything comes out better and brighter than before,--not a bird is killed, not the frailest flower destroyed. But man comes, and in one day he will make a desolation that centuries cannot repair. Ignorant boor that he is, and all incapable of appreciating the glorious works of Nature, it seems to be his glory to be able to destroy in a few hours what it was the work of ages to produce. The noble oak, that has been cut away to build this contemptible human dwelling, had a life older and wiser than that of any man in this country. That tree has seen generations of men come and go. It was a fresh young tree when Shakespeare was born; it was hardly a middle-aged tree when he died; it was growing here when the first ship brought the white men to our shores, and hundreds and hundreds of those whom they call bravest, wisest, strongest,--warriors, statesmen, orators, and poets,--have been born, have grown up, lived, and died, while yet it has outlived them all. It has seen more wisdom than the best of them; but two or three hours of brutal strength sufficed to lay it low. Which of these dolts could make a tree? I'd like to see them do anything like it. How noisy and clumsy are all their movements,--chopping, pounding, rasping, hammering. And, after all, what do they build? In the forest <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> so quietly. A tree would be ashamed of itself that could not get its growth without making such a noise and dust and fuss. Our life is the perfection of good manners. For my part, I feel degraded at the mere presence of these human beings; but, alas! I am old; a hollow place at my heart warns me of the progress of decay, and probably it will be seized upon by these rapacious creatures as an excuse for laying me as low as my noble green brother." ...|$|E
