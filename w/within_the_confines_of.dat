A mosque was also constructed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> the Qasr al-Basha fortress, which later {{came to be}} known as the Ridwan Castle in light of its function as the Ridwans' residence (ad-Dabawiyya). The fortress itself was outfitted with additional defenses, including arrow slits and narrow openings, which were extended to employ the use of cannon. During Ridwan rule, the Qaysariyyah Market in Gaza's al-Daraj quarter was reconstructed as was the Hamam al-Sammara bathhouse and the former Khan az-Zayt caravansary. Bahram Pasha ordered the construction of the main sabil ("fountain") in Gaza in the mid-16th-century.|$|E
5|$|By 1901 {{there were}} so few rubber plants left in the {{concession}} that the Free State authorities granted permission for the villagers to cut down the remaining plants and grind their bark to retrieve the rubber. Once this process was completed the rubber tax was abolished. The Abir company merged with the Société Anversoise in May 1911 to form the Compagnie du Congo Belge and now focussed on the management of rubber plantations and the gathering of rubber from them. However, later that year it agreed with the Belgian government {{to reduce the size}} of its operations and its monopoly status. In July 1911 it was banned from collecting rubber <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> its old concession for 18 months and was subject to new laws introduced by the Free State. The later history of the company is unknown but it continued to operate until at least 1926 when it split off its oil palm concessions into the Maringa company.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{reference}} {{is part of}} a polemic against the moral decay of Florence, Lombardy, and the Italian Peninsula as a whole; Dante, through his characters, chastises German King Albert I for neglecting his responsibilities towards Italy ("you who are negligent"), and successive popes for their encroachment from purely spiritual affairs, thus leading to a climate of incessant bickering and warfare between rival political parties in Lombardy. History records the name of the family Montague as being lent to such a political party in Verona, but that of the Capulets as from a Cremonese family, both of whom play out their conflict in Lombardy as a whole rather than <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> Verona. Allied to rival political factions, the parties are grieving ("One lot already grieving") because their endless warfare has led to the destruction of both parties, rather than a grief from the loss of their ill-fated offspring as the play sets forth, which appears to be a solely poetic creation within this context.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit {{spending}} and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing to stay <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards. This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels {{through a combination of}} techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.|$|E

5|$|The German Army entered Vilnius on 24 June 1941, as part {{of their}} {{invasion}} of Russia in World War II. After their arrival, Gens was put in charge of the Jewish hospital. The occupying authorities ordered the creation of the Judenrat, or Jewish Council, with community-selected members. In early September 1941, the Germans murdered most of the Judenrat, which left the Jewish community leaderless before and during the relocation of the Jews into two ghettos in Vilnius. During this period, the hospital sheltered several prominent Jews from Vilnius. When the ghettos were formed, the Jewish hospital was included <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> the larger ghetto, an unusual arrangement for a Nazi-period ghetto. Most ghettos were organized to exclude any Jewish hospitals, forcing the inhabitants to either do without a hospital or set up a makeshift one.|$|E
5|$|The German army {{concentrated}} its {{attack on}} the First, Second and Third Forts, which were the complex's oldest structures. The army did not surround the entire fortress, and its defense was able to regroup and resupply. On August 8, the Germans intensified their bombardment, but the fortress garrison withstood several attempts to breach the defensive perimeter. Several days afterward, the bombardment of the fortress reached its peak; its defenders sustained heavy casualty rates of 50% to 75%. On August 14, over 1,000 defending troops were killed, but the Germans were unable to completely overcome the fortress' defenses. However, on the next day, Gamma-Gerät shells destroyed the First Fort and the Germans transferred their attentions to the Second Fort. The fight was now <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> the greater fortress complex.|$|E

They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an appendage {{on either side of}} the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons. The pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. When ready to emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.|$|E

5|$|Sultan Ali {{spent his}} last years in Umbai, Malacca, and {{supported}} {{himself with a}} small monthly stipend which the British East India Company had granted him. He built a palace for himself and lived with his third wife, Cik' Sembuk {{until his death in}} June 1877, and was buried in a Mausoleum <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> the Umbai mosque. Shortly before his death, Sultan Ali willed the Kesang territory to Tengku Mahmood, his 11-year-old son with Cik' Sembuk. His decision was met with considerable disproval among the some Malays in Singapore, who felt that Tengku Alam should be the heir to the Kesang territory as he was the oldest son with Daing Siti, who was the daughter of a Bugis nobleman, while Cik' Sembuk was a commoner. At the time of Sultan Ali's death, custody of the Kesang territory lay in the hands of Ungku Jalil, Sultan Ali's elder brother. Ungku Jalil handed over the custodianship of the Kesang territory to Maharaja Abu Bakar, after the British government held an election for the Temenggong Paduka Tuan of Muar and the territory's chieftains to decide on the destiny of the Kesang territory, and voted unanimously for Maharaja Abu Bakar as their leader. The British Governor handed over administrative charge of the Kesang territory over to the Maharaja, which upset Tengku Alam and many of his supporters. Their continued claims to the Kesang territory led to the instigation of the Jementah Civil War in 1879.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} destruction caused to {{the city}} by the tornado was to the town's business district, a three-block stretch of Main Street between First and Fourth Street lined with stores, offices and tenements built of brick and stone. Because of the direction the storm had approached the city from and the angle at which it entered the city, the tornado virtually swallowed the entire business district. It was here that {{a large majority of}} the fatalities occurred, as many of those who thought they would be safe <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> the reinforced structures were killed by cascades of falling debris as the buildings on Main Street were swept away. A 1.5-ton safe from the city bank was thrown a full block away. Probably one of the greatest demonstrations of the tornado's strength was seen at the Nicollet Hotel, a newly constructed three-story brick building located adjacent to the Willow River. The tornado swept the building clean down to the foundation, killing at least five people. Almost simultaneously, the town's Methodist Church was completely obliterated, the only remnant being the 1.1-ton cast iron bell, which was found nearly 200 feet from the church foundation. As the tornado cleared Main Street, it tore the iron-frame bridge spanning the Willow River from its fitting and onto the adjacent riverbank in a twisted heap. The City Hall was completely flattened, the adjacent water tower sent toppling to the northeast and dumping its contents into First Street and transforming it into a muddy deluge. The tornado then moved into the east side of New Richmond, where many of the city's working class residents lived. As many as forty homes in this neighborhood were completely obliterated, leaving the neighborhood virtually unrecognizable. Within a period of roughly seven to ten minutes, over half of New Richmond was laid to ruins.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{slavery was}} to be {{regulated}} under the new Constitution {{was a matter of}} such intense conflict between the North and South that several Southern states refused to join the Union if slavery were not to be allowed. Delegates opposed to slavery were forced to yield in their demands that slavery practiced <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> the new nation be completely outlawed. However, they continued to argue that the Constitution should prohibit the states from participating in the international slave trade, including in the importation of new slaves from Africa and the export of slaves to other countries. The Convention postponed making a final decision on the international slave trade until late in the deliberations because of the contentious nature of the issue. During the Convention's late July recess, the Committee of Detail had inserted language that would prohibit the federal government from attempting to ban international slave trading and from imposing taxes on the purchase or sale of slaves. The Convention could not agree on these provisions when the subject came up again in late August, so they referred the matter to an eleven-member committee for further discussion. This committee helped work out a compromise: Congress would have the power to ban the international slave trade, but not for another twenty years (that is, not until 1808). In exchange for this concession, the federal government's power to regulate foreign commerce would be strengthened by provisions that allowed for taxation of slave trades in the international market and that reduced the requirement for passage of navigation acts from two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress to simple majorities.|$|E

40|$|In my opinion, Mishima's {{earliest}} stories can {{be classified}} into two categories: stories of yearning and those of self-recognition. These two categories have, at the first glance, {{nothing to do with}} each other and therefore, some critics once doubted the integrity and consistency of Mishima as a writer. The stories of yearning are fantastic with a strong romantic coloring, and those of self-recognition are in the style of "I-Novel" (Shishosetsu), based on the writer's actual existence and temperament. These apparently differnt genres of stories, are,however, closely interrelated witd each other <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>confine</b> <b>of</b> Mishima's imagination, because with him yearning originates from self-recognition and vice versa: to put it more concretely, a recognition of infirmity and poor physique in himself gave, as its counteraction, birth to a yearning to something romantic, tragic and far-away...|$|R
