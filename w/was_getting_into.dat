She had been vacationing in London at the time, but fell as she <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> a taxi, and died a few days later in a London hospital. An autopsy report revealed that her death was not related to the earlier fall. On receiving news of her death, the University of Texas declared two days of mourning and flew the flag at half-staff.|$|E

Allegedly he had tried to steal 76 {{kilograms}} of Ecstasy in 2002. According to the indictment, Moshe Malul and fugitive Vineland Boyz′ member Luis Sandoval, were at the scene when Atias was shot, but another man had pulled the trigger.

5|$|Though Wiggins did {{not give}} up hope {{for a return to}} baseball, he began to study the {{real-estate}} market after his suspension from the game. In the late 1980s, Wiggins began to suffer from health difficulties related to AIDS, though the diagnosis was not publicly disclosed while he was alive. He was receiving deferred payments from his baseball career, and he began to make plans for the financial future of his children. He told one of his former teammates that he <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> computer work. Gwynn said that he had seen Wiggins in the spring of 1990 and was struck by his visible weight loss.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1918 Dyer {{was awarded}} a points victory over Frankie Mack in Boston, which he {{followed}} up with another win this time over Terry Brooks. At {{the start of the}} Brooks fight, as Dyer <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> the ring, he was handed a telegram informing him that he had been appointed as a boxing instructor for the National Army. Dyer had been refused admission into the British and American Armies on account of the broken cartilage in his right knee. Dyer was eventually based at Camp Grant in Illinois, but fought one more bout, a win over Walter Butler of Boston before beginning his commission. Dyer did not fight outside the armed forces {{during the rest of the}} war, but he proved successful in his role as camp boxing instructor with Camp Grant performing well in boxing tournaments. Dyer also continued his charity work, singing and boxing in front of the public and the armed forces.|$|E

500|$|The {{read-through}} of [...] "The Power of Three" [...] {{took place}} at Roath Lock, Cardiff on 27 April 2012. It was filmed by itself in the series' third production block. Because of this schedule, it was the final episode Gillan and Darvill filmed as Amy and Rory. Their last scene filmed together <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> the TARDIS with the Doctor after saying farwell to Brian; when the doors closed Gillan, Darvill, and Smith hugged and started crying. Some exterior scenes at Amy and Rory's house were re-shot in June and July 2012, with Darvill briefly returning for the June re-shoot. Producer Marcus Wilson stated that a [...] "hundred" [...] individual cube props were made, with [...] "many more" [...] added with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Amy and the Doctor's conversation outside the Tower of London could not be filmed at the genuine location due to the London Olympics, so it was shot on studio in Cardiff and the live action was combined with other footage to create the illusion. The episode also features cameos from physicist Brian Cox and Lord Sugar, {{both of whom were}} long-time fans of the program. Sugar's cameo was in fact filmed on the set of The Apprentice, with director Douglas Mackinnon standing in for the person who was fired.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{contains}} {{a wide range}} of musical styles, which the authors Barry Miles and Gillian Gaar each view as the most diverse of any of the group's albums. These styles include rock and roll, blues, folk, country, reggae, avant-garde, hard rock and music hall. The production aesthetic ensured that the album's sound was scaled-down and less reliant on studio innovation, relative to all the Beatles' releases since Revolver. The author Nicholas Schaffner viewed this as reflective of a widespread departure from the LSD-inspired psychedelia of 1967, an approach that was initiated by Bob Dylan and the Beach Boys and similarly adopted in 1968 by artists such as the Rolling Stones and the Byrds. Edwin Faust of Stylus Magazine described The Beatles as [...] "foremost an album about musical purity (as the album cover and title suggest). Whereas on prior Beatles albums, the band <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> the habit of mixing several musical genres into a single song, on The White Album every song is faithful to its selected genre. The rock n' roll tracks are purely rock n' roll; the folk songs are purely folk; the surreal pop numbers are purely surreal pop; and the experimental piece is purely experimental." ...|$|E
500|$|In an August 2008 {{interview}} with AbsolutePunk, McKinnon said the band {{were planning to}} start recording once the tour with New Found Glory had finished, [...] "So Oct & Nov." [...] McKinnon said that having Wade, who had previously worked on the band's other albums, on production duties, was {{a way for the}} album to have [...] "A Day To Remember-type feel". Wade also recorded the band's demos for the album, {{in the back of a}} bus. The album itself was recorded at Wade's The Wade Studio, in Ocala, Florida, after the Easycore Tour had finished. Gilbert was touring with New Found Glory in Europe at the time, but with video conferencing he was able to offer input about the record. In September 2008, a demo appeared on the band's MySpace page, entitled [...] "Wax Larry". [...] Documenting the recording process, the band released several webisodes on YouTube, under the name The Real ADTR: Homesick in Ocala, which had been called a spoof of The Real World. The webisodes were aided by director Drew Russ, as guitarist Neil Westfall states: [...] "When he [...] was telling us in the beginning that he <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> video stuff, and we were like 'Well that's kinda crazy 'cause we need a video guy to do these webisodes for us'. And as we started talking he really kinda got our sense of humor". While in the middle of recording Homesick, A Day to Remember released Old Record.|$|E

500|$|In February 2003, Case {{temporarily}} {{exited the}} show {{as a result of}} lengthy contract negotiations. Instead of having the character depart permanently (or be killed off), executive producer David Shaughnessy chose to have her leave town after issues with her marriage to Nick. While away, Sharon becomes suicidal; Case explained that Sharon's life had fallen apart and she left town to commit suicide, drinking herself into [...] "a complete stupor". Travelling to Denver, she meets (and has an affair with) businessman Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby), who physically abuses her. In April, Case signed a new contract with the show. Executive producer and head writer at the time John F. Smith said that upon Sharon's return to Genoa City, she wants to keep where she was a secret. That December, Sharon is horrified when Cameron arrives in town for apparent business with Newman Enterprises. Smith stated that the story with Cameron and Sharon would be one that [...] "builds quickly into a lot of drama". Explaining their relationship, Ashby revealed that Cameron and Sharon were [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and hooked up, but Cameron becomes abusive, with Ashby calling him [...] "really disturbing". Cameron blackmails Sharon into meeting him at a motel. When she arrives they have a physical altercation in which Sharon throws a bottle at him to keep him from raping her, [...] "killing" [...] him (or so she believes). Australian magazine TV Soap noted that [...] "sweet, demure" [...] Sharon had become a murderer. After driving around with his body in her car trunk for days, she dumps it in an alley. Sharon's former friend, Grace, returns to town; she discovers Cameron alive, and nurses him back to health. Detective Weber (Sherman Augustus) is suspicious of Sharon's involvement in Cameron's disappearance. Sharon begins [...] "hallucinating" [...] with visions of Cameron's [...] "ghost" [...] (which is actually him, alive). Case noted that Sharon <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> deeper trouble by making mistakes [...] "trying to do the right thing".|$|E

Damon Gough tried to approach Amos backstage to say hello, but was pushed back repeatedly by one of her minders. As he was on before Amos on the Pet Sounds stage later that evening, a clearly irked Gough reportedly said [...] "Tori Amos can wait" [...] as his set ran over, and Amos's crew began setting up around him. When he tried again to approach her backstage as she <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> a car, he was again pushed back and [...] "banged the car's bonnet" [...] and [...] "threw his Jack Daniels against the windscreen".|$|E

It was later revealed that Minogoue would bring a limited numbers of shows to her home country, stating, [...] "The reason I hadn't confirmed dates in Australia is I really didn't know what I <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> [...] But now I know".|$|E

2500|$|The first {{challenge}} Maclean faced <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> {{military service}} at all. His Foreign Office job was a reserved occupation, {{so he was}} not allowed to enlist. [...] The only way around this was to go into politics, and on this stated ground Maclean tendered his resignation in 1941 to Alexander Cadogan, an FO mandarin. Maclean immediately enlisted, taking a taxi from Sir Alexander's office to a nearby recruiting station, where he joined the Cameron Highlanders, his father's regiment, as a private. Later, his erstwhile employers discovered that his resignation had been merely a ruse or legal fiction along the lines of taking the Chiltern Hundreds. Maclean was thus forced to run for office and, despite his self-confessed inexperience, was chosen as a Conservative candidate, and eventually elected MP. Prime Minister Winston Churchill jocularly accused him of using [...] "the Mother of Parliaments as a public convenience".|$|E
2500|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{of attacks on}} rail and communications began in the autumn 1944. The Luftwaffe could not prevent {{the destruction of the}} city Kassel's electricity supply ending Krupp Gusstahlfabrik (Cast Steel Works) contribution to the war on 23 October 1944. This type of direct attack was unable to stop production altogether. Attacks on communications came closest to achieving this goal. The Dortmund-Ems canal was drained by an attack in September 1944. The huge marshalling yard at Hamm was damaged and its capacity reduced by 75%. Between 14 and 18 October, the rail shipments of coal from the Ruhr ended completely. By early October 1944, only one train in 50 <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> the Ruhr in the first place. The lack of iron ore caused a drop in steel production of 66%. Some [...] had been dropped on these targets. It was enough to bring near total collapse between November 1944 and January 1945.|$|E
2500|$|Götz von Berlichingen {{spent three}} years in [...] "knightly custody" [...] in Heilbronn {{starting}} in 1519 and even spent a night in the tower of the bastion. That same year people first took note of the pub owner Jäcklein Rohrbach who with accomplices would later kill the executor of Böckingen. After he had {{spent some time in}} the Hohenlohe Plains and collected similarly minded characters around him, he returned to Heilbronn in April 1525 just as the German Peasants' War <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> full swing. On April 16 the peasants killed many of the nobles in Weinsberg and on April 18 the Heilbronn cloister of the Order of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel was attacked and ransacked. The city opened its gates in response to demands of the peasants and consequently more churches and municipal institutions were robbed the next day. For about a month Heilbronn remained under the control of revolting peasants. And even though Johann Lachmann, later a church reformer, had attempted to mediate, the peasants did not leave the city until one of their armies was defeated on May 12, 1525 in Böblingen. Their leader Rohrbach was executed on May 21, 1525 in Neckargartach and his home town of Böckingen was partially burnt to the ground in punishment.|$|E
