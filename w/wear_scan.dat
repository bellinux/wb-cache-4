40|$|AbstractFor {{environmental}} reasons, {{as well as}} {{the dwindling}} source of petroleum, a new class of environmentally acceptable and renewable biolubricants based on plant oils is available. Even though plant oils possess excellent lubricant-related properties, there are some concerns about using it as biolubricant base oil. In this study we present a series of structures derived from oleic acid to be used as synthetic biolubricant basestocks. Measuring of pour point (PP), flash point, viscosity index (VI), oxidation onset temperature (OT) and signal maximum temperature (SMT) was carried out for each compound. Furthermore, the friction and wear properties were measured using a high-frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR). The resulting product structures were confirmed by NMR and FTIR spectroscopic analysis. The results showed that ethylhexyl 9 -(octanoyloxy) - 10 -(behenoxy) octadecanoate with behenyl mid-chain ester exhibited the most favorable low temperature performance (PP − 48 °C) and ethylhexyl 9 -(octanoyloxy) - 10 -(octyloxy) octadecanoate octyl mid-chain ester exhibited higher oxidation stability (OT 142 °C) than the other synthetic ester oils. On the other hand, the highest ball <b>wear</b> <b>scan</b> diameter was obtained for ethylhexyl 9 -(octanoyloxy) - 10 -(behenoxy) octadecanoate while the lowest value was obtained for 9 -hydroxy- 10 -octyloxyoctadecanoic acid. Overall, it was concluded that these synthetic ester oils have potential in formulation of industrial fluids for different temperature applications...|$|E
40|$|A stereotaxic frame worn during {{computed}} tomographic (CT) scanning of {{the head}} produces landmarks in each section {{that are used to}} relate section coordinates to frame coordinates. A small, commercially available, programmable calculator is used to interrelate frame and CT section geometry. The system can be used with any CT scanner that can specify (x,y) coordinates of a pixel, obviating the need for extensive modifications of the CT computer software. Representative clinical cases are pre-sented. Several investigators have desc ribed methods for using computed tomography (CT) to direct stereotaxic neurosurgical procedures [1 - 6]. These methods require patient fi xation to the CT scanner to insure that the CT sections obtained will be parallel to one another or parallel to the base of a stereotax ic fram e <b>worn</b> during <b>scanning.</b> An alternate technique is to incorporate a landmark-prod ucing appa-ratus into the stereotaxic frame.

40|$|Several {{cases of}} tibial post {{breakage}} {{are reported in}} the literature. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, only three cases of NexGen knee prosthesis (Zimmer, Warsaw, Indiana, USA) tibial post failure have been reported. In November 1999, a 63 -year-old Caucasian woman from Italy with a history of symptomatic left knee osteoarthritis underwent a total knee arthroplasty. In March 2008, while rising from a chair, she felt a sudden pain and instability in her left knee. She reported a fracture of the polyethylene post of the tibial insert. No malposition or malalignment of either the femoral or tibial components were identified. The polyethylene tibial insert was studied under light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The fracture was also noted to have occurred without any notable polyethylene <b>wear.</b> <b>Scanning</b> electron microscopy revealed two different damage patterns that could be explained with a two-stage rupture of our patient's polyethylene post. This could have been caused by a non-optimal ligamentous balancing during first implant surgery.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a lubricant greatly depends on the additives it involves. However, recently used additives produce severe pollution when they are burned and exhausted. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} develop a new generation of green additives. Graphene oxide (GO) is considered to be environmentally friendly. The scope {{of this study is to}} explore the fundamental tribological behavior of graphene, the first existing 2 D material, and evaluate its performance as a lubricant additive. The friction and wear behavior of 0. 5 wt% concentrations of GO particles in ethanol and SAE 20 W 50 engine oil on a hypereutectic Al- 25 Si alloy disc against steel ball was studied at 5 N load. GO as an additive reduced the wear coefficient by 60 – 80 % with 30 Hz frequency for 120 m sliding distance. The minimum value of the coefficient of friction (0. 057) was found with SAE 20 W 50 + 0. 5 wt% GO. A possible explanation for these results is that the graphene layers act as a 2 D nanomaterial and form a conformal protective film on the sliding contact interfaces and easily shear off due to weak Van der Waal's forces and drastically reduce the <b>wear.</b> <b>Scanning</b> electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and Raman spectroscopy were used for characterization of GO and wear scars...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to detail and assess the {{capability}} of a novel methodology to 3 D-quantify tooth wear progression in a patient over a period of 12 months. Materials and Methods: A calibrated stainless steel model was used to identify the accuracy of the scanning system by assessing the accuracy and precision of the contact scanner and the dimensional accuracy and stability of casts fabricated from three different types of impression materials. Thereafter, the overall accuracy of the 3 D scanning system (scanner and casts) was ascertained. Clinically, polyether impressions were made of the patient’s dentition at the initial examination and at the 12 -month review, then poured in type IV dental stone to assess the tooth wear. The anterior teeth on the resultant casts were scanned, and images were analyzed using 3 D matching software to detect dimensional variations between the patient’s impressions. Results: The accuracy of the 3 D scanning system was established to be 33 μm. 3 D clinical analysis demonstrated localized wear on the incisal and palatal surfaces of the patient’s maxillary central incisors. The identified wear extended to a depth of 500 μm with a distribution of 4 % to 7 % of affected tooth surfaces. Conclusion: The newly developed 3 D scanning methodology was found to be capable of assessing and accounting for the various factors affecting tooth <b>wear</b> <b>scanning.</b> Initial clinical evaluation of the methodology demonstrates successful monitoring of tooth wear progression.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to develop}} a tooth wear index capable of objectively {{classifying}} and quantifying the progression of tooth wear using accurate 3 D scanning data of tooth wear in patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: a 3 D tooth <b>wear</b> <b>scanning</b> protocol, aimed at in-vivo monitoring of tooth wear progression, was developed and assessed using a calibrated reference model. The methodology involved taking polyether impressions of the dentition, pouring impressions in Type IV stone and scanning the resultant casts using a 3 D contact-scanner. Thereafter, eleven tooth wear patients were recruited (n= 130 teeth) with participants’ dentitions scanned initially and after twelve months. The resultant 3 D scan data, demonstrating depth, surface area and distribution of tooth wear, were analysed and employed to formulate a novel 3 D tooth wear index. RESULTS: all study-participants demonstrated ≥ 140 µm of tooth wear {{over a period of}} twelve months. All participants had one or more teeth with ≥ 260 µm tooth wear. However, the wear affected surface area was ≤ 4 % in the majority of scanned teeth (n= 104 / 130). Based on clinical data, the proposed 3 D scanning index classifies tooth wear according to depth (Grade 1 : 140 – 260 µm, Grade 2 : 260 – 380 µm and Grade 3 : 380 - > 500 µm), surface area (Class A: 0 - 4 %, Class B: 4 - 8 % and Class C: ≥ 8 %), and distribution (Localised tooth wear: affecting ≤ 30 % of teeth with Grade 1 or more wear-depth. Generalised tooth wear: affecting > 30 % of teeth with Grade 1 or more wear-depth). CONCLUSION: the proposed tooth wear index offers an objective means to clinically assess and monitor tooth wear progression in patients using quantitative 3 D scan data acquired through a standardised, calibrated and repeatable scanning protocol...|$|R

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) {{studies were carried out}} to reveal the morphology, distribution and secondary confirmation of ZrB 2 particles in the matrix. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis was done to reveal the crystal structure, interfacial characteristics and dislocations around the ZrB 2 particles. Hardness of composites improved significantly as compared to base alloy. Dry sliding wear and friction study of composites was carried out at room temperature on pin-on-disc apparatus. The results revealed that cumulative weight loss of both the base alloy and composites shows a linear relationship with sliding distance, however, change in slope is observed at certain intervals. Wear rate decrease with formation of in-situ ZrB 2 particles and improves as the reinforcement amount increases, whereas, coefficient of friction of composites follows a reverse trend.

40|$|Abstract. Aluminum {{silicon carbide}} Metal Matrix Composites (Al-MMC) {{are widely used}} in {{aeronautical}} and automobile industries due to their excellent mechanical and physical properties. However the harder reinforcement particles make machining difficult. Tool wear occurs more quickly and reduces {{the life of the}} tool. This paper presents the experimental investigation on turning A 356 matrix metal reinforced with 20 % by weight of Silicon carbide (SiC) particles, fabricated in house by stir casting. Fabricated samples were turned on medium duty lathe with Poly crystalline Diamond (PCD) inserts of 1300 and 1500 grade exposed to various cutting conditions. Parameters such as power consumed by main spindle, machined surface roughness and tool <b>wear</b> are studied. <b>Scanning</b> Electron Microscope (SEM) images support the result. It is evident that, surface finish, and power consumed are good for 1500 grade when compared with 1300 grade at higher cutting speed and tool wear is strongly dependent on the abrasive hard reinforcement particles...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The role of phenol {{formaldehyde}} or phenolic resin as a binder in friction composites assumes paramount significance because the structural {{integrity of the}} composites depends on it. The resin properties {{as well as its}} content are critical parameters that strongly influence the overall performance of friction composites. In the present paper the influence of alkyl benzene modified phenolic resin on fade and recovery behavior of friction composites is reported and compared with straight phenolic resin. Six non–asbestos friction composites were developed in the laboratory by varying the content of modified resin and unmodified resin viz., 10, 12. 5, and 15 % by weight compensating this variation by inert filler BaSO 4 to keep concentration at 40 %. The concentration of other ingredients was kept constant. Compared to unmodified phenolic resin, modified phenolic resin improved the physical and mechanical properties of composites not friction and <b>wear</b> performance. A <b>scanning</b> electron microscope was used to analyze the wear mechanisms...|$|R
