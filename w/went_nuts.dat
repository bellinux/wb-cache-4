500|$|Abbey Road was {{recorded}} on professional eight-track reel to reel tape machines {{rather than the}} four-track machines that were used for earlier Beatles albums such as Sgt Pepper, {{and was the first}} Beatles album not to be issued in mono. The album makes prominent use of the Moog synthesizer, and the guitar played through a Leslie speaker. The Moog is not merely as a background effect but sometimes playing a central role, as in [...] "Because" [...] where it is used for the middle eight. It is also prominent on [...] "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" [...] (played using a ribbon strip) and [...] "Here Comes the Sun". The instrument was introduced to the band by Harrison who acquired one in November 1968 and subsequently used it to create his Electronic Sound album. Starr made more prominent use of the tom-toms on Abbey Road, later saying the album was [...] "tom-tom madness ... I <b>went</b> <b>nuts</b> on the toms." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with music webzine Pitchfork, Robyn was asked if [...] "Fembot" [...] represented a dislike for the notion that humans and robots are separate, and she responded by saying, [...] "The classic, dystopian theory about the future is not really as interesting to me. Like the book I, Robot is all about these robots that basically <b>went</b> <b>nuts,</b> and it's always because they were wrongly programmed by humans. It's like a mirror of our own psyche. It's almost like the wrong program could be a mental disease." [...] She elaborated that [...] "Fembot" [...] is not [...] "really about the future or about space or anything", {{saying that it is}} about the present time. [...] "Technology is becoming more organic, and using the word 'fembot' or 'robot' in a song makes things more human to me", she said. In {{an interview}} with music website Stereogum, she explained that the song also chronicles her personal experience of [...] "turning 30 and contemplating children". She elaborated, saying, ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] {{has been}} {{performed}} more than 600 times by U2. It was first heard by a live audience in December 1982 in Glasgow, Scotland, on a twenty-one show [...] "Pre-War Tour." [...] The band were particularly nervous about playing {{the song in}} Belfast, Northern Ireland. Introducing the song there at the Maysfield Leisure Centre, Bono stated [...] "It's not a rebel song.", attempted to further clarify this point by reciting the entire second verse ("Broken bottles under children's feet ..."), and added as a final note, [...] "If you don't like it, you let us know." [...] The crowd overwhelmingly enjoyed the song; the Edge recalls that [...] "the place <b>went</b> <b>nuts,</b> it drew a really positive reaction.", also saying that [...] "We {{thought a lot about}} the song before we played it in Belfast and Bono told the audience that if they didn't like it then we'd never play it again. Out of the 3,000 people in the hall about three walked out. I think that says a lot about the audience's trust in us." [...] The band remained apprehensive, however. Even by the song's sixth performance, Bono was introducing the song with the statement [...] "This song is not a rebel song." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Us Weekly, Makeba Riddick, who assisted with the song's vocal production, spoke about {{the inspiration for the}} song. Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song, and had been working with Stargate to develop it. Upon hearing it, Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed, and sent it to Riddick for completion. Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from: [...] "I was listening to the words and me and [...] and we were just laughing and talking about so many situations that have happened in the past and that happen to women everywhere. By the time we were done of course, we were laughing and giggling about the lyrics [...] surprisingly everybody <b>went</b> <b>nuts</b> over the song." [...] Dean explained the development of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] in {{an interview}} with The Boom Box, and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song's lyrics. Dean praised Rihanna's ability to take risks with her music, saying [...] "I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won't say. Even if she says let's go kiss some girls, who really cares...that's Rihanna. Music is about fantasy. This is what people want to do, but are afraid to do." ...|$|E

"And {{it is here}} too, {{that we have to}} go {{on record}} and say that the Corvair is— in our opinion— the most {{important}} new car of the entire crop of '65 models, and the most beautiful car to appear in this country since before World War II." [...] "When the pictures of the '65 Corvair arrived in our offices, the man who opened the envelope actually let out a great shout of delight and amazement on first seeing the car, and in thirty seconds the whole staff was charging around, each wanting {{to be the first to}} show somebody else, each wanting the vicarious kick of hearing that characteristic war-whoop from the first-time viewer." [...] "Our ardor had cooled a little by the time we got to drive the cars— then we <b>went</b> <b>nuts</b> all over again. The new rear suspension, the new softer spring rates in front, the bigger brakes, the addition of some more power, all these factors had us driving around like idiots— zooming around the handling loop dragging with each other, standing on the brakes— until we had to reluctantly turn the car over to some other impatient journalist... The '65 Corvair is an outstanding car. It doesn't go fast enough, but we love it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regardless, Clooney was {{determined}} {{to stay with the}} role. Loyal to the script, Clooney helped convince executives to support certain aspects of the film (such as the exploding cow scene) even after he was urged to drop out of production, as his contract called for his compensation with or without his decision to stay in the film. After a number of arguments, Clooney wrote Russell a letter that criticized Russell's behavior in a last attempt to make peace between the two, days before another fight would break out during the filming of the movie's finale. In it, the three lead characters attempt to escort Iraqi rebels across the border to Iran. There were a number of actors and extras in the scene, as well as other elements, such as helicopters flying overhead and landing {{in the center of the}} location. The fight began after an extra was having difficulty throwing Ice Cube's character to the ground. After a number of takes, Russell came to the extra and put him through the motions of the action. Some individuals present on the set during the incident state that Russell was simply showing the extra how to convincingly act in the scene. However, Clooney and others thought that Russell had violently thrown the extra to the ground. Clooney recalls: [...] "We were trying to get a shot and then he went berserk. He <b>went</b> <b>nuts</b> on an extra." [...] Clooney approached Russell and began criticizing him again, coming to the extra's defense. The two began shouting at one another before entering a physical fight. Second assistant director Paul Bernard was so fed up with the experience when the fight broke out that he put down his camera and walked off the set, effectively quitting. Clooney concludes, [...] "Will I work with David ever again? Absolutely not. Never. Do I think he's tremendously talented and do I think he should be nominated for Oscars? Yeah." [...] Russell offered a different view, saying [...] "we're both passionate guys who are the two biggest authorities on the set," [...] and maintaining that the two continue to be friends. Ice Cube felt the conflict helped the film, saying [...] "it kind of kicked the set into a different gear where everybody was focused and we finished strong. I wouldn't mind if the director and the star got into an argument on all of my movies." ...|$|E

We were lucky that Bitsadze, being so big was getting tired, he had fought for a whole minute and a half.
