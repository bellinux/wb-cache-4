5000|$|A fourth method, also {{available}} in English, is using zijn (to be) with the adverb and preposition bezig met (busy with) and the gerund, e.g., Ik ben bezig met lezen (lit. I <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> with reading), meaning I <b>am</b> (<b>busy)</b> reading. If there is an object, there are two forms: 1. the gerund is preceded by the neuter article het and followed by the preposition van (of) and the object, e.g. Ik ben bezig met het lezen van deze brief (lit. I <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> with the reading of this letter), meaning I am reading this letter; 2. the object comes before the full infinitive (instead of the gerund), e.g. Ik ben bezig met deze brief te lezen (lit. I <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> with this letter to read), meaning I am reading this letter. This form of the continuous is mostly used for a real (physical) activity. Grammar-wise, {{it is possible to}} say zij is bezig te denken (lit. she <b>is</b> <b>busy</b> to think, she is thinking) or hij is bezig te slapen (lit. he <b>is</b> <b>busy</b> to sleep, he is sleeping), but it sounds strange in Dutch. In these cases, other forms of the continuous are generally used, specifically the second method: Zij is aan het denken and hij is aan het slapen.|$|R

5|$|Cavalera Conspiracy {{entered the}} studio in April 2010 to begin {{recording}} the follow-up to their 2008 debut album, Inflikted. In May 2010, the band finished recording with producer Logan Mader in co-production with Max. Cavalera Conspiracy recruited their touring bassist Johny Chow to play bass on the album, as former member Joe Duplantier <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> with Gojira's next album. Upon finished recordings, Roadrunner Records {{confirmed that the}} band's new album would not be released until early 2011.|$|E
5|$|Ensemble Studios worked {{together}} with Big Huge Games to develop The Asian Dynasties, Age of Empires IIIs second expansion. This {{was the first}} joint venture for both teams. The reason for them doing so was compatible schedules: Ensemble Studios <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> with other projects—particularly Halo Wars—while Big Huge Games' real-time strategy team had few projects at that time. Big Huge Games {{did most of the}} work, but Ensemble Studios designers Greg Street and Sandy Petersen joined in the brainstorming, and had control over the final product. Both studios had roles in testing the game before its release.|$|E
5|$|For Your Eyes Only {{marked a}} change in the {{production}} crew: John Glen was promoted from his duties as a film editor to director, a position he would occupy for the next four films. Since Ken Adam <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> with the film Pennies from Heaven, Peter Lamont, who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger, was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion from Glen, Lamont created realistic sets, instead of the elaborate scenery for which the series had been known.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Jarre {{was invited}} by the musical {{director}} of the Houston Grand Opera to perform a concert celebrating Texas's 150th anniversary on 5 April 1986. Although he <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> with other projects and was at first unimpressed by the proposal, on a later visit to the city, he was immediately impressed by the visual grandeur of the city's skyline and agreed to perform. Also, 1985 marked the 25th anniversary of {{the foundation of the}} Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center; and NASA asked Jarre to integrate the anniversary into the concert.|$|E
5|$|Kvale {{hoped that}} {{his friend and}} fellow Minnesotan, Senator Henrik Shipstead, could persuade {{sculptor}} Gutzon Borglum to design the medal for no fee or a nominal one.

Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, a member of the Commission of Fine Arts, was engaged for a fee of $1,500, about the usual for a commemorative coin.|$|E
5|$|Produced by Manson and {{newcomer}} Tyler Bates, who Manson {{met through}} their mutual {{involvement in the}} TV series Californication, The Pale Emperor eschews the band's usual industrial rock style {{in favor of a}} sparser, blues rock-influenced sound. The album features drummer Gil Sharone, formerly of Stolen Babies and The Dillinger Escape Plan. It was the first album since his return to the band in 2008 to not include songwriting or performance contributions from bassist Twiggy, who <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> with his own projects. The album is dedicated to Manson's mother, who died of Alzheimer's disease during production.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Eno's {{previous}} albums, {{which were}} recorded {{in a very short}} time, Before and After Science was two years in the making. During this two-year period, Eno <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> working on his solo ambient music albums Music for Films and Discreet Music. Due to the very positive critical reception accorded his previous rock music-oriented album Another Green World, Eno was afraid of repeating himself but still wanted to release a high-quality product.|$|E
5|$|As 1953 began, Ferrier <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> rehearsing for Orpheus, an English {{language}} version of Orfeo ed Euridice to be staged in four performances at the Royal Opera House in February. Barbirolli had instigated this project, with Ferrier's enthusiastic approval, some months previously. Her only other engagement in January was a BBC recital recording, {{in which she}} sang works by three living English composers: Howard Ferguson, William Wordsworth and Edmund Rubbra. During her regular hospital treatment she discussed with doctors the advisability of an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries), but on learning that the impact on her cancer would probably be insignificant and that her voice might be badly affected, she chose {{not to have the}} operation.|$|E

5|$|Charles X Gustav then granted Frederick William full {{sovereignty}} in the Duchy of Prussia {{in return for}} military aid, and in the Treaty of Radnot allied himself with the Transylvanian George II Rákóczi who invaded Poland–Lithuania from the southeast. John II Vasa found an ally in Leopold I of Habsburg, whose armies crossed into Poland–Lithuania from the southwest. This triggered Frederick III of Denmark's invasion of the Swedish mainland {{in the spring of}} 1657, in an attempt to settle old scores from the Torstenson War while Sweden <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> elsewhere.

5|$|Dean's other {{dream is}} a major {{turning point in the}} character's storyline, after which he starts gaining self-respect and realizes that he truly wants to live. He begins the season with little self-worth, and the writers {{realized}} that this outlook stems from his father, John Winchester. Initially, they planned to have Jeffrey Dean Morgan reprise his role as John, who would browbeat Dean within the dreamscape. When they learned that Morgan <b>was</b> <b>busy</b> filming Watchmen, the writers instead found inspiration in the junkyard scene from the film Superman III, in which good and evil versions of Superman confront one another. Kripke noted, however, that the conversation between the two Deans still focuses on John.|$|E
5|$|Des McAnuff {{replaced}} Mann as director, and filming was {{rescheduled to}} December 1994.

The budget {{was estimated at}} $20 million. McAnuff stepped down as director {{and was replaced by}} Dennis Hopper. Hopper was a close friend with Dean and co-starred with the actor in both Rebel Without a Cause and Giant. Hopper met with DiCaprio for the lead role, but the director eventually dropped out of the film. By May 1995, DiCaprio was still the top candidate to portray Dean with Milčo Mančevski in discussions to direct the film.|$|E
