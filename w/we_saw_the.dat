Of course, Mongols would have mutton fat and why not use that for oil! The caravan leader assured us that he had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot of it was warming over the fire. We poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way.|$|E

500|$|More than 750 {{slaves were}} rescued in the Combahee River Raid. Newspapers heralded Tubman's [...] "patriotism, sagacity, energy, [...] ability", {{and she was}} praised for her {{recruiting}} efforts – most of the newly liberated men went on to join the Union army. Tubman later worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She described the battle by saying: [...] "And then <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> lightning, {{and that was the}} guns; and then we heard the thunder, and that was the big guns; and then we heard the rain falling, and that was the drops of blood falling; and when we came to get the crops, it was dead men that we reaped." ...|$|E
500|$|During the tour, filmmaker Baz Luhrmann {{commissioned}} Radiohead {{to write}} a song for his upcoming film Romeo + Juliet and gave them the final 30 minutes of the film. Yorke said: [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> scene in which Claire Danes holds the Colt [...]45 against her head, we started working on the song immediately." [...] Soon afterwards, the band wrote and recorded [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)"; the track plays over the film's end credits but was excluded from the soundtrack album at the band's request. The song helped shape {{the direction of the}} rest of the album; Yorke said it [...] "was the first performance we'd ever recorded where every note of it made my head spin—something I was proud of, something I could turn up really, really loud and not wince at any moment." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{exploding}} pustules {{were carefully}} rigged to burst on command. Makeup supervisor Toby Lindala constructed a handheld device that connected via tube to the faux sores. When {{the device was}} pressed, the pustule would burst. Filming the scenes was particularly arduous; he later noted [...] "I was jammed underneath one of the bus seats with these extras basically stepping on my head." [...] The X-Files director Frank Spotnitz remarked, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> pustule bursting on film, we just laughed {{because it was just}} so over-the-top grotesque." [...] The Costa Rican forest at the opening was shot at the Seymour Demonstration Forest in Northern Vancouver, which also served as Puerto Rico in season opener [...] "Little Green Men". The city of Delta served for both the gas station and the bus station—actually a redecorated Dodge/Chrysler car dealership.|$|E

500|$|The exact date of {{the burning}} of the monastery is not known for certain. On April 27 1915, a message sent [...] "To Americans, or any Foreign Consul" [...] by Clarence Ussher and Ernest Yarrow, American missionaries in Van, said that [...] "From our window we could plainly see Shushantz afire on its mountain-side and Varak Monastery, with its priceless store of ancient manuscripts, going up in smoke." [...] However, a fellow missionary, Elizabeth Barrows Ussher, Clarence Ussher's wife, wrote in her diary that the monastery was {{attacked}} by 200 cavalry and foot soldiers on April 30, but they were repulsed. She gave May 4 as the day the monastery was burned. Another missionary teacher Grace H. Knapp recounted, however, that [...] "On the 8th May <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> place in flames, and Varak Monastery near by, with its priceless ancient manuscripts, also went up in smoke." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{somewhat}} rare occasions, {{a thunderstorm}} can become stationary or nearly so while prolifically producing hail and significant depths of accumulation do occur; this tends {{to happen in}} mountainous areas, such as the July 29, 2010 case of a foot of hail accumulation in Boulder County, Colorado. On June 5, 2015, hail up to four feet deep fell on one city block in Denver, Colorado. [...] The hailstones, described as between the size of bumble bees and ping pong balls, were accompanied by rain and high winds. [...] The hail fell in only the one area, leaving the surrounding area untouched. [...] It fell for {{one and a half}} hours between 10 p.m. and 11:30p.m. A meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder said, [...] "It's a very interesting phenomenon. [...] <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> storm stall. It produced copious amounts of hail in one small area. It's a meteorological thing." [...] Tractors used to clear the area filled more than 30 dump-truck loads of hail.|$|E
500|$|The {{occupation}} of Serbia by the Central Powers pained Bojić {{far more than}} the everyday struggles of the exodus itself. He is said to have slept very little, telling Živadinović: [...] "You don't realize what you are missing by sleeping. In circumstances like these, the entire soul must be kept constantly awake. Whole centuries have never painted such a vast fresco. Never has death been so greedy, nor heroes so indifferent to it." [...] In December 1915, Bojić reached Shëngjin with the others and reunited with his fiancée. Živadinović recalled: [...] "I shall never forget the day that <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> sea. Only then did Bojić begin to speak about the future. He was making plans for a vast novel in verse, for comedies, dramas, tragedies, all intended to bring the great events of our history back to life." [...] Upon reaching the coast, Bojić was told that he could not board the ship to Italy because he was of fighting age. His fiancée was allowed to board and his fifteen-year-old brother was judged to be too young for military service and granted passage as well. Unable to go with them, Bojić and his companions continued {{down the length of the}} Albanian coast until they reached Corfu, where the Allies had sent ships to transport the remnants of the Serbian Army to the Greek mainland.|$|E

500|$|Character shading {{supervisor}} on {{the film}} Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges {{on the film}}, saying: [...] "Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning {{as much as we}} could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone." [...] Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: [...] "Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for Cars we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN {{gave the}} episode a 7.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} a [...] "good" [...] episode. He was positive towards the Logan and Keith storylines, writing [...] "the other main storylines, featuring Logan and Keith, were nice ones for the respective characters," [...] calling the half-brother plotline [...] "interesting". On the advancing of the rapist plot, Goldman praised the increase in Veronica's personal involvement with the case, while continuing to criticize the portrayal of the feminists in the episode. [...] "At this point, neither we, nor Veronica, seem to be meant to have nearly any sympathy for them. And yet, shouldn't we all naturally be able to connect more to a group of girls who are passionately seeking to stop a serial rapist on campus?" [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave the episode a very positive review, lauding the Logan's half-brother storyline, calling it [...] "Top quality stuff. I loved the moment when Veronica realized Logan's brother was an imposter and in the next scene <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> two guys surfing together. So much suspense!" [...] Television Without Pity gave [...] "Charlie Don't Surf" [...] a [...] "B+". The reviewer was very positive towards the plot involving Logan and his supposed half-brother, writing, [...] "since Logan actually knows how to find Charlie in person, perhaps this all doesn't have to be quite as tragic as it's coming off. Still, in my opinion? Best episode of the season so far." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Second Test in Melbourne, O'Reilly {{opened the}} bowling as Australia opted {{to use only}} one pace bowler on a turning pitch. After Australia had made only 228, O'Reilly trapped Bob Wyatt leg before wicket (lbw) before bowling both the Nawab of Pataudi and Maurice Leyland to leave England at 4/98. He later took two {{tail-end}} wickets to end with 5/63 and secure Australia a first innings lead. Defending a target of 251, O'Reilly bowled the leading English opener Herbert Sutcliffe for 33 with a textbook perfect leg break that pitched on leg stump and clipped {{the top of the}} off stump. According to English team manager Plum Warner, Sutcliffe had never been defeated so comprehensively. O'Reilly also removed Hammond on the way to ending with 5/66 and securing a 111-run win. The ten-wicket haul was O'Reilly's first at Test level and the start of his strong career record over the English. However, Australia were not to taste further success. The controversial [...] "fast leg theory" [...] bowling used by England under newly appointed captain Douglas Jardine brought the touring team victories in the last three matches: Australia were handicapped not only by the tactics, but also by a lack of quality fast bowlers; O'Reilly also opened the bowling in both the Third and Fourth Tests in Adelaide and Brisbane respectively due to the selection of only one paceman. He was hindered by a decline in the form of Grimmett, who was dropped after the Third Test. O'Reilly took 2/83 and 4/79 in Adelaide, collecting the wicket of Sutcliffe for single figures in the first innings of a match overshadowed by near-riots after captain Bill Woodfull was struck in the heart. Australia were crushed by 338 runs, and lost the series in Brisbane. After O'Reilly had taken 4/101—including Sutcliffe and Jardine—in the first innings to keep Australia's first innings deficit to 16, the hosts collapsed to be 175 all out. O'Reilly took one wicket in the second innings of a six-wicket loss. The final Test in Sydney took a similar course; O'Reilly took 4/111 in the first innings including Sutcliffe and Jardine again, as the tourists took a 14-run lead before completing an eight-wicket win after another Australian collapse. O'Reilly was wicketless in the second innings and bowled 72 overs in total in the match. Reflecting on the performance of O'Reilly in the series, R Mason said [...] "here <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> first flexing of that most menacing genius".|$|E
