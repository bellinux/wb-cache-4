500|$|The International Olympic Committee {{commissioned}} a song by Björk specially for the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. The singer {{revealed that the}} committee asked her to do a kind of [...] "Ebony and Ivory" [...] or [...] "We Are the World" [...] type of song, which are [...] "smashing tunes" [...] according to her, but she thought, [...] "'Maybe there's another angle to this'. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to write an Olympic lyric, though, {{it was full of}} sports socks and ribbons. I ended up pissing myself laughing". Then, she called Sjón, an Icelandic poet who had previously collaborated with her on songs such as [...] "Bachelorette" [...] from her fourth studio album Homogenic (1997). When she said to him that they would need something [...] "suitably epic" [...] for the Olympics, the poet even took a short course about Greek mythology at Reykjavík University. [...] "Oceania" [...] was the last song recorded for Medúlla. Björk said about the song: [...] "I am incredibly honoured to have been asked to write a song and sing it at the Olympics. The song is written {{from the point of view}} of the ocean that surrounds all the land and watches over the humans to see how they are doing after millions of years of evolution. It sees no borders, different races or religion which has always been at the core of these [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Ralf Schumacher said, [...] "I'm {{more than}} happy; {{we have been}} strong here the whole weekend and my car behaved perfectly. I had a little moment of worry about six laps from the end when the {{throttle}} didn't seem to pick up properly and I thought the engine was going to stop, but it came back and all was well." [...] Schumacher added that his team was confident of securing third in the Constructors' Championship; although he could not match Häkkinen's pace, he praised the team for his car's set-up. Coulthard was disappointed with his fourth-place finish, and thought his team's decision to call him into the pit lane after his competitors cost him the victory; however, he remained confident about his championship chances. Button was also disappointed to finish fifth: [...] "It was a bad race for me, if not the worst. The car was working well at the start, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to pass Jarno I went in a bit late." [...] Trulli refused to criticise Button after the race, believing that Button made a mistake. Fisichella and Verstappen felt similarly about their lap-nine collision, with Fisichella saying that he [...] "felt sorry" [...] for Verstappen and describing his weekend as [...] "disastrous". Verstappen said that he struggled with his car's balance, which resulted in oversteer. He was [...] "happy to go home", because [...] "it's not been a good weekend." [...] Frentzen said that although {{he was happy to}} score points, he had hoped for a better finish.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1995, {{he became}} suicidal after {{deciding}} he had [...] "had enough". He stated, [...] "I just felt {{more people were}} against me. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to be friendly toward them, they just walked away". Although he had previously been {{little more than a}} social drinker, his alcohol consumption increased and, although he had not consumed any alcohol on that day, had especially escalated in the six months prior to the massacre. Bryant's average daily consumption was estimated at half a bottle of Sambuca and a bottle of Baileys Irish Cream supplemented with Port wine and other sweet alcoholic drinks. According to Bryant, he thought the plan for Port Arthur may have first occurred to him four to twelve weeks before the event.|$|E

He didn’t move. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They glared at me with a mean look and I was very frightened and didn’t know what to do. I turned around and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer. Somebody started yelling, [...] "Drag her over this tree! Let's take care of that nigger!'" ...|$|E
