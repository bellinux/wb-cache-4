50|$|Pre-treatment is a {{necessary}} step in raisin production to ensure the increased rate of water removal during the drying process. A faster <b>water</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> decreases the rate of browning and helps to produce more desirable raisins. The historical method of completing this process {{was developed in the}} Mediterranean and Asia Minor areas by using a dry emulsion cold dip made of potassium carbonate and ethyl esters of fatty acids. This dip was shown to increase the rate of water loss by two- to three-fold.Recently, new methods have been developed such as exposing the grapes to oil emulsions or dilute alkaline solutions. These methods can encourage water transfer to the outer surface of grapes which helps to increase the efficiency of the drying process.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel process for drying {{chlorine}} by {{formation of a}} clathrate hydrate. Liquid chlorine is dried in a rotor-stator spinning disc (RSSD) heat exchanger, which has heat transfer coefficients up to 10 kW/m 2 /K, independent of the flow rate. Benefits of this novel drying process are (1) compactness of the spinning disc heat exchanger, minimizing material investments, (2) blocking of the equipment by the adhesive hydrates is prevented by the rotation, and (3) no chlorine contamination by drying agents, e. g., sulfuric acid or zeolite. Batch and RSSD experiments were performed with dichloromethane as a model compound for liquid chlorine. Lower crystallization temperatures result in shorter induction times of the hydrate formation and thus faster <b>water</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rates.</b> Higher mass transfer rates at higher rotation speeds have the same effect.

40|$|Baker's yeast drying {{experiments}} in a conical spouted bed {{are used to}} characterize the effects of operating conditions on drying behavior. A novel multiscale model, describing Baker's yeast drying in a conical spouted bed, is presented; {{it is based on}} an intrinsic drying model developed for a single pellet, combined with a gas–solid flow model developed for a conical spouted bed. The resulting phenomenological model, which has only one adjustable parameter, is in good agreement with the experimental results. The model is capable of adequately predicting the drying rate of Baker's yeast pellets during the entire drying period in a conical spouted bed: from the beginning, where the <b>water</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> is limited by the air saturation with vapor during its residence time in the bed; to the end, where the <b>water</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> is dictated by internal resistance within the yeast pellets. The quality of dried Baker's yeast was characterized by measuring the gassing power in bread dough. This parameter was monitored during the conical spouted bed drying experiments. It was found that yeast degradation is linked to intracellular water removal (type D, end of the drying below a moisture content of around 0. 5 (d. b.)) and it is mostly the rate of this water removal that controls the final quality of the product. Intercellular water removal (type E, beginning of the drying) was found to have no significant influence on yeast degradation.

40|$|Excessive water {{formation}} {{inside the}} polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell’s structures {{leads to the}} flooding of the cathode gas diffusion layer (GDL) and cathode gas flow channels. This results in {{a negative impact on}} water management and the overall cell performance. Liquid water generated in the cathode catalyst layer and the water moved from anode to cathode side due to electro-osmotic drag transport through the GDL to reach the gas flow field channels, where it is removed by air cathode gas stream. Due to high and uniform capillary force distribution effect of the pores through the GDL plane and surface tension between the water droplets and gas flow field channels surfaces, liquid water tends to block/fill the pores of the GDL and stick {{to the surface of the}} GDL and gas flow channels. Therefore, it is difficult to remove the trapped water in GDL structure which can lead to flood of the PEM fuel cell. The GDL surfaces are commonly treated uniformly with a hydrophobic material in order to overcome the flooding phenomena inside PEM fuel cell. Despite the importance impact of the surface wettability of both channel and GDL surface characteristics especially for the cathode side on the water management, few experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of the two-phase flow in cathode gas flow channel and their crucial role. The work presented in this thesis covers contributions that provide insight, not only into the investigation of the effects of hydrophobic cathode GDL and cathode gas flow channels, on water removal, two phase flow inside the channel, and on PEM fuel cell performance, but also the superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic GDLs and gas flow channels effects. Further, the effects of a novel GDL designs with sandwich and gradient wettability with driving capillary force through GDL plane have been investigated. Two-phase flow especially in the cathode gas flow field channels of PEM fuel cell has a crucial role on water removal. Hence, in this research, ex-situ investigations of the effects of channels with different surface wettability; superhydrophobic, hydrophobic, slightly hydrophobic, and superhydrophilic on the two-phase flow characteristics have been tested and visualized at room temperature. Pressure drop measurements and two-phase flow visualization have been carried out using high speed camera. The effect of the various coating materials on graphite and GDL surface morphology, roughness, static contact angle (θ), and sliding contact angle (α) have been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Profilometry, and sessile drop technique, respectively. It has been observed that the two-phase flow resistance is considerably affected by surface wettability of the channels. Further, the overall cell performance can be improved by superhydrophobic gas flow channels mainly at high current density over slightly hydrophobic and superhydrophilic cases tested. In addition, sandwich wettability GDL has been coated with a silica particle/ Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite. The porometric characteristics have been studied using, method of standard porosimetry (MSP). It has been found that sandwich wettability GDL has superhydrophobic surfaces with (θ = 162 ± 2 °), (α = 5 ± 1 °), and the internal pores are hydrophilic, while the mean pore radius is 7. 1 μm. This shows a low resistance to gas transport. On the other hand, performance testing indicates that (PEM) fuel cell equipped with sandwich wettability GDL results in the best performance compared to those with raw (non-coated) (slightly hydrophobic), PTFE coated (commercial with micro-porous layer (MPL)) (superhydrophobic), and silica coated (superhydrophilic) GDL. The wettability gradient has been introduced through plane of the one side hydrophobic GDL by coating one side of non-coated GDL with 15 wt. % of PTFE solution; however, the other side remains uncoated. The effects of wettability gradient on the <b>water</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate,</b> droplet dynamics, and PEM fuel cell performance have been covered in this thesis. <b>Water</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> is determined using a 20 ml syringe barrel, wherein a 13 mm diameter GDL token is fixed on the barrel opening.

The results indicated overall virus <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> in the dark ranging from 1. 8 to 6. 2 % h− 1 and production rates in the dark ranging from 1. 9 to 6. 1 % h− 1, corresponding to turnover times of virus populations of 1 to 2 days, even in oligotrophic offshore <b>waters.</b> Virus <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> determined by the FLV tracer method were compared to rates of virus degradation, determined at the same locations by radiolabeling methods, and were similar even though the current FLV method is suitable for only dark incubations. Our results support previous findings that virus impacts on bacterial populations may be more important in some environments and less so in others. This new method can be used to determine rates of virus degradation, production, and turnover in eutrophic, mesotrophic, and oligotrophic waters and will provide important inputs for future investigations of microbial food webs...|$|R
40|$|Water removal during drying {{depends on}} the pathway of water {{migration}} from food materials. Moreover, the <b>water</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> also {{depends on the}} characteristics of the cell wall of plant tissue. In this study, the influence of cell wall properties (such as moisture distribution, stiffness, thickness and cell dimension) on porosity and shrinkage of dried product was investigated. Cell wall stiffness depends on a complex combination of plant cell microstructure, composition of food materials and the water-holding capacity of the cell. In this work, a preliminary investigation of the cell wall properties of apple was conducted in order to predict changes of porosity and shrinkage during drying. Cell wall characteristics of two types of apple (Granny Smith and Red Delicious) were investigated under convective drying to correlate with porosity and shrinkage. A scanning electron microscope (SEM), 2 kN Intron, pycnometer and ImageJ software were used in order to measure and analyse cell characteristics, water holding capacity of cell walls, porosity and shrinkage. The cell firmness of the Red Delicious apple was found to be higher than for Granny Smith apples. A remarkable relationship was observed between cell wall characteristics when compare with heat and mass transfer characteristics. It was also found that the evolution of porosity and shrinkage are noticeably influenced {{by the nature of the}} cell wall during convective drying. This study has revealed a better understanding of porosity and the shrinkage of dried food at microscopy (cell) level, and will provide better insights to attain energy-effective drying processes and improved quality of dried foods...|$|E
40|$|First American Scientific Corporation (FASC) has {{developed}} a unique and innovative grinder/dryer called KDS Micronex. The KS (Kinetic Disintegration System) combines two operations of grinding and drying into a single operation which reduces dependence on external heat input. The machine captures the heat of comminution and combines it will centrifugal forces to expedite moisture extraction from wet biomass. Because it uses mechanical forces rather than providing direct heat to perform the drying operation, it is a simpler machine and uses less energy than conventional grinding and drying operations which occur as two separate steps. The entire compact unit can be transported on a flatbed trailer to the site where biomass is available. Hence, the KDS Micronex is a technology that enables inexpensive pretreatment of waste materials and biomass. A well prepared biomass {{can be used as}} feed, fuel or fertilizer instead of being discarded. Electricity and chemical feedstock produced from such biomass would displace the use of fossil fuels and no net greenhouse gas emissions would result from such bio-based operations. Organic fertilizers resulting from the KS Micronex grinding/drying process will be pathogen-free unlike raw animal manures. The feasibility tests on KS during Phase I showed that a prototype machine can be developed, field tested and the technology demonstrated for commercial applications. The present KDS machine can remove up to 400 kg/h of water from a wet feed material. Since biomass processors demand a finished product that is only 10 % moist and most raw materials like corn stover, bagasse, layer manure, cow dung, and waste wood have moisture contents of the order of 50 %, this <b>water</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> translates to a production rate of roughly half a ton per hour. this is too small for most processors who are unwilling to acquire multiple machines because of the added complexity to the feed and product removal systems. The economics suffer due to small production rates, because the labor costs are a much larger fraction of the production cost. The goal for further research and development work is to scale up the KDS technology incorporating findings from Phase I into a machine that has superior performance characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. The purpose of this work is {{to develop and implement}} a simple and robust preservation technology that can enhance food and economic security and thereby improve the lives of people in developing countries. The technique under development is termed “solar assisted pervaporation (SAP) ”. It is a sustainable technology whereby fruit juices or purées are concentrated using reusable pouches made of “breathable textiles”. The active layer of the textile is permeable to water vapour but not liquid water, and the process is related to the techniques pervaporation and membrane distillation. The pouches are filled with the juice/purée, hung from a tree or placed on a roof or in a solar dryer, and then exposed to sun and air for a specified period of time. A storage stable concentrate can be produced within 10 to 45 hours (depending on the conditions) and the entire concentration process is done using only solar energy. The fruit juice concentrate can be stored in the household or sold, thereby increasing both food and economic security in local communities. To demonstrate the feasibility of this technique, three different fruits/juices were concentrated by placing prototype pouches in a convective dryer to simulate a ventilated solar collector, or by exposing the pouches to a solar lamp equipped with convective air circulation to simulate ambient drying with direct sunlight exposure. Drying curves were obtained experimentally and the concentrates were analysed in terms of moisture content, water activity and degrees Brix. Depending on the drying time and type of fruit, the resulting product can be syrup-like, pasty, or have the texture of fruit leather. Under certain drying conditions, the <b>water</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> is actually higher for the pouch versus an open dish of the same dimensions because the pouch has two sides for mass transfer. Horizontal drying was found to be more effective than vertical drying and dissolved solids content was found to affect drying rate. Initial tests with a solar lamp have shown that drying rate increases with increasing radiant energy flux. It was also found that composition (fiber vs. sugar content) and form (purée vs. juice) of the fruit determines its compatibility with the pouch and drying technique. The results indicate that the technique is feasible and have given insight into how the bag should be designed. dc 201...|$|E
40|$|Freeze-drying is a low-pressure, {{low-temperature}} condensation pumping process {{widely used}} {{in the manufacture of}} pharmaceuticals for removal of solvents by sublimation. Key performance characteristics of a freeze-dryer condenser are largely dependent on the vapor and ice dynamics in the low-pressure environment. The main objective of this work is to develop a modeling and computational framework for analysis of vapor and ice dynamics in such freeze-dryer condensers. The direct Simulation Monte Carlow (DSMC) technique is applied to model the relevant physical processes that accompany the vapor flow in the condenser chamber. Low-temperature water vapor molecular model is applied in the DSMC solver SMILE to simulate the flowfield structure. The developing ice front is tracked based on the mass flux computed at the nodes of the DSMC surface mesh. Verification of ice accretion simulations has been done by comparison with analytical free-molecular solutions. Simulations of ice buildup on the coils of a laboratory-scale dryer have been compared with experiments. The comparison shows that unsteady simulations are necessary to reproduce experimentally observed icing structures. The DSMC simulations demonstrate that by tailoring the condenser topology to the flow-field structure of the water vapor jet expanding into a low-pressure reservoir, it is possible to significantly increase <b>water</b> vapor <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> and improve the overall efficiency of freeze-drying process...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Aluminum Nitride (AlN) ceramic {{materials}} have high thermal conductivity and electrical insulation, prompting consideration of their {{use as a}} semiconducting material. Although AlN should be machined with a high accuracy of form and dimension to achieve products and components with requisite precision, mechanical and other machining methods such as the laser method cannot be used because of the brittleness and high thermal conductivity of AIN. Recently, we have succeeded in machining many insulating ceramics by sinking (SEDM) and Wire-Electrical Discharge Machining (WEDM) with the assisting electrode method. We have already machined many insulating {{ceramic materials}} such as Si 3 N 4, ZrO 2 and Al 2 O 3. However, inferior machining characteristics were obtained with AlN than with other materials. In this study, the effects of several electrical discharge conditions were examined to obtain better machining properties, such as high material <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> and a low electrode wear ratio. It was found that machining time decreased {{with an increase in}} capacitance, while the electrode wear ratio increased. The electrode wear ratio of the W electrode was low, suggesting that it is suited for accurate machining of AlN. Additionally, the electrically conductive layer was analyzed using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). As a result, the architectural component of the EDMed AlN surface is considered mostly Al that is resolution of the workpiece. Therefore, in the EDM of AlN using the assisting electrode method, machinability using deionized water may be superior to dielectric oil. To investigate the effect of the dielectric working fluid, AlN was machined using deionized water and dielectric oil. In the case of machining with deionized <b>water,</b> the <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> was faster and electrode wear ratio was lower, compared to dielectric oil...|$|R
