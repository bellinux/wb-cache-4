5|$|Although {{all of the}} B-29s {{were named}} as shown, the only nose art applied to the {{aircraft}} before the atomic bomb missions was that of Enola Gay. With the exceptions of Victors 71 and 94, the others were applied some time in August 1945.

5|$|Chris Carter {{had envisioned}} Lance Henriksen portraying the {{character}} of Frank Black, long before he <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> contacted.

Four of this order were redesignated as service test vehicles, and an additional eight production aircraft were soon ordered as well.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham {{moved to}} Auckland in 1902, and played his club rugby for City, before joining Ponsonby the {{following}} season.

The New Zealanders used a different scrum formation than seen today, and only one lock <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> required.|$|E
5|$|Despite its popularization {{in later}} times, the phrase is not {{recorded}} elsewhere in Roman history. Historians question whether it <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> {{used as a}} customary salute. It was more likely an isolated appeal by desperate captives and criminals condemned to die, and noted by Roman historians in part for the unusual mass reprieve granted by Claudius to the survivors.|$|E
5|$|Despite what {{officials}} {{described as}} an extraordinarily concentrated collection effort {{leading up to the}} operation, no U.S. spy agency <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> able to capture a photograph of bin Laden at the compound before the raid or a recording of the voice of the mysterious male figure whose family occupied the structure's top two floors.|$|E

A permit for the construction of a Syriac church was granted in December 2012, however, it was refused by the Assyrian community since the land used to be a Latin cemetery.|$|E
5|$|During {{one of the}} cutscenes of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall is impaled by the Edea in battle. This {{created a}} theory that Squall dies in battle. When asked about this, Kitase laughed at this and denied this theory. However, he found it {{interesting}} if a remake of the game <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> proposed and the staff would think of changing elements from the story.|$|E
5|$|East of 63rd Drive–Rego Park on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, bellmouths {{were built}} for a {{proposed}} {{connection to the}} LIRR's Rockaway Beach Branch. They may be used if the Rockaway Beach Branch <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> reused for subway service.|$|E
