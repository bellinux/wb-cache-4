5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{economic}} realities of the conversion to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films {{went to great lengths}} to belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take advantage of their built-in following.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Actual Fantasy was {{recorded}} {{with a digital}} drum computer. Arjen had for some time <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> tracks would sound like with a real drummer, and as his collaborations with Gorefest drummer Ed Warby became more consistent over the years, the exciting yet intimidating idea developed. To remix the album in 5.1, certain sections had to be re-recorded, as they {{were lost in the}} subsequent eight years - this made the idea of using drums for the entire album an increasingly viable option.|$|E

500|$|On June 9, the Emperor's confidant Marquis Kōichi Kido wrote a [...] "Draft Plan for Controlling the Crisis Situation," [...] {{warning that}} by the end of the year Japan's ability to wage modern war would be {{extinguished}} and the government would be unable to contain civil unrest. [...] "... We cannot be sure we will not share the fate of Germany and be reduced to adverse circumstances under which we will not attain even our supreme object of safeguarding the Imperial Household and preserving the national polity." [...] Kido proposed that the Emperor take action, by offering to end the war on [...] "very generous terms." [...] Kido proposed that Japan withdraw from the formerly European colonies it had occupied provided they were granted independence, that Japan disarm provided this not occur under Allied supervision, and that Japan for a time be [...] "content with minimum defense." [...] Kido's proposal did not contemplate Allied occupation of Japan, prosecution of war criminals or substantial change in Japan's system of government. With the Emperor's authorization, Kido approached several members of the Supreme Council, the [...] "Big Six." [...] Tōgō was very supportive. Suzuki and Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, the Navy minister, were both cautiously supportive; each <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> other thought. General Korechika Anami, the Army minister, was ambivalent, insisting that diplomacy must wait until [...] "after the United States has sustained heavy losses" [...] in Operation Ketsugō.|$|E

He replied to Grant's further message with an evasive answer {{in which he}} said he merely <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> terms would be if he surrendered, not that the time had come for that. He offered to meet Grant on the stage road at the rear of his army at 10:00a.m. on April 9. Lee {{realized}} he would know by then if his army could escape and, if not, he would have no alternative but to surrender the army or face its annihilation.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, San Francisco Supervisor Tom Ammiano {{came into}} {{conflict}} with some in San Francisco's Catholic community when the Board of Supervisors, at Ammiano's request, granted the Sisters a permit to close a block of Castro Street for their 20th anniversary celebration on Easter Sunday, that included a [...] "Hunky Jesus" [...] contest among other activities. [...] San Francisco's archdiocese requested the event be moved to another day. The city's Interfaith Council suggested the following Sunday, which was the Eastern Orthodox Easter. An Archdiocese newspaper compared the Sisters' event to neo-Nazis celebrating on the Jewish holiday of Passover. The controversy sparked a flurry of responses in The San Francisco Chronicles Letters to the Editor. The Anti-Defamation League wrote to reply that such a characterization was offensive and [...] "trivializes the horrific actions of hate groups" [...] while others reflected offense at the sacrilege of the Sisters' actions and other writers merely <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fuss was about. The resulting attention ensured a crowd of 5,000 attendees and what the Sisters {{claimed to be a}} million dollars of free publicity. In actuality, the event raised about $13,000 for the Tenderloin AIDS Resource Center and the San Francisco LGBT Community Center, among various groups.|$|E
