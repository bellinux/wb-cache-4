Throughout his childhood and teenage years, Mark's father would have him combine athletic and mental training. Mark would have to dribble a basketball <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it while reciting multiplication tables; practice baseball swings in a batting cage while answering questions about the periodic table and similar combined drills that his father hoped would develop quick thinking and self-confidence that would guide Mark {{in all areas of}} life and not simply sports.|$|E
5|$|The rough idea {{of these}} inapproximability results is {{to form a}} graph that {{represents}} a probabilistically checkable proof system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable proof system, a proof is represented as a sequence of bits. An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid proof {{if and only if}} it is satisfiable. The proof is checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial-time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses to examine a small number of randomly chosen positions of the proof string. Depending on what values are found at that sample of bits, the checker will either accept or reject the proof, <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid proof must always be accepted. However, an invalid proof may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid proof, the probability that the checker will accept it must be low.|$|E

25|$|The crucial {{aspect of}} any good pass is it being {{difficult}} to intercept. Good passers can pass {{the ball with}} great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball. A special way of doing this is passing the ball <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the receiving teammate. This is called a no-look pass.|$|E
25|$|HR = 1,500/RR {{interval}} in millimeters, HR = 60/RR interval in seconds, or HR = 300/number {{of large}} squares between successive R waves. In each case, {{the authors are}} actually referring to instantaneous HR, which {{is the number of}} times the heart would beat if successive RR intervals were constant. However, because the above formula is almost always mentioned, students determine HR this way <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the ECG any further.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} craft {{transmission}} {{were based on}} those established in China, and consisted of highly methodical copying of sample images until they could be adequately reproduced <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the model. This was practiced {{in a number of}} ways, including through use of edehon, “pictorial models containing sketches of such things as ideal forms, subjects, and objects that are copied repeatedly for study purposes in learning painting.” This was employed ardently within the Kanō School, which wanted to ensure its tenets were not diluted through its wide network of painters. Consistency was also attempted through written manuals detailing such trade secrets as pigments and brush technique.|$|E

25|$|The Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth {{low energy}} {{wearable}} device, developed by Nintendo's Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain {{actions in the}} game <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> their smart device. When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates. The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until {{the next time they}} sign into the app on their mobile device. The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin. The decision to create the device rather than create a smart watch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smart watch is prohibitively expensive. It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.|$|E
25|$|In {{variations}} of two-handed play, no cards are initially dealt, a distinction {{from all other}} variations. Instead, the entire deck is placed face-down on the playing surface between the two players to form the widow. One player begins the hand-building process by drawing the top card of the widow. The player can either keep that card for her or his hand or reject the card. If the player chooses to hold the initial card, the player then draws a second card from the widow, then places it face-down, <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it, creating a discard pile. If the player rejects the first card, the card becomes the first card in the discard pile. The second card drawn from the widow must be kept, regardless of whether she or he preferred the first card. Players alternate turns in this hand-building process until all cards are chosen.|$|E
25|$|Kelly’s {{background}} in {{the military has been}} suggested as a source of the seriousness of his works. While serving time in the army, Kelly was exposed to and influenced by the camouflage with which his specific battalion worked. This taught him about the use of form and shadow, as well as the construction and deconstruction of the visible. It was fundamental to his early education as an artist. Ralph Coburn, a friend of Kelly's from Boston, introduced him to the technique of automatic drawing while visiting in Paris. Kelly embraced this technique of making an image <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the sheet of paper. These techniques helped Kelly in loosening his drawing style and broadened his acceptance of what he believed to be art. During his last year in Paris, Kelly was ill and also suffered depression; Sims thought that influenced his predominant use of black and white during that period.|$|E

500|$|While filming Weir {{guiding the}} team to find the ZPM, {{the fact that she}} can see [...] "everything" [...] <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{anything}} was a hard sell for an actor, but with Higginson's drive in her eyes, this would make the scene more believable for the audience. The scene was not written in the original script. The set for the core room in the Asuran city was the same set as Atlantis' gate room, though {{in order to make it}} look as different as possible, the cameras were placed at angles not usually used for filming in the gate room, such as where they would normally place lights.|$|E
500|$|Wong {{was highly}} active during the Umbrella Revolution: {{he held a}} contest for the best logo to elevate {{awareness}} and generate more concern for the demand for [...] "real universal suffrage" [...] for Hong Kong. Using social media as a [...] "safe platform" [...] for universal participation, he generated considerable awareness and received entries {{from all over the}} world. Wong held sessions where he would draw a person's portrait in one minute <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the paper [...] the concept inspired by Nelson Mandela's maxim [...] "It always seems impossible until it's done". He also co-founded Umbrella Movement Art Preservation, to make an inventory of works and their locations at protest sites, aiming to rescue key pieces before police clearances.|$|E
500|$|This {{system was}} {{developed}} to replace the failing multi-wire telegraph on the Paddington to West Drayton line. [...] It required only two wires, but a more complex code and slower transmission speed. [...] Whereas the two-needle system needed a three-unit code (that is, up to three movements of the needles to represent each letter), the one-needle system used a four-unit code, but had enough codes to encode the entire alphabet. [...] Like the preceding two-needle system, the code units consisted of rapid deflections of the needle to either left or right in quick succession. [...] The needle struck a post when it moved causing it to ring. [...] Different tones were provided for {{the left and right}} movements so that the operator could hear which direction the needle had moved <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it.|$|E

500|$|Robin Williams as The Genie, a comedic genie, with nigh omnipotent {{power that}} can only be {{exercised}} when his master wishes it. The Genie's supervising animator was Eric Goldberg. Clements and Musker wrote the part of the Genie for Robin Williams, and, when met with resistance, created a reel of Williams' stand-up to animation of the Genie. The directors asked Goldberg to animate a Genie over one of Williams' old stand-up comedy routines to pitch the idea to the actor. The resulting test, where Williams talking about schizophrenia was translated into Genie growing another head to argue with himself, made Williams [...] "laugh his ass off" [...] and convinced him to sign on for the role. Williams' appearance in Aladdin (despite his appearance along with Christian Slater and Tim Curry in the early 1992 animated film [...] ) marks the beginning of a transition in animated film to celebrity voice actors, rather than specifically trained voice actors in animated film. Williams provided many celebrity impressions during recording sessions, which were re-adapted into the fabric of the character. These included Ed Sullivan, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Groucho Marx, Rodney Dangerfield, William F. Buckley, Peter Lorre, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Arsenio Hall. Williams also voices the Peddler, a mysterious merchant who appears {{at the beginning of the}} film. After promoting useless goods to the audience, he reveals the magic lamp and begins the story of Aladdin. The scene was completely unscripted — the production left Williams a table with props covered with a sheet and asked him to pull out objects <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them and describe them in-character. The double role originally led to the Peddler revealing to be the Genie disguised, but that idea was dropped later in development. Bruce Adler supplies the singing voice for the Peddler, with Williams singing as Genie.|$|E

2500|$|Trained in {{her early}} years by her sister Susan, who {{ultimately}} became Women's World Champion, Judit Polgár was a prodigy from an early age.

[...] Judit replied: [...] "Do you cook <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the stove?" [...] However, according to Susan, Judit was not the sister with the most talent, explaining: [...] "Judit was a slow starter, but very hard-working." [...] Polgár described herself at that age as [...] "obsessive" [...] about chess. She first defeated an International Master, Dolfi Drimer, at age 10, and a grandmaster, Lev Gutman, at age 11.|$|E

2500|$|Like Zhu Rongji, Wen is {{generally}} {{seen as a}} popular communist official with the Chinese public. His attitude is seemingly sincere and warm, triggering comparisons with former premier Zhou Enlai. Wen spent Chinese New Year in 2005 {{with a group of}} coal miners in a Shanxi coal mine. To many, Wen has gained the image of being the [...] "people's premier", a populist, and an ordinary Chinese citizen who knows and understands ordinary people's needs. In an annual meeting of the Chinese Authors Association, Wen spoke for over two hours to the delegates <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> script. To foreign media, Wen was also the highest figure in the Chinese government to give free press conferences, often facing politically sensitive and difficult questions regarding subjects such as Taiwan Independence, Tibetan independence and human rights.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1877, ten Ponca chiefs, {{including}} Standing Bear, accompanied Inspector Edward C. Kemble to Indian Territory to view several {{tracts of}} land. After viewing {{lands on the}} Osage Reservation and the Kaw Reservation, the chiefs were unhappy with what they were shown, and asked to return home <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the Quapaw Reservation. Angry at {{what he called the}} Ponca chiefs' [...] "insubordination," [...] Kemble refused to take them home until they had viewed all the land. Instead, eight of the chiefs decided to return home on foot. Kemble visited the Quapaw Reservation and selected it as the removal destination. In April, Kemble headed south to the Quapaw Reservation near present-day Peoria, Oklahoma, with those Ponca willing to leave. [...] In May, the remainder of the tribe was forced to move, including Standing Bear and his family.|$|E
