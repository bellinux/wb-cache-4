5|$|Aspirin is an {{important}} part of the treatment of those who have had a myocardial infarction (heart attack). One trial found that among those likely having an ST-segment elevation MI, aspirin saves the life of 1 in 42 by reducing the 30-day death rate from 11.8% to 9.4%. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> major bleeding, but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, the cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians. Small ridges, or denticles, lined {{the edges of}} ornithischian cheek teeth in order to crop vegetation. These denticles extend {{only a third of}} the way down the tooth crown from the tip in all heterodontosaurids; in other ornithischians, the denticles extend further down towards the root. Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (cingulum) separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, so that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E

25|$|A popular {{notion is}} that people might not share {{extremely}} intense emotional events because they are simply inexpressible. Along with this idea, psychologists initially hypothesized that the extreme nature of such experiences would {{play an important role}} in determining whether an emotional event is shared or not. Additionally, they thought that people would be motivated not to deliberately revisit such events because they would reactivate the extreme negative emotions that accompanied the events. However, their studies revealed that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the average emotional intensity between events that were shared compared to those that were kept secret.|$|E

25|$|Frameshift {{mutations}} {{are found}} to be more common in repeat regions of DNA. A reason for this is because of slipping of the polymerase enzyme in repeat regions, allowing for mutations to enter the sequence. Experiments can be run to determine the frequency of the frameshift mutation by adding or removing a pre-set number of nucleotides. Experiments have been run by adding four basepairs, called the +4 experiments, but a team from Emory University looked at the difference in frequency of the mutation by both adding and deleting a base pair. It was shown that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the frequency between the addition and deletion of a base pair.

500|$|IGN's Travis Fahs, in {{discussing}} the SMS version, offered another opinion, praising the game as [...] "not only the crowning achievement of the series, but perhaps one the best games of the 8-bit era", drawing comparisons to both Mario and Zelda. Thomas again reviewed the Master System version of Wonder BoyIII: The Dragon's Trap when it was released two years later for the Virtual Console. In this review, he compares the gameplay to Metroid – more specifically the need to gather additional equipment and abilities to advance in the game. While he acknowledged that this version {{from one of the}} best Master System games as well as for any 8-bit system, he felt that the Master System's Virtual Console release had a reduced appeal. He said that the TurboGrafx-16 version Dragon's Curse had already been out for two years and that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> gameplay between the two versions, but there were improvements in graphics and sound in the TurboGrafx-16 version because of the system's superior capabilities. He also noted that the Master System version suffers from sprite flickering – something the TurboGrafx-16 version did not have. Despite the small differences in the two versions, he decided to give the Master System version the same rating as the TurboGrafx-16 version.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dialogue sessions, producer Chris Thomas was hired to provide [...] "a fresh pair of ears". [...] Thomas's background was in music, rather than engineering.

[...] All four members of the band were engaged in a disagreement over the style of the mix, with Waters and Mason preferring a [...] "dry" [...] and [...] "clean" [...] mix which made more use of the non-musical elements, and Gilmour and Wright preferring a subtler and more [...] "echoey" [...] mix. [...] Thomas later claimed there were no such disagreements, stating [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> opinion between them, I don't remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo.

[...] Although the truth remains unclear, Thomas's intervention resulted in a welcome compromise between Waters and Gilmour, leaving both entirely satisfied with the end product. [...] Thomas was responsible for significant changes to the album, including the perfect timing of the echo used on [...] "Us and Them".
