One study has suggested <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be resistant than men, and a different, aggregate study of 2,930 people found 28% were resistant.|$|E
5|$|<b>Women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{to develop}} {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In population-based studies, women were seven {{times more likely}} than men to have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion that <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also {{the notion that the}} net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E

50|$|In May 2007, {{researchers}} with the Centers for Disease Control reported on rates of self-reported violence among intimate partners {{using data from}} a 2001 study. In the study, almost one-quarter of participants reported some violence in their relationships. Half of these involved one-sided ("non-reciprocal") attacks and half involved both assaults and counter assaults ("reciprocal violence"). Women reported committing one-sided attacks {{more than twice as}} often as men (70% versus 29%). In all cases of intimate partner violence, <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> injured than men, but 25% of men in relationships with two-sided violence reported injury compared to 20% of women reporting injury in relationships with one-sided violence. <b>Women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> injured in non-reciprocal violence.|$|R

Data from a routine structured interview was obtained from medical charts of 842 women and 128 men seen at an urban hospital-based rape treatment center. Demographic characteristics were similar, although males <b>were</b> <b>more</b> like to identify as gay or bisexual, and <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> of minority ethnicity. Men <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to report acute psychiatric symptoms, a history of psychiatric disorder, and a history of psychiatric hospitalization. <b>Women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to experience vaginal or anal penetration, to sustain injuries, and to make a police report.

50|$|<b>Women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have: (a) a {{publicly}} viewable Facebook account, (b) more photo albums, (c) more photos, (d) {{a photo of}} themselves as their profile picture, (e) positive references to alcohol, partying, or drugs, and (f) more positive references to or about the institution or institution-related activities. In general, <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to disclose information about themselves in their Facebook profile, with the primary exception of sharing their telephone number. Similarly, female respondents to Strano's study <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to keep their profile photo recent and choose a photo that made them appear attractive, happy, and fun-loving.

40|$|This {{research}} had two aims. Firstly, to examine availability of emotional support in chat rooms, and secondly, to investigate openness and dishonesty in chat rooms. Three {{hundred and twenty}} respondents (160 women and 160 men) filled out the ‘Chat Room Survey’.

5000|$|Problems {{resulting}} from mass incarceration extend beyond {{economic and political}} aspects to reach community lives as well. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, 46% of black female inmates were likely to {{have grown up in}} a home with only their mothers. A study by Bresler and Lewis shows how incarcerated African American <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have <b>been</b> raised in a single female headed household while incarcerated white <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> raised in a two parent household.

25|$|About 70 {{percent of}} ECT {{patients}} are women. This {{may be due}} to the fact that <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be diagnosed with depression.

25|$|Several {{studies have}} found that black women in the U.S. are more likely to die from breast cancer even though white <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be {{diagnosed}} with the disease. Even after diagnosis, black women are less likely to get treatment compared to white women. Scholars have advanced several theories for the disparities, including inadequate access to screening, reduced availability of the most advanced surgical and medical techniques, or some biological characteristic of the disease in the African American population. Some studies suggest that the racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes may reflect cultural biases more than biological disease differences. However, the lack of diversity in clinical trials for breast cancer treatment may contribute to these disparities, with recent research indicating that black <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have estrogen receptor negative breast cancers, which are not responsive to hormone treatments that are effective for most white women. Research is currently ongoing to define the contribution of both biological and cultural factors.|$|E
25|$|Children {{raised in}} {{alcoholic}} families {{have the potential}} to suffer emotional distress as they move into their own committed relationships. These children are at a higher risk for divorce and separation, unstable marital conditions and fractured families. Feelings of depression and antisocial behaviors experienced in early childhood frequently contribute to marital conflict and domestic violence. <b>Women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men to be victims of alcohol-related domestic violence.|$|E

25|$|Obesity {{has been}} linked to an {{increased}} risk of developing breast cancer by many scientific studies. There is evidence to suggest that excess body fat at the time of breast cancer diagnosis is associated with higher rates of cancer recurrence and death. Furthermore, studies have shown that obese <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have large tumors, greater lymph node involvement, and poorer breast cancer prognosis with 30% higher risk of mortality.|$|E
25|$|While doing {{research}} on sexual tendencies {{of women who have}} sex with women, one study, from the Journal of Bisexuality, concluded that bisexual <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to engage in various high risk behaviors and were at a higher risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. These behaviors have been attributed to the unlikeliness of bisexuals to discuss their sexuality and proper protection with health professionals for fear of judgement or discrimination, leaving them uneducated.|$|E
25|$|PTSD is {{believed}} to be caused by the experience {{of a wide range of}} traumatic events and, in particular if the trauma is extreme, can occur in persons with no predisposing conditions.

40|$|Background Studies {{suggest that}} <b>women</b> may <b>be</b> {{at greater risk}} for {{developing}} chronic pain and pain-related disability. Methods Because musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are the most frequently endorsed painful conditions among veterans, we sought to characterize gender differences in sociodemographic and clinical correlates among veterans upon entry into Veterans Health Administration's Musculoskeletal Disorders Cohort (n = 4, 128, 008). Results <b>Women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> younger, Black, unmarried, and veterans of recent conflicts. In analyses adjusted for gender differences in sociodemographics, <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have diagnoses of fibromyalgia, temporomandibular disorders, and neck pain. Almost one in five women (19. 4 %) had more than one MSD diagnosis, compared with 15. 7 % of men; this higher risk of MSD multimorbidity remained in adjusted analyses. Adjusting for sociodemographics, <b>women</b> with MSD <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have migraine headache and depressive, anxiety, and bipolar disorders. Women had lower odds of cardiovascular diseases, substance use disorders, and several MSDs, including back pain conditions. Men <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to report “no pain” on the pain intensity Numeric Rating Scale, whereas more women (41 %) than men (34 %) reported moderate to severe pain (Numeric Rating Scale 4 +). Conclusions Because <b>women</b> veterans <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have conditions such as fibromyalgia and mental health conditions, along with greater pain intensity in the setting of MSD, women-specific pain services may be needed...|$|R
25|$|Education is {{considered}} a contributing factor to why <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men to live in poverty. 63% of female households who have {{children under the age}} of 18 do not complete high school. However, for minority women, socioeconomic factors contribute to them receiving less of an education than whites. There is a high concentration of minorities in poverty living in urban areas; this contributes to poor quality of education as there is a lack of funding in inner-city schools.|$|E
25|$|In the US, the {{incidence}} rate in women over 50 is approximately 33 per 100,000.
