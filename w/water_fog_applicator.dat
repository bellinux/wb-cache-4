40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a review of}} research into, and application of, a three dimensional (3 D) <b>water</b> <b>fog</b> technique for firefighting. The impact of <b>water</b> <b>fog</b> characteristics associated with properties of the nozzle (e. g., droplet size, momentum, flow rate, spray angle and pattern) and discharge techniques (e. g., discharge angle, and discharge duration related to the bursts) on performance of the 3 D <b>water</b> <b>fog</b> technique are discussed. Potential use of numerical computer studies to help understand and improve this technique is also reviewed and discussed. The 3 D <b>water</b> <b>fog</b> technique is not designed to replace the direct fire attack but rather to complement existing forms of fire attack {{in an effort to}} increase the safety and effectiveness of fire fighting teams. Compared to the traditional straight-stream attack, the 3 D <b>water</b> <b>fog</b> technique has advantages in controlling steadily growing fires where the space can still be entered, but where the seat of the fire cannot be attacked directly. It has also been used for offensive attack to control flashover. However, there is not sufficient research to evaluate its capabilities in other fire scenarios, such as reducing the likelihood of backdraft, and in controlling fire threats in low visibility scenarios. Research on the effects of the nozzle type, application techniques and fire conditions on the performance of the 3 D <b>water</b> <b>fog</b> tactic is also very limited. Further research efforts, including both experimental and numerical studies, can help firefighters understand how to most effectively use this technique and also help to improve its performance in firefighting.

40|$|The <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> {{chemistry}} and deposition in northern Japan were investigated by <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> and throughfall measurements in 2010. <b>Fog</b> <b>water</b> was sampled week-ly by an active-string fog sampler at Lake Mashu from May to November. Throughfall measurements were conducted using rain gauges under three deciduous {{trees along the}} somma of the lake from August to October. The mean fog deposition rate (flux) was cal-culated using throughfall data to estimate the total <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> deposition amount for the entire sampling period. NH 4 + and SO 42 - were the most abundant ca-tion and anion, respectively, in the <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> samples. A mean pH of 5. 08 in the <b>fog</b> <b>water,</b> which is higher than those in rural areas in Japan, was observed. The [NH 4 +]/[SO 42 -] equivalent ratio in <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> was larger than 1. 0 throughout the study period, indicat-ing that NH 3 gas was the primary neutralizing agent for <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> acidity. The mean rate and total amount of <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> deposition were estimated as 0. 15 mm h- 1 and 164 mm, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Zavizan, {{the highest}} {{meteorological}} station in Croatia (1594 m) {{is equipped with}} instrument for collecting <b>fog</b> <b>water.</b> <b>Fog</b> <b>water</b> collection started with the Grunow type collector in 1954. In the summer of 2000., on Zavizan was installed a standard fog collector (SFC). This paper discusses the the daily <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> amounts collected with this new collector of the years periods 2000. - 2004. during the warm part of the years. The highest daily collection rate was 27. 8 l /m on Octobar 8, 2003. The collected <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> in days without rain was 19. 0 l / m on Octobar 16, 2000.

40|$|We {{quantified}} {{the following}} hydrological and meteorological components in a windward tropical montane cloud forest ecosystem near Monteverde, Costa Rica, during a three months field campaign in 2003 : <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> deposition, precipitation, throughfall, and stemflow. Additionally we determined the stabile isotope concentrations of 18 O and 2 H {{of a large}} number of samples from each component. Net <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> deposition was measured directly with the eddy covariance method. An average daily <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> deposition rate of 1. 2 mm was measured. <b>Fog</b> <b>water</b> deposition constituted 4 – 7 % of rainfall collected over the full period. Comparisons between direct <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> deposition measurements and the results of a mixing model using the stable isotopes as tracers revealed that the latter might be a good tool to estimate <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> deposition without an eddy covariance system in the future under many (but not all) conditions. To compute the wet-canopy water balance, evaporation from the wet canopy was calculated with the reduced Penman- Monteith equation. For a period of 65 2 days, we measured 506 mm of <b>water</b> input (<b>fog</b> and rain <b>water)</b> and 557 mm of water output (throughfall, stemflow, and wet-canopy evaporation). 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> {{collection}} obtained with cylindrical fog gauges at three locations on the northern side of Tenerife island (Spain) : La Esperanza (1093 m a. s. l.), Taborno (1015 m a. s. l.), and El Gaitero (1747 m a. s. l.). Concomitant meteorological variables were also measured. We show that fog precipitation was more frequent than rainfall. However, the volumes and frequency of daily <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> collection varied among the three studied sites, usually not exceeding 10 – 40 L d− 1 /m 2 of collecting surface. In La Esperanza, <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> harvesting occurred frequently, but was considerably lower than {{in the other two}} locations. However, while in Taborno <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> collection episodes were distributed throughout the period, in El Gaitero these were mainly concentrated in two periods, during autumn and winter 2012 – 2013. The study of the relationships between daily <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> yields and the averages of meteorological variables did not show any clear trend, but it suggested that the greater volumes of collected <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> were logically associated with higher wind speeds and lower solar radiation conditions. <b>Fog</b> <b>water</b> collection in La Esperanza and in Taborno typically occurred within a similar temperature interval (7. 5 – 12. 5 °C), while in El Gaitero the phenomenon was associated with a lower temperature range (2. 5 – 10 °C) ...|$|R

40|$|During two {{extended}} summer {{seasons in}} 2006 and 2007 we operated two battery driven {{versions of the}} Caltech active strand cloud water collector (MiniCASCC) at the Niesen mountain (2362 m a. s. l.) {{in the northern part}} of the Swiss Alps, and two devices at the Lägeren research tower (690 m a. s. l.) at the northern boundary of the Swiss Plateau. During these two field operation phases we gained weekly samples of <b>fog</b> <b>water,</b> where we analyzed the major anions and cations, and the isotope ratios of <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> (in form of δ 2 H and δ 18 O). Dominant ions in <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> at all sites were NH 4 +, NO 3 −, and SO 42 −. Compared to precipitation, the enrichment factors in <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> were in the range 5 – 9 at the highest site, Niesen Kulm. We found considerably lower summertime ion loadings in <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> at the two Alpine sites than at lower elevations above the Swiss Plateau. The lowest ion concentrations were found at the Niesen Kulm site at 2300 m a. s. l., whereas the highest concentrations (a factor 7 compared to Niesen Kulm) were found in <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> at the Lägeren site. Occult nitrogen deposition was estimated from fog frequency and typical <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> flux rates. This pathway contributes 0. 3 – 3. 9 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 to the total N deposition at the highest site on Niesen mountain, and 0. 1 – 2. 2 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 at the lower site. These inputs are the reverse of ion concentrations measured in fog due to the 2. 5 times higher frequency of fog occurrence at the mountain top (overall fog occurrence was 25 % of the time) as compared to the lower Niesen Schwandegg site. Although <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> concentrations were on the lower range reported in earlier studies, <b>fog</b> <b>water</b> is likely to be an important N source for Northern Alpine ecosystems and might reach values up to 16 % of the total N deposition and up to 75 % of wet N deposition by precipitation...|$|R
