500|$|Biko never {{addressed}} {{questions of}} gender and sexism in his politics. The sexism was evident in many ways, according to Mamphela Ramphele, a BCM activist and doctor at the Zanempilo Clinic, including that women tended to be given responsibility for the cleaning and catering at functions. [...] "There was no way you could think of Steve making {{a cup of tea}} or whatever for himself", another activist said. Feminism was viewed as irrelevant [...] "bra-burning". Surrounded by women who cared about him, Biko developed a reputation as a womaniser, something that Woods described as [...] "well earned". He displayed no racial prejudice, sleeping with both black and white women. At NUSAS, he and his friends competed to see who could have sex with the most female delegates. Responding to this behaviour, the NUSAS general secretary Sheila Lapinsky accused Biko of sexism, to which he responded: [...] "Don't worry about my sexism. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> white racist friends in NUSAS?" [...] Sobukwe also admonished Biko for his womanising, believing that it set a bad example to other activists.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the seven}} years after she {{graduated}} college, Davis lived out of her car, which at first was her grandmother's Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera; she even built a bed in the backseat. She drove around to climbing areas, guiding and waiting tables to make ends meet, earning only about US$6,000 a year. She read throughout her journeys, from novels by Gabriel García Márquez to an autobiography by Kirstie Alley, to French short stories in the original language. Some of her favorite authors are T.C. Boyle, Victor Villasenor, and Rumi. Among her climbing heroes is Layton Kor. Her parents continued to disapprove of her lifestyle, however, and she felt very alone: [...] "My parents did not like my choices and thought I was doing stupid things with my life, {{and they told me}} so. I didn't feel like anyone cared if I did a climb I was proud of. They were just like, 'Great. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> future schooling?'" [...] As Davis became more well-known and successful at climbing, however, she was able to make a better living, particularly from sponsorships from major companies such as Patagonia, Five Ten, Clif Bar, and Black Diamond.|$|E

40|$|An {{information}} collection method called photovoice was utilized to assess ZOE, an orphan empowerment program in Meru County, Kenya. 2 ̆ 2 ZOE 2 ̆ 2 is the Greek word {{for life and}} the ZOE program was founded in 2004, serving nearly 30, 000 orphans and vulnerable children in seven countries. Participants were graduates of the program {{between the ages of}} 16 and 25 years. They were elected by their peers to be leaders of their working groups within their communities and demonstrated responsible leadership throughout the program. The four research questions provided to the participants addressed positive and negative aspects of one 2 ̆ 7 s life prior to the program and after completing the program: 1. <b>What</b> was difficult <b>about</b> <b>your</b> life before the ZOE program? 2. <b>What</b> was great <b>about</b> <b>your</b> life before the ZOE program? 3. <b>What</b> remains difficult <b>about</b> <b>your</b> life now that you joined the ZOE program? 4. <b>What</b> has improved <b>about</b> <b>your</b> life now because of the ZOE program? ^ Participants took photographs and provided corresponding narratives to be used for analysis. Narratives were coded by hand and emerged themes were summarized in tables and networks demonstrating their relationships. Staying true to the nature of photovoice, an educational photo book was created using the photos and narratives in order to reach a broader audience and to showcase the participants 2 ̆ 7 stories. ^ Social capital and economic development were identified as the driving forces for the successful completion of the ZOE program. Additionally, sibling resiliency played a large part in the experiences of the orphan heads of household. Once participants assumed the caretaker role, family management and decisions were based on ensuring siblings 2 ̆ 7 basic needs were met, emphasizing the importance of siblings staying together after parental loss. ...|$|R
