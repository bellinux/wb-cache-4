5|$|Another {{important}} asset are the Storm's narrow dimensions, <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> it {{to traverse}} the narrow alleyways {{common to the}} casbahs of many Middle Eastern cities, places that armoured Humvees can only enter with great difficulty and minimal manoeuvrability, if at all. Full-height rear doors <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> for the quick deployment of fully equipped troops into combat are touted as another advantage over similar vehicles.|$|E
5|$|ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 – three-letter {{country codes}} <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> a better visual {{association}} between the codes and the country names than the alpha-2 codes.|$|E
5|$|The Park {{contains}} several well-marked trails <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> {{visitors to}} view the geology of the canyon and its surroundings, which spans millions of years.|$|E
5000|$|As well as {{controlling}} Jones, {{the player}} can also control Astral, a spirit which Jones can call in specific locations. Astral levitates rather than walks, {{and has no}} offensive capabilities. Instead, the player has access to different [...] "forms", such as a Revenant form <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> her to walk and interact with switches, a charming form <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> her to trick ghosts into following her, a spectral form <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> her to warp through walls and floors at special warp points, a poltergeist form <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> her to throw objects, and a possession form <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> her control certain ghosts.|$|R
5000|$|Super Mario Bros. 3: The warp whistle, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> {{player to}} first go to a warp zone, then advance to another {{world of a}} higher value, and the hammer, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> players to take shortcuts on the overworld game map. Mario also acquires a Raccoon Leaf <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> him to fly, {{sometimes}} to hidden areas.|$|R

5|$|Airports with {{international}} flights have customs and immigration facilities, <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> right of entry. These {{change over time}} but are generally designated by law. However, as some countries have agreements that allow connecting flights without customs and immigrations, such facilities do not define an international airport.|$|E
5|$|At 6 feet (1.83 metres) and 212 pounds (96 kilograms), Booth's size {{enables him to}} play in {{the style}} of a power forward. Along with his {{physical}} stature, he is a fast skater, both of <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> him to retain the puck and contribute to his offensive skills.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, {{these trends}} have continued, and several new {{approaches}} {{have come into}} prominence, including multielectrode recording, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> the activity of many brain cells to be recorded {{all at the same}} time; genetic engineering, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally; genomics, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in DNA properties and neuroimaging.|$|R

Some of {{these include the}} Screen Ratio, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> users to indicate {{if they have a}} standard or widescreen display, Color Profile, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> changing the color scheme of displays, and subtitle, which selects the default subtitle language.

5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} other objects which may serve to spread their scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around {{to draw attention to}} the marking post. Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E
5|$|Canada Post {{provides}} a free postal code look-up tool on its website, via its mobile application, and sells hard-copy directories and CD-ROMs. Many vendors also sell validation tools, <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> customers to properly match addresses and postal codes.

5|$|Located to {{the east}} of the Nanzan Campus is the Divine Word Seminary Chapel (1962).

These are punctured with vertical slots <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> light to radiate along the curved interior walls.|$|E
5|$|Male elk {{retain their}} antlers {{for more than}} half the year and are less likely to group with other males when they have antlers. Antlers provide a means of defense, as does a strong front-leg kick, which is {{performed}} by either sex if provoked. Once the antlers have been shed, bulls tend to form bachelor groups <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> them to work cooperatively at fending off predators. Herds tend to employ one or more scouts while the remaining members eat and rest.|$|E

Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> two gamers to compete by modem or local networks, persuaded a wider audience that multiplayer competition was much more challenging than contests against the artificial intelligence (AI), and made multiplayer facilities essential for future RTS titles.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{political}} parties in Singapore have called for the ISA to be abolished. In its manifesto for the 2011 general election, the Workers' Party said that specific anti-terrorism and anti-espionage laws, <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> arrests and detention without trial only under strict conditions, should be enacted to replace the ISA. The National Solidarity Party took a similar stance in February 2013.|$|E
5|$|Portable devices {{having an}} USB On-The-Go port {{may want to}} charge and access USB {{peripheral}} at the same time, but having only a single port (both due to On-The-Go and space requirement) prevents this. Accessory charging adapters (ACA) are devices <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> a charging power to be injected into an On-The-Go connection between host and peripheral.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: HP HIL Adapter, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> {{standard}} PC keyboards {{and mice}} {{to be added}} to an HIL host. Note the pass-through port on the right, <b>which</b> <b>allowed</b> other HIL devices to be daisy-chained through this one.|$|R

5|$|Rorquals use throat pleats {{to expand}} their mouths, <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> them to feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} need to build up water pressure in order {{to expand their}} mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E
5|$|Savoye, {{comparing}} {{the structure of}} Live and Let Die with Casino Royale, believes that the two books have open narratives <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> Fleming to continue with further books in the series. Savoye finds differences {{in the structure of}} the endings, with Live and Let Dies promise of future sexual encounters between Bond and Solitaire to be more credible than Casino Royales ending, in which Bond vows to battle a super-criminal organisation.|$|E
5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} {{of a cell}} has multiple functions. These include transporting nutrients into the cell, allowing waste to leave, preventing materials from entering the cell, averting needed materials from leaving the cell, maintaining the pH of the cytosol, and preserving the osmotic pressure of the cytosol. Transport proteins <b>which</b> <b>allow</b> some materials to pass through but not others are used for these functions. These proteins use ATP hydrolysis to pump materials against their concentration gradients.|$|E
50|$|Jonathan Drew {{has limited}} powers of telepathy, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> him to sense emotions, read minds (only surface thoughts), and telekinesis, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> him to fly, {{generate}} force fields, and lift heavy objects through force of mind alone.|$|R
50|$|Smalltalk MT {{directly}} interfaces to DLLs {{in exactly}} the same manner as C <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> DLL calls to be tested directly in a Workspace, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> a scripting style of approach to accessing any DLL based code.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the expected functions of an operating system, DPPX included several functions <b>which</b> <b>allowed</b> for remote administration, such as Distributed Host Command Facility (DHCF), <b>which</b> <b>allowed</b> a Host Command Facility (HCF) user on a mainframe to log on in either full-screen mode or line mode to execute commands as though logged on locally, and Distributed Systems Network (or Node) Executive (DSNX), <b>which</b> <b>allowed</b> a Distributed Systems Executive (DSX) (later NetView/DM) job to manage files.|$|R
