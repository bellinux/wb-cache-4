His works from this period include the First Choral Symphony to <b>words</b> <b>by</b> Keats (a Second Choral Symphony to <b>words</b> <b>by</b> George Meredith exists only in fragments). A short Shakespearian opera, At the Boar's Head, followed; neither had the immediate popular appeal of A Moorside Suite for brass band of 1928.|$|E

5|$|Greenlandic is a polysynthetic {{language}} {{that allows the}} creation of long <b>words</b> <b>by</b> stringing together roots and suffixes.

5|$|Nocturne (1958) is {{the last}} of the orchestral cycles. As in the Serenade, Britten set <b>words</b> <b>by</b> a range of poets, who here include Shakespeare, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Tennyson and Wilfred Owen. The whole cycle is darker in tone than the Serenade, with pre-echoes of the War Requiem. All the songs have subtly {{different}} orchestrations, with a prominent obbligato part for a different instrument in each.|$|E
5|$|Sullivan's most {{enduring}} orchestral work, the Overture di Ballo, was composed for the Birmingham Festival in 1870. Also in 1870, Sullivan met Gilbert. 1871 was a busy year for Sullivan. He published his only song cycle, The Window; or, The Songs of the Wrens, to <b>words</b> <b>by</b> Tennyson, {{and he wrote}} {{the first of a}} series of suites of incidental music for West End productions of Shakespeare plays. Still in 1871, Sullivan composed a dramatic cantata, On Shore and Sea, for the opening of the London International Exhibition, and the hymn Onward, Christian Soldiers, with <b>words</b> <b>by</b> Sabine Baring-Gould. The Salvation Army adopted the latter as its favoured processional, and it became Sullivan's {{most enduring}} hymn.|$|E

5|$|The Fish minigame {{involves}} manipulating a fish {{to collect}} every coin in its tank. The fish moves {{in a straight}} diagonal line, and the player can alter this line by placing bubbles at certain marked points, reflecting {{it in a different}} direction. In the Japanese version of Last Specter, the Fish minigame is instead based on trying to create <b>words</b> <b>by</b> feeding them to fish, who alter them in specific patterns.|$|E
5|$|The cantata in {{structured}} in six movements, beginning with an aria for tenor (T), {{followed by two}} pairs of recitative and aria, one for bass (B), the other for the duet of soprano (S) and alto (A), and a concluding chorale when all four parts are united. As with several other cantatas on <b>words</b> <b>by</b> Franck, it is scored for a small Baroque chamber ensemble of two violins (Vl), viola (Va), two cellos (Vc) and basso continuo (Bc).|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his life}} Smetana {{returned}} to simple song-writing, with five Evening Songs (1879) to <b>words</b> <b>by</b> the poet Vítězslav Hálek. His final completed work, Our Song (1883), is the last of four settings of texts by Josef Srb-Debrnov. Despite the state of Smetana's health, this is a happy celebration of Czech song and dance. The piece was lost for many years, and only received its first performance after rediscovery in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Vaughan Williams's choral {{works for}} concert {{performance}} include settings of both {{secular and religious}} words. The former include Toward the Unknown Region to <b>words</b> <b>by</b> Whitman (composed 1904–06), Five Tudor Portraits, <b>words</b> <b>by</b> John Skelton (1935), and the Shakespearean Serenade to Music (in its alternative version for chorus and orchestra, 1938). Choral pieces with religious words include the oratorio Sancta Civitas (1923–25) and the Christmas cantata Hodie (1954). In 1953 the composer said that of his choral works Sancta Civitas was his favourite. The Dona Nobis Pacem, an impassioned anti-war cantata (1936) {{is a combination of}} both, with words from Whitman and others juxtaposed with extracts from the Latin mass, anticipating a similar mixture of sacred and secular text in Britten's War Requiem twenty-five years later.|$|E
5|$|Annual {{events in}} the town's {{calendar}} include the Keswick Film Festival (February–March).

The festival began in 1995, and events have been presented by Melvyn Bragg, Louis de Bernières, Germaine Greer, Steve Jones, Penelope Lively, Princess Michael of Kent, Michael Rosen and Joanna Trollope.|$|E
5|$|During 1937 Britten {{composed}} a Pacifist March to <b>words</b> <b>by</b> Ronald Duncan for the Peace Pledge Union, of which, as a pacifist, {{he had become}} an active member; the work was not a success and was soon withdrawn. The best known of his compositions from this period is probably Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge for string orchestra, described by Matthews as the first of Britten's works to become a popular classic. It was a success in North America, with performances in Toronto, New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, under conductors including John Barbirolli and Serge Koussevitzky.|$|E

5|$|Sanderson was {{originally}} working to {{a target of}} 200,000 words, later 250,000 words and by April 2008 up to 400,000 <b>words.</b> <b>By</b> the end of October 2008 the 400,000 estimate was still in effect. Sanderson later estimated the final length of A Memory of Light {{to be at least}} 750,000 words. Information emerged on the Internet pertaining to the book, with a draft cover suggesting it was to be split into volumes. On March 30, 2009, Tor Books confirmed A Memory of Light was to be split into three volumes, the first of which, The Gathering Storm, would be released on November 3, 2009. This date was later changed to October 27, 2009, a week earlier than planned.|$|E
5|$|The cantata is {{structured}} in seven movements, framed as the earlier chorale cantatas by a chorale fantasia and a chorale four-part setting, {{of the first}} and the twelfth stanza in the original <b>words</b> <b>by</b> the reformer Speratus, published in the First Lutheran hymnal. The theme is salvation from sin by God's grace alone. An anonymous librettist paraphrased the content of ten inner stanzas to alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the cantata for a chamber ensemble of four vocal parts, flauto traverso, oboe d'amore, strings and continuo. He gave all three recitatives to the bass, like a sermon interrupted in reflection by a tenor aria with solo violin and a duet of soprano and alto with the wind instruments.|$|E
5|$|The {{lyrics of}} The Power of Four were {{circulated}} {{to all of}} the members of the British and Irish Lions tour squad and the song was pre-added to the playlists on their tour iPods.

The British and Irish Lions players were shown the words of The Power of Four on the Saturday before their first game and it was expected that they would know the <b>words</b> <b>by</b> the time they had arrived in New Zealand. However it was mentioned by a British and Irish Lions spokesman that the players were under no obligation to sing it.|$|E

5|$|The {{morphology}} of Greenlandic {{is highly}} synthetic and exclusively suffixing, {{with the exception}} of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long <b>words</b> <b>by</b> means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem. In principle there is no limit to the length of a Greenlandic word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5. The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.|$|E
5|$|For a {{brief period}} in 1848, Smetana was a revolutionary. In the climate of {{political}} change and upheaval that swept through Europe in that year, a pro-democracy movement in Prague led by Smetana's old friend Karel Havlíček was urging an end to Habsburg absolutist rule and for more political autonomy. A Citizens' Army ("Svornost") was formed to defend the city against possible attack. Smetana wrote a series of patriotic works, including two marches dedicated respectively to the Czech National Guard and the Students' Legion of the University of Prague, and The Song of Freedom to <b>words</b> <b>by</b> Ján Kollár. In June 1848, as the Habsburg armies moved to suppress rebellious tendencies, Prague came under attack from the Austrian forces led by the Prince of Windisch-Grätz. As a member of Svornost, Smetana helped to man the barricades on the Charles Bridge. The nascent uprising was quickly crushed, but Smetana avoided the imprisonment or exile received by leaders such as Havlíček. During his brief spell with Svornost, he met the writer and leading radical, Karel Sabina, who would later provide libretti for Smetana's first two operas.|$|E
5|$|Like bryozoans and phoronids, brachiopods have a lophophore, a {{crown of}} tentacles whose cilia (fine hairs) create a water current {{that enables them to}} filter food {{particles}} out of the water. However a bryozoan or phoronid lophophore is a ring of tentacles mounted on a single, retracted stalk, while the basic form of the brachiopod lophophore is U-shaped, forming the brachia ("arms") from which the phylum gets its name. Brachiopod lophophores are non-retractable and occupy up to two-thirds of the internal space, in the frontmost area where the valves gape when opened. To provide enough filtering capacity in this restricted space, lophophores of larger brachiopods are folded in moderately to very complex shapes—loops and coils are common, and some species' lophophores resemble a hand with the fingers splayed. In all species the lophophore is supported by cartilage and by a hydrostatic skeleton (in other <b>words</b> <b>by</b> the pressure of its internal fluid), and the fluid extends into the tentacles. Some articulate brachiopods also have a brachidium, a calcareous support for the lophophore attached {{to the inside of the}} brachial valve.|$|E
