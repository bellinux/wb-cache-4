5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Hel. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down a slope and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. The downward slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards the realm of the dead and the <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Hel.|$|E

She told a psychiatrist that she would study a specific malady and subsequently present herself with its symptoms; her time at each forum followed a daily schedule. Others disappear and simply stop posting, such as the monk who claimed to have cancer.|$|E

Other cases of coffin birth at archaeological sites have been described, such as in 1978 at a Neolithic site in Germany, at a medieval site in Denmark in 1982, and in 2009 at an Early Christian period site at Fingal, Ireland. A coffin birth was also described in a 2011 episode of the BBC show History Cold Case, featuring the Roman era remains of a woman and three neonates discovered near Baldock, Hertfordshire. Another was identified in 2006 in a 14th-century Black Death cemetery in Genoa, Italy.|$|E

25|$|Glasgow police {{decided to}} use the {{occasion}} of the public address to effect the arrest. However, the WSPU activists anticipated their action and increased security coverage for their leader, including enforcing strict secrecy surrounding her movements and erecting a concealed barbed wire barrier across the front of the stage. A short time into Pankhurst's speech, around 160 police officers stormed the hall and began to move toward the stage. They were met by a barrage of thrown chairs and plant pots, and soon fights broke out between the police and members of the audience. During the commotion one of the women present drew a revolver and fired several blank cartridges toward the ceiling. The police attempted to apprehend her, but she managed to slip their grasp and escape. Although not positively identified at the time, many since have stated that Janie Allan was the <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> revolver.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Chlamydia trachomatis {{infections are}} the most {{prevalent}} bacterial sexually transmitted infections recognized throughout the world. In the last few years, several {{studies have indicated that}} predisposition of C. trachomatis to persist within the host cell is recognized as {{a major factor in the}} pathogenesis of chlamydial infection. During persistent chlamydial infection, the stress protein hsp 60 is synthesized continually as immunopathologic antigen. Antibodies to hsp 60 are found in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> tubal occlusion, but these antibodies are not detected in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> acute C. trachomatis infection, which indicates that hsp 60 has an important role in pathogenesis of persistant chlamydial infection. Objective. The aim of this study was to determine the role of chlamydial stress proteins (heat shock proteins) in pathogenesis of ectopic pregnancy. Methods. The study included 40 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> ectopic pregnancy (experimental group) and 34 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> normal pregnancy (control group). C. trachomatis was detected in endocervical smears by direct immunofluorescence test, while specific antibodies against Chlamydia spp. and against hsp 60 were detected by ELISA. Results. DIF method detected the presence of C. trachomatis in 12. 5 % of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ectopic pregnancy and 17. 6 % of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> normal pregnancy. IgG antibodies against Chlamydia spp. were found in 57. 5 % of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ectopic pregnancy and 26. 5 % of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> normal pregnancy. IgA antibodies were positive in 37. 5 % of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ectopic pregnancy and 2. 9 % of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> normal pregnancy. IgG antibodies against hsp 60 were positive in 37. 5 % of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ectopic pregnancy and 14. 7 % of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> normal pregnancy. Conclusion. The results of this study have proven the correlation between the ectopic pregnancy and the presence of IgG antibodies to chlamydial hsp 60...|$|R
25|$|A second {{explosion}} at the Park Kultury station followed at approximately 8:38am, caused by another female, {{who at the}} time of the first explosion was riding another train from Yugo-Zapadnaya towards Ulitsa Podbelskogo station in the same direction as the first train. At the time of first explosion, the second train had stopped in the tunnel between Frunzenskaya and Park Kultury stations. It was announced over the speakers that due to technical problems, the train would have to unload the passengers at the next stop. About 40 minutes later, the train reached the station, and once its doors opened, the second female suspect detonated the second explosion, killing fourteen commuters. Panic included stampedes at both stations, as commuters attempted to escape. The second attack was carried out by a dark-haired <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> equivalent of 2kg of TNT strapped to her waist. Both bombs were packed with metal nuts, bolts and screws, to increase the destructive impact of the blasts.|$|E
25|$|Kumashiro {{also took}} breaks from the Roman Porno genre to direct {{mainstream}} films, beginning with Bitterness of Youth (1974), {{a story of}} student radicalism with similarities to Dreiser's An American Tragedy (1925). Other such films include Light of Africa (1975) for Toho and Jigoku (1979), a remake of Nobuo Nakagawa's 1960 film Jigoku, for Toei. For the German-Japanese co-production, The <b>Woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Red Hat (1982), Kumashiro worked with Pink Film producer-director Kōji Wakamatsu. The production was an unsuccessful attempt on Wakamatsu's part to emulate the success he had had in collaborating with the French in Nagisa Ōshima's In the Realm of the Senses (1976). The story, dealing with a Japanese man in Germany and his obsessive sexual relationship with a German woman during Hitler's rise to power, also seemed to echo Ōshima's film. Jasper Sharp notes with surprise that Kumashiro, who had long been an opponent of Japanese censorship, did {{not take advantage of}} the more liberal European laws. Instead he followed the Japanese practice of obscuring genital areas with props.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the idea}} of the cunning folk began to appear in the {{literature}} of the period. In 1638, the playwright Thomas Heywood published his comedy, The Wise Woman of Hogsdon, whilst in 1684 another playwright, Edward Ravenscroft, published his own play about a cunning <b>woman.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> decline in the witch trials {{in the latter part of}} the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, partly due to the rise of the Enlightenment amongst the educated elite, a new law was introduced, the Witchcraft Act of 1736. Unlike earlier laws, this did not accept the existence of magic, and was designed to be used to prosecute those who claimed magical powers as being fraudulent; it could therefore be very damaging to the cunning profession. The new regulations imposed by the Witchcraft Act of 1736 laid down a maximum penalty of a year's imprisonment for the crime of deceiving people by claiming magical powers, but in effect, during the rest of the eighteenth century, there were very few prosecutions, with most authorities not bothering to enforce this particular law.|$|E
