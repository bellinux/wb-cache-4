25|$|Jobs {{traveled}} to India in mid-1974 to visit Neem Karoli Baba at his Kainchi ashram with his Reed friend (and eventual Apple employee) Daniel Kottke, {{in search of}} spiritual enlightenment. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Neem Karoli ashram, it was almost deserted because Neem Karoli Baba had died in September 1973. Then they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of Haidakhan Babaji. In India, they {{spent a lot of}} time on bus rides from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.|$|E
25|$|The Melbourne Games {{also saw}} {{the high point of}} Australian female sprinting with Betty Cuthbert winning three gold medals at the MCG. She won the 100m and 200m and {{anchored}} the winning 4 x 100m team. Born in Merrylands in Sydneyâ€™s west she was a champion schoolgirl athlete and had already broken the world record for the 200m just before the 1956 Games. She was to be overshadowed by her Western Suburbs club member, the Marlene Matthews. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Games, Matthews was the overwhelming favourite especially for the 100m a distance over which Cuthbert had beaten her just once.|$|E
25|$|The gangsters drove Kilroy {{through the}} back {{streets of the city}} and past an {{industrial}} area. The number of bars and vendor stands in the street began to thin out as they drove Kilroy through a highway in the city's outskirts. The gangsters then turned to a dirt road that stretched between two corn fields. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> private ranch known as Santa Elena, they left Kilroy inside the car overnight. Shortly after dawn, the ranch's caretaker went to see Kilroy and fed him bread, eggs, and water. About twelve hours after Kilroy was kidnapped, Contanzo and his men came to see him. They wrapped his face and mouth with duct tape and walked him through a field to a storage cabin with his hands still tied around his back.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} cold <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Folkestone, and Lady Alexandrina shivered {{as she stepped}} into the private-looking {{carriage}} which had been sent to the station for her use.|$|R

5000|$|Hannah (when she was Chaya) {{was really}} the woman she was named after, Rivka was Aunt Eva, and Rivka's brother, Wolfe, was Grandpa Will. (Aunt Eva said that they changed their names <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> America.) ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{negotiations}} that followed were called the Naples Conference, with Tito, Velebit and Olga {{on one side}} of the table and Churchill and Maclean on the other. Churchill was happy to give this matter his personal attention, and, Maclean says, he did it very well. One day the two leaders were taking a rest, having handed things over to a committee of experts, when a matter arose required Churchill's immediate attention. Maclean was sent to find him; he was believed to be bathing in the Bay of Naples. [...] <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore, they saw the huge flotilla of troopships setting off for the south of France (Operation Dragoon), and a small bright blue [...] dodging around them. Maclean was assigned a little torpedo boat, complete with a cautious captain and an attractive stenographer. It zoomed after the barge, eventually catching up with the prime minister, who found Maclean and his crew's arrival a source of much hilarity.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2006 {{six members}} of an Ashland, Oregon, family were {{stranded}} in their snowbound motor home for two weeks. In addition to the two Stivers, the group included Stivers's parents, the Higginbothams; and the Stivers' two children. The RV was stranded on the spur road to Calvert Airstrip near its intersection with the BLM Glendale-to-Powers Bike Route after that road passes Marial Junction, about [...] west of Glendale. Unlike the route of James Kim and his family who turned west up BLM 34-8-36 toward Bear Camp Road and Gold Beach, the Stivers-Higginbotham group took a different road, having missed the turnoff that the Kims took toward Bear Camp {{at the start of}} BLM 34-8-36. Stivers-Higginbotham's route went north through Galice and on to Grave Creek, there crossing the bridge over the Rogue River, and next, heading north up Mount Reuben Road. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Glendale-to-Powers bike route, they turned west where they later became stuck in snow on the BLM airstrip spur, while trying to head back down it after turning around at the airstrip. Their RV had become stuck north of the Rogue River in March, about [...] north-northeast, geographically, from where the Kims' car was stranded in late November 2006.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Some, sir' (considering the question). 'Soldier-like. They {{had been}} long marching in the rainy season, by bad roads--no roads at all, in short--and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Calcutta, men turned to and drank, before taking {{a last look at}} it.

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of {{the field}} the oxen stopped. Beechnut and Stuyvesant then looked round to see the furrow. It was very respectably straight.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{door she}} plaintively said: 'Come in,' and he {{followed}} her to her room. Here she sank on to a chair, and gave herself up to her tears.|$|E
50|$|Black hocks {{actually}} {{referred to}} the hocks of their horses being black <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Quebec city due to the abundance of peaty bogs, or wetlands, on the journey there into which horses legs would sink up to their hocks and become covered in the mucky stuff and so blackened.|$|R
60|$|When {{the week}} was up Mat implored {{to be left}} behind with Angela, the maid, and Brio, a big poodle possessed of the devil. But she was torn away, and only consoled by the promise of many new gloves, with as many buttons as she pleased, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Munich.|$|R
50|$|Despite their relief, Matthew, Jimmy and Carl {{were far}} from ecstatic, with Matthew still wanting to know who killed his father. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Home Farm, Matthew was still {{convinced}} Jimmy was guilty and demanded he admit it, once and for all. However, Jimmy continued to deny that it was him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'At first; {{but either}} {{he could not}} bear to see Meta's piano profaned, or he thought it too strong <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sacred line, for he bolted, and is gone home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{lieutenant}} meditated cheerfully for a moment. Then he added, [...] "You would scarcely credit it, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ridge at last, {{they found}} two {{more of the}} Sepoys had jumped over." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bridge Dave {{was much}} {{surprised}} to see a couple of men at work repairing the structure. They were putting down some planking that was bound to last a long while.|$|E

6000|$|... 'However, {{he left a}} {{direction}} in the town that a lookout should be kept, though this was arranged privately, the bare possibility of an elopement being {{enough to make him}} reticent; and, full of misgivings, the two remaining ones hastened to catch the last train out of Budmouth-Regis; and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Casterbridge drove back to Upper Longpuddle.' ...|$|R
60|$|From {{the fact}} that the cook was not visible at the moment the skipper took the salutation to himself.

6000|$|... "The two {{who moved}} first were the boys we allowed {{we were not}} quite sure about. I don't know if it means anything, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river, they and Davies lost the others." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{other end}} of the barn, they found a door leading out into a shed; and there was Farmer Cropwell, with one of his men and a pretty large boy, getting out some ploughs.|$|E
60|$|After {{that they}} went through the whole garden again, flower by flower, {{as if it were a}} long {{sentence}} they were spelling out, with kisses for commas, and a great hug by way of a full-stop <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end.|$|E
60|$|It was a damp, cheerless morning <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Northfleet again. It {{had been}} raining {{heavily in the}} night, and black clouds still hung low over the river.

5000|$|The key {{concept of}} the series was that each show starts off with the letter [...] "A".

5000|$|Davis {{eventually}} went on {{to befriend}} over 20 members of the KKK.

Davis recounted his experiences in his 1998 book, Klan-destine Relationships: A Black Man's Odyssey in the Ku Klux Klan.|$|R
