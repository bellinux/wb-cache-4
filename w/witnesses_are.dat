If superintendents, supervisors and trial <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> also included then approximately 200 Japanese spent time in Britain.|$|E
5|$|One {{problem with}} {{counting}} attacks on humans {{is that the}} copper shark is so similar to other requiem sharks. Victims and <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> unlikely to correctly identify which type of genus Carcharhinus shark {{is responsible for the}} attack. Experts trying to confirm shark attacks by species warn that their statistics undercount the number of attacks by requiem sharks like the copper.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, about {{eighty percent}} of Sri Lankan Tamils were Hindus who {{followed}} the Shaiva sect. The rest were mostly Roman Catholics who converted after the Portuguese conquest of Jaffna Kingdom and coastal Sri Lanka. There is also {{a small minority of}} Protestants due to missionary efforts in the 18th century by organisations such as the American Ceylon Mission. Most Tamils who inhabit the Western Province are Roman Catholics, while those of the Northern and Eastern Provinces are mainly Hindu. Pentecostal and other churches, such as Jehovah's <b>Witnesses,</b> <b>are</b> active among the internally displaced and refugee populations. The 2012 Sri Lanka Census revealed a Buddhist population of 22,254 amongst Sri Lankan Tamils. Accounting to roughly 1% of all Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka.|$|E
50|$|The {{general rule}} <b>is</b> that a <b>witness</b> <b>is</b> {{not allowed to}} testify about, nor may another <b>witness</b> <b>be</b> called to support, a {{previous}} consistent statement.|$|R
25|$|The {{court did}} not err in refusing to order {{production}} of a defense alibi witness, where the defense contended that the <b>witness</b> <b>was</b> under subpoena but no evidence was introduced {{to show that the}} <b>witness</b> <b>was</b> under subpoena, and no evidence was introduced to show the <b>witness</b> <b>was</b> ever served with a subpoena to testify.|$|R
5000|$|Where the <b>witness</b> <b>is</b> {{hostile to}} the examiner, or {{reluctant}} or unwilling to testify, in which situation the <b>witness</b> <b>is</b> unlikely to accept being [...] "coached" [...] by the questioner.|$|R
5|$|Such <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> {{those who}} cannot hear an idle intemperate expression, {{but they must}} {{immediately}} run to the magistrate to inform; or perhaps wrangling in their cups over night, {{when they were not}} able to speak or apprehend three words of common sense, will pretend to remember everything the next morning, and think themselves very properly qualified to be accusers of their brethren. God be thanked, the throne of our King is too firmly settled to be shaken by the folly and rashness of every sottish companion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Witnesses</b> <b>are</b> {{told that}} they should put the {{interests}} of God's Kingdom first {{in their lives and}} that other secular and recreational pursuits should remain secondary to spiritual matters. <b>Witnesses</b> <b>are</b> frequently instructed through Watch Tower Society publications, and at meetings and conventions, to increase {{the quality and quantity of}} their preaching efforts. Watch Tower Society publications suggest that endurance in public preaching is a requirement for Witnesses to attain salvation, and that evangelizing frees them from blood-guilt regarding individuals who might die at Armageddon without having heard about God's kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The {{committee}} {{takes the}} role of prosecutor, judge and jury when handling its cases. After the hearing is opened with a prayer, the accused is invited to make a personal statement. If there is no admission of guilt, the individual is informed {{of the source of}} the charges and <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> presented one at a time to give evidence. Witnesses do not remain present for the entire hearing. Once all the evidence is presented, the accused and all <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> dismissed and the committee reviews the evidence and the attitude of the accused.|$|E
5000|$|American Legion posts harassed Witnesses nationwide. For example, on June 27, {{members of}} the American Legion forced Witnesses from a trailer camp in Jackson, Mississippi and escorted them across state lines to Louisiana, where they were [...] "passed from county to county, finally winding up in the {{vicinity}} of Dallas, Texas." [...] A Nebraska <b>Witness</b> <b>was</b> castrated. Little Rock <b>Witnesses</b> <b>were</b> beaten with pipes and screwdrivers. West Virginia <b>Witnesses</b> <b>were</b> forced to drink castor oil and then tied together with police department rope. <b>Witnesses</b> <b>were</b> jailed for sedition, distributing literature, holding a parade, and canvassing without a license.|$|R
2500|$|Approximately 80 FBI agents {{conducted}} {{interviews with}} potential witnesses daily. [...] No verbatim {{records of the}} <b>witness</b> interviews <b>were</b> produced; instead, the agents who conducted the interviews wrote summaries that they then submitted. <b>Witnesses</b> <b>were</b> not asked to review or correct the summaries. Included {{in some of the}} <b>witness</b> summaries <b>were</b> drawings or diagrams of what the <b>witness</b> observed. <b>Witnesses</b> <b>were</b> not allowed to testify at the court hearings.|$|R
60|$|The Recorder {{summed up}} against Elizabeth. He {{steadily}} assumed that Nash was always right, and the neighbours always wrong, {{as to the}} girl's original story. He said nothing of Bennet; the tanner's dog had done for Bennet. He said that, if the Enfield <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> right, the Dorset <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> wilfully perjured. He did not add that, if the Dorset <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> right, the Enfield testifiers were perjured.|$|R
25|$|The {{rules of}} {{evidence}} in sharia courts also maintain a distinctive custom of prioritizing oral testimony. Witnesses, in a sharia court system, must be faithful, that is Muslim. Male Muslim <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> deemed more reliable than female Muslim witnesses, and non-Muslim witnesses considered unreliable and receive no priority in a sharia court. In civil cases in some countries, a Muslim woman witness is considered half the worth and reliability than a Muslim man witness. In criminal cases, women <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> unacceptable in stricter, traditional interpretations of sharia, such as those found in Hanbali madhhab.|$|E
25|$|<b>Witnesses</b> <b>are</b> {{urged to}} prepare for {{congregation}} meetings by studying the assigned Watch Tower literature, {{and are expected to}} read all magazines and books published by the Society. One analysis noted that each year <b>Witnesses</b> <b>are</b> expected to read more than 3,000 pages of the Society's publications, according to its suggested program for personal study. Much of the literature is illustrated extensively, with sociologist Andrew Holden observing utopian, post-Armageddon images of happy Witnesses in bright sunshine and pristine environments, often playing with formerly wild animals such as lions and tigers, in contrast to dark-colored images of unfavorable activities such as murders, burglaries and promiscuity that highlight the moral dangers outside the organization.|$|E
25|$|Since Charles Taze Russell's Bible Students {{group had}} formed after the American Civil War {{there was no}} formal {{position}} on military service till 1914, when the body came out against military service.

25|$|A <b>witness's</b> {{testimony}} may <b>be</b> read {{in court}} if the <b>witness</b> <b>is</b> unavailable to attend.|$|R
5000|$|The ICTY {{stated that}} no <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> murdered during either trial. The {{judgments}} of each trial chamber {{can be found}} on the ICTY's website: www.icty.org. There was some confusion over this point because during the first trial, 97 <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> called by the Prosecution to testify against Mr. Haradinaj; however, two did not testify. and one witness died shortly before trial.

25|$|Jehovah's Witnesses {{believe that}} the Bible prohibits ingesting blood and that Christians should not accept blood transfusions or donate or store their own blood for transfusion. The belief {{is based on an}} {{interpretation}} of scripture that differs from that of other Christian denominations. It is one of the doctrines for which Jehovah's <b>Witnesses</b> <b>are</b> best known.|$|E
25|$|In the end, Aslan sends Jill and Eustace {{back to our}} world. Aided by a rejuvenated Caspian, Aslan {{helps them}} repay the school bullies—and make the school better in the process. Aslan shows himself to the bullies, who, seeing only what they take to be a wild lion, are {{severely}} shaken. But no one believes their story, as the only other <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> Jill, Eustace and Caspian.|$|E
25|$|Criticism {{has also}} been {{directed}} at the 1981 change of policy that directed that persons who disassociate from (formally leave) the group were {{to be treated as}} though they were disfellowshipped. Holden says that as a result, those who do leave are seldom allowed a dignified exit. Heather and Gary Botting claim inactive <b>Witnesses</b> <b>are</b> often pressured to either become active or to disassociate themselves by declaring they no longer accept key Watch Tower Society doctrines.|$|E
50|$|Ideally, if {{the report}} of a <b>witness</b> <b>is</b> used, the <b>witness</b> should <b>be</b> asked to confirm and adopt {{it as part of}} his evidence.|$|R

25|$|The {{practices}} of Jehovah's <b>Witnesses</b> <b>are</b> {{based on the}} biblical interpretations of Charles Taze Russell, founder of the Bible Student movement, and successive presidents of the Watch Tower Society, Joseph Franklin Rutherford and Nathan Homer Knorr. Since 1976 they have also been based on decisions made at closed meetings of the group's Governing Body. Instructions regarding activities and acceptable behavior are disseminated through The Watchtower magazine and other official publications, and at conventions and congregation meetings.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} Shari'a {{criminal law}} {{men and women}} are treated differently with regard to evidence and bloodmoney. The testimony of a man has twice the strength of that of a woman. However, with regard to hadd offences and retaliation, the testimonies of female <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> not admitted at all. A number of Muslim-majority countries, particularly in the Arab world, presently treat a woman's testimony as half of a man's in certain cases, mainly in family disputes adjudicated based on Islamic law.|$|E
25|$|The Jamal Abdel Nasser Mosque {{is one of}} the city's largest. The Orthodox Church of Ramallah, an Orthodox Christian convent, Melkite Catholic Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church, Arab Episcopal (Anglican) Church, Ramallah Local Church (Evangelical\Born Again) and Ramallah Baptist Church all operate {{schools in}} the city. A large new church has been built on top of one of the highest hills of Ramallah, {{belonging}} to the Coptic Orthodox Church.

50|$|In United States law, {{an outcry}} <b>witness</b> <b>is</b> {{the person who}} first hears an {{allegation}} of abuse made by a child or another victim of abuse or sexual crime.

25|$|This {{consists}} of references, again either explicit or implicit, to the text, especially during earliest times {{by those who}} had access to reliable sources now lost. Explicit references would be mentioning the text or letter by name, or a recognizable form of that text. Examples include a list of accepted biblical books, such as the Muratorian fragment, or the contents of an early manuscript, such as Papyrus 46. Unfortunately, these <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> often either damaged or too late in date to provide much help.|$|E
25|$|Any Finnish {{citizen who}} refuses to perform both {{military}} and civilian service faces a penalty of 173 days in prison, minus any served days. Such sentences are usually served fully in prison, with no parole. Jehovah's <b>Witnesses</b> <b>are</b> exempted in {{that they may be}} granted a deferment of service for 3 years upon presentation of a certificate from their congregation's minister showing they are an active member of that religious community. Providing they are still an active member 3 years later, there is nothing to stop them getting a further certificate and deferment.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan {{has had a}} {{moratorium}} on executions since 2008. Currently there are approximately 800 people on death row in Pakistan in terrorism related cases. The move comes following the widely held perception that terrorists are never brought to justice in Pakistan. Many times, the judges and <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> too scared {{to come forward and}} award due sentences to the terrorists. And even when the terrorists are convicted and sent to prison, the frail policing system of Pakistan has seen many jailbreaks, including the Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan jailbreaks, in which many high-profile terrorists escaped.|$|E
50|$|In its {{original}} meaning, the word martyr, meaning <b>witness,</b> <b>was</b> {{used in the}} secular sphere {{as well as in}} the New Testament of the Bible. The process of bearing <b>witness</b> <b>was</b> not intended to lead to the death of the <b>witness,</b> although it <b>is</b> known from ancient writers (e.g. Josephus) and from the New Testament that witnesses often died for their testimonies.|$|R
