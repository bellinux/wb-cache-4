The pieces were then apparently stored inside the brains of the cured patients fourteen years ago. Knowing only Walter could comprehend the memories concerning how to open a portal to another reality, the shapeshifters kidnap him. By the time the others find Walter, Newton has already learned <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> know and escapes. Olivia manages to stop them, but is {{forced to choose between}} seizing Newton and saving Walter, as he has been given a lethal dose of a neurotoxin that will kill him unless Newton gives them the correct directions.

The two continue to travel into the dwelling of Haruth and Maruth and, when Mohareb finds out that Thalaba is not evil, attacks him. However, the ring protects Thalaba.

Soon after, Mohareb is also thrown into the pit and Thalaba is able to ask the angels <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> defeat his enemies. He is simply told [...] "faith".|$|E

500|$|As a visibly distraught Rick hesitates {{to shoot}} Dale, Daryl takes {{the gun and}} inevitably shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl {{to pull away from}} interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up in a way he had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't {{want to be a part}} of the group and have those emotions and care about these people. So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant guy, you can do the things that no one else wants to do. He wants to step in and take that burden away from Rick for a moment. Rick is the one who stepped up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and because of his pain over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. But when he sees Rick hesitate to do the same thing with Dale he knows: this is my moment, this is where I can prove my worth, and he steps in and does <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{apparent}} {{failure of the}} cinematic universe's first team-up film, , to establish a successful equivalent to the MCU, Todd VanDerWerff noted that where the MCU has a television-like [...] "showrunner" [...] in Feige, [...] "the visionary behind Marvel's entire slate", the DCEU has director Zack Snyder, whose DC films [...] "seemingly start from the assumption that people have come not to see an individual story but {{a long series of}} teases for other ones. It's like he knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> do but can't focus on the task at hand. TV certainly isn't immune to that problem, but shows that get caught up in high-concept premises and big-picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled." [...] Subsequently, in May 2016, Warner Bros. gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to [...] "unify the disparate elements of the DC movies" [...] and emulate Marvel's success. The two were made producers on the Justice League films, on top of Johns' involvement in several [...] "solo" [...] films, such as the post-production process of Suicide Squad or the writing process of a standalone Batman film. After the successful release of Wonder Woman in June 2017, DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson stating, [...] "Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn’t make sense, but there’s no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you’ll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who’s creating them." [...] Additionally, DC began focusing on films [...] "completely separate from everything else, set entirely outside the" [...] DCEU as part of a new label, with the first centered on the Joker.|$|E

2500|$|As {{their record}} {{improved}} throughout {{the second half}} of the season, the Aggies earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1987. [...] During the tournament, Kavaliauskas averaged 10.5 points and 4.0 rebounds. [...] After winning their first round match-up against Syracuse, the Aggies appeared poised to reach the Sweet 16 when, with 18 seconds left in their second-round game against LSU, teammate Acie Law hit a jumper, giving the Aggies a 57–55 lead. The dream was dashed fifteen seconds later, however, when Darrell Mitchell completed a three-point shot for LSU over the head of Kavaliauskas.

Souders and Peterson also chose not to erase Lois's memory of Clark's secret, something she discovered in the season nine finale. Instead, Lois helped Clark do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> do to get away and fulfill his destiny without telling him that she knows. The producers explained {{that there would be}} [...] "some twists and turns" [...] before Lois tells Clark that she knows.
