In 2010, {{another one of the}} Cardinals' greatest sluggers, Albert Pujols, whose nickname was [...] "El Hombre", said he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> [...] "The Man", even in Spanish, because [...] "There is one man that gets that respect, and that is Stan Musial." [...] Also in 2010, the Cardinals launched a campaign to build support for awarding Musial the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his lifetime of achievement and service. The campaign realized its goal, and on February 15, 2011, Musial was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama who called him [...] "an icon untarnished, a beloved pillar of the community, a gentleman you'd want your kids to emulate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Humperdinck's easygoing {{style and}} good looks {{earned him a}} large following, {{particularly}} among women. His hardcore female fans called themselves [...] "Humperdinckers". [...] "Release Me" [...] was succeeded by two more hit ballads: [...] "There Goes My Everything" [...] and [...] "The Last Waltz", earning him {{a reputation as a}} crooner, a description which he disputed. [...] "If you are not a crooner," [...] he told The Hollywood Reporter writer Rick Sherwood: [...] "It's something you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called.</b> No crooner has the range I have. I can hit notes a bank could not cash. What I am is a contemporary singer, a stylised performer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Watson's The Double Helix {{almost entirely}} refers {{to her as}} [...] "Rosy", the name people at King's College used behind her back. She did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> by that name {{because she had a}} {{great-aunt}} Rosy. In the family, she was called [...] "Ros". To others, she was simply [...] "Rosalind". She made it clear to an American visiting friend Dorothea Raacke, while sitting with her at Crick's table in The Eagle pub in Cambridge: Raacke asked her how she was to be called and she replied [...] "I'm afraid {{it will have to be}} Rosalind", adding [...] "Most definitely not Rosy." ...|$|E

The next girl is named Mariah and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> Prototype.

2500|$|Despite his championship, Louis was {{haunted by}} the earlier defeat to Schmeling. Shortly after winning the title, he was quoted as saying, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> champ until I whip Max Schmeling." [...] Louis's manager Mike Jacobs {{attempted}} to arrange a rematch in 1937, but negotiations broke down when Schmeling demanded 30% of the gate. When Schmeling instead attempted to arrange for a fight against British Empire champion Tommy Farr, known as the [...] "Tonypandy Terror",—ostensibly for a world championship to rival the claims of American boxing authorities—Jacobs outmaneuvered him, offering Farr a guaranteed $60,000 to fight Louis instead. The offer was too lucrative for Farr to turn down.|$|E
2500|$|The Unitas Fratrum or Unity of the Brethren (...) {{was founded}} in 1457 by Bohemian Christian {{followers}} of Jan Hus who were disappointed by the religious development in their country, especially by the wars which were led {{in the name of}} God. They were strongly impacted by the teaching of Petr Chelčický. The early Unity was in touch with the Waldensians. The Bohemian Brethren were known for their radical biblicism. After a certain amount of hesitation they decided to deny the apostolic succession and to establish a distinct church. Considered to be heretics and persecuted by both Roman Catholics and Utraquists (Hussites, Calixtines) they became tolerant to other Christian denominations. They did not believe themselves to be the only true church. They even did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> a church but used the term unity to describe their denomination, for they believed there was only one Church of Christ which was invisible.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "long-simmering resentment in the military" [...] was {{articulated}} publicly by four high-level officers, including Air Force Gen. Roman Gomez Ruiz, {{who called}} on Chávez to [...] "resign peacefully and {{take responsibility for}} your failure." [...] Chávez responded by declaring these officers traitors, ordering their arrest, and forcing their resignations. The Chicago Tribune later reported that although the Venezuelan general public was unaware of it, the country's oil industry was approaching {{the end of a}} six-week work slowdown and Chávez's government and oil executives had agreed that members of an oil board picked by Chávez would resign. [...] "But labor and business leaders, who had joined in secret with dissident military officers in an effort to oust Chávez, decided that the moment had come to press on," [...] the newspaper maintained. [...] "The middle-class intellectuals and professionals who had at first delighted in Chávez's talk of restoring 'national honor'," [...] Sandra Hernandez later observed in The Los Angeles Times, [...] "watched in dismay as Chávez's supporters formed 'Bolivarian circles,' muscle groups that intimidated government opponents with threats of physical harm." [...] During the year or so preceding the coup, Chávez [...] "essentially thumbed his nose" [...] at his opponents, claimed a political consultant. Many opponents of Chávez felt that his behavior was self-destructive and that he would end up [...] "los power through constitutional means via the Supreme Court or the parliament." [...] Nonetheless, according to The New York Times, [...] "discontented military officers had been meeting among themselves and with business leaders for almost a year to discuss ways to oust Mr. Chávez." [...] These military officers [...] "said they would pick the leader," [...] one officer said, because [...] "They did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> a military junta, but they {{wanted to make sure that}} at least one military person was on the transitional board."' ...|$|E
