And of course, your Worship, he had had very little to eat all day, and the drink does go to the head when you have not had enough to eat. Your Worship may not know, but it is the truth. And I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> all through his married life, I have never known him to {{do such a thing}} before, though we have passed through great hardships and [speaking with soft emphasis] I am quite sure he would not have done it if he had been himself at the time.|$|E

5000|$|In modern poetry, Herbert {{advocated}} semantic transparency.

This semantic transparency is the characteristic of a sign consisting in this: that during {{the time when the}} sign is used, attention is directed towards the object denoted, and the sign itself does not hold the attention. The word is a window onto reality." ...|$|E

5000|$|..[...] [...] I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{the book}} before us {{certainly}} contains {{an abundance of}} material {{for the history of}} Hindu mathematics, but the material presented has to be used with caution. The authors, as native Hindu scholars, are certainly possessed of a deep erudition in Hindu literature, but they display a lack of training in the modern methods of philological and historical criticism, which deficiency is still enhanced by a too perspicuous bias and a tendency towards exaggerating the achievements of the Hindu race. As an industrious collection of material and {{as a starting point for}} further critical investigation the present volume is very welcome indeed. But, on the whole, it impresses us as a mathematical panegyric on Hindu history. A history of Hindu mathematics still remains to be written." ...|$|E

Upon his arrival he was greeted by the leaders of the Chilean Communist and Socialist parties. In contrast, his co-defendants Heinz Kessler, Fritz Streletz and Hans Albrecht were sentenced on 16 September 1993 to imprisonment of between four and seven-and-a-half years. On 13 April 1993 a final attempt to separate and continue the trial against Honecker in his absence was discontinued. Four days later, on the 66th birthday of his wife Margot, he gave a final public speech, ending with the words: [...] "Socialism is the opposite of what we have now in Germany. For that I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> our beautiful memories of the German Democratic Republic are testimony of a new and just society.
