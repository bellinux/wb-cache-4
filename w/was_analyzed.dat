5|$|A {{tropical}} depression first formed on August20 {{in the central}} Caribbean Sea from a broad area of low pressure, based on weather reports from weather stations and ships in the vicinity. Moving steadily to the west-northwest towards the western Caribbean, the disturbance slowly intensified, attaining tropical storm strength by 1200UTC the next day. Prior to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project, however, the system <b>was</b> <b>analyzed</b> to be an open trough up until August22. The tropical storm began to move more towards {{the west in the}} Gulf of Mexico after clipping the Guanahacabibes Peninsula—the westernmost region of Cuba—late on August22.|$|E
5|$|Data on Kepler-40 <b>was</b> <b>analyzed</b> {{by a team}} of French and Swiss astronomers, {{who first}} tested for false positives.

Collected data was then checked to see if it corresponded with that of a closely orbiting binary star or that of a planet; it was found to be that of a planet, leading to the confirmation of Kepler-40b.|$|E
5|$|In early August, an extratropical trough {{moved off}} the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, with a {{stationary}} front extending from it. A weak low-pressure area began to develop {{at the southern end of}} the front just offshore of Jacksonville, Florida. Initially, the storm had an open center of circulation and remained a frontal low as it moved southwestward across Florida, and thus was not considered a fully tropical system at the time. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, however, observations indicated that the disturbance developed a closed center of circulation. As a result, the storm <b>was</b> <b>analyzed</b> to have developed into a tropical depression off the western coast of Florida at 1200UTC on August3. At the time, weather reports revealed a definite cyclonic rotation, though the depression had a shallow minimum barometric pressure of 1012.5mbar (hPa; 29.90inHg). Moving west-southwest, the depression steadily intensified and attained tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on August4. Late that evening, the tropical storm executed a slight northward curve. Strengthening continued into the following day, and ships in the storm's vicinity began to report a much stronger storm than was previously suggested. A ship reported the first gale-force winds associated with the storm at 2100UTC on August4. The S.S. Connecticut observed force11 winds, the strongest wind measurement associated with the storm as recorded by vessel. A minimum pressure of 995mbar (hPa; 29.39inHg) <b>was</b> <b>analyzed</b> for the system at 0600UTC on August5 based on an observation from a nearby ship.|$|E

5|$|On November 2, a trough of {{low-pressure}} <b>was</b> <b>analyzed</b> {{near the}} Lesser Antilles. The system moved westward into the Caribbean Sea without much organization. On November 7, the low-pressure area moved south of Cuba and became sufficiently organized {{to be considered}} a tropical depression with a pressure of at least 1010 mbar (hPa; 29.83 inHg). The depression moved over Cuba and into the Atlantic, where it dissipated the following day. On November 9, a second system was detected northeast of Bermuda with a pressure of 1005 mbar (hPa; 29.68 inHg), though it remained unclear whether the two systems were related.|$|E
5|$|On October 23, an open trough was {{centered}} north of Hispaniola near the Turks and Caicos islands. At 0000 UTC the following day, {{the area of}} disturbed weather became organized and <b>was</b> <b>analyzed</b> to have become a tropical storm southeast of Inagua, based on nearby vessel reports. Initially, the storm drifted northward, but later began to accelerate towards the northeast after a roughly 12-hour period. At 0600 UTC on September 25, the disturbance slightly gained in intensity to attain maximum wind speeds of 45 mph (75 km/h); these would be the strongest winds associated with the storm as a fully tropical cyclone. A reanalysis of the system indicated that {{due to a lack}} of definite tropical features, the storm may have had been a subtropical cyclone. On October 26, the system became increasingly asymmetric and had developed frontal boundaries, allowing for it to be classified as an extratropical cyclone at 0600 UTC that day. Once transitioning into an extratropical system, the storm continued to intensified as it moved northward. On October 27, the system <b>was</b> <b>analyzed</b> to have a minimum pressure of at least 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg) after passing to the southeast of Bermuda. At 1200 UTC later that day, the cyclone reached an extratropical peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) just east of Newfoundland. Had the storm been tropical at the time, it would have been classified as a modern-day Category 1 hurricane. Subsequently, the extratropical storm curved eastward, where it persisted before dissipating by 1800 UTC on September 29.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{hurricane}} {{can be traced to}} a compact and slow-moving low-pressure area in the open Atlantic Ocean in late August1940. As the system progressed in a west-northwest direction, its center of circulation became more organized. As a result, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda at 1200UTC on August26. Operationally, the storm <b>was</b> <b>analyzed</b> to have undergone tropical cyclogenesis on August30. However, a reanalysis of the storm conducted in 2012 found that the system was already organized prior. In its initial stages, the depression remained weak, with few ships reporting abnormally strong winds in association with the storm. Continuing in a slow west-northwest movement, the disturbance gradually intensified, and <b>was</b> <b>analyzed</b> to have attained tropical storm intensity by 1800UTC on August28. At 0600UTC on August30, the tropical storm strengthened further into the equivalent of a modern-day Category1hurricane, roughly 225mi (360km) east of the Florida peninsula. At the same time, the hurricane began to intensify and move quicker than it had previously. Later that day, a ship within the periphery of the storm reported winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a barometric pressure of 979mbar (hPa; 28.90inHg).|$|E
