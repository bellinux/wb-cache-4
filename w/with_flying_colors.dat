25|$|Hamilton's wartime {{experiences}} exerted their influence, drawing {{him from}} private medical practice into a commission as an Assistant Surgeon in the United States Army (1874) {{and after he}} resigned from the Army, into the Regular Corps of the Marine Hospital Service (MHS). In 1876, the 24-year-old Hamilton sat for the first examination for entrance into MHS, passed <b>with</b> <b>flying</b> <b>colors,</b> and was commissioned as an Assistant Surgeon on Oct 21, 1876. His talent in public health practice revealed itself early, during an 1877 assignment to the Boston Marine Hospital at Chelsea, Massachusetts. Changing land use in the area had blocked hospital sewage from draining properly, causing unexpected outbreaks of infectious disease among patients. Hamilton resolved the crisis successfully by directing a renovation of the facility's drainage and sewage systems.|$|E

They duel a final time with Montross wearing his Mandalorian helmet and jetpack. Jango finally defeats Montross, {{who wishes to}} have a warrior's death. Fett, {{as a means of}} revenge for his murder of Rozatta, lets the Bando Gora tear Montross to pieces as he walks away. Upon {{entering}} the castle, he is taken prisoner. He is tortured both physically and mentally by Vosa. However, Wesell then arrives, but is injured by Vosa. As Vosa moves to kill her, Wesell blasts Jango's restraints, freeing him. Fett follows a fleeing Vosa through the castle and ultimately fatally wounds her. As she lies defeated she is force choked by Darth Tyranus, who then steps from the shadows. Tyranus explains that the entire ordeal was a test, and that Fett has passed <b>with</b> <b>flying</b> <b>colors.</b> He offers Fett a considerably larger sum to go to Kamino, to be the template for a clone army. Fett agrees, on the condition that he gets the first unaltered clone for himself. The game ends with Fett carrying the wounded Wesell to Slave I.|$|E

She also praised Searle's performance saying, [...] "When Irina described cutting up Callum's body it was with an eerie coldness. She liked the man and he cared for her.

[...] The 19th then faced to the east, with the 18th Virginia to the left, and the 19th Mississippi and 17th Virginia to the left, and the 28th Virginia came up in reserve The 19th then came [...] under heavy fire from the Federals in the pine thicket. [...] The 19th began to fall back, but General Pickett and Lieutenant Colonel Gantt rallied the men and ordered them up. [...] Later in the day, the 19th fixed bayonets and charged the Federal position. [...] The Federal troops were driven by Pickett's men for a mile. [...] During the charge, the 19th captured a battery of seven guns and over 200 Federals.
