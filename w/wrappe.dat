40|$|Abstract—Numerical Lagrangian {{trajectory}} modeling is {{a natural}} method of investigating transport in a circulation system and understanding the physics on {{the wide range of}} length scales that are actually experienced by a drifter. A previously-developed tool, TRACMASS, written in Fortran, accomplishes this modeling with a clever algorithm that operates natively on the commonly used staggered Arakawa C grid. TracPy is a Python wrapper written to ease running batches of simulations. Some improvements in TracPy include updating to netCDF 4 -CLASSIC from netCDF 3 for saving drifter trajectories, providing an iPython notebook as a usermanual for using the system, and adding unit tests for stable continued development.

We present explicit solutions of the WILL-brane (Weyl-Invariant Light-Like brane) equations of motion in various gravitational backgrounds of physical relevance exhibiting the following new phenomena: (i) In spherically symmetric static backgrounds the WILL-brane automatically positions itself on (materializes) the event horizon of the corresponding black hole solutions, thus providing an explicit dynamical realization of the membrane paradigm in black hole physics; (ii) In product spaces (of interest in Kaluza-Klein context) the WILL-brane <b>wrappes</b> non-trivially around the compact (internal) dimensions and moves as a whole with the speed of light in the non-compact (space-time) dimensions. ...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{terminology}} {{services has}} resulted in development of applications and definition of standards, but has not yet led to widespread use of (standardized) terminology services in practice. Current terminology services offer functionality both for concept representation and lexical knowledge representation, hampering the possibility of combining the strengths of dedicated (concept and lexical) services. We therefore propose an extensible architecture in which concept-related and lexicon-related components are integrated and made available through a uniform interface. This interface can be extended in order to conform to existing standards, {{making it possible to}} use dedicated (third-party) components in a standardized way. As a proof of concept and a reference implementation, a SOAP-based Java implementation of the terminology service is being developed, providing wrappers for Protégé and UMLS Knowledge Source Server. Other systems, such as the Description Logic-based reasoner RACER can be easily integrated by implementation of an appropriate <b>wrappe...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a communication network}} targeted for complex system-on-chip (SoC) and network-on-chip (NoC) designs. The Heterogeneous IP Block Interconnection (HIBI) aims at maximum efficiency and minimum energy per transmitted bit combined with quality-of-service (QoS) in transfers. Other features include support for hierarchical topologies with several clock domains, flexible scalability, and runtime reconfiguration of network parameters. HIBI is intended for integrating coarse-grain components such as intellectual property (IP) blocks that have size of thousands of gates. HIBI has been implemented in VHDL and SystemC and synthesized on several CMOS technologies and on FPGA. A 32 -bit wrapper requires 5400 gates and runs with 315 MHz on 0. 18 μm technology which shows that only minimal area overhead is paid for the advanced features. The area and frequency results are well comparable to other NoC proposals. Furthermore, data transfers are shown to approach the maximum theoretical performance for protocol efficiency. HIBI network is accompanied with a design framework with tools for optimizing the system through automated design space exploration.

40|$|Boldyreva et al. {{introduced}} {{the notion of}} multiple forking (MF) {{as an extension of}} (general) forking to accommodate nested oracle replay attacks. The primary objective of a (multiple) forking algorithm is to separate out the oracle replay attack from the actual simulation of protocol to the adversary, and this is achieved through the intermediary of a so-called wrapper algorithm. Multiple forking {{has turned out to be}} a useful tool in the security argument of several cryptographic protocols. However, a reduction employing the MF Algorithm incurs a significant degradation of O q 2 n, where q denotes the upper bound on the underlying random oracle calls and n, the number of forkings. In this work we take a closer look at the reasons for the degradation with a tighter se-curity bound in mind. We nail down the exact set of conditions for the success of the MF Algorithm. A careful analysis of the protocols (and corresponding security argument) em-ploying multiple forking allow us to relax the overly restrictive conditions of the original MF Algorithm. To achieve this, we club two consecutive invocations of the underlying <b>wrappe...</b>|$|E
40|$|In this letter, we {{introduce}} a general theory {{for the construction}} of particle physics theories, with three families and realistic gauge groups, within the context of heterotic M-theory. This is achieved using semi-stable holomorphic gauge bundles over elliptically fibered Calabi–Yau three-folds. Construction of realistic theories is facilitated by the appearance of non-perturbative five-branes in the vacuum. The complete moduli space of these five-branes is computed and their worldvolume gauge theory discussed. It is shown, within the context of holomorphic gauge bundles, how grand unified gauge groups can be spontaneously broken to the gauge group of the standard model. These ideas are illustrated in an explicit SU(5) three-family example. In seminal work, Horava and Witten [1] and Witten [2] showed that, by compactifying M-theory on an orbifold interval, S 1 /Z 2, times a Calabi–Yau three-fold, X, N = 1 supersymmetric E 8 × E 8 gauge theories with chiral fermions can arise in four dimensions. In [4, 5], the effective five-dimensional heterotic M-theory was constructed and its static vacuum shown to be an exact pair of BPS three-branes located at the orbifold planes. More recently [6], this work was extended by the inclusion in the vacuum of five-branes <b>wrappe...</b>|$|E
40|$|JmjC domain-containing {{proteins}} {{have been}} shown to possess histone demethylase activity. One of these proteins is the Drosophila histone H 3 lysine 4 demethylase Little imaginal discs (Lid), which has been genetically classified as a Trithorax group protein. However, contrary to the supposed function of Lid in gene activation, the biochemical activity of this protein entails the removal of a histone mark that is correlated with active transcription. To understand the molecular mechanism behind the function of Lid, we have purified a Lid-containing protein complex from Drosophila embryo nuclear extracts. In addition to Lid, the complex contains Rpd 3, CG 3815 /Drosophila Pf 1, CG 13367, and Mrg 15. Rpd 3 is a histone deacetylase, and along with Polycomb group proteins, which antagonize the function of Trithorax group proteins, it negatively regulates transcription. By reconstituting the Lid complex, we demonstrated that the demethylase activity of Lid is not affected by its association with other proteins. However, the deacetylase activity of Rpd 3 is greatly diminished upon incorporation into the Lid complex. Thus, our finding that Lid antagonizes Rpd 3 function provides an explanation for the genetic classification of Lid as a positive transcription regulator. Gene transcription is regulated in part by modulating the conformation of chromatin, which consists of DNA <b>wrappe...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recently, the {{application}} of magnetic particles for targeted drug delivery has received considerable attention. For example, manipulation of magnetic particles coated with drugs or encapsulated inside drug droplets into target tissues via external magnetic field has been studied [1]. Usually, a strong magnetic field on the order Tesla is applied outside human body to generate the needed magnetic forces for effective manipulation of the particles. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the targeted drug delivery, {{it is important to}} understand how the magnetic particles or aggregates interact with external magnetic fields for a more precise and selective manipulation. To conduct such study, a localized magnetic source with controllable field generation will be necessary. Using a simple and straightforward microfabrication process, we have designed, fabricated and tested a new micro magnetic probe and successfully demonstrated micro manipulation of biocompatible alginate droplets containing magnetic particles. The developed magnetic probe consists of a tungsten core with a sharp tip (radius: 0. 5 µm), coated with an electroplated permalloy layer (~ 25 µm) for magnetic field focusing (Fig. 1). During electroplating, a special anode-cathode configuration with reduced plate separation is utilized to maintain the probe tip profile (Fig 2 a and 2 b).
