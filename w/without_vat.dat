In {{the first half}} of 2011, however, BINA Istra reported 65.8millionkuna (€8.9million) of income in {{the first half of}} 2011, <b>without</b> <b>VAT.</b> This income represented a 30.8percent increase compared to the same period in the previous year. (The figure includes income from the entire Istrian Y system, i.e., both the A8 and A9 motorways.) Most of this increase is attributed to the introduction of a closed toll system along the routes, replacing an open toll system in which a toll was charged only at the Mirna Bridge (along the A9 motorway) and the Učka Tunnel. In 1999, the Croatian government negotiated amendments to the BINA Istra concession contract. These amendments allow the government to determine tolls along the A8 and A9 motorways, and the government decided to eliminate tolls on traffic flowing along the two-lane sections of the routes; to compensate for this loss of income, the government subsidizes BINA Istra– for instance, in 2012 it is expected to receive a 165millionkuna (million) subsidy. By the end of 2010, the subsidy paid to BINA Istra reached a total of 1.3billionkuna (million); at the time, it was estimated that a further sum of 1.9billionkuna (million) may be paid in annual subsidies between 2011 and 2027, when the concession contract expires. BINA Istra estimates the total investment value of the construction it has carried out or planned on the A8 and A9 routes at one billion euros.|$|E

The scheme, identified by British magazine Private Eye, utilizes offshore holding companies in Luxembourg and partnership agreements to reduce corporation tax liability by up to £50 million a year. Another scheme previously identified by Private Eye involved depositing £1 billion in a Swiss partnership, and then loaning out that money to overseas Tesco stores, so that profit can be transferred indirectly through interest payments. This scheme is still in operation and is estimated to be costing the UK exchequer up to £20 million a year in corporation tax.

40|$|We {{explore the}} effects of a {{temporary}} cut in VAT, identifying three possible effects: an income effect as people benefit from a lower cost of living during the period of the reduction, a substitution effect as people bring their consumption forward and an arbitrage effect as people buy non-perishable goods {{before the end of the}} period of low VAT for consumption after the VAT rate as been raised. International evidence suggests a clear overall impact on consumption, although the nature of the pattern depends on the way in which the data are analysed. However, the key policy issue is the impact of the VAT change on output and to examine that a simulation model of the whole economy is needed. Evidence from the National Institute’s Global Economic Model suggests that the impact of the recent VAT reduction is likely to build up during the course of 2009. The reduction in VAT from 17 % to 15 % is likely to result in consumption being augmented by less than 1 per cent by the fourth quarter of 2009.

We sought to determine the prevalence, distribution, and risk factor correlates of high TAT. Methods and Results-—Participants from the Framingham Heart Study (n= 3246, 48 % women, mean age 51. 1 years) underwent multidetector computed tomography; high TAT and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were defined on the basis of sex-specific 90 th percentiles in a healthy referent sample. The prevalence of high TAT was 38. 1 % in women and 35. 7 % in men. Among individuals <b>without</b> high <b>VAT,</b> 10. 1 % had high TAT. After adjustment for age and VAT, both women and men with high TAT in the absence of high VAT were older and had a higher prevalence of CVD (P< 0. 0001) compared with those without high TAT. In addition, men in this group were more likely to be smokers (P= 0. 02), whereas women were more likely to have low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P= 0. 005).

40|$|Harmonization of tax {{systems of}} the European Union member states {{has been going on}} since 1950 s. This trend is {{followed}} to this day in order to achieve one of the primary objectives of the European Union, single domestic market. The harmonization of tax systems allows free movement of capital, goods, and services. Value added tax is harmonized through the EU Directives that have unified tax object, tax base and partly tax rates. The Court of Justice of the European Union also plays a vital role in the harmonization, because the European case law complements the interpretation of the directives and creates a comprehensive impact throughout the harmonization. This thesis analyses the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which have been implemented in the VAT Act, and examines at the same time impact of the implementation.

BackgroundHemodialysis vascular access thrombosis (VAT) {{is a significant}} cause of morbidity for hemodialysis patients and results, in part, from decreased access flow potentially caused by venous outflow stenosis. We have previously shown ultrasound dilution (UD) to be a practical and reliable predictor of venous outflow in children receiving hemodialysis. MethodsThe current study {{is the first to}} our knowledge {{to assess the impact of}} a proactive UD monitoring program upon VAT in pediatric patients. Nine patients experienced 18 VAT over the two-year study. Mean values for variables potentially associated with VAT were compared to values from a size-matched seven patient group <b>without</b> <b>VAT</b> during the study period. VAT rates were compared between the year-before (pre-UD era) and year-after (UD era) UD was initiated. During the latter half of the UD era (rapid referral period), patients with VA flow rate (QAcorr) < 650 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 were referred for balloon angioplasty within 48 hours. ResultsMean QAcorr was lower for patients with subsequent VAT (562 ± 290 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2) versus patients <b>without</b> <b>VAT</b> (1005 ± 372 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2; P = 0. 02). The VAT rate was significantly lower in the UD era (4. 1 VAT/ 100 patient-months) versus the pre-UD era (11. 0 VAT/ 100 patient-months; P = 0. 03). The decrease in VAT rates was caused predominantly in the rapid referral period, where the VAT rate dropped to 0. 96 VAT/ 100 patient-months (P < 0. 001). Cost of vascular access management was 65 % higher ($ 1264 vs. $ 765 /patient-month) in the pre-UD era, reflecting the increased cost for treatment of VAT. ConclusionsMonthly QAcorr < 650 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 is predictive of imminent VAT in children receiving hemodialysis. Prompt referral for angioplasty of VA with QAcorr < 650 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 leads to decreased VAT rates in children...|$|E
40|$|This study {{develops}} a dynamic general equilibrium model, applied to Pakistani data, in which optimizing agents evade taxes by {{operating in the}} underground economy. The cost to firms of evading taxes is that they find themselves subject to credit rationing from banks. Our model simulations show that {{in the absence of}} budgetary flexibility to adjust expenditures, raising tax rates too high drives firms into the underground economy, thereby reducing the tax base. Aggregate investment in the economy is lowered because of credit rationing. Taxes that are too low eliminate the underground economy, but result in unsustainable budget and trade deficits. Thus, the optimal rate of taxation, from a macroeconomic point of view, may lead to some underground activity. We note, in particular, that incorporating a <b>VAT</b> <b>without</b> any other tax reductions greatly reduces the tax compliance of the service sector. We have applied our model to Pakistan, and have calibrated our model to an 8 year period from 2004 - 2011. We note that it gives a reasonable approximation of Pakistani macro data. We then use a sectoral breakdown of tax data generated by the model to estimate tax gaps on a sector by sector basis. We note that certain sectors are currently paying taxes below their potential, while others may be above their tax potential. These sectoral gap estimates may be used as indicators of where greater tax enforcement efforts should be directed...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{literature}} on commodity tax competition among countries in the European Union (EU). The motivation for {{this may be due}} to the fact that different value-added tax (<b>VAT)</b> <b>without</b> physical border control induces cross-border shoppers who pay the VAT of other countries rather than their own. Since such cross-border shopping among the EU member countries directly affects each government revenues, tax competition is an essential economic problem for the EU to solve. Also, there is an evident relationship between the geographical elements of countries and the present VAT rates in the EU, as pointed out in Kanbur and Keen(1993), and Ohsawa(1999, 2001). Thus, it is worthy to close examine the tax revenue and cross-border activity based on commodity tax competition within a geographical setting. Analytical studies on commodity tax competition in a linear market has received attention in the literature for the last few years. The exsisting studies clarified the impact of the spatial characteristics such as country size and position on tax rates, tax revenues, and number of cross-border shoppers. However, one of their common limitation is the assumption of a linear market, even though countries in real world are laid out in a two-dimensional market. To the best of our knowledge, analytical approaches on tax competition in two-dimensional market have received remarkably little attention from researchers. Thus, this paper is an attempt to overcome the said limitation of the previous studies. It aims to set up a Nash game between two neighboring countries in two-dimensional market, and to analyze how the two-dimensional market characterizes Nash equilibrium. When one turns from a one-dimensional market to a two-dimensional market, the essential difference between the two markets is country shape such as the length and curvature of the national border. In order to pinpoint the effects of such spatial characteristics, we employ the simplest model. This paper proves three conclusions in a geographical sense. First, small country sets lower tax than big country, and per capita revenue of small country is larger than big country. Second, these two countries are subject to fiercer competitive pressure in a more curved and/or longer national border. Finally, the impact of border curvature on tax and revenue differences are always incompatible with that on tax and revenue ratios. ...|$|R
