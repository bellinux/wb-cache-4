5|$|Though he was {{initially}} unsure whether he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> university, Fox's mother {{convinced him to}} enrol at Simon Fraser University, where he studied kinesiology as a stepping stone to becoming a physical education teacher. He tried out for the junior varsity basketball team, earning a spot ahead of more talented players due to his determination.|$|E
5|$|He {{graduated}} from Hall High School with a National Merit Scholarship. He helped take their swim {{team to the}} state championship, filling in for a sick teammate by swimming two legs of a relay. Clark has often repeated the anecdote that he decided he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> West Point after meeting a cadet with glasses who told Clark (who wore glasses as well) that one did not need perfect vision to attend West Point as Clark had thought. Clark applied, and he was accepted on April 24, 1962.|$|E
5|$|To {{continue}} his studies, Champollion <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Paris, Grenoble offering few possibilities for such specialized subjects as ancient languages. His brother thus stayed in Paris from August to September that same year, {{so as to}} seek his admission in a specialized school. Before leaving however Champollion presented, on the 1st September 1807, his Essay on the Geographical Description of Egypt before the Conquest of Cambyses before the Academy of Grenoble whose members were so impressed that they admitted him to the Academy six months later.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{came from}} a poor family, and he {{had dropped out of}} the {{cheapest}} college he could afford. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal. His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>To</b> persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.|$|E
5|$|He {{was given}} to {{sketching}} and drawing from an early age, without encouragement from his family. However, when he turned sixteen and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Stockholm to study art, they were enthusiastic for him and backed him financially. In 1898, {{he was one of}} the 40 applicants to study at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, and although he was deemed well qualified for a place at the academy, he was too young to be accepted. He spent the next two years at the Kaleb Ahltins school for painters. During this time he was, like most teenagers, torn between hope and despair, something that is reflected in his artwork.|$|E
5|$|The next season, Leeds drew Turkish side Beşiktaş in the UEFA Champions League. Security {{surrounding}} both matches {{was increased}} and planned {{several months in}} advance. Because of the tensions caused by the stabbings in Istanbul, only 70 Beşiktaş fans travelled to Leeds. They had originally been booked onto an official Beşiktaş chartered flight, however, it was cancelled as was pre-match hospitality prepared by Leeds' directors. The flight, sponsored by Beşiktaş fans, was cancelled because only 70 out of a hoped-for 500 fans <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the match. In the return leg, Beşiktaş placed Leeds fans, who had been escorted through the airport, on an alcohol-free cruise around the Bosphorus Strait before being transported by bus to the BJK İnönü Stadium in Istanbul before the match.|$|E

While effects cinematographer Don Dow <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sea and record plumes of water created by exploding detonating cords in the water, the team decided to create the probe's climatic effect in another way after a government fishing agency voiced concerns {{for the welfare of}} marine life in the area. The team used a combination of baking soda and cloud tank effects; the swirling mist created by the water-filled tank was shot on black velvet, and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint into the tank. These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with overlaid lightning effects, created by double-exposing lights as they moved across the screen.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} Gui's disappearance, four men came to search his {{apartment}} – ostensibly for his computer – but left without it. A manager from the estate where Gui lived attempted to contact Gui {{on the number}} of the person who called her last regarding Gui. A taxi driver answered, saying that four men had left the telephone in the taxi, and that they had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Poipet, a border town in Cambodia. Gui was last heard from on 6 November when he called his wife to tell her that he was safe but was unwilling to reveal his whereabouts. The Thai authorities have no record of Gui leaving the country. Gui's family contacted the Swedish embassy, and the Swedish police filed a report through Interpol. The Guardian observed that the Thai government had done little to advance the case, noting that the military junta was becoming increasingly accommodating to Chinese demands.|$|E
5|$|Gui Minhai (桂民海, age 51) is a Swedish {{national}} {{and one of}} the three shareholders of Mighty Current. He was taken away from his home in Pattaya, Thailand by an unknown man on 17 October 2015. Gui had written some 200 books during his ten years as author/publisher. He kept his movements to himself and his communications routed, and his work projects would also be shrouded in secrecy. Gui has not set foot inside the PRC for a long period – he never attended to his father when he was ill, and did not return upon his death. It is known that his home in Thailand was later searched by four Chinese men, who attempted to seize Gui's computer. A manager from the estate where Gui lived, in an effort to contact Gui, dialled the number that last called her regarding Gui, to be told by a taxi driver that the four men, who had left the telephone in the taxi, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a border town in Cambodia. He was last heard from on 6 November when he called his wife to tell her that he was safe but was unwilling to reveal his whereabouts. Gui's family contacted the Swedish embassy, and the Swedish police filed a report through Interpol, but the Guardian, noting that the military junta was becoming increasingly accommodating to Chinese demands, observed that the Thais had done little to advance the case.

5|$|After electing to bat, Australia {{made history}} {{on the first}} day by {{breaking}} the record for the most runs scored in a first-class match in a day. Ironically, {{it was the only time}} they were dismissed in a single day on the entire tour. With centuries from Brown (153), Bradman (187), Loxton (120) and Saggers (104*), Australia's first innings totalled 721; they were dismissed on the close of the first day's play. Bradman's 187 came in 155 minutes and Brown's 153 lasted three hours; the pair put on 219 in 90 minutes after Barnes fell for 79 at 145/1. Bradman came in and seized the initiative, reaching 42 in the 20 minutes before lunch, including five fours from one over by Frank Vigar which subsequently entered Essex club folklore. Bradman and Brown were parted when the latter fell at 364/2 only halfway through the day's play. Miller then famously deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball as a protest against Australia's merciless crushing of their hosts, something that angered his captain and batting partner Bradman. Miller later told Dickie Bird that he had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the local horse races, but this was refused by Bradman. The all rounder therefore made his duck in protest, but still did not get to go to the races. Later, Loxton and Saggers made 166 in 65 minutes for the sixth wicket, before a late-order collapse saw Australia lose 5/57, leaving Saggers unbeaten, but not before he reached the only first-class century of his career. After being demoralised by the Australian batsmen {{on the first day}}, Essex made only 83 in their first innings, capitulating within 37 overs. Toshack took 5/31 and Miller 3/14, and Australia enforced the follow-on. Essex's second innings appeared to be heading the same way when four early wickets to Johnson had them at 46/6. However, a partnership of 133 between Tom Pearce and Peter Smith for the seventh wicket salvaged some respectability before they were out for 187. Johnson ended with 6/37 as the Australians dismissed their hosts twice in a single day. The ground attendance of 32,000 was a record.|$|E
