5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

500|$|Ahead of a March2011 {{friendly}} against United States, Chapman unexpectedly {{withdrew from}} the England squad and quit international football. The decision, related to Chapman's family commitments, {{was reported to have}} left England's World Cup preparations in disarray. Hope Powell praised Chapman as [...] "a wonderful servant to England over the years". Chapman later confirmed she had been unhappy about a perceived lack of support with childcare costs and arrangements while on international duty. At the 2011 World Cup, Powell stressed that the FA had tried hard to accommodate Chapman's requirements: [...] "Katie was away <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> 2009 when we paid for her family to come along {{but at the end of}} the day there is not a bottomless pit of money in the women's game." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Confederate States of America, God Save the South was the {{official}} national anthem. [...] However, Dixie {{was the most}} popular.

[...] At an April 9, 1865, rally, the band director was surprised when Lincoln requested that the band play Dixie. [...] Lincoln said, [...] "That tune is now Federal property...good to show the rebels that, <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> power, they will be free to hear it again". The other prominent tune was The Bonnie Blue Flag, and like Dixie was written in 1861, unlike Union popular tunes which were written throughout the war.|$|E

500|$|At one stage, Bradman went 13 {{first-class}} innings {{without a}} century, the longest such spell of his career, prompting suggestions that Bodyline had eroded his confidence and altered his technique. After three Tests, {{the series was}} one–one and Bradman had scored 133runs in five innings. The Australians travelled to Sheffield and played a warm up game before the Fourth Test. Bradman started slowly and then, [...] "...the old Bradman [...] back <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> <b>in</b> the twinkling of an eye, almost". He went on to make 140, with the last 90runs coming in just 45minutes. On {{the opening day of}} the Fourth Test at Headingley (Leeds), England were out for 200, but Australia slumped to 3/39, losing the third wicket from the last ball of the day. Listed to bat at number five, Bradman would start his innings the next day.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the 2007–08 season, Bristol City manager Gary Johnson stated his {{intention}} to send Myrie-Williams out on loan {{in order to gain}} more first-team experience. Johnson believed that Myrie-Williams would only benefit from a loan move to a League One club, given that he was playing in the third tier of English football prior to Bristol City's promotion to the Championship during the 2006–07 campaign. Two days {{before the start of the}} 2007–08 season, Myrie-Williams joined Cheltenham Town on a month's loan. He made his debut for Cheltenham in the club's 1–0 home win against Gillingham on the first day of the season, coming on as a substitute in the 68th minute. Myrie-Williams made a further substitute appearance in a 1–0 defeat at Millwall a week later, before starting his first game in a 1–1 draw with Swindon Town on 25 August 2007. After making four first-team appearances for Cheltenham, Myrie-Williams' loan was extended for a further month, running until 6 October 2007. Cheltenham Town manager John Ward said [...] "I am really pleased that Jennison will be staying <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> <b>In</b> the last two or three games he has started to show his tremendous pace and ability on the ball". His loan was extended yet again in October 2007, taking him into a third month with Cheltenham. He scored his first goal for Cheltenham in a 3–1 away win at Swindon Town in the Football League Trophy, scoring the first goal of the game, [...] "finishing neatly after a superb through ball from Craig Reid". He made his final appearance for Cheltenham in a 2–2 home draw with Crewe Alexandra, coming on as a substitute as Cheltenham scored two late goals to salvage a point. After the game, Myrie-Williams suffered a knee injury in training, ruling him out of first-team action for two weeks. He made 13 appearances for Cheltenham during his three-month loan spell, scoring one goal— he returned to his parent club in early November 2007.|$|E
