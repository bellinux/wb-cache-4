5|$|The {{final game}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> {{modified}} roulette wheel split into 36 alternately coloured sections (18 red and 18 black), awarding a £1m prize if the player chose the correct colour. Red or Black? {{made its first}} millionaire in the first show, with bricklayer Nathan Hageman, from Reading, winning on red. The following night the second millionaire was made, with carer Kevin Cartwright also winning on red. Two further millionaires, Darren Thompson and Gary Brocklesby, were made during the series.|$|E

There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> projection screen that resembled the magical mirror from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Also present was a mechanical magic carpet in which Spears sat and {{flew over the}} first 100 feet above the crowd. Spears, who had five costumes changes during the show, was joined on stage by eight dancers. The setlist consisted of nine songs, seven from her debut album and two unreleased songs from her then upcoming album, Oops!... I Did It Again (2000).|$|E
5|$|The novella {{illustrates}} the differences perspectives can make. The stories {{told in the}} Odyssey by Nestor and Menelaus to Telemachus, and Odysseus to a Scherian court make Odysseus into a hero as he fights monsters and seduces goddesses. According to Penelope in The Penelopiad, Odysseus was a liar who drunkenly fought a one-eyed bartender then boasted it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> cannibalistic cyclops. Homer portrays Penelope as loyal, patient, and the ideal wife, as he contrasts her to Clytemnestra who killed Agamemnon upon his return from Troy. In The Penelopiad, Penelope feels compelled {{to tell her story}} because she is unsatisfied with Homer's portrayal of her and the other myths about her sleeping with the suitors and giving birth to Pan. She rejects the role of the ideal wife and admits she was just trying to survive. The Odyssey makes the maids into traitors who consort with the suitors. From the maids' perspective, they were innocent victims, used by Penelope to spy, raped and abused by the suitors, and then murdered by Odysseus and Telemachus. Atwood shows the truth occupies a third position between the myths and the biased points of view.|$|E

25|$|Construction of the {{terminal}} cost 26 million Norwegian kroner. The delays caused NSB and Linjegods to instead establish Rolvsøy Terminal in Fredrikstad. Without customers, {{the terminal}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> fluke and became nicknamed Tiananmen Square. In 1989 the operating company had a revenue of 14,495 kroner and operating costs of 5 million kroner. Major investors such as Kredittkassen and Selmer Furuholmen sold, with the municipality becoming the dominant owner. By 1991 only Myrene Transport had established itself in the area.|$|E
25|$|Charlemagne Tower <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> of his time, {{leaving an}} {{indelible}} footprint {{on the history}} of the United States. He is credited with creating the mining industry in Minnesota, as well as attracting settlers to the area. He was deeply involved in the mining industry in Pennsylvania, and was part of the ascension of the Reading Railroad. Towns in three states are named after him. He served on the board of overseers for Harvard University, and was involved in many business ventures, many of them successful.|$|E

25|$|Layered deposits, called {{interior}} layered deposits (ILDs), {{in various}} parts of Valles Marineris, especially Candor Chasma and Juventae Chasma, have led many researchers to believe that they were formed when the whole area <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> lake. However, many other ideas have been advanced to explain them. High-resolution structural and geologic mapping in west Candor Chasma, presented in March 2015, showed that the deposits {{on the floor of the}} Candor chasma are basin-filling sediments that were deposited in a wet playa-like setting; hence water was involved in their formation.|$|E
25|$|In late 1824, Jim Bridger {{became the}} first known English-speaking person to sight the Great Salt Lake. Due to the high {{salinity}} of its waters, Bridger thought {{he had found the}} Pacific Ocean; he subsequently found that this body of water <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> salt lake. After the discovery of the lake, hundreds of American and Canadian traders and trappers established trading posts in the region. In the 1830s, thousands of migrants traveling from the Eastern United States to the American West began to make stops in the region of the Great Salt Lake, then known as Lake Youta.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{earliest}} versions of The Silmarillion legendarium as detailed in the History of Middle-earth series, Sauron underwent many changes. The prototype or precursor Sauron-figure <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> monstrous cat, the Prince of Cats. Called Tevildo, Tifil and Tiberth among other names, this character {{played the role}} later taken by Sauron in {{the earliest}} {{version of the story}} of Beren and Tinúviel in The Book of Lost Tales. The Prince of Cats was later replaced by Thû, the Necromancer. The name was then changed to Gorthû, Sûr, and finally to Sauron. Gorthû, in the form Gorthaur remained in The Silmarillion; both Thû and Sauron name the character in the Lay of Leithian.|$|E

25|$|Whitworth also {{invented the}} Whitworth rifle, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> leap in the {{development}} of the rifle, delivering a shooting range which far exceeded any firearm available at the time. In the American Civil War Confederate troops equipped with barrel-length three power scopes mounted on the exceptionally accurate Whitworth rifle had been known to kill Union officers at ranges of about 800 yards (731.5m), an unheard-of distance at that time. Consequently, the Whitworth rifle is considered one of the earliest examples of a sniper rifle, if not the first. In recognition of his achievements, a number of buildings in Manchester are named after him as is Whitworth Street. As part of his bequest, the Whitworth Art Gallery was created in his honour.|$|E
25|$|Hughes {{was a man}} of a mixed racial background. The {{census of}} 1850 {{designated}} him as a mulatto. He was at least part Mohawk. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> for his time, standing 6 feet 8inches and weighing as much as 300pounds. Hughes moved to Williamsport in 1828 and married a local African American freewoman, Ann Rotch. According to the 1850 census, she too was mulatto. His work on the river and canals gave him an opportunity to take {{an important role in the}} Underground Railroad. Hughes' barge and home provided a safe haven for the fugitive slaves. His property in the hills north of Williamsport was in a densely wooded area that was covered with vines. A series of caves under the Hughes property provided further cover for the runaway slaves.|$|E
25|$|In the Magic Land {{stories of}} Alexander Melentyevich Volkov, the {{prehistory}} is quite different. The land was created 6,000–7,000years {{ago by a}} wizard named Hurricap, who was tired of people coming to him with requests, {{so he decided to}} find a place without them annoying him. He found a remote land and separated it {{from the rest of the}} world, along with putting the enchantments of eternal spring and talking animals (Volkov's version doesn't include any forms of immortality). However, he failed to notice that the land already contained people (since he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant,</b> already suffering from nearsightedness in his advanced age, and the people in the Magic Land were much shorter than in other places), but, upon discovering the fact, decided that removing the enchantments would be unnecessary. Instead, he ordered the people to keep away from his castle. After that, the notable events included a conquest attempt by a sorceress named Arachna (Gurrikap was still alive, and put her in an enchanted sleep for 5,000years. Her awakening formed the story for the fifth book in Volkov's series), an unsuccessful coup by a prince named Bofaro to overthrow his father about 1,000years ago (He and his accomplices were banished to an underground cave and became the Magic Land's main source of metal and gems, an analogue to the Nomes), and the arrival of the Four Witches (which only occurred about 500years ago in this continuity).|$|E

25|$|In the Maroons' {{first season}} of {{operation}} they finished second {{last in the}} league. However, the new Forum was selling out and, {{with the addition of}} players Nelson Stewart, Babe Siebert and Bill Phillips, success came quickly. In a single year, the Maroons went from having their worst record in franchise history to their best. In only their second season of operation, Montreal won their first Stanley Cup. The NHL playoffs that year were a two-game total-goals format. Montreal won the opening series over the Pittsburgh Pirates 6–4, then upset the favored Ottawa Senators 2–1. In the NHL playoff final, Montreal defeated Ottawa to advance to the Stanley Cup final, against the Victoria Cougars of the Western Hockey League. In the last Stanley Cup final involving two different leagues, Montreal defeated Victoria three games to one. Contributing to the victory was rookie, and future Hall of Fame member, Nels Stewart, who scored six of the Maroons' ten goals in the series. Stewart won the Hart Trophy for most valuable player. While not a smooth skater, Stewart compensated with size (at six foot one and 195 pounds, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> compared to other players of that era), toughness (amassing 119 penalty minutes), and shooting (scoring 34 of Montreal's 91 goals during the season). Stewart's 34 goals remained an NHL record for rookies until the 1970–71 season. During this era, a team's best players often played the entire game with substitutions only made for injuries.|$|E
