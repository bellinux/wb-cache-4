5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> {{likely to}} be highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
50|$|Soft drinks, candy, cookies, snack crackers, and {{ice cream}} are food items and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> {{eligible}} items. Seafood, steak, and bakery cakes are also food items and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> eligible items.|$|R
30|$|The {{prognosis}} {{depends on}} prompt treatment. It <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> important to perform cervicovaginal swabs on women at risk because of IUD use [9]. This examination allows diagnosing Actinomycoses quite early. Treatment <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> simpler and results are better.|$|R
5000|$|The {{candidates}} {{present in}} either outcome are Andrea, Carter, Delilah and Brad. Scott <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> excluded and his votes transfer to Delilah. Carter's surplus is then transferred {{and goes to}} Brad. The final scores <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> as follows: ...|$|R
5|$|According to Naughty Dog, Cutter was {{originally}} supposed to remain by the protagonists' side {{until the final}} battle with Katherine Marlowe and Talbot, but McTavish was forced to drop out in order to fly to New Zealand after landing a role The Hobbit. Cutter's role <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> reduced to only {{the first half of}} the game.|$|E
5|$|According to {{traditional}} sources Aisha was {{six or seven}} years old when betrothed to Muhammad, with the marriage not being consummated until she had reached puberty at the age of nine or ten years old. She <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> a virgin at marriage. Modern Muslim authors who calculate Aisha's age based on other sources of information, such that available about her sister Asma about whom more is known, estimate that she was over thirteen and perhaps in her late teens {{at the time of her}} marriage.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} construction {{effort in}} the face of wet weather, the airbase was completed and proved useful. Whereas the base at Nadzab was surrounded by mountains and <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, there was no such problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.|$|E
50|$|Granites are {{cooler and}} <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> {{less able to}} melt and {{assimilate}} country rocks. Wholesale contamination <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> minor and unusual, although mixing of granitic and basaltic melts is not unknown where basalt is injected into granitic magma chambers.|$|R
30|$|The proof <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> completed.|$|R
60|$|All entirely bad {{works of}} art may be divided into those which, professing to be imaginative, bear no stamp of imagination, and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> false, and those which, professing to be {{representative}} of matter, miss of the representation and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> nugatory.|$|R
5|$|As {{printing}} became available, it {{was promptly}} used to publish herbals, the first printed matter being known as incunabula. In Europe, the first printed herbal with woodcut (xylograph) illustrations, the Puch der Natur of Konrad of Megenberg, appeared in 1475. Metal-engraved plates were first used in about 1580. As woodcuts and metal engravings could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers: there <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> a large {{increase in the}} number of illustrations together with an improvement in quality and detail but a tendency for repetition.|$|E
5|$|Balthazar Lange {{designed}} Trondheim Central Station. The originally two-story {{station was}} designed in Renaissance Revival architecture. With {{the opening of}} the Hell–Sunnan Line in 1902, there was a need for a larger station at Hell. The Blix' station building <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> moved to Sunnan Station, while a new and larger building, designed by Paul Due, was built at Hell. It received an intermediate style between Dragestil and Jugendstil.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war, though Leipzig was in very poor {{condition}} following an accidental collision {{with the heavy}} cruiser Prinz Eugen late in the war. Leipzig <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> used as a barracks ship before being scuttled in 1946. Nürnberg, however, emerged from the war largely unscathed, and as a result, was seized by the Soviet Navy as war reparations, and commissioned into the Soviet fleet as Admiral Makarov; she continued in Soviet service until the late 1950s, and was broken up for scrap by 1960.|$|E

5000|$|Nothing, {{specifically}} Pure Nothing, [...] "is simply equality with itself, complete emptiness, {{absence of}} all determination and content." [...] It <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> identical with <b>Being,</b> {{except that it}} is thought of as its very opposite. This distinction <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> meaningful as posited by thought.|$|R
5|$|Broadcasters {{have had}} to bid {{for the rights to}} host the contest since 2004 to avoid such {{problems}} from happening again. Belgium <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> the first country to successfully bid for the rights to host the contest in 2005.|$|E
5|$|By 16 December, the British 5th Division had {{completed}} its {{move into the}} line between the New Zealand and the Indian divisions. There followed a period of hostile patrolling and skirmishing on the XIII Corps front. The main burden of the fighting <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> assumed by V Corps as the Canadians pushed for Ortona with the Indian Division on their left flank attacking toward Villa Grande and Tollo.|$|E
5|$|Coffelt's {{account was}} {{reviewed}} by the FBI, which concluded that it differed in significant details from information {{that had not been}} made public, and <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> a fabrication. Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975. Multiple media venues, including the television news program 60 Minutes, considered and rejected it. In a 2008 book about Lincoln's descendants, author Charles Lachman revisited Coffelt's tale although it had been discredited 36 years before.|$|E

5|$|Despite these advances, {{movable type}} {{printing}} never gained {{the amount of}} widespread use in East Asia that woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the 9th century. With written Chinese, the vast amount of written morpheme characters impeded movable type's acceptance and practical use, and <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> seen as largely unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the European printing press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398–1468), was eventually wholly adopted as the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries still.|$|E
5|$|Domnall was {{a son of}} Murchad mac Diarmata, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1070), who {{was himself}} a son of Diarmait mac Máel na mBó, King of Leinster (died 1072). Domnall <b>was,</b> <b>therefore,</b> {{a member of the}} Uí Chennselaig; as well as the first of the Meic Murchada, a branch of the Uí Chennselaig named after his father. Domnall had two brothers: Donnchad (died 1115), a later King of Leinster, and Énna.|$|E
5|$|Domnall was {{a son of}} Tadc (died 1086), son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1086). Domnall <b>was,</b> <b>therefore,</b> {{a member}} of the Meic Taidc. According to the twelfth-century Banshenchas, Domnall's father married Mór, {{daughter}} of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1064/1065). This source specifies that the couple had three sons and a daughter: Amlaíb (died 1096), Bé Binn, Donnchad (died 1113), and Domnall himself.|$|E
5000|$|... 2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine {{is listed}} as a Scheduled I {{controlled}} substance {{at the federal level}} in the United States and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> illegal to buy, possess, and sell. 2,4-dimethoxyamphetamine, 2,6-dimethoxyamphetamine, 3,4-dimethoxyamphetamine, and 3,5-dimethoxyamphetamine are each position isomers of 2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine, they <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> all Schedule I controlled substances as well.|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{extensive}} coastal defences erected by the Germans {{to protect the}} installation from a seaborne raid, {{it was believed that}} a commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the garrison at the installation to destroy the Würzburg radar set. It <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation would be the most practicable way to surprise the garrison of the installation, seize the technology intact, and minimise casualties to the raiding force.|$|E
5|$|Early {{experiments}} with radiolabelled systemin in tomato demonstrated {{that it is}} transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants and <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> {{thought to be the}} systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance. This view was challenged by grafting experiments which showed that mutants deficient in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and perception were unable to activate systemic acquired resistance. It is now thought that jasmonic acid is the systemic signal and that systemin upregulates the pathways for jasmonic acid synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Franz Ferdinand was an {{advocate}} of increased federalism and widely believed to favor trialism, under which Austria-Hungary would be reorganized by combining the Slavic lands within the Austro-Hungarian empire into a third crown. A Slavic kingdom {{could have been a}} bulwark against Serb irredentism, and Franz Ferdinand <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> perceived as a threat by those same irredentists. Princip later stated to the court that preventing Franz Ferdinand's planned reforms was one of his motivations.|$|E
