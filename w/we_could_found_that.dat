Based on Government regulations that banned piracy selling in trade center, this essay created. For further knowledges, researches conducted to found the rule application on trade centers. The research did using empiric method at several trade centers in Yogyakarta. From the research, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> not all of trade center applying the rules to the tenants.

In addition, I first did the research basically on the evolution of history and the existing of delivery business in France. Then, I examined the dining habits and behaviours during the weekday of French citizen and their opinions in the future delivery system, in order to analyse the future market shape. In this case, I based on the weekday as the working days. The participants could be students, employee and so on. The purposive sampling method was used to conduct surveys with structured questionnaires among citizens in France which including the foreigners who lived in France. A total of 78 participants returned valid responses for further analysis. Base on the responses of the field study, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> the delivery service actually placed in the 3 rd categories of French citizen’s habits. People usually cook at home or hit up the frozen food during the weekday, and most of the people, who have already used the meal delivery service, ordered only once a month. Moreover, we discovered that convenience life and saving time is critical for most of the people nowadays as well as the customer’s opinion of the food delivery service today and in the future. At last, the research and the results of this study actually guided me to rethink the demand of French market and come out with a potential solution by reforming the food delivery service, in order to meet the human needs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTasks such {{as reading}} or visual search consist of series of saccades. We have {{investigated}} to what extent saccades that are made within a series of self-paced movements are influenced by preceding movements. The present paper concerns {{an analysis of the}} duration of the fixations preceding saccades. We tested human subjects in a paradigm where they had to fixate two to four targets in a fixed order as fast as they <b>could.</b> <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> fixations before so-called ‘return saccades’ (saccades returning to the previously fixated position) are considerably longer (up to 40 %) than other fixations. This phenomenon, which we call ‘Inhibition of Saccade Return’ (ISR), is present when return and regular saccades are mixed in one trial, and seems to be reset after each saccade. ISR is strongest at the previously fixated target, and decreases gradually from there. The radius of the area where ISR is found is about 4 °. The relation between ISR and ‘Inhibition of Return’ of spatial attention [Posner & Cohen, 1984] is discussed, as well as the neurophysiological basis of ISR...|$|R

Paralelamente, examinar a validade diagnóstica do primeiro, comparado ao segundo método. MÉTODO: Retrospectivamente, foram estudados 124 pacientes (OBJECTIVE: To {{verify the}} frequency of patent foramen ovale (PFO) among patients with ischemic stroke (cryptogenic or with a known cause) investigated by transcranial doppler (TCD) and transesophageal echocardiography. Secondarily, to determine the diagnostic validity of the former, compared with the later method. METHOD: Retrospectively, 124 patients (< 51 years old) with ischemic stroke were submitted to TCD and or transesophageal echocardiography. The patients were classified as cryptogenic stroke or not. RESULTS: <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>found</b> an important association between cryptogenic ischemic stroke and PFO (odds ratio 4. 3 - CI 95 % 1. 7 - 10. 7).

40|$|Propose: To {{describe}} PRP extraction devices, {{through a}} review of kits available in Spain, taking into account AEMPS and SEFH working groups (GPS, Farmacotecnia, Hemoderivados groups) contributions. Methods: Three independent searches about PRP extraction devices were carried out. Device suppliers were contacted and an individually meeting was called with each one. Characteristics of each device was reviewed by virtual demonstration. A kits comparison chart was made with all the information acquired. Kits were classified as Closed-Technique and Opened- Technique {{in accordance with the}} AEMPS technical committee report. Results: Ten devices were found: ACP®; Angel®, Cascade®, Endoret ®, GPS®, Magellan®, Minos®, Ortho-pras®, Smart-prepr® and Tricell®. However, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>found</b> out the mechanism in detail of seven of them. Information about Cascade®, Magellan ® and Smart-prepr® kits was not enough. Conclusion: The review provided the main PRP extraction devices available with CE marking and its distinguishing characteristics, however, it is crucial to pay attention to PRP extraction procedure and administration, to guarantee the final product quality. Pharmacy Department must get involved in the device selections due to the close link with the manufactured drug quality. Working together with the AEMPS will contribute to defining extraction procedure specifically. ...|$|R
