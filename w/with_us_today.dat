25|$|Defeat meant {{acceptance}} of Union {{and the search}} for an identity that was Unionist but also uniquely Scottish. One aspect was converting Highlanders from half-naked savages into a noble warrior race. For decades before 1745, rural poverty drove many to enlist in European armies but while military experience was common, the military aspects of clanship itself had been in decline for many years. Foreign service was banned after 1745 and recruitment into the British Army accelerated as deliberate policy. Britain was at war for 43 of the years between 1756 and 1815 with Scotland providing disproportionate numbers of recruits. During Empire, British policy makers focused recruiting on a small number of so-called 'martial races,' a category including Highlanders, Sikhs, Dogras and Gurkhas. In many ways, this view remains <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

50|$|Appleton {{also saw}} US 41 realignments {{over the course}} of time, {{beginning}} with the 1937 two-lane bypass (along the present freeway route) from Neenah northerly to a T-intersection <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 10 (<b>today's</b> Wisconsin Avenue, WIS 96). There, US 41 turned east <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 10, back to its original route at the intersection of US 10 (Wisconsin Avenue) and Richmond Street north of downtown Appleton, then north on Richmond to present day Northland Avenue. There it turned east on new alignment back to the original route northeast of Kaukauna. In 1940, US 41 was extended northerly from the T-intersection at US 10 for 1 mi, before making a large sweeping curve onto present day Northland Avenue to join back up with the previous bypass at Richmond Street. By 1962, the original Appleton bypass had been converted to four-lane divided highway from Oshkosh north to Northland Avenue, then north and east on new alignment bypassing the Northland Avenue bypass with the current freeway easterly to Kaukauna.|$|R

It will be a leading card to maul the Duke of Marlborough for the same crime, or at least to censure him. The Queen's message was only to give them notice of the peace she is treating, and to desire they will make some law to prevent libels against the Government; so farewell to Grub Street.|$|E

40|$|As a {{pre-requisite}} for the Roman law to {{come into}} existence, a community of people had first to emerge; a community identifying itself vis-à-vis its surroundings. Legal norms that came into being in such community, rather simple legal norms {{at the time of}} their hypothetical origin, were gradually developed in line with the development of such community throughout the times. The outcome is an elaborated system of Roman law that communicates <b>with</b> <b>us</b> even <b>today.</b> The presented paper endeavours to shed some light at some profound aspects of the formation of the Roman nation on its road to the definition of the Roman citizenship. In the case of the Romans we cannot use simple definition features, such as the language (as the Latin language was shared by other peoples of the ancient Italy) or the religion (as the ancient polytheism intertwined various cultures of the given times) or a territory. The paper offers views into the combinations of the Roman culture with those other ancient cultures that shared numerous aspects with it and that had a formatting effect on it. It also addresses the role of the religion in the formatting process of the original Roman society. The result is an attempt for a definition of the Roman nation, i. e. the personal area serving the creation and development of the Roman law [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{world in}} which we live can have {{experienced}} few tragedies so great as the conflict between religion and science. The contrast between the Puritan scientists of the seventeenth century and the scientists and church-men involved in the Darwinian controversy of the nineteenth century is fundamental, and marks a disastrous revolution in the approach to nature of both Christians and non-Christians. Whereas the Puritans regarded science as an ally of true religiont, most of those engaged in the first flurry of the evolution debacle were ranged into opposing camps depending upon whether they were scientists, evolutionists and unbelievers, or theologians and anti-evolutionists. The legacy of this radically changed attitude has remained <b>with</b> <b>us</b> and even <b>today</b> is a determinative influence in much of our religious and scientific life. The reasons for the change are complex, and will only partly concern us here.
