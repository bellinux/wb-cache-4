5|$|An {{incident}} in Žirmūnai's history {{that has been}} difficult to reconstruct occurred in 1975, when a pontoon bridge across the River Neris, that was customarily set up from spring to autumn, collapsed due to the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crowd returning from a concert in the Palace of Concerts and Sports. It was rumoured that the bridge supports were not fully connected at the time. There were witnessed fatalities involving drownings and crushing by the bridge structures. Public discussion of the disaster was restricted and the number of casualties remains unknown. The pontoon bridge was never re-erected at the site; the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotally {{injection}} of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure {{of blood vessels}} (embolization) and decay of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). Alprazolam is not very soluble in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on blotter paper {{in a manner similar}} to LSD.|$|E
5000|$|In physics, {{apparent}} <b>weight</b> is <b>a</b> property <b>of</b> {{objects that}} corresponds to how heavy an object is. The apparent <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object will differ from the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object whenever {{the force of gravity}} acting on the object is not balanced by an equal but opposite normal force. By definition, the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object is equal to the magnitude of the force of gravity acting on it. This means that even a [...] "weightless" [...] astronaut in low Earth orbit has almost the same weight as he would have while standing on the ground.|$|R

5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth the weight of an object is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale. The ratio of {{the force of gravity}} on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E
5|$|In Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī's (973–1048) Shadows, {{non-uniform}} {{motion is}} described {{as the result of}} acceleration. Ibn-Sina's theory of mayl tried to relate the velocity and <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> moving object, a precursor of the concept of momentum. Aristotle's theory of motion stated that a constant force produces a uniform motion; Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī (c. 1080 – 1164/5) disagreed, arguing that velocity and acceleration are two different things, and that force is proportional to acceleration, not to velocity.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic form}} of the apothecaries' system is {{essentially}} {{a subset of the}} Roman weight system. An apothecaries' pound normally consisted of 12 ounces. (In France this was changed to 16 ounces, and in Spain the customary unit was the marco, a mark of 8 ounces.) In the south of Europe and in France, the scruple was generally divided into 24 grains, so that one ounce consisted of 576 grains. Nevertheless, the subdivision of an ounce was somewhat more uniform than that of a pound, and a common feature of all variants is that 12 ounces are roughly 100 drachms (96–128 drachms) and a grain is roughly the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physical grain.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1750s, even {{the roof of}} Ardincaple Castle, seat of the clan chief, had fallen in. The overall {{condition}} of the castle had deteriorated {{to such an extent}} that the next laird was forced to abandon it and live in nearby Laggarie. The bulk of the Ardincaple estate ultimately passed into the hands of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll. The last chief of the MacAulays, Aulay MacAulay, died at High Laggarie (now encompassed by the tiny village of Rhu) landless and without an heir to succeed as chief in about 1767. In 1794, Lord Frederick Campbell (brother of John, 5th Duke of Argyll) supervised the draining of the marsh and bog-ridden former lands of the Lairds of Ardincaple. The poor state of the lands of Ardincaple before that year is illustrated in the statement by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll: that much of the land could not bear the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cow, and local men of the time remembered when horses would be lost in the bogholes prevalent in the area.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a common}} sight {{in much of the}} continent, the bald eagle was {{severely}} affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US.|$|E
5|$|Sexual size {{dimorphism}} in {{this species}} {{is perhaps the}} greatest in any neognath bird. Males were considerably larger than females, measuring 90cm (35in) in length and weighing up to 28kg (62lb), whereas females were 70cm (28in) and weighed 17kg (37lb). This is only 60% of the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mature male. Their weight may have varied substantially due to fat cycles, meaning that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but slim during hot seasons, {{and may have been}} as low as 21kg in males and 13kg in females. Though male pigeons are usually larger than females, there is no direct evidence for the largest specimens actually being the males of the species, and this has only been assumed based on early works. Though the male was probably largest, this can only be confirmed by molecular sexing techniques, and not skeletal morphology alone.|$|E

Elsewhere in Saint Andrew, three construction workers were killed when the shed in which they were sleeping caved in. A girl was crushed to death under the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> collapsed board house in Saint Catherine Parish.

Amid a microburst, a waterspout tore roofs off buildings and hospitalized five residents in Westmoreland Parish's capital of Savanna-la-Mar, while to the northwest, strong gusts and rough surf impacted the resort town of Negril. In the wake of the storm, a body was recovered from debris along a road in Saint Catherine. Flooded streets, roads and bridges isolated communities across seven of the island's parishes and trapped hundreds of residents in their homes.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Duke of Edinburgh was {{attached}} to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron and remained at sea until 2 June, searching for disabled ships. She arrived in Scapa Flow on the afternoon of 3 June. On the evening of 18 August 1916, the Grand Fleet, including Duke of Edinburgh, put to sea in response to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet, minus the II Battle Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The Germans planned to bombard the port of Sunderland on 19 August, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Germans broke off their planned attack to pursue a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans then set course for home. After Jutland the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, now including Duke of Edinburgh, was ordered to reinforce the patrols north of the Shetland Islands against German blockade runners and commerce raiders. The ship's foremast was converted to a tripod to support the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fire-control director in May 1917, but when the director was actually fitted is not known. Two more 6-inch guns were added in embrasures on the forecastle deck during that same refit. She was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in August 1917 for convoy escort duties, where she remained {{for the duration of the}} war. Upon her return, Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the Humber, before she was sold for scrap on 12 April 1920 and broken up at Blyth in Northumberland.|$|E
