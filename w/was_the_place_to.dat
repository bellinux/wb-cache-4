The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) was given the mandate {{to form a new}} subsidiary corporation that would restore, renovate, and expand the Manila Hotel. In the following two decades, Mr. Marcos's wife, Imelda, could frequently be seen at the hotel restaurants. During her visits, a red carpet and garlands were put out and the air was sprayed with deodorant. Under Imelda's patronage, the hotel reaped international recognition and awards. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go and be seen during the martial law years.|$|E

Family Guy was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show MADtv, but the plan changed because MADtv's budget was not large enough to support animation production. MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he thought that that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> create a prime-time animation show. Family Guy was originally pitched to Fox {{in the same year}} as King of the Hill, but the show was not bought until years later, when King of the Hill became successful. Fox ordered 13 episodes of Family Guy to air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven-minute demo.|$|E

2500|$|Caesar was {{considered}} a [...] "sketch comic" [...] and actor, {{as opposed to a}} stand-up comedian. He also relied more on body language, accents, and facial contortions than simply dialogue. Unlike the slapstick comedy which was standard on TV, his style {{was considered}} [...] "avant garde" [...] in the 1950s. He conjured up ideas and scene and used writers to flesh out the concept and create the dialogue. Among the writers who wrote for Caesar early in their careers were Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Larry Gelbart, Carl Reiner, Michael Stewart, Mel Tolkin, and Woody Allen. [...] "Sid's was the show to which all comedy writers aspired. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> be," [...] said Steve Allen.|$|E

[...] While Caesar did not write his dialogue, he made all final decisions. His writers, such as Mel Brooks, felt they [...] "had a great {{instrument}} in Caesar that we could all play, and we played it very well." [...] As for Caesar, Nachman describes him basically as an [...] "inspired idea man who allowed the writers to take more risks" [...] than other TV shows. Woody Allen remembers that [...] "...you wrote situations," [...] instead of jokes, as in [...] "This Is Your Story" [...] with Carl Reiner, a parody of the popular TV show This is Your Life. It {{was said to be}} [...] "Caesar's personal favorite" [...] sketch.|$|E
2500|$|Stanton {{took the}} matter to the press. In {{addition}} to publicizing the details of Sherman's deal, Stanton said Sherman intentionally flouted direct orders from both Lincoln and Johnson, listed nine reasons Sherman's deal had been categorically rejected. Further, Stanton accused Sherman of recklessly opening a path by which Jefferson Davis might flee the country with specie Davis purportedly took with him after abandoning Richmond. The latter claim was based in Sherman's removal of Maj. Gen. George Stoneman's forces from the Greensboro railway—Greensboro <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> which Davis and other Confederate officials fled. Stanton's words were damning. [...] "It amounted to a castigation of Sherman and virtually accused him of disloyalty", say Thomas and Hyman. Moreover, Sherman being among the most respected generals in the country, Stanton's publication endangered {{his place in the}} administration.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1950 the {{government}} of Iraq passed the Denaturalisation Act that allowed Jews to emigrate if they renounced their Iraqi citizenship. Iraqi prime minister Tawfiq al-Suwaidi expected that 7,000–10,000 Jews out of the Iraqi Jewish population of 125,000 would leave. A few thousand Jews registered for the offer before the first bombing occurred. The first bombing occurred {{on the last day}} of Passover, 8 April 1950. Panic in the Jewish community ensued and many more Jews registered to leave Iraq. The law expired in March 1951 but was extended after the Iraqi government froze the assets of departing Jews, including those who had already left. Between the first and last bombing almost the entire Jewish community bar a few thousand had registered to leave the country. The emigration of Jews was also due to the deteriorating status of Jews in Iraq since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war as they were suspected of being disloyal to Iraq. They were treated with threats, suspicion and physical assaults and were portrayed by the media as a fifth column. By 1953, nearly all Jews had left the country. In his memoir of Jewish life in Baghdad, Sasson Somekh writes: [...] "The pace of registration for the citizenship waiver was slow in the beginning, but it increased as tensions rose between Jews and their neighbors and after acts of terror were perpetrated against Jewish businesses and institutions – especially the Mas'uda Shem-Tov Synagogue...This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> which emigrating citizens were required to report with their luggage before leaving for Israel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} acts, {{the stars of}} the club were the patrons. Tender Trap patrons were {{generally}} regarded by the press of the day to be a cut above – articles often refer to their eccentric, period fashion sense and funky moves. The most loyal patrons were a group known as [...] "the Kids" [...] – the Captain, Tito, 'Tache, Glen, Peta, Ineke, Jodie, & Megan. Other colourful patrons included [...] "Lantern", the [...] "Dancing Partner", Mr. Tambourine Man, Quiet Dave, Disco Phil, and Bongo John. A teenage Hana Shimada, now a co-director of her own successful GoodGod Small Club in downtown Sydney, was a regular sight on the dance-floor. All club regulars were issued the prized [...] "Swingers" [...] membership cards. However, the door policy was deliberately inclusive – all types were welcome, young and old, straight and gay, the sophisticated, the sexy, and the downright spooky. Celebrities had to pay to get in – they included Leonardo DiCaprio, Princess Stephanie of Monaco, Russell Crow, Geoffrey Rush, numerous touring rockers such as Urge Overkill and Donovan Leitch. Only one celebrity was ever admitted free as a special guest – Lamonte McLemore, one of the founding members of the American popular music vocal group the 5th Dimension. Lamonte received star treatment, and was feted by young ladies at his own table. Lamonte smiled enigmatically as a room full of people danced wildly to the 5th Dimension hits, Up, Up and Away, and Puppet Man, 30 years after those records had first hit the charts. At its peak, and on long weekend holidays, the Tender Trap could be packed with 1200 patrons, the queue stretching down Darlinghurst Road, all in a building licensed to entertain 300. The crush added to the sense of wild occasion, but for those wanting a more laid-back experience, mid-winter Tender Trap <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> be.|$|E
