5|$|Having lost O'Rourke {{as manager}} in 1921, {{after he had}} {{struggled}} {{to cope with the}} death of his son two years earlier, Bradford's results suffered back in Division Two. Both Bradford City and Bradford (Park Avenue) had been relegated in 1922, and with the rise of fellow West Yorkshire side Huddersfield Town, attendances in Bradford dropped. City's average attendance fell from a record high of 22,585 in 1920–21 to between 12,000 and 14,000 in Division Two. Five consecutive bottom half finishes culminated in relegation to Division Three (North) in 1926–27, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finished</b> bottom of the table following a then record 8–0 defeat to Manchester City {{on the final day of}} the season. New manager Colin Veitch missed out on guiding the club to an immediate promotion <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finished</b> sixth, but at the end of the season the players had not been paid and the bank was unable to advance any more money because of the club's overdraft. Had it not been for donations by fans, Bradford City would not have started the following campaign. A new board was appointed, and they reinstated Peter O'Rourke as manager. Success was immediate, when the 1928–29 season started with a record 11–1 victory over Rotherham United, as the side scored a club record 128goals to earn promotion by just one point. City's successful team had also brought the fans back and the average attendance of 18,551 is the highest average recorded by the club, since 1925, when The Football League started to keep official records.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the race's {{first week}} and {{beginning}} of its second were three hilly medium-mountain stages. These stages took the Giro through Austria and Switzerland before returning to Italy. Each of these stages took more than five hours to complete, and the rain that fell each day combined with the difficulties presented by the numerous ascents and descents made the courses potentially unsafe in the riders' opinion. This opinion was perhaps validated by the life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo in the eighth stage after he crashed while descending a mountain. While the ninth stage {{was meant to be a}} showy criterium in celebration of this being the 100th anniversary of the Giro d'Italia, the riders collectively protested the safety conditions of that stage and the ones before it. This meant it would be neutralized, with every rider receiving the same finishing time as the stage winner regardless of <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finished.</b>|$|E

5|$|Chamois Niortais {{were soon}} relegated from the CFA and {{returned}} to the DH Centre-Ouest in 1945. Led by Faczinek, who had returned to the club as player-manager in 1943, the side won the DH Centre-Ouest for three consecutive seasons. Despite this success, Faczinek left the club in 1948 and was replaced by former France international Maurice Banide. The team re-joined the CFA for the 1948–49 season and played in the division for the following five campaigns, achieving a second-place finish in 1951, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finished</b> behind Stade Quimpérois by five points. In 1953, the side finished bottom of the division and were relegated back to the DH Centre-Ouest. Following the relegation, manager Nicolas Hibst was sacked and replaced by Georges Hatz, who had previously coached AJ Auxerre. The side remained in the DH Centre-Ouest until 1960 when, under the guidance of Nordine Ben Ali, they won the league title by a single point ahead of Poitiers FC to return to the CFA.|$|E
5|$|Ernie McCoy {{became the}} second former All-American Wolverine player {{to coach the}} team. Like Oosterbaan before him, he became a {{football}} and baseball coach at Michigan. He also served as assistant Athletic Director under Fritz Crisler. During his four seasons as basketball coach, Michigan's best finish was during the 1948–49 season <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finished</b> 15–6 overall (7–5, Big Ten) and earned a third place Big Ten Conference finish. He coached Michigan's first All-Big Ten basketball players that season in Pete Elliot and captain Bob Harrison who were both selected to the first team. Harrison returned the following season as the first repeat first-team All-Big Ten basketball player and Elliot was a second-team honoree. McCoy served as a football scout at the same time.|$|E

5|$|In April 1925, Sunderland {{completed}} {{the signing of}} centre forward Dave Halliday, after Buchan left for Arsenal. In his second season Halliday scored 38 goals, helping Sunderland secure a third-place finish in the League. In the 1928–29 season Halliday scored 43goals, a club record for the most individual goals in a season. Kyle, who had been Sunderland's manager since 1905, resigned {{at the end of}} the 1928–29 season, after 25seasons in charge of the club, managing 817matches and taking Sunderland to the verge of a League and cup double. He was replaced by Johnny Cochrane, who arrived from St Mirren. With Cochrane in charge, Sunderland reached the 1930–31 FA Cup semi-final, where they lost to Birmingham City. Sunderland's next success came in the 1934–35 season <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finished</b> as runners-up to Arsenal. The following season Sunderland managed to win their sixth League title, by a margin of eight points. They scored 109goals during the season, with Raich Carter and Bobby Gurney each scoring 31.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} decade, Malmö FF established {{themselves as a}} permanent fixture in Allsvenskan. The side had a period of great success in the late 1940s and early 1950s, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finished</b> within the top three in Allsvenskan for ten years in a row, securing five league titles. The club also won the main Swedish cup tournament, Svenska Cupen (established in 1941), five times during the same period. The club continued to finish in {{the upper half of}} the league table and experienced additional periods of success during the late 1960s and the 1970s. Malmö FF also qualified for European competition arranged by The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), doing so for the first time during the 1964–65 season when they entered the European Cup (qualifying as Allsvenskan leaders during the European summer, as Sweden had switched to a season format based around the calendar year). The club qualified for continental competitions 12 times in a row between 1971 and 1982.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees' 1980s demise and {{downfall}} {{continued into}} the early 1990s and was at its frustrating peak in 1994, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finished</b> with {{the best record in}} the American League in a season that was prematurely halted by the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, which left New York sports fans disappointed that Mattingly had not played in a postseason despite being poised to do so that year. At that time, he led active players in both games played and at-bats without participating in a postseason game. Throughout October, the news media added to the embarrassment when they often made references to dates that games in the World Series would have been played. That year, the Yankees and Red Sox would have finished the season against each other at Fenway Park. Both managers, Buck Showalter of the Yankees and Butch Hobson of the Red Sox, who made their managerial debuts against each other, were fired as a result of or during the strike.|$|E

Of the seven major league affiliations in Nashville's history, the team experienced its best record from 1980 to 1984 as the Double-A farm club for the New York Yankees. The Sounds had a composite regular season record of 417–306 (.577). They reached the postseason in all five seasons, winning two Western Division titles and one Southern League Championship. Their postseason record was 14–14 (.500). Conversely, the team's lowest record was as the Detroit Tigers' Triple-A club from 1985 to 1986. The Sounds compiled a 139–144 (.491) record {{and failed to}} reach the postseason in either year.|$|E
5|$|The team's worst {{regular season}} record was 2001, where they {{finished}} 1–15, {{worst in the}} league for that season; although they won their first game, they lost each of the remaining 15.

The team achieved their best playoff performance in 2003, when the team were the NFC Champions and reached Super Bowl XXXVIII, losing 29–32 to the New England Patriots; they also reached Super Bowl 50 {{at the conclusion of}} the 2015 season. Overall, the team has recorded 6 winning seasons, 12 losing seasons, and three 8–8 seasons; counting the playoffs, they have an overall record of 181 wins, 186 losses, and 1 tie (.493 winning percentage).|$|E
5|$|When the Sun Sox {{released}} him, Martin {{was hired}} to manage the Miami Beach Flamingos of the Florida International League in 1952. Despite leading them to a 103-49 record, the Flamigos finished the season one game behind his former team, the Sun Sox. In 1953, he became {{the manager of the}} Fort Lauderdale Lions and led them to the Florida International League title. After spending the 1954 season as the manager for the Portsmouth Merrimacs, Martin was named as a coach for the Chicago Cubs in September 1955. Stan Hack was fired as the Cubs manager <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finished</b> in last place in the 1956 season, and the new Cubs manager, Bob Scheffing, asked for Martin's resignation {{along with the rest of}} the coaching staff. Martin returned to the minor leagues once again where he became a player-coach for the Tulsa Oilers, playing his final game at the age of 54. He took his final field assignment as the manager of the Miami Marlins in 1959.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, {{the club}} {{followed}} Salisbury and {{stepped up to}} the Western League. This proved to be quite a different challenge—whereas before they had only competed against local teams in league competition, they now faced opposition from teams as far afield as Avon, Somerset and Devon as well as the reserve teams of league clubs such as Bristol Rovers, Bristol City and Torquay United. They generally fared well, only failing to finish in {{the top half of the}} table twice during their time at this level. Their first season in the Western League saw the club reach the first round proper of the FA Cup for the only time in their history after defeating Hendon 5–4 in a fourth qualifying round replay. On 3 November, Fourth Division side Gillingham came to the Walled Meadow and won 1–0 in front of 3484 spectators, a figure which would remain as the club's largest attendance for a home game. In the league Andover finished fourth, but that was their highest placing until 1969–70 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finished</b> as runners-up.|$|E
5|$|Striker Bobby Ham, whose 18goals {{had helped}} City into Division Three, was again top goalscorer the {{following}} season, but the club's stint in Division Three was short-lived. Once Ham, and fellow Bradford-born striker Bruce Bannister, who scored 60goals during seven {{seasons with the}} club, both left, City were relegated back into the bottom division in 1971–72. The spell in Division Three had also been notable for the debut of Ces Podd, {{who went on to}} play a record 502league games during 14seasons with the club. City spent five seasons back in Division Four. In 1975–76 they had their best FA Cup run in more than 50years after defeating Norwich City, before they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual winners Southampton 1–0. A year later more than 40goals from the trio of Dominican striker Joe Cooke, Terry Dolan and Don Hutchins helped City to another promotion <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finished</b> in fourth position. The club's board failed to strengthen the squad the following season, resulting in an instant return to Division Four. Under new manager George Mulhall, City spent three seasons in mid-table, although a late spell of form nearly earned promotion in 1979–80.|$|E
5|$|Docherty rebuilt {{confidence}} in the team and Villa {{went on to win}} five consecutive games and retained a place in the Second Division. In the short time that Docherty had been at the club, attendances rose significantly from a low of just over 12,000 against Charlton Athletic in December. In the summer of 1969 the first share issue since 1896 raised £200,000 for the club, £140,000 of which was spent on new players. In the following season, however, Villa took ten games to register a win. By Christmas 1969, Villa were {{at the bottom of the}} Second Division and Docherty was sacked. His successor, Vic Crowe, was unable to prevent Aston Villa from being relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in its history in the 196970 season. Despite finishing fourth in the Third Division in the 197071 season, Villa reached the League Cup final after beating Manchester United in the semi-final. They were defeated in the final by Tottenham Hotspur 20. The 197172 season saw the club return to the Second Division as champions with a then divisional record 70 points. They were invited to take part in the 1972 FA Charity Shield but lost 1–0 to Manchester City. In the autumn of 1972, there was a revolt in the boardroom and four of the five directors voted to oust Doug Ellis from the board. Within 43days though, Ellis was reinstated as chairman after he received the support of the largest shareholder Pat Matthews, and the supporters at an EGM, who also voted to replace the existing directors. Their first season back in the Second Division in 197273 saw Villa narrowly miss out on a second successive promotion <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finished</b> third. However, the following season Villa finished 14th and Ellis sacked Crowe, replacing him with Ron Saunders.|$|E
