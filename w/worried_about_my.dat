25|$|In 2003, the Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale was introduced. It {{was made}} for three {{different}} age groups. The AMAS takes into account age-related situations that affect an individual's anxiety. The divisions include one scale for adults (AMA-A), one scale for college students (AMAS-C), {{and the other for}} the elderly population (AMAS-E). Each scale is geared towards examining situations specific to that age group. For example, the AMAS-C has items pertaining specifically to college students, such as questions about anxiety of the future. The AMAS-A is geared more toward mid-life issues, and the AMAS-E has specific anxieties the older population deals with, such as fear of aging and dying. The AMAS-A contains 36 items. It has 14 questions relating to worry/oversensitivity, 9 questions about physiological anxiety, 7 questions about social concerns/stress, and 6 questions about lies. An example of an age appropriate item for this scale is, “I am <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> job performance”. The AMAS-C contains 49 items about the same topics, but incorporates 15 items related specifically to test anxiety. Questions relating to the items on this scale include, “I worry too much about tests and exams”. This scale is similar in structure to the CMAS discussed above. The AMAS-E contains 44 items related to worry/oversensitivity, physiological anxiety, lying, and the fear of aging. Twenty- three of the questions on the AMAS-E are related to worry/oversensitivity, but The Fear of Aging category of this scale includes items such as, “I worry about becoming senile”. Similar to the TMAS, the AMAS can be given in a group or individual setting, and the person responds either yes or no to each item listed according to if it pertains to themselves or not. The more items that are answered yes, suggest a higher level of anxiety. The scale has been said to be easy to complete and practical, because it takes only about 10 minutes to complete and just a couple minutes to score.|$|E
500|$|Otto and Edith Frank {{planned to}} go into hiding with the {{children}} on 16 July 1942, but when Margot received a call-up notice from the Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung (Central Office for Jewish Emigration) on 5 July, ordering her to report for relocation to a work camp, {{they were forced to}} move the plan ten days forward. Shortly before going into hiding, Anne gave her friend and neighbour, Toosje Kupers, a book, a tea set, a tin of marbles, and the family cat for safekeeping.

500|$|The Game {{is often}} {{credited}} as {{a driving force}} in bringing the West Coast hip hop scene back to recognition. Before its release, he expressed his desire to have high opening week sales, saying, [...] "I want to sell a million albums in my first week. And if I only sell one album the following week, I'm good." [...] He also admitted feeling nervous {{about not being able}} to live up to the industry expectations, saying, [...] "Yeah, I've got some butterflies. I'm <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> first-week numbers, and I'm worried about living up to the hype." [...] The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 586,000 copies in the first week. The Recording Industry Association of America certified the album double Platinum on March 23, 2005, and it was the tenth best-selling record of the year. The album has since sold over 2.5 million units in the United States.|$|E

Once, when Sima Yi was ill, Zhang Chunhua visited him, {{and he said}} to her, [...] "Old creature, your looks are disgusting! Why do you even bother to visit me?" [...] Zhang Chunhua became angry and attempted to starve herself to death. Their sons did so too. Sima Yi was so shocked that he immediately apologised to his wife and reconciled with her.

60|$|My {{thoughts}} alarmed me. Beyond a doubt John Stumpy {{intended to}} rob the Widow Canby's house. The only one {{at home was}} Kate, and I groaned as I thought of the alarm and terror {{that she might be}} called upon to suffer. As it was, I was sure she was <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> continued absence. In my anguish I strove with all my might to burst asunder the bonds that held me. At the end of five minutes' struggle I remained as securely tied as ever.|$|E

[...] "I suppose {{she was beginning to}} be <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> being out alone. She'll be so glad I met you." [...] It didn't appear to Herbert, however, that Mrs. Brooks exhibited any extravagant joy over the occurrence, and she almost instantly retired with her daughter into the sitting-room, linking her arm in Cherry's, and, as it were, empanoplying her with her own invulnerable shawl. Herbert went to his room more dissatisfied with himself than ever.|$|E

I put pressure on my hips more and more to compensate for the pain I was feeling". Following the season, Joubert consulted different specialists about his knee injury and was told he would be unlikely to fully recover his normal strength if he underwent surgery; he therefore decided on a strict diet and specific exercises to restore his musculature balance.|$|E
