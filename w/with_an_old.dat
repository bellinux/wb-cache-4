40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} if having <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling {{was significantly related}} to stronger selfregulation and achievement, in a sample of 74 preschool children participating in a selfregulation intervention. It was hypothesized that children <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling in the fall would have higher self-regulation and achievement scores than children with no older siblings, and that children <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling in the intervention would improve more across the year in selfregulation and achievement than children <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling in the control group. Results showed that having <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling significantly predicted higher vocabulary and math scores in the fall of preschool. In addition, children <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling in the intervention group had significantly higher vocabulary scores than children <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling in the control group in the spring. Findings indicate that <b>older</b> siblings have <b>an</b> important influence on the early development of vocabulary skills in preschool children...|$|R

5|$|Elliott {{embarked}} for Australia on the RMS Orontes on 15 May 1919, {{sharing a}} cabin <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> friend, Brigadier General Gordon Bennett. They arrived back in Melbourne on 28 June, and his AIF appointment was terminated the following day. He contested {{the federal election}} {{as a candidate for}} the Nationalist Party of Australia on 13 December 1919. He achieved the greatest popular vote of any Victorian candidate for the Senate. Moreover, he repeated this success at the 1925 election. Although not naturally suited to life in the federal parliament, he made significant contributions, and was outspoken in his efforts to assist returned servicemen, particularly those with whom he had served. This outspokenness often took the form of arguing in the Senate in relation to the new legislation being brought before it, when such legislation involved the defence forces. At other times, he would personally champion the cause of those men who had been in his battalion.|$|E

NY128 proceeds north on Main Street, a two-lane commercial street, intersecting <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> alignment of NY22, entering the town center for North Castle, where it maintains the commercial backdrop through town. Passing west of Wampus Brook Park, NY128 intersects with Old Mount Kisco Road, an old alignment as it leaves the town center. NY128 soon parallels the park and Wampus Brook on its way north, maintaining the Main Street moniker until an intersection with Old Mount Kisco Road. At that junction, the route becomes ArmonkMount Kisco Road, making a large bend westward near Al Ehrmann Park.|$|E
5|$|The new Ibrox had a {{capacity}} of 44,000 and was opened <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> Firm game played on 19 September 1981. By this time, however, the development cost had risen to ¬£10 million, which depleted the club financially. This resulted in a difficult period {{in the history of}} Rangers, as the average attendance fell to 17,500 in the 1981‚Äì82 season, including a crowd of only 4,500 for a game against St Mirren. The redeveloped stadium was partly blamed for this, as some fans felt that the new ground lacked atmosphere due to the spaces between the stands. This was during a period of low attendances in Scottish football in general. Despite the relatively low attendance at Ibrox, Rangers had the highest average home attendances in the Premier Division in both 1983‚Äì84 and 1984‚Äì85.|$|E
5|$|Through Preston Park, Route370 intersects <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> {{alignment}} of itself twice {{before coming to}} the main intersection in town, the northern terminus of Route247 (Creamton Drive) and its continuation Rabbit Run Road. The road turns northeastward and passes several residences before intersecting with Shehawken Road, where the road becomes mainly wooded once again. The route parallels an {{alignment of}} former State Route570 and the former Ontario and Western Railroad into Buckingham Township, where the route enters the hamlet of Starlight. In Starlight, Route370 passes the former Ontario and Western station and turns eastward once the old alignment of Route570 merges in. After passing a pond, the highway leaves Starlight and continues northeastward in dense forestry. A short while later, the route turns northward and weaves to an intersection with Route191 (the Hancock Highway) in Buckingham Township. This serves as the northern terminus of Route370.|$|E

5|$|Brumfield {{considered}} Operation Hump to be {{the least}} successful operation in which the Australian battalion had participated, and he criticised it as being badly conceived from the start, and mounted with too little intelligence or prior reconnaissance. Indeed, from the initial landing zone being occupied by the Viet Cong, failures in the passage of information, the heavy losses suffered by the US 1/503rd Battalion and the subsequent difficulties with casualty evacuation, the operation had not run smoothly. The Australians were vengeful for their losses and wanted to return to collect their dead; however, with 1 RAR absorbed into other operations the planned battalion attack on Hill 82 never occurred. Regardless, further operations followed in the months afterwards, with 1 RAR subsequently employed on Operation New Life in November and December, and later Operation Crimp in the Ho Bo Woods in January 1966. Operation Hump was Brumfield's last, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> football injury forcing his evacuation to Australia in mid-November. He was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece.|$|E
