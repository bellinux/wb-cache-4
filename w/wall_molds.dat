40|$|ABSTRACT: Thin <b>wall</b> {{injection}} <b>molding</b> of thermoplastic composites {{has become}} an important process in industry because of its light weight, relatively lower resin cost per part, and faster cycle time. An experimental study, based on the Taguchi orthogonal array design, was conducted to characterize the effect of different processing parameters on the thin <b>wall</b> injection <b>molding</b> of thermoplastic composites, including melt temperature, mold temperature, filling speed, filling pressure, packing pressure, and packing time. Three materials {{were used in the}} study: virgin acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and 20 % and 30 % glass-fiber filled ABS composites. Experiments were carried out on an 80 -ton reciprocating injection molding machine. After molding, the weight of the molded com-posite parts was determined. For the factors selected in the main experiments, melt temper-ature and melt filling pressure were found to be the principal parameters affecting the thin <b>wall</b> injection <b>molding</b> of thermoplastic composites. Glass fiber filled polymers required a higher filling pressure and melt temperature for successful molding than those of the non-filled polymers. In addition, a moldability diagram was developed based on the statis-tical results to give first guidelines for system optimization...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed to {{investigate}} and establish a correlation between the <b>mold</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and the mechanical properties of the non-ferrous alloy in investment casting. Mold material of the fine stucco system is investigated. For the investigation proposes, four molds with different thicknesses are established: 5, 7, 9, and 11 layers. Pouring temperature is set to 660 Â°C. After pouring, the temperatures of the outer and inner <b>wall</b> of the <b>mold</b> materials is recorded until the temperature reach the steady state condition. Finite element analysis based on a plane strain assumption is employed to evaluate the thermal conductivity k, of the mold material with different thicknesses,based on the experimental steady state temperature of {{the inner and outer}} surface of the mold material. The mechanical properties of the casting materials are investigated by observing the microstructure and performed Vickers Hardness Test on the casting specimens. In the findings, the thermal conductivity k, of the mold materials is almost the same. The percentage of the silicon flakes for the cast product is decreased with the increasing of <b>mold</b> <b>wall</b> thickness.

40|$|Extensive {{experimental}} studies {{were conducted to}} quantify the effect of different parameters that can affect the heat transfer from the metal to the mold during the steady-state phase of DC casting. In the first part previously published, the experimental technique was established and results were reported for the effect of gas type (atmosphere within the mold) and {{the gap between the}} metal and the mold. The results showed the significant effect of gas thermal conductivity and the metal-mold gap on the <b>mold</b> <b>wall</b> heat transfer coefficient. In this second publication on heat transfer in the <b>mold</b> <b>wall</b> region of a DC casting mold, the results from the effect of casting temperature, gas flow rate, casting alloy, mold material, and the mold insert material on the <b>mold</b> <b>wall</b> heat transfer coefficient are described. The experiments reported in the current paper show that these additional factors tested do not affect the heat flux through the <b>mold</b> <b>wall</b> to the same extent as the gap size or the gas type. The heat transfer coefficient changes by less than 5 pct when casting temperature is changed by ± 25 K, less than 15 pct when the gas flow rate within the metal-mold gap flows at up to 3 LPM, and approximately 30 pct when the mold material is changed from stainless steel to AA 601 to copper. Similar results were obtained when different insert materials were used.

5000|$|Heating {{the mold}} in an oven while it rotates, {{until all the}} polymer has melted and adhered to the <b>mold</b> <b>wall.</b> The hollow part should be rotated through two or more axes, {{rotating}} at different speeds, {{in order to avoid}} the accumulation of polymer powder. The length of time the mold spends in the oven is critical: too long and the polymer will degrade, reducing impact strength. If the mold spends too little time in the oven, the polymer melt may be incomplete. The polymer grains will not have time to fully melt and coalesce on the <b>mold</b> <b>wall,</b> resulting in large bubbles in the polymer.

An experimental study, together with a two-dimensional numerical simulation of solute segregation, was conducted to investigate (1) the mechanism for stray-grain nucleation following seed melt-back and initial withdrawal and (2) the role of the primary dendrite disposition of the seed crystal in relation to the <b>mold</b> <b>wall</b> during growth. It is proposed that the factors contributing to stray-grain nucleation during initial withdrawal are (1) the magnitude of local, solute-adjusted undercooling and (2) the rapidly changing curvature of the solidification front close to the <b>mold</b> <b>walls</b> during the initial solidification transient. Based upon the calculated local undercooling and experimentally observed stray-grain morphologies, it was concluded that stray grains nucleate near the <b>mold</b> <b>wall</b> around the seed perimeter and behind the columnar dendrites that advance into the bulk liquid ahead of the melt-back zone. These grains then compete during growth with the dendrites originating from the seed. Therefore, the morphological constraints arising from the inclination of the primary dendrites from the seed crystal with respect to the <b>mold</b> <b>wall</b> (converging/diverging/axial 〈 001 〉) determines the probability of the stray-grain nuclei developing into equiaxed/columnar grains following competitive growth.
