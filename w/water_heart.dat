40|$|The Australian {{freshwater}} crocodile, Crocodylus johnstoni, heats significantly {{faster than}} it cools.

Convective transfer of heat within the body is effected by the circulatory system, and this far exceeds rates of heat transfer by conduction alone. Localized heating of the body surface results in a cutaneous vasodilation which promotes uptake of heat. Localized cooling of the body surface results in cutaneous vasoconstriction, promoting heat conservation. Increase or decrease in heart rate accompanies cutaneous vasodilation or vasoconstriction. The dilation or constriction of cutaneous blood vessels and the acceleration or deceleration of heart rate are seen as separate responses to surface heating or cooling. Together they promote heat gain or retard heat loss and provide physiological mechanisms contributing to thermoregulation in C. johnstoni...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the diving {{response}} on alveolar gas exchange was investigated in 15 subjects. During steady-state exercise (80 W) on a cycle ergometer, the subjects performed 40 -s apneas in air and 40 -s apneas with face immersion in cold (10 °C) <b>water.</b> <b>Heart</b> rate decreased and blood pressure increased during apneas, and the responses were augmented by face immersion. Oxygen uptake from the lungs decreased during apnea in air (- 22 % compared with eupneic control) and was further reduced during apnea with face immersion (- 25 % compared with eupneic control). The plasma lactate concentration increased from control (11 %) after apnea in air and even more after apnea with face immersion (20 %), suggesting an increased anaerobic metabolism during apneas. The lung oxygen store was depleted more slowly during apnea with face immersion because of the augmented diving response, probably including a decrease in cardiac output. Venous oxygen stores were probably reduced by the cardiovascular responses. The turnover times of these gas stores would have been prolonged, reducing their effect on the oxygen uptake in the lungs. Thus the human diving response has an oxygen-conserving effect...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Acute bronchiolitis is {{the most}} common lower {{respiratory}} tract infection in infant and one of their hospital admission reasons. Due to the high prevalence of the disease and unclear effectiveness of existing treatments, the present study was designed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of single dose of injected dexamethasone and inhaled epinephrine in patients with acute bronchiolitis treated with inhaled salbutamol. Materials and Methods: In this double-blinded clinical trial, 90 infants with age of 2 - 24 months who were admitted to hospital with acute bronchiolitis were studied. All patients received inhaled salbutamol (0. 15 mg/kg) and then were randomly assigned to three groups (n= 30) of dexamethasone (0. 6 mg/kg), inhaled epinephrine (0. 15 mg/kg) and control (distillated <b>water).</b> <b>Heart</b> rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR), arterial blood oxygen saturation (O 2 sat) and respiratory distress scores (RDS) of children at baseline, 30, 60, 120 minutes and, 24 hours after intervention were recorded and compared between groups.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. com authorBathing in hot springs containing high concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO_ 2) remarkably influences cardiovascular function more than bathing in fresh water. The CO_ 2 -ennriched water in hot springs generally contains many salts among which interactions remain unknown. We separately evaluated the actions of individual factors in CO_ 2 -water and confirmed that CO_ 2 and NaCl have combined effects on blood pressure fluctuations in anesthetized rats. The animals were equipped with sensor probes to monitor body temperature, skin blood flow and arterial blood pressure, and immersed in bathwater (35 °C) containing CO_ 2 with NaCl, KCl or sucrose. The effects of these factors on cardiovascular functions were evaluated using power-spectral analysis of the fluctuation in blood pressure and heart rate. Compared with immersion in tap <b>water,</b> <b>heart</b> rate and skin vascular resistance were reduced during immersion in CO_ 2 -water as reported irrespective of the ingredients. In terms of the very low frequency range (0. 02 ~ 0. 195 Hz), the power of blood pressure fluctuation during immersion was significantly reduced when the CO_ 2 -water contained more than 1. 5 % NaCl but was not influenced by other ingredients with a similar osmotic pressure and the same specific gravity. The results indicated that coexistent CO_ 2 and sodium ions in bathwater reduce blood pressure fluctuations, and suggested that this combination effect of CO_ 2 and salt contributes to the sedative effect on human cardiovascular functions while bathing in CO_ 2 -hot springs...|$|E

40|$|Heart girth {{and body}} weight were {{measured}} on 100 growing-finishing pigs (50 to 273 lb) at the KSU Swine Teaching and Research Center. Heart girth, in inches, {{was measured using}} a cloth measuring tape. The tape was placed directly behind the front legs and then wrapped around the heart girth and read directly behind the shoulders. Heart girth was strongly correlated (R 2 = 0. 98) with body weight, with the following regression equation: pig weight = 10. 1709 × Heart girth - 205. 7492. The 95 % confidence interval shows the projected weight to be ± 10 lb of the actual weight of the pig. To validate our equation we weighed and measured heart girth on 40 pigs from a commercial breeding farm {{and a group of}} 165 pigs at the 2002 Swine Classic Youth Exposition. At the commercial breeding farm, the actual measured body weights fit within the 95 % confidence interval from their projected weights, based on the regression equation. The average residual (difference between predicted and actual weight) of the 40 pigs was - 0. 70 lb with a range of ± 4 lb. The actual weights of pigs at the Swine Classic averaged 16 lb greater than their predicted body weights with a range of ± 8. 5 lb. The actual weights failed to fall within the 95 % confidence interval for the developed regression equation.

40|$|Background: Electrocution {{can cause}} damages in tissue and body {{biochemical}} changes including heart muscles hypercontraction and elevation of creatine kinase–MB serum level. The {{purpose of this}} study is to prove effects of electrical current directly and through medium of water toward the amount of heart muscle fibre hypercontraction points and elevation of creatine kinase–MB serum level. Method: 54 wistar mice was chosen using simple random sampling. Samples then divided into 9 groups, i. e. group 1 – 4 had direct exposure to electrical current, 1 - 30 mA, 31 - 60 mA, 61 - 90 mA, 91 - 120 mA, respectively. Group 5 – 8 were exposed to electrical current through medium of water, 1 - 30 mA, 31 - 60 mA, 61 - 90 mA, 91 - 120 mA, respectively. Group 9 were not exposed to electrical current. After 7 days of adaptation, exposure of electrical current were performed then creatine kinase–MB were measured from sinus retroorbitalis using COBAS Integral 400 Plus-Roche and number of heart mucle fibre hypercontraction points were counted. Data analysis were performed using Spearman, Pearson correlation test and independent t test Result: Correlation value between the strength of exposure of electrical current and through medium of water with the amount of heart muscle fibre hypercontraction points were 0. 981 (p = 0. 000) and 0. 423 (p = 0. 020), while correlation number between the strength of exposure of electrical current and through medium of water with elevation of creatine kinase–MB serum level in wistar mice 0. 256 (p = 0. 172) and 0. 337 (p = 0. 068). Conclusion: There is a strong positive correlation between the strength of electrical current exposures with the amount of heart muscle hypercontraction points. There is no correlation between the strentgh of electrical current exposures with elevation of creatine kinase–MB level in wistar mice.
