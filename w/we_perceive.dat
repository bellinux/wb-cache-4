25|$|Sanskaras, once {{acquired}} and accumulated, form {{what can}} be compared to a lens through which the subjective aspects of our experience such as judgment arise. Thus when <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> (either thoughts or external objects) we apperceive those objects through the lens of past experience. <b>We</b> <b>perceive</b> through the imprint or conditioning of past impressions or sanskaras.|$|E
25|$|According to Aristotle's {{theory of}} perception, <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> an object by {{receiving}} its form with our sense organs. Thus, forms include complex qualia such as colors, textures, and flavors, not just shapes.|$|E
25|$|In the {{dialogue}} Phaedo, Plato formulated his famous Theory of Forms as distinct and immaterial substances {{of which the}} objects and other phenomena that <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> {{in the world are}} nothing more than mere shadows.|$|E

25|$|This {{calculated}} value of g only includes true gravity. It {{does not include}} the reduction of constraint force that <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> as a reduction of gravity due to the rotation of Earth, and some of gravity being counteracted by centrifugal force.|$|E
25|$|Elucidating the {{connections}} between language (especially names and nouns), meaning and the way <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> the world has provided a rich field of study for philosophers and linguists. Relevant areas of study include: the distinction between proper names and proper nouns; {{and the relationship between}} names, their referents, meanings (semantics), and the structure of language.|$|E
25|$|At first glance, the {{solution}} to the problem of how <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> speech seems deceptively simple. If one could identify stretches of the acoustic waveform that correspond to units of perception, then the path from sound to meaning would be clear. However, this correspondence or mapping has proven extremely difficult to find, even after some forty-five years of research on the problem.|$|E
60|$|By {{degrees and}} very {{cautiously}} they approached us. To our joy, <b>we</b> <b>perceived</b> that behind them walked several {{young women who}} bore wooden trays of food or fruit.|$|R
60|$|But <b>we</b> <b>perceived</b> the {{infection}} kept chiefly in the out-parishes, which being very populous, and fuller also of poor, the distemper found more to prey upon {{than in the}} city, as I shall observe afterwards. <b>We</b> <b>perceived,</b> I say, the distemper to draw our way, viz., by the parishes of Clarkenwell, Cripplegate, Shoreditch, and Bishopsgate; which last two parishes joining to Aldgate, Whitechappel, and Stepney, {{the infection}} came at length to spread its utmost rage and violence in those parts, even when it abated at the western parishes where it began.|$|R

25|$|This {{variation}} of input signals {{calls for a}} variety of cells of the cortex in lamina 1 to have different modality-selectiveness and morphologies. These varying neurons are responsible for the different feelings <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> in our body and can be classified by their responses to ranges of stimuli. The brain uses the integration of these signals to maintain homeostasis in the body whether it is temperature related or pain related.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{equivalence}} principle guided {{the development of}} general relativity, {{it is not a}} founding principle of relativity but rather a simple consequence of the geometrical nature of the theory. In general relativity, objects in free-fall follow geodesics of spacetime, and what <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> as the force of gravity is instead a result of our being unable to follow those geodesics of spacetime, because the mechanical resistance of matter prevents us from doing so.|$|E
25|$|The {{equations}} used {{in physics}} to model reality do not treat {{time in the}} same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of classical mechanics are symmetric with respect to time, and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if both time and other quantities (such as charge and parity) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time flowing in one direction is an artifact of the laws of thermodynamics (<b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> time as flowing in the direction of increasing entropy).|$|E
60|$|I did {{not quite}} like {{the tone of his}} voice, but at that moment a smart knock reached our ears, and looking out of the window <b>we</b> <b>perceived</b> the two detectives waiting for us below.|$|R
60|$|The same cry, {{in words}} not very different, came {{from both of}} us, that the other was come in {{compliment}} to say farewell, and then <b>we</b> <b>perceived</b> in a flash we were to ship together.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{afterwards}} {{we observed}} a faint flash of lightning, which {{was followed by}} another and deeper rumble of heaven's artillery. Looking up through the branches <b>we</b> <b>perceived</b> that the sky had become overcast with heavy clouds.|$|R
25|$|Fuzzy-trace theory, a dual {{process model}} {{of memory and}} reasoning, was also derived from Gestalt psychology. Fuzzy-trace theory posits that we encode {{information}} into two separate traces: verbatim and gist. Information stored in verbatim is exact memory for detail (the individual parts of a pattern, for example) while information stored in gist is semantic and conceptual (what <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> the pattern to be). The effects seen in Gestalt psychology {{can be attributed to}} the way we encode information as gist.|$|E
25|$|For flat mirrors, {{the law of}} {{reflection}} implies that images of objects are upright and the same distance behind the mirror as the objects are {{in front of the}} mirror. The image size {{is the same as the}} object size. The law also implies that mirror images are parity inverted, which <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> as a left-right inversion. Images formed from reflection in two (or any even number of) mirrors are not parity inverted. Corner reflectors retroreflect light, producing reflected rays that travel back in the direction from which the incident rays came.|$|E
25|$|The {{liability}} of West Virginia is a deepseated equity, not discharged {{by changes in}} the form of the debt, nor split up by the unilateral attempt of Virginia to apportion specific parts to the two states. If one-third of the debt were discharged in fact to all intents, <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> no reason in what has happened why West Virginia should not contribute her proportion of the remaining two-thirds. But we are of opinion that no part of the debt is extinguished, and further, that nothing has happened to bring the rule of New Hampshire v. Louisiana into play.|$|E
60|$|Looking about, <b>we</b> <b>perceived</b> {{the team}} hitched across the street, while those we sought {{had gone into}} a confectory close by. I could see Marjorie dancing {{in front of the}} door with a box of candy.|$|R
60|$|When {{we came to}} it {{beneath the}} lion-skin, the Professor's face was black and hideous to see, but, to our relief, <b>we</b> <b>perceived</b> {{that he was not}} dead, for he moved his hand and moaned. Orme looked at me.|$|R
60|$|All {{this while}} {{we had been}} {{advancing}} steadily towards {{the centre of the}} open space, in the midst of which were placed some stools. As <b>we</b> proceeded <b>we</b> <b>perceived</b> another small party coming {{from the direction of the}} royal hut.|$|R
25|$|The {{organization}} {{evolved from}} a community mural workshop in which the participants designed and painted the portable mural “Masks of God, Soul of Man” for the Bernal Heights Library. The group signed the piece as Precita Eyes Muralists because the project was a collaborative effort. The name of the organization {{comes from the fact}} that most of the muralists were from Precita Valley. Precita is a diminutive form of the Spanish word ‘presa,’ which means dam; the word ‘Precita’ means little dam. The ‘Eyes’ in the name are what <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> the visual world with, our own eyes.|$|E
25|$|Austrian {{psychiatrist}} Alfred Adler (1870–1937), who parted {{ways with}} Freud, emphasised {{the role of}} goals and motivation in his Individual Psychology. One of Adler's most famous ideas is {{that we try to}} compensate for inferiorities that <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> in ourselves. A lack of power often lies at the root of feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.|$|E
25|$|If a river, {{subject to}} tides, {{constituted}} {{the boundary of}} a State, and at flood {{the waters of the}} river flowed through a narrow channel, round an extensive body of land, but receded from that channel at ebb, so as to leave the land it surrounded at high water, connected with {{the main body of the}} country; this portion of territory would scarcely be considered as belonging to the State on the opposite side of the river, although that State should have the property of the river. The principle that a country bounded by a river extends to low water mark, a principle so natural, and of such obvious convenience as to have been generally adopted, would, we think, apply to that case. <b>We</b> <b>perceive</b> no sufficient reason why it should not apply to this.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>perceived</b> at once, {{as soon as}} we {{came into}} the main street again, from the excited {{demeanour}} of the crowd and from the anxious faces of people running to and fro that something of great moment must be happening.|$|R
60|$|When, {{so far as}} {{we could}} judge, we had gone some fifty paces, <b>we</b> <b>perceived</b> that the passage was growing faintly light. Another minute, and we were in perhaps the most {{wonderful}} place that the eyes of living man have beheld.|$|R
50|$|Upon our Talking {{and making}} Signs to him, {{he wrote a}} Line or two before us, and when he read it, {{pronounced}} the Words Allah and Mahommed; by which, and his refusing a Glass of Wine we offered him, <b>we</b> <b>perceived</b> he was a Mahometan, but could not imagine of what Country he was, or how he got thither; for by his affable Carriage, and the easy Composure of his Countenance, <b>we</b> could <b>perceive</b> he was no common Slave.|$|R
25|$|Once one accepts The Matrix as a {{generated}} {{reality of}} malicious machines invention {{then this is}} Descartes' First Meditation, or evil demon, a hypothesis that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise {{can be found in}} Hilary Putnam's brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s. One can make a connection between the premise of The Matrix and Plato's Allegory of the Cave; once one accepts that The Matrix is an illusion, then the allegory of the cave becomes clear. The allegory is related to Plato's theory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object is not what <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.|$|E
25|$|The {{more closely}} we look into history, the more clearly shall <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> {{that the system}} of chivalry is an {{invention}} almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries {{in which it is}} said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The Romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by Francis I. At the present day , we imagine we can still see chivalry flourishing in the persons of Du Guesclin and Bayard, under Charles V and Francis I. But when we come to examine either the one period or the other, although we find in each some heroic spirits, we are forced to confess {{that it is necessary to}} antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.|$|E
25|$|Distractor {{inhibition}} {{model is}} the oldest model that explains the negative priming effect {{as the result of}} selective attention to a target stimulus. When we pay attention to a particular stimulus, <b>we</b> <b>perceive</b> other stimuli surrounding the target as distractors in order to help focus. But when one of those distractors becomes the new target of attention, our response to the target is hampered due to immediate residual inhibition. Selective attention is the ability to respond to a specific object when there are other distractors that also compete for a response. To explain this selective attention, the distractor inhibition model proposes a dual mechanism involving excitation to boost target signal and inhibition to suppress distractors. This inhibition is triggered when there is a mismatch between the internal representations of the target and a distractor. Inhibition of the distractor's internal representation is a way of helping to selectively attend to the target stimulus. This inhibition decays gradually when the stimulus is no longer present to help with the next target. However, if a distractor stimulus is re-encountered as the target, the internal representation of the distractor stimulus may continue to be suppressed because it is too soon for the decay to dissipate already. This {{is referred to as the}} transient residual inhibition. This inhibition also impairs the processing of an appropriate response to the new target stimulus and results in greater reaction time.|$|E
60|$|In {{five miles}} we saw no rift or break. And then {{suddenly}} <b>we</b> <b>perceived</b> something which filled us with new hope. In a hollow of the rock, protected from rain, there was drawn a rough arrow in chalk, pointing still to the westwards.|$|R
60|$|Coasting by {{a portion}} of it, which Mohi called Kanneeda, a {{province}} of King Bello's, <b>we</b> <b>perceived</b> the groves rocking in the wind; their flexible boughs bending like bows; and the leaves flying forth, and darkening the landscape, like flocks of pigeons.|$|R
60|$|Just before sundown, as we rested {{after our}} toil, <b>we</b> <b>perceived</b> {{a small company}} of men {{advancing}} towards us {{from the direction of}} Loo, one of whom bore a palm leaf in his hand for a sign that he came as a herald.|$|R
