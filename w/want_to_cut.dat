500|$|The {{costs of}} filming Titanic {{eventually}} began to mount and finally reached $200million. Fox executives panicked and suggested {{an hour of}} specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics {{are more likely to}} help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, [...] "You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!" [...] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.|$|E

It's so hyped to {{where you want to}} punch a hole in somebody's head or punch a hole through the wall." [...] "Good Guys Get Left Behind" [...] is a love song, that features multiple twists and turns. [...] "Old Friend" [...] is based around a friend of his that became addicted to methamphetamine and the personal issues which he suffered from it.

500|$|In the 2012 presidential campaign, {{during which}} he {{acknowledged}} {{it was unlikely that}} he would win the Republican Party nomination, Paul again asserted that he was participating in the Republican Party on his own terms, trying to persuade the rest of the party to move toward his positions rather than joining in with theirs. He expressed doubt that he would support any of his rivals should they win the nomination, warning that, “If the policies of the Republican Party are the same as the Democrat Party and they don't want to change anything on foreign policy, they don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> anything, they don't want to audit the Fed and find out about monetary policy, they don't want to have actual change in government, that is a problem for me." [...] On that same theme he said in another interview, [...] "I would be reluctant to jump on board and tell all of the supporters that have given me trust and money that all of a sudden, I'd say, [...] we've done is for naught. So, let's support anybody at all … even if they disagree with everything that we do." ...|$|E
500|$|True Finns {{have said}} that Finland should not financially support the European Financial Stability Facility that led to bailouts for Ireland and Greece. Timo Soini asked: [...] "How come they (the European Union) can't see the euro doesn't work?" [...] The party {{manifesto}} {{said that they would}} support a capital gains tax increase from 28% to 30% and an increased tax on alcohol. The party also opposed mention of Finland's EU membership in the constitution and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> social welfare for immigrants. Soini also suggested Finland should unilaterally withdraw from the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and some other international commitments and that giving up the euro was an option. While speculating about a possible ministerial portfolio he later backed down on commitments when journalists asked him if the issues would be True Finns' demands in any possible government formation talks, citing the proposals as his personal opinion and not necessarily incorporated into a prospective government policy programme. He continued to maintain that the EU membership issue in the constitution would be a threshold for their participation in government formation talks. Helsingin Sanomat suggested that these demands could prove detrimental to a chance for True Finns to join a governing coalition. The True Finns also support the continuation of social welfare benefits. The party's support for the benefits along with its stance on the EU bailouts was also seen as one reason for its growth in popularity {{at a time when the}} country was facing welfare cuts by the government. The True Finns' vice-chairman Vesa-Matti Saarakkala said that [...] "the True Finns will not participate in a coalition government with any party ready to give further loan guarantees". This stance on the EU's bailout was read by The Wall Street Journal as detrimental to the euro zone's attempt to reassure bond investors that it would not face debt problems. It also said that a good showing for the True Finns could threaten Portugal's EU-sponsored bailout.|$|E

[...] He then promised that [...] "what happens to Alfie next is absolutely great!" [...] When asked what Alfie might do when he finds out who Kat is having the affair with, Richie said that he would get revenge, as [...] "everyone forgets Alfie's been in jail. Marriage has taken off his edge, but if he finds out his wife has been with one of his closest friends, well, any bloke would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the other blokes knackers [...] off, wouldn't he?"
