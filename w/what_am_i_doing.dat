5|$|Chatwin also edited a {{collection}} of his journalism, which was published as <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> Here (1989). At {{the time of his}} death in 1989, he was working on a number of new ideas for future novels, including a transcontinental epic provisionally titled Lydia Livingstone.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years after}} the start of his {{collaboration}} with Sergio Leone, Morricone also started to score music for another Spaghetti Western director, Sergio Corbucci. The composer wrote music for Corbucci's Navajo Joe (1966), The Hellbenders (1967), The Mercenary/The Professional Gun (1968), The Great Silence (1968), Compañeros (1970), Sonny and Jed (1972) and <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> in the Middle of the Revolution? (1972).|$|E
500|$|Chatwin {{returned}} {{to the subject of}} art and objects during his career. In his early writing for the Sunday Times Magazine, he wrote about art and artists, and many of these articles Chatwin included in <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> Here. The main focus of Utz is on the impact the possession of art (in this case porcelain figures) has on a collector. Utz's unwillingness to give up his porcelain collection kept him in Czechoslovakia even though he had the opportunity to live in the West. Chatwin constantly struggled with the conflicting desires to own beautiful items and to live in a space free of unnecessary objects. His distaste for the art world was the result of his days at Sotheby's, and some of his final writing focused on this. The final section of <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> Here, [...] "Tales from the Art World," [...] consists of four short stories on this topic. At the end of <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> Here, Chatwin shares an anecdote about advice he had received from Noël Coward, who told him [...] "Never let anything artistic stand in your way." [...] Chatwin stated, [...] "I've always acted on that advice." ...|$|E

All promises and statements made by our leaders and ministers {{have turned out to be}} shallow. Our suffering gives them their moment in limelight. My daughter asks me what I have done to get her justice. She asks <b>what</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>doing</b> so that many more like her get justice and I wake up to realise how helpless and trivial I am..." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} from Patagonia, Chatwin {{discovered}} a change in leadership at The Sunday Times Magazine and his retainer was not continued. Chatwin intended his next project to be a biography of Francisco Félix de Sousa, a nineteenth-century slave trader born in Brazil who became the Viceroy of Ouidah in Dahomey (present day Benin). Chatwin had first heard of de Sousa {{during a visit to}} Dahomey in 1972. He returned to the country, by then renamed the People's Republic of Benin, in December 1976 to conduct research. In January 1977, the 1977 Benin coup d'état attempt took place, and Chatwin was accused of being a mercenary, arrested, and detained for three days. Chatwin later wrote about this experience in [...] "A Coup—A Story," [...] which was published in Granta and included in <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> Here (1989).|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} filmed during September 9–11, 1994 at the Lenox Lounge and on {{location}} on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. McDaniel {{and her team}} scouted out low-rent, speak-easy locations and they did street-casting, assembling off-beat characters, from transvestites to card tricksters and edgy Harlem teenagers. However, {{when it came to}} filming there was a problem—McDaniel's approach was to start the camera and let the cast improvise, but Madonna wanted direction. She would sit on the chair and when McDaniel said [...] "Action", she would still sit there saying impatiently, [...] "What am I doing? <b>What</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>doing?</b> Hello?" [...] The director was overawed by Madonna's big entourage and had held herself from speaking her mind about the singer's look. She later asked Madonna to appear edgy like Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in the 1990 drama film Last Exit to Brooklyn. Madonna had her hair and makeup re-done and it was the final look for the video.|$|E
