5|$|As many {{newspapers}} {{belonging to}} the dwindling Communist Party, Arbeideren would cease to exist {{before the end of}} the 1920s. It was still published six times a <b>week,</b> <b>but</b> had to give up its printing press in 1929, switching to Samtrykk in Oslo. The last ever issue of Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad was published on 4 October 1929.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of her husband's election, some sources {{anticipated}} that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African-Americans. Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion <b>week,</b> <b>but</b> Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.|$|E

There were {{concerns}} about Stevens' fitness as he had missed races after being thrown from a horse the previous <b>week,</b> <b>but</b> medical tests {{showed no sign of}} injury. Oxbow was the third favorite at 5–1 on the morning line, but by race time his odds were at 10–1.|$|E

5|$|Other {{traditions and}} customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall {{six times a}} <b>week,</b> <b>but</b> in others this only happens occasionally. At most colleges these formal meals require gowns to be worn, and a Latin grace is said.|$|E
5|$|These snakes {{do well in}} captivity, {{but there}} are reports of gluttony. Kauffeld (1969) {{mentions}} that specimens can be maintained for years on only one meal per <b>week,</b> <b>but</b> that when offered all they can eat, the result is often death, or at best wholesale regurgitation. They are bad-tempered snakes and some specimens never settle down in captivity, always hissing and puffing when approached.|$|E

With the charting, Usher passed Ludacris for the most top three hits. The song also peaked at number sixty-eight on the Austrian Singles Chart.|$|E
5|$|By November 1885, Adler had a {{theatrical}} club of his own, the Princes Street Club, No. 3 Princes Street (now Princelet Street, E1), purpose-built, financed by a butcher named David Smith. It seated 300; playing every night except Friday, he was earning about £3 s.10 a <b>week,</b> <b>but</b> with a fame {{well out of}} proportion to the meagre money. Many of the most prominent figures in Yiddish theater, including Sigmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, Abba and Clara Shoengold, and Sara Heine (the future Sara Adler), gave guest performances when they passed through London.|$|E
5|$|Cole was an Australian Institute of Sport Scholarship holder. Her coach, Graeme Carroll, trained her in Canberra in {{preparation}} for the 2012 London Paralympics with an approach that combined swim training with aerobics and gym work. She trained with Teigan Van Roosmalen, a blind and deaf S13 swimmer. Cole also mentors young athletes. When not in high school Cole was undertaking ten or more swimming sessions a <b>week</b> <b>but,</b> while at school, she reduced her load. As of 2015, her coach is Nathan Doyle.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{proceeded}} rapidly {{during the}} <b>week,</b> <b>but</b> did not {{touch on the}} issue of Lisbon until the fifth day, 26 July, when Hughes and Johnston met with Smith, Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont, and Trade and Industry Minister George Rudland. Dupont opened the discussion by referring to Sandys' statement from 1963, which said the Rhodesian government would retain any rights previously granted to the Federation, which Dupont reasoned surely included the ability given in 1957 to appoint its own overseas agents if it informed Britain. As Portugal had indicated its willingness to accept a Rhodesian diplomat, Dupont said, the Rhodesian government was acting perfectly within its rights.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1942 Cardus {{rented a}} small flat in the Kings Cross {{district}} of Sydney, where {{he wrote his}} Ten Composers (1945) and Autobiography (1947). He said later that he found the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult at first, but that the process had turned him from a journalist into something more substantial. When later in 1942 his wife announced her intention of sailing from England to join him, Cardus declined {{to move to a}} larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a mile away. They dined together once a <b>week,</b> <b>but</b> otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.|$|E

He was earning up to £33 a <b>week.</b> <b>But</b> in 1973, at the age of 21, the pain in his joints became so severe that he was forced to retire.|$|E

5|$|The next {{rebellion}} against royal power in Transylvania {{broke out in}} 1467.
