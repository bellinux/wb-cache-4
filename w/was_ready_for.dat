General Carleton had a 9,000 man army at Fort Saint-Jean, but needed to build a fleet to carry it on the lake.

5|$|The Platt-LePage XR-1, {{also known}} by the company {{designation}} PL-3, was an early American twin-rotor helicopter, built by the Platt-LePage Aircraft Company of Eddystone, Pennsylvania. The winner of a United States Army Air Corps design competition held in early 1940, the XR-1 was the first helicopter tested by the USAAF, flying in 1941. The flight testing of the XR-1 proved troublesome, and although continued testing showed that the design had promise, other, improved helicopters were becoming available before the XR-1 <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> service. As a result, {{the development of the}} aircraft was terminated in 1945.|$|E
