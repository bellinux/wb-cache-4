500|$|In November 1940, the German Luftwaffe began bombing Southampton, {{where the}} OS offices were located. Crawford removed {{some of the}} old OS maps and stored them in the garage of his house at Nursling, while also unsuccessfully urging the Director-General to remove the OS' archive of books, documents, maps and {{photographs}} to a secure location. Subsequently, the OS headquarters were destroyed in the bombing, resulting in the loss of most of their archive. The refusal of the OS administration to take his warnings seriously infuriated Crawford, exacerbating his anger about the civil service's red tape and bureaucracy. In his words, [...] "trying to get a move on in the Civil Service <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> swim in a lake of glue". Resigning his membership in various British societies, he unsuccessfully tried to find employment abroad.|$|E
500|$|Raich Carter {{once said}} of Frank Swift {{that he looked}} so big in goal that as a forward it often seemed that trying to score against him <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> put the ball into a matchbox. Swift's hands, which had a finger span of , were {{sufficiently}} large for him to easily pick up the ball with one hand, and {{gave rise to the}} nickname [...] "Frying Pan Hands". Swift kicked with his left foot as the result of an injury to his right foot sustained during his youth. However, where possible he preferred throwing the ball to the wing over kicking it downfield. When asked for advice to give to young goalkeepers, Swift replied that he drew diagrams of each goal scored against him {{to see if he was}} at fault.|$|E
500|$|Rule {{changes for}} the 2005 season {{required}} tyres to last an entire race, tipping the overall advantage to teams using Michelins over teams such as Ferrari that relied on Bridgestone tyres. The rule changes were partly {{in an effort to}} dent Ferrari's dominance and make the series more interesting. The most notable moment of the early season for Schumacher was his battle with Fernando Alonso in San Marino, where he started 13th and finished only 0.2 seconds behind the Spanish driver. Less than halfway through the season, Schumacher said [...] "I don't think I can count myself in this battle any more. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> fight with a blunted weapon.... If your weapons are weak you don't have a chance." [...] Schumacher's sole win in 2005 came at the [...] Prior to that race, the Michelin tyres were found to have significant safety issues. When no compromise between the teams and the FIA could be reached, all but the six drivers using Bridgestone tyres dropped out of the race after the formation lap. Schumacher retired in six of the 19 races. He finished the season in third with 62 points, fewer than half the points of World Champion Alonso.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Todd McCarthy of Variety {{thought that}} the film should have {{remained}} an episode of Tales from the Crypt. Critic James Berardinelli believed that although The Frighteners wasn't [...] "a bad film", it was [...] "a disappointment, following Jackson's powerful, true-life matricide tale, Heavenly Creatures", {{and because of that}} [...] "The Frighteners fell short of expectations by being just one of many in the long line of 1996 summer movies." [...] Chicago Sun-Times Roger Ebert, felt that Jackson was more interested in prosthetic makeup designs, computer animation, and special effects than writing a cohesive storyline. Ebert and critic Gene Siskel gave it a [...] "two thumbs down" [...] rating on their TV show At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. Chicago Reader critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, described the film's special effects as [...] "ugly, aggressive" [...] and [...] "proliferating", saying that [...] "trying to keep interested in [...] <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> remain interested in a loudmouth shouting in [...] ear". Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle stated that [...] "instead of moving the horror genre in new directions, The Frighteners simply falls apart from its barrage of visual effects and the overmixed onslaught of Danny Elfman's music score". The Austin Chronicles Joey O'Brien, said that although the screenplay was [...] "practically loaded with wild ideas, knowingly campy dialogue and offbeat characterizations", it [...] "switched gears" [...] too fast and too frequently that [...] "the audience is left struggling to catch up as [...] twists and turns its way unmercifully towards a literally out-of-this-world finale".|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} illustrative metaphors {{have been used}} to {{describe}} Petrosian's style of play. Harold C. Schonberg said that [...] "playing him <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> put handcuffs on an eel. There was nothing to grip." [...] He {{has been described as a}} centipede lurking in the dark, a tiger looking for the opportunity to pounce, a python who slowly squeezes his victims to death, and as a crocodile who waits for hours to make a decisive strike. Boris Spassky, who succeeded Petrosian as World Chess Champion, described his style of play as such: [...] "Petrosian reminds me of a hedgehog. Just when you think you have caught him, he puts out his quills." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{newspaper}} accounts, and {{a lengthy}} {{account of the}} game in the 1911 Michiganensian yearbook, the game was a scoreless tie late in the fourth quarter. [...] Michigan took possession at the forty-yard line with 60 yards to go for a touchdown. [...] The Michiganensian described the game-winning drive this way: [...] "With the sun already far down in the West, [...] [...] [...] and the ball in Michigan's possession, sixty yards from Minnesota’s goal, the unexpected did take place. [...] 'Shorty' McMillan signaled for a forward pass[...] [...] [...] 'Stan' (Wells) ran backwards and threw far and true to Borleske, who was thirty yards down the field before a Swede tackled him. [...] Minnesota was slightly worried. [...] Thirty yards on one play, and it seemed certain that Michigan would now try some old football. [...] Instead, 'Shorty' called for the same play and again Wells threw true to Borleske, who was tackled on the Gopher two yard line. [...] Minnesota, desperate, tried to check the onslaught, but it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> turn a freshet from its course. [...] Wells hit the line but was thrown back. [...] Again the auburned lad struck the line. [...] Minnesota blocked his path. [...] 'Stan' twisted slightly and slipped between two men. [...] When the officials separated the men, the ball was {{on the far side of}} the Gopher goal line." ...|$|E

60|$|After church, Miss Charlecote {{proposed}} a few {{turns in the}} garden; dingy enough, but a marvel for the situation: and here the tacit object of herself and Phoebe was to afford Robert {{an opportunity for the}} interview on which so much depended. But it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> catch a butterfly; Lucilla was here, there, everywhere; and an excuse was hardly made for leaving her beside the grave, silent young man, ere her merry tones were heard chattering to some one else. Perhaps Robert, heart-sick and oppressed with the importance of what trembled on his tongue, was not ready in seizing the moment; perhaps she would not let him speak; at any rate, she was aware of some design; since, baffling Phoebe's last attempt, she danced up to her bedroom after her, and throwing herself into a chair, in a paroxysm of laughter, cried, 'You abominable little pussycat of a manoeuvrer; I thought you were in a better school for the proprieties! No, don't make your round eyes, and look so dismayed, or you'll kill me with laughing! Cooking tete-a-tetes, Phoebe--I thought better of you. Oh, fie!' and holding up her finger, as if in displeasure, she hid her face in ecstasies of mirth at Phoebe's bewildered simplicity.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} facts in our literary history is the pre-eminence at once so frankly and unanimously conceded to Spenser by his contemporaries. At first, it is true, he had not many rivals. Before the [...] "Faery Queen" [...] two long poems were printed and popular,--the [...] "Mirror for Magistrates" [...] and Warner's [...] "Albion's England,"--and not long after it came the [...] "Polyolbion" [...] of Drayton and the [...] "Civil Wars" [...] of Daniel. This was the period of the saurians in English poetry, interminable poems, book after book and canto after canto, like far-stretching vertebrae, that at first sight would seem to have rendered earth unfit for the habitation of man. They most of them sleep well now, as once they made their readers sleep, and their huge remains lie embedded in the deep morasses of Chambers and Anderson. We wonder at the length of face and general atrabilious look that mark the portraits of the men of that generation, but it is no marvel when even their relaxations were such downright hard work. Fathers when their day on earth was up must have folded down the leaf and left the task to be finished by their sons,--a dreary inheritance. Yet both Drayton and Daniel are fine poets, though both of them in their most elaborate works made shipwreck of their genius on the shoal of a bad subject. Neither of them could make poetry coalesce with gazetteering or chronicle-making. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> put a declaration of love into the forms of a declaration in trover. The [...] "Polyolbion" [...] is nothing less than a versified gazetteer of England and Wales,--fortunately Scotland was not yet annexed, or the poem would have been even longer, and already it is the plesiosaurus of verse. Mountains, rivers, and even marshes are personified, to narrate historical episodes, or to give us geographical lectures.

6000|$|It was like, I suppose, {{most schools}} of its type, an obscene, {{bullying}} place, where {{a big boy}} would hit a small boy in the wind to see him double up, and where certain boys, too young for any emotion of sex, would sing the dirty songs of the street, but I daresay it suited me better than a better school. I have heard the head-master say, [...] "how has so-and-so done in his Greek?" [...] and the class-master reply, [...] "very badly, but he is doing well in his cricket," [...] and the head-master has gone away saying [...] "Oh, leave him alone." [...] I was unfitted for school work, and though I would often work well for weeks together, I had to give the whole evening to one lesson if I was to know it.

I was always near the bottom of my class, and always making excuses that but added to my timidity; but no master was rough with me. I was known to collect moths and butterflies and to get into no worse mischief than hiding now and again an old tailless white rat in my coat-pocket or my desk. There was but one interruption of our quiet habits, the brief engagement of an Irish master, a fine Greek scholar and vehement teacher, but of fantastic speech. He would open the class by saying, [...] "there he goes, there he goes," [...] or some like words as the head-master passed by {{at the end of the}} hall. [...] "Of course this school is no good. How could it be with a clergyman for head-master?" [...] And then perhaps his eye would light on me, and he would make me stand up and tell me it was a scandal I was so idle when all the world knew that any Irish boy was cleverer than a whole class-room of English boys, a description I had to pay for afterwards. Sometimes he would call up a little boy who had a girl's face and kiss him upon both cheeks and talk of taking him to Greece in the holidays, and presently we heard he had written to the boy's parents about it, but long before the holidays he was dismissed.|$|E
