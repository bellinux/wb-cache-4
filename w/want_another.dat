5|$|By the 1930–31 season, {{the team}} was openly selling players to make ends meet. Star defenceman King Clancy was sold to Toronto for an {{unprecedented}} $35,000 and two players on October 11, 1930. The team fell into last place {{for the first time}} since 1898. In 1931, a potential deal arose with the owners of Chicago Stadium, including grain magnate James E. Norris, who wanted to move the team to Chicago, but the deal was vetoed by Chicago Black Hawks owner Frederic McLaughlin who did not <b>want</b> <b>another</b> team in his territory. Norris bought the bankrupt Detroit Falcons instead and turned them into the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Northcott as Chief of the General Staff and Blamey as Commander-in-Chief bore some similarities {{to the one}} between the RAAF's Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, and Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, {{the commander of the}} RAAF forces in the field, but Blamey was senior to Northcott, both in rank and in the Army's command structure. The relationship could still have been a delicate one, but in the event it was characterised by none of the rancour and rivalry that marred the wartime administration of the RAAF. In late 1943, Blamey sought to appoint Northcott as his deputy, but the government turned down his request, on the advice of General Douglas MacArthur, who did not <b>want</b> <b>another</b> officer who was answerable both to himself and the Australian Government. However, when Blamey travelled to Washington, D.C. and London in April 1944, he arranged for Northcott to act as Commander-in-Chief in his absence. After Wynter's death in February 1945, the post of LGA was abolished and the CGS again became responsible for administration.|$|E
25|$|Ignatieff's {{attempt to}} force a September 2009 {{election}} was reported as a miscalculation, as polls showed that most Canadians did not <b>want</b> <b>another</b> election. Ignatieff's popularity {{as well as that}} of the Liberals dropped off considerably immediately afterwards.|$|E

25|$|However, Luciano {{and other}} mob members did not <b>want</b> <b>another</b> top leader. When Maranzano learned about Luciano's disaffection, {{he hired a}} gunman to kill him. However, in September 1931 Luciano struck first. Several Jewish assassins {{provided}} by Luciano associate Meyer Lansky murdered Maranzano in his office. Luciano now became the most powerful mobster in New York.|$|E
25|$|When New Spain Viceroy Luis de Velasco died in 1564, the cabildo (city council) of Mexico City {{informed}} Spain {{they did}} not <b>want</b> <b>another</b> viceroy. Word that the Council of the Indies in Spain would not agree to make encomiendas permanent led to a conspiracy to make New Spain independent of the mother country. In 1565, Martín Cortés, Marquess del Valle, son and heir of Hernán Cortés, and Luis, another son, were the leaders of this conspiracy (the Conspiracy of 1565).|$|E
25|$|No Oakland player wore Russell's #2 {{during the}} regular season for several years after his release; only punter Marquette King donned it, during Oakland's 2012 preseason before being placed on season-ending injured reserve. In 2011, newly drafted quarterback Terrelle Pryor's request to wear #2 was turned down by then-coach Hue Jackson; it is widely {{believed}} that the Raiders did not <b>want</b> <b>another</b> highly touted quarterback wearing the same number as the disappointing Russell. However, in 2013 Raiders coach Dennis Allen allowed Pryor to trade numbers with King; he debuted on Oakland's practice field on August 21, 2013 wearing the jersey number he had worn at Ohio State.|$|E

25|$|May {{asserted}} that in Paris, London and other capitals, {{there was an}} inability to believe that someone might <b>want</b> <b>another</b> world war. He wrote that, given public reluctance to contemplate another war and a need to reach consensus about Germany, the rulers of France and Britain were reticent (to take a stand against German aggression), which limited dissent {{at the cost of}} enabling assumptions that suited their convenience. In France, Édouard Daladier withheld information until the last moment, and then presented the Munich Agreement to the French cabinet as a fait accompli in September 1938, thus avoiding discussions over whether Britain would follow France into war or if the military balance was really in Germany's favour or how significant it was. The decision for war in September 1939 and the plan devised in the winter of 1939–1940 by Daladier for war with the USSR followed the same pattern.|$|E
25|$|In early 1976, Norving {{launched}} {{plans for}} a taxi route between Stavanger Airport, Sola and Skien. It was protested by Haugesund-based Nordsjøfly, who had started linking Haugesund to Stavanger and Bergen, and did not <b>want</b> <b>another</b> regional airline in Rogaland. Both airlines had their applications rejected by the ministry. When the contract to operate Skien Airport was to be renewed in 1978, a local political debate broke out regarding whether the municipality should be subsidizing the airport all the {{time there was a}} train service to the capital. The contract was renewed and Norving continued to take advantage of both a free hangar and no landing fees. Following a twenty percent growth on the Oslo–Skien route in 1978, Norving applied to increase the size of the aircraft to twenty passengers. The application was rejected by the ministry on the grounds that taxi routes were limited to ten-passenger aircraft. In 1979, the route had 14,000 passengers.|$|E
25|$|Tensely, {{people watch}} for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, {{if not for the}} {{pleasure}} of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you <b>want</b> <b>another</b> man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.|$|E

However, when Gowariker decided to start filming What's Your Raashee?, Rahman was busy with other projects including Slumdog Millionaire (2008). Gowariker wanted thirteen songs for the film, but Rahman {{did not have time}} to compose them, and they agreed not to work together on the film. The director revealed that he did not <b>want</b> <b>another</b> established composer because [...] "he wanted someone to work full time on this film for several months."

Jackson's father Joseph also approved of the project and allowed him to record it on the condition that it didn't interfere with group business. Despite his brothers' desire to work with him, Jackson wanted to make the album independently of his family. Nevertheless, his brother Randy still contributed percussion to [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough".|$|E
