So instead of trying to evolve the series necessarily, it's more like taking that concept and putting it in different places – seeing how it works."

500|$|Loevs {{script was}} penned by Sudhanshu Saria [...] in the United States, {{when he was}} working on the {{screenplay}} of another film, I Am Here. Describing the film as [...] "small, fragile, honest", Saria said that through his endeavour he [...] "tries to capture the silences and the things unsaid in male friendships". He wrote Loev because he was unable to put together the financing for I Am Here. At the time of the script's inception, Saria had no plan of making it into a feature film, as he believed that no investors or actors <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with a film that he thought would be censored or banned in its home country. The plot of the film follows many personal experiences that Saria himself went through, growing up in the Indian hill town of Darjeeling, and later at the Ithaca Arts College, New York.|$|E

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives.

[...] The Arsenal manager claimed that Rooney told his players that he felt no contact, but the referee {{made the decision to}} give Manchester United a penalty which he called the turning point of the match. Wenger used statistics to question Riley's impartiality – of the referee's last eight matches at Old Trafford, he awarded eight penalties to the home team. Wenger was not surprised at United's rough treatment of Reyes – [...] "That's what they always try against us when they're in a difficult situation" [...] and accused Van Nistelrooy of being a cheat in his post-match television interview. Vieira, like his manager, was disappointed in Riley's handling of the match, but sought positives: [...] "We're still eight points clear of United and two points clear of Chelsea.

[...] He is confused and enraged, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean Übermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life [...] "that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications". Fincher explained, [...] " [...] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't {{have anything to do with}} the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: You're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now." [...] While studio executives worried that Fight Club was going to be [...] "sinister and seditious", Fincher sought to make it [...] "funny and seditious" [...] by including humor to temper the sinister element.|$|E
500|$|However, Milk's {{assassination}} {{has become}} entwined with his political efficacy, {{partly because he}} was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, [...] "No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death." [...] His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk's success, murder, and the inevitable injustice of White's verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk's life was [...] "a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America". According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend {{has been unable to}} be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: [...] "The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him {{a great deal of the}} Castro's optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one." [...] On the 20th anniversary of Milk's death, historian John D'Emilio said, [...] "The legacy that I think he <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> remembered for is the imperative to live one's life at all times with integrity." [...] For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: [...] "His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process." ...|$|E

Bryant was later shown in an infamous amateur video saying that center Andrew Bynum should have been traded for All-Star Jason Kidd.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{a student}} at Kashima high school and is a classmate of Hazumu's in their second year. As a child, she used to love {{watching}} caterpillars leave their chrysalises and turn into butterflies. However, she never once thought that she herself <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a similar position—changing into something else—so she merely just enjoyed watching the transformation before her. That by itself is enough for her, she recounts to Hazumu. Using this as a metaphor, Ayuki tries to explain to Hazumu that watching her loved one from afar is its own variety of love, though Ayuki never explicitly states just who she admires from a distance. Ayuki is good friends with Tomari, and Ayuki will often give her, and others, advice and help in regards to relationships. Keeping with her stance on watching from afar, Ayuki continuously observes the ongoing development of the love triangle between Hazumu, Yasuna, and Tomari.|$|E
2500|$|Piquet Jr. was criticised {{by many in}} the {{community}} and some suggest that the controversy effectively ended his hopes of continuing in F1. BBC F1 commentator Martin Brundle suggested that Piquet Jr. was now unemployable in Formula One, saying that no team or sponsor <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with the Piquet family. Brundle noted that Piquet Jr. [...] "didn't deliver at Renault, he wasn't fast enough, that's why he was released and that's why he has dropped hand grenades into the system ever since". Brundle was also highly critical that Piquet Jr. escaped sanction from the FIA despite admitting to race-fixing, while the others involved were heavily punished. Other leading F1 figures have echoed Brundle's sentiments. Toyota team principal John Howett was quoted as saying, [...] "I think on his performance...disregarding the issue, I probably would not give him a drive and I would probably be further influenced in that decision by what took place."
