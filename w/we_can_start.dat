25|$|In some cases, cognate terms {{used for}} {{parallel}} {{practices in the}} early medieval Irish and Welsh laws allow us to assume that these practices were already used in what is referred to by linguists as the 'common Celtic period', which is usually dated to around 1000 BC (e.g. Kelly 1988, 231), although this at best is a very rough estimate. Where parallels for such practices exist, but with non-cognate terminology, in other Indo-European laws, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>start</b> to consider the cognate practices as specifically Celtic forms of law. Similarly, where such cognate terminology exists for parallel practices in the early medieval Celtic laws, but not in other Indo-European laws, we can consider these to be specifically Celtic laws.|$|E
25|$|Once we {{have found}} the {{augmented}} shortest path, {{we want to make}} sure we ignore any other paths that are longer than this shortest paths. BFS algorithm marks nodes in path with distance with source being 0. Thus, after doing BFS, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>start</b> at each unmatched vertex in U, follow the path by following nodes with distance that increments by 1. When we finally arrive at the destination vDummy, if its distance is 1 more than last node in V then we know that the path we followed is (one of the possibly many) shortest path. In that case we can go ahead and update the pairing for vertices on path in U and V. Note that each vertex in V on path, except for the last one, is non-free vertex. So updating pairing for these vertices in V to different vertices in U is equivalent to removing previously matched edge and adding new unmatched edge in matching. This is same as doing the symmetric difference (i.e. remove edges common to previous matching and add non-common edges in augmented path in new matching).|$|E

2500|$|Little Inferno is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tomorrow Corporation, an independent game developer founded in 2010 consisting of three people: Kyle Gray, Kyle Gabler, and Allan Blomquist. Gray previously worked on Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure, while Gabler and Blomquist worked on World of Goo. Gabler stated that Little Inferno was inspired by The Yule Log, a television program that consists of a 17-second loop of a burning log. The team had mused that the program was like [...] "a super boring game that some awful company will totally make for the Wii or smartphones," [...] which then inspired the proposal that [...] "WE could be that awful company! But I wonder if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>start</b> with an exceptionally underwhelming premise, but then actually make the game really really surprisingly good?" [...] One of the goals in designing Little Inferno {{was to make the}} game [...] "unpredictable" [...] in order to distinguish it from existing games in which the player might easily determine the direction of the gameplay. Gabler remarked [...] "I want to be taken on a ride, and not know where I'm going. I want game designers to respect me enough to NOT let me know exactly what's going on. Give me hints. Let me NOT know. Let me figure it out. Totally change the game out from under me." ...|$|E
