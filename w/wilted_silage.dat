40|$|Effects of wilting {{of grass}} prior to {{ensiling}} on OM intake, ruminal digestibility, efficiency of bacterial protein synthesis, and amount {{and composition of}} duodenal N fraction were examined using four lactating Holstein cows. Direct-cut or wilted grass silages were fed for ad libitum intake and supplemented with 5. 0 or 5. 3 kg of concentrate, respectively. Milk yield was 18. 1 and 21. 2 kg/d with direct-cut versus <b>wilted</b> <b>silage,</b> and milk protein and fat contents were 2. 63 and 4. 60 % with direct-cut versus 2. 75 and 4. 27 % with <b>wilted</b> <b>silage,</b> respectively. Wilting of the grass (from 17 to 38 % DM) increased OM intake but {{had no effect on}} ruminal digestibility. Total N flow and amounts of different AA in proximal duodenum were increased, and the difference was principally of bacterial origin. The efficiency of bacterial protein synthesis in rumen was related to dilution rate of liquid phase and to the time devoted to ruminating. These results indicate that the passage of bacterial protein to the lower digestive tract is a key factor for improving the assimilation of the soluble N fraction of grass silage and that this phenomenon is related to chewing activity...|$|E

Six mature Friesian cattle, fitted with rumen and simple duodenal cannulae, were fed the silages for ad libitum intake in a crossover design {{consisting of}} two 49 -d periods. Wilting increased intake of organic matter and decreased ruminal apparent digestibility or organic matter and whole tract apparent digestibilities of organic matter, NDF, and total N. Rumen degradability of silage N was increased by wilting (. 7 vs.. 67). Direct-cut silage, in comparison with <b>wilted</b> <b>silage,</b> provide (g/d) less N intake (232 vs. 286) and lower duodenal flows of total N (215 vs. 293), non-NH 3 N (202 vs. 280), microbial N (111 vs. 177), and total amino acids (1056. 8 vs. 1342. 7). Duodenal flows of NH 3 N and undegraded N were not different between silages. Efficiency of bacterial N synthesis in rumen was higher for wilted than for direct-cut silage (32. 3 vs. 21. 4 g N/kg organic matter apparently digested in rumen).

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the influence of stage of growth at harvest on fermentative characteristics of Panicum maximum silage. The treatments were three different growth stages (early vegetative, boot and full bloom stage) that were ensiled directly or wilted prior to ensiling. Directly ensiled and wilted forage material were mixed prior to ensiling with molasses at 12 and 8 kg/ton dry matter, respectively. Thereafter, each treatment was ensiled in 12 one litre glass jars (bottles). From each treatment, samples of the silage were taken from three bottles at 0, 7, 21 and 120 d post-ensiling for analysis of fermentative characteristics. Growth stage in directly cut silage {{had no effect on}} silage pH between days 0 and 21. In contrast, within the wilted groups, a lower pH was observed at day 7 when the plants were harvested at the boot stage than at an early vegetative or full bloom stage. In both directly cut as well as prior <b>wilted</b> <b>silage,</b> a higher lactic acid concentration was recorded on day 7 in the boot stage silage compared to the full bloom stage silage, but on day 21 the boot stage had a lower lactic acid concentration than that of the full bloom stage silage. Growth stage had no effect on the acetic acid concentration on day 7. However, on days 21 and 120 the full bloom stage had a higher acetic acid concentration when the material was directly ensiled. In contrast, in prior <b>wilted</b> <b>silage</b> a higher acetic acid concentration was found in the early vegetative stage silage than in the full bloom stage silage at 120 days post-ensiling. Total nitrogen was lower in the full bloom stage silage than in the early vegetative and boot stage silages. A higher level of ammonia nitrogen was recorded at days 7 and 21 for the early vegetative stage silage as compared to the boot stage silage. A similar trend was revealed in the prior wilted groups between days 0 and 21. Harvesting at the boot growth stage consistently resulted in a good fermentation process with desirable fermentation end products (low pH and higher lactic acid concentration) up to a period of 21 days, but when compared at 120 days post-ensiling the differences between boot and bloom stages were not clearly observed in terms of fermentative attributes, probably due to the confounding effect of undesirable fermentation by entrobacteria or yeast.

Feeding FA-silage decreased diet organic matter digestibility, particularly that of neutral detergent fibre, compared with I-silage. Inclusion of FM increased the digestibility of all dietary constituents. Dry matter (DM) intake of I-silage was lower than that of FA-silage but milk yield was not significantly affected. Restricting silage fermentation increased milk fat content, fat yield and energy corrected milk yield. FM inclusion increased silage DM intake, milk yield, milk protein content and yield. FM 120 inclusion increased milk fat yield more with FA- silage than with I-silage, whereas the response in milk protein yield was greater with I-silage.

Various fiber components (ADF, NDF, lignin), and expressions computed from them, were used to estimate TDN and digestible energy of forages or groups of forages having homogenous relationships. Stepwise backward elimination procedure was employed to discard independent variables or their squared terms at 5 % probability to develop significant, biologically sound, practical predictive relationships. Standard NRC equations were used to extend energy densities to NEL. Free choice DM intake of forages (fed alone) was not closely related to NDF percentages.

Two experiments were conducted with wilted timothy-meadow fescue herbage (dry matter 429 and 344 g kg- 1) using six treatments. In experiment I, E 76 (106 cfu g- 1 fresh matter (FM)) was applied alone and in combination with sodium benzoate (0. 3 g kg- 1 grass FM) or low rate of formic acid (0. 4 l t- 1 FM). In experiment II, E 76 and a commercial inoculant were applied alone and in combination with sodium benzoate. Untreated silage and formic acid (4 l t- 1 FM) treated silage served as negative and positive controls in both experiments. The effect of sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate in experiment I, on aerobic stability was tested by treating silages prior to aerobic stability measurements. The novel lactic acid bacteria inoculant was equally effective in improving fermentation quality as the commercial inoculant. However, the aerobic stability of both inoculated silages was poorer than that of formic acid treated or the untreated one {{in one of the}} experiments.

Neither the concentration of fermentation products in the silages, i. e. their palatability, nor the rate and extent of ruminal digestion or the extent of particle-size reduction in the digestive tract could explain the increased dry-matter intake of <b>wilted</b> versus direct-cut <b>silage</b> (17. 7 % in heifers and 28. 4 % in lactating cows).

It was inferred that ruminating is firmly involved in augmenting functional density of feed particles in the reticulorumen by expelling pockets of air or fermentation gases. This permits sedimentation of the particles and their passage through the reticulo-omasal orifice. As daily chewing capacity of the animals is limited to around 950 min, the farmer can help more efficient eaters by facilitating dry-matter ingestion (wilting, chopping, etc.) and in this way, liberating more time and more jaw movements for ruminating.

Wilting of grass prior to ensiling increased the concentration of CLA in subcutaneous adipose tissue (P < 0 ? 001), while increasing FO supply linearly increased the concentration of cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA. From a human nutrition perspective, increasing the level of FO in the ration or wilting of grass prior to ensiling appear to modify the fatty acid composition of beef muscle favourably. However, the health implications of associated increases in trans fatty acids remain to be elucidated. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} several {{representatives of}} the most common types of Czech legumes and grasses, their ecological requirements and factors that affecting their cultivation. It assesses their benefits and suitability as individual components of clover-grass communities. It compares the cultivation methods and effectiveness for individual grass and clover-grass blends. It characterizes their feed value, assesses the factors affecting the quality of the resulting forages as well as the factors affecting the suitability of these forages for preservation as silage. The importance of conservation is to preserve quality feed throughout the year. Conservation provides stable ration for production dairy cow in all seasons. Ensiling affects the final quality and nutritional value of feed, which is also highly dependent on the proper technological process.

40|$|The {{effects of}} silage {{conservation}} method on silage composition and animal performance {{were examined in}} two experiments. In Experiment 1, unwilted, flail-chopped silages made with or without an additive (sodium nitrite and hexamethylene tetramine) were compared with <b>wilted,</b> round-bale <b>silage.</b> The dry matter (DM) concentration of round bale silage (460 g/kg) was {{higher than that of}} flail silage (214 g/kg) and this restricted fermentation and N solublisation. When fed to growing cattle, intake (P 0. 05). Steers fed round-bale silages had higher LW gain (1. 0 kg/day) than those fed flail (0. 7 kg/day) or precision-chopped silage (0. 8 kg/day; P< 0. 05). Efficiency of utilization of DM for LW gain was similar for all silages. Pre-slicing at baling had no effect on animal performance. It is concluded that the increased performance by cattle offered silages made by the wilted round-bale system was largely due to higher voluntary intake. peer-reviewedThis research was partially funded {{by a grant from the}} Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture and Marketing...|$|R

Part of the material was direct cut ensiled (26. 3 % DM) and part was wilted for 20 hours (44. 12 % DM). Both <b>silages,</b> either <b>wilted</b> or not, were assigned to four treatments: Control, Enzymes, Inoculate and Inoculate plus Enzymes and were ensiled in laboratory silos (3. 6 L), with four replicates, per treatment, per a period 60 days. <b>Wilting</b> provived <b>silages</b> of better quality with lower pH, higher lactic acid/acetic acid ratio, lower N-NH 3 and lower solubilization of the nitrogen fraction, with higher residual soluble carbohydrates content.

40|$|Field wilting {{and drying}} of hay is an {{important}} agricultural process upon which the quality of material subsequently conserved is dependent. The research described here aims at translating the biophysical processes that affect field drying of grass into parameters sets {{to be used for}} decision support systems that would aid effective management of field <b>wilting</b> for <b>silage</b> making. A mechanistic model of field drying of grass was implemented, largely based on Thompson's (1981) multi-layer canopy representation. Given the meteorological conditions at a 10 minutes interval, an iterative algorithm calculates the profile of evaporation within a drying swath. The time course of moisture content is calculated by integration. The model is shown to reproduce in detail changes of swath moisture content, including dew interception at night time. Three input parameters (i. e. swath resistance per unit tissue moisture content, minimum initial resistance and water content at stomatal closure) were adapted in order to simulate different conditioning treatments. Model predictions and measurements on reference plots were compared with experimental drying rates of perennial rye-grass (Lolium perenne), either lightly or heavily conditioned. The results make clear that coupling grass handling procedures to parameters of a mechanistic model of the drying process can provide tools for use in optimising such procedures...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} {{the efficiency of}} microbial protein synthesis (EMPS) in diets based on highly <b>wilted</b> grass <b>silage</b> (GS, 539 g dry matter (DM) per kg) with the supplementation of starch or water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) rich feeds, i. e. maize silage (MS, 391 g kg- 1 DM intake [DMI]), fodder beet (FB, 173 g kg- 1 DMI) or molasses (M, 137 g kg- 1 DMI). All the diets were made isonitrogenous by urea supplementation (14. 0, 4. 0 and 2. 0 g per kg DMI in GS-MS, GS-FB and GS-M diets). In sacco determined crude protein (CP) and organic matter (OM) degradabilities were 756, 800, 778 and 814 (P 0. 05) among the diets (36. 6, 35. 1, 34. 7 and 34. 0 g microbial nitrogen per kg OM apparently digested in the rumen in GS, GS-MS, GS-FB and GS-M diets, respectively). The estimated metabolizable protein supply from GS, GS-MS, GS-FB and GS-M diets amounted to 97, 91, 93 and 86 g kg- 1 DMI, respectively. Apparently, highly wilted GS containing {{a high concentration of}} WSC (91 g kg- 1 DM) supports high EMPS in the rumen and this cannot be improved by the supplementation with starch or WSC rich feeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{nutritive value}} of cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) green forage (GF), dry leaves (DL) and straw (S) was studied from {{chemical}} composition analyses and from voluntary intake, digestibility and rumen degradability estimations obtained using adult wethers. Aptitude For bring ensiled {{according to the}} wilting period was also evaluated making silages with fresh forage and after 24 and 94 hours of wilting. Green forage had a high nutritive value, as shown by low levels of fibre and lignin and its very high digestibility (86 % for OM). Nevertheless, its voluntary intake was relatively low (64 g DM. kg(- 1) LW 0. 75), although very variable among animals. Fermentation characteristics of the GF silages were good and <b>wilting</b> reduced <b>silage</b> losses andimproved the duality of silages. Nutritive value of DL was high, but limited only by a moderate crude protein content. Supplemented with urea, it hadan OM digestibility similar to a medium-good quality hay (65. 9 % average) and a voluntary intake equivalent to a good quality grass (75. 9 g DM. kg(- 1) LW 0. 75). Finally, S was a typical fibrous and low protein forage, but whensupplemented with urea, it had an intake and a digestibility {{higher than those of}} cereal straws. Variations in digestibility for OM and energy among the different non-preserved Cynara cardunculus forages showed close relationships with fibre fractions, especially with the acid detergent lignin content...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{replacing}} <b>wilted</b> grass <b>silage</b> (GS) with pea-barley intercrop silage (PBS) on feed intake, diet digestibility and milk production was studied with 8 multiparous Ayrshire-cows in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square experiment. Proportion of PBS was 0 (PBS 0), 33 (PBS 33), 67 (PBS 67) or 100 (PBS 100) % of silage dry matter (DM). The DM content was 559 and 255 g kg- 1 for GS and PBS. Crude protein content was 131 and 170 g kg- 1 DM, respectively. Pea-barley silage was more extensively fermented than GS with total fermentation acid content of 120 vs. 12 g kg- 1 DM. Silage was fed for ad libitum intake and supplemented {{with on the}} average 13 kg concentrate per day. Silage DM intake was 9. 2 (PBS 0), 9. 7 (PBS 33), 9. 0 (PBS 67) and 7. 1 (PBS 100) kg per day (Pquadr. < 0. 05). The energy corrected milk yield [30. 3 (PBS 0), 29. 8 (PBS 33), 30. 3 (PBS 67), 31. 3 (PBS 100) kg per day] was not significantly affected by the treatment. Milk protein concentration decreased linearly (P < 0. 05) in response to feeding PBS. It is concluded that PBS can replace up to two thirds of wilted, moderate quality GS in the feeding of dairy cows because in this experiment pure pea-barley silage reduced silage intake...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in 2013 / 2014 in order to evaluate the forage yield and the nutritional value of the fresh, hayed and ensiled common buckwheat. Two varieties were harvested at the Green and Brown achene stages. The silage was produced in experimental mini-silo. The need for wilting the forage (at 35 % dry matter) and for adding Lactobacillus plantarum as inoculum was evaluated. From Green to Brown achenes, the dry matter (DM) yield, the relative feed value (RFV) and the total digestible nutrient (TDN) increased (from 3 to 4 t ha- 1, from 136 to 152 and from 56 to 59 %, respectively) while the crude protein (CP) decreased from 14 to 10 %. Compared with the fresh forage, haymaking resulted in a marked decrease of CP, RFV and TDN, while ensiling did not change the CP and slightly decreased RFV and TDN. Forage <b>wilting</b> worsened the <b>silage</b> quality, while the inoculation improved it. Quali- and quantitative differences between varieties were detected...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{different}} technological influences of the production of corn silage and <b>silage</b> from <b>wilted</b> forage. Corn <b>silage</b> and also perennial forage crops are an important feed for livestock. During their production is important to follow all technological procedures starting from the selection of seed forage crops to quality covering the silo. Failure to observe technological processes leads to problems of poor fermentation process which results in poor feed, which immediately reflected on the animals and then the whole economic management of the farm. Different technological procedures were reviewed and one of the common mistakes is poor covering silage. Results have shown that imperfect covering silage leads to poor silage fermentation process which takes place only under anaerobic conditions. It later also affects the loss of solids in the feed which may cause up to 30 % of losses on the surface layer of silage...|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of baled silage on Irish farms frequently {{differs from that}} of comparable precision-chop silage. This paper concerns a field-scale study designed to investigate: (a) the effects of number of layers (2, 4, 6 or 8) of polyethylene stretch film and the duration of storage (7 vs. 18 months) on the conservation characteristics of baled silage, and (b) the conservation characteristics of baled (4 layers of stretch film) and precision-chop silages. All silages were made following three durations of wilting (0, 24 or 48 h). <b>Wilting</b> restricted <b>silage</b> fermentation, with silage pH being highest (P< 0. 001) and the concentration of fermentation products lowest (P< 0. 001) for the 48 h wilt treatment. Wrapping bales in only 2 layers of polyethylene stretch film resulted in extensive visible mould growth, but mould growth was practically eliminated by the application of 4 or more layers of film. Silage fermentation characteristics were generally improved by wilting, and by 4 compared to 2 layers of stretch film. Extending the storage duration of baled silage from 7 to 18 months reduced (P< 0. 001) the concentration of fermentation products and increased in-silo fresh weight losses (P< 0. 001) and visible mould growth. Whereas 4 layers of conventional stretch film are normally sufficient, 6 layers may be necessary to prevent mould growth when bales of unwilted silage are stored for a second season. Under good farm-management conditions differences observed between baled and precision-chop silages probably result mainly from differences in the concentration of dry matter in herbage at ensiling. peer-reviewe...|$|R
