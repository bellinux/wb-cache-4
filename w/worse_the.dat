5|$|Both Edmundston and Rimouski were {{fitted with}} about 60 light projectors: {{those on the}} hull were on {{retractable}} supports; those on the superstructure were on fixed supports. Each ship's diffused lighting system was tested systematically in St Margaret's Bay, and then trialled when actually escorting Atlantic convoys in 1943. Experimentally, the diffused lighting reduced the ships' visibility by up to 70%, but at sea the electrical equipment proved too delicate, and frequently malfunctioned. <b>Worse,</b> <b>the</b> system was slow to respond to changes in background lighting, and the Canadian Navy considered the lighting too green.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{pipeline}} caused a massive economic boom in towns up and down {{the pipeline}} route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the pipeline. By 1976, after the town's residents had endured a spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the <b>worse.</b> <b>The</b> boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E

The county noted that the towns' inability to pay for the road made the new road a financial burden for the county.

5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan.

Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Tara {{was one of}} {{the deadliest}} Pacific hurricanes on record. The final {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1961 Pacific hurricane season, Tara formed on November10 about 230mi (365km) off the coast of Mexico.

Hurricane Tara dissipated on November12, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to locations inundated by 10days of precipitation. Damage was light in the major port city of Acapulco, though further west along the coast, the effects of Tara were much <b>worse.</b> <b>The</b> city of Nuxco in Tecpán de Galeana municipality received the most damage and deaths from the hurricane.

5|$|In his five-volume {{analysis}} of the French Revolutionary Wars, Ramsay Weston Phipps speculated on why Moreau gained renown by the supposed skill of his retreat. Phipps suggested {{that it was not}} skillful for Moreau to allow the inferior columns of Latour, Nauendorf and Fröhlich to herd him back to France. Even during his advance Moreau was irresolute. Jean-de-Dieu Soult, who participated in the campaign as an infantry brigadier, noted that Jourdan made many errors but the French government's errors were <b>worse.</b> <b>The</b> French were unable to pay for supplies because their currency was worthless, so the soldiers stole everything. This ruined discipline and turned the local populations against the French. Jourdan seemed to have an unwarranted faith in Moreau's promise to follow Charles. His decision to give battle at Würzburg was partly done so as not to leave Moreau in the lurch.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{scientists}} at Los Alamos were eager {{to return to their}} laboratories and universities, and by February 1946 all of the wartime division heads had left, but a talented core remained. Darol Froman became head of Robert Bacher's G division, now renamed M Division. Eric Jette became responsible for Chemistry and Metallurgy, John H. Manley for Physics, George Placzek for Theory, Max Roy for Explosives, and Roger Wagner for Ordnance. The number of personnel at Los Alamos plummeted from its wartime peak of over 3,000 to around 1,000, but many were still living in temporary wartime accommodation. To make matters <b>worse,</b> <b>the</b> water pipe to Los Alamos froze and the water had to be supplied by tanker trucks. Despite the reduced staff, Bradbury still had to provide support for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear tests in the Pacific.|$|E

Moreno renamed Trujillo as Ascensión, and he sent messages to Hernández de Córdoba, who was in Nicaragua, asking him to renounce his loyalty to Pedrarias and pledge allegiance to Santo Domingo. Moreno then returned to Hispaniola, promising to send aid. As soon as he was gone, the residents restored the name of Trujillo, pledged their allegiance once more to Cortés, and expelled Juan Ruano.|$|E
5|$|Saw {{received}} mixed reviews. The Xbox 360 {{version of}} the game currently holds an average score of 59 percent on the game aggregator Metacritic, based on 35 reviews; the PlayStation 3 version has 59 percent from 36 reviews.

The PC version holds a lower score of 44.33 percent, based solely on three reviews. Although the game was nearly universally praised for the storyline and the two endings the game presented and critics consistently mentioned the immersive atmosphere and environment as being true to the Saw series, the quality level of puzzles were mixed, depending on the reviewer.

5|$|The {{choice of}} date proved unfortunate for several reasons. It clashed {{with a public}} holiday, and many people had left {{the city for the}} country.

Thus on its opening night the opera, in its two-act version with spoken dialogue, was poorly attended and indifferently received. Receipts failed to cover costs, and the theatre director was forced to pay Smetana's fee from his own pocket.|$|E

In October the 29th and 46th Battalions were also amalgamated, leaving the division with just six infantry battalions in two brigades.|$|E

5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, the reform {{did not try to}} change the existing system radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why the reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive answers. The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on the combination of the recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling the pricing system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters <b>worse,</b> <b>the</b> reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E

5|$|At de Launay's request, an {{additional}} force of 32 {{soldiers from the}} Swiss Salis-Samade regiment {{had been assigned to}} the Bastille on 7 July, adding to the existing 82 invalides pensioners who formed the regular garrison. De Launay had taken various precautions, raising the drawbridge in the Comté tower and destroying the stone abutment that linked the Bastille to its bastion to prevent anyone from gaining access from that side of the fortress. The shops in the entranceway to the Bastille had been closed and the gates locked. The Bastille was defended by 30 small artillery pieces, but nonetheless, by 14 July de Launay was very concerned about the Bastille's situation. The Bastille, already hugely unpopular with the revolutionary crowds, was now the only remaining royalist stronghold in central Paris, in addition to which he was protecting a recently arrived stock of 250 barrels of valuable gunpowder. To make matters <b>worse,</b> <b>the</b> Bastille had only two days' supply of food and no source of water, making it impossible to withstand a long siege.|$|E
5|$|By 1838 it {{had become}} clear that {{construction}} costs for the town were spiralling out of control. To make matters <b>worse,</b> <b>the</b> railway's engineer informed Hesketh-Fleetwood {{that the cost of}} the railway was expected to exceed £300,000. The company had also sold far fewer shares than had been hoped. Frederick Kemp was collecting rents and rates from tenants, and Hesketh-Fleetwood repeatedly asked him for money to pay some of the mounting bills. Kemp, a more forceful character than his employer, kept claiming that there was no money. Hesketh-Fleetwood turned to his brother Charles and asked him to get £4,000 out of Kemp. Charles was more assertive, but Kemp said that the money had been spent on workers' wages and produced yet more invoices that needed to be paid. During Hesketh-Fleetwood's many absences from the Fylde, Kemp managed to involve himself in a number of enterprises in the town, to his own financial advantage. The railway was taking longer than expected and, with mounting debts, Hesketh-Fleetwood grew increasingly depressed and began to withdraw from society.|$|E
5|$|During his convalescence, he {{was visited}} by the General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters), Generalleutnant Adolf Galland, who offered Graf command {{of his old}} unit, JG52. Graf {{accepted}} {{with the proviso that}} his Roten Jäger football team went with him. Once criticized for its low scoring rate early in the war, it was now the pre-eminent Geschwader, with over 10,000 victories. His return was celebrated with a welcome dinner at its headquarters in Kraków, southern Poland, on 20 September 1944. He was officially appointed on 1 October. Ongoing weakness in his left arm kept Graf on the ground. In the two years since he had left the Eastern Front, {{the quantity and quality of}} the Soviet pilots had greatly improved, as had their equipment. For the remainder of the war he oversaw his three separated fighter groups shuttled up and down the front, in emergency responses to each new Soviet offensive. Several times the crews had to evacuate as Soviet tanks and artillery were shelling their airfield. The German fuel crisis severely curtailed the amount of flight-time. Consequently, the November total for the wing of only 369 Soviet aircraft shot down was the lowest monthly total of the eastern campaign. As the winter weather got <b>worse,</b> <b>the</b> lull allowed Graf to organise a football match between his Roten Jäger and a local Kraków team, watched by 20,000 German soldiers.|$|E
