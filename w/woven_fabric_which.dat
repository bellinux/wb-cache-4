RWB stands for red-white-blue, which is a traditional plastic bag commonly used in Hong Kong in the 1960s and 1970s. ‘330’ {{is similar to the}} phonetic sound of “body, mind and spirit” in Cantonese. (Chinese: 身、心、靈). It cooperates New Life Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association.

30|$|Instead of coating fabrics, {{carbon fibers}} {{are used to}} make a <b>woven</b> <b>fabric,</b> <b>which</b> can be applied to {{flexible}} textile electrodes [45]. To maximize the surface area, vertically-aligned CNTs are additionally synthesized on the carbon fabric. Electroplating vertical CNTs with RuO 2 NPs further increases the capacitance (Fig.  7 f), and an all-solid-state wearable SC is fabricated by sandwiching a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-H 3 PO 4 gel electrolyte between two modified carbon fabric electrodes (Fig.  7 g). The resulting SC exhibits high performance up to 135 -degree bending and 4000 charge–discharge cycles (Fig.  7 h–j).|$|E

Each layer was cured below 130 °C to ensure no thermal damage to the fabric. Each display pixel, consisting of the colour changing and counter electrodes, was separately driven at two voltage direct currents (VDCs). The colour change between pale blue and dark blue was controlled by switching the polarity using a microcontroller.

40|$|In recent years, {{safety systems}} such as seat belts and airbags {{have been one of}} the fast-growing sectors within the {{automotive}} industry. Seat belts and airbags have made driving substantially safer since their introduction. Airbags are safety systems used to cushion the driver or passenger during a collision and reduce bodily injuries. The technology involved in the manufacturing and working of airbags is complex. Since the early stages of development, airbag technology has been undergoing continual evolution in terms of design, materials and performance. Airbags are typically made from <b>woven</b> <b>fabric,</b> <b>which</b> may be coated or uncoated but must be impermeable to gases and flame resistant. In terms of their operation, modern airbags are smart restraint systems, which can tailor the deployment of the airbag according to the crash severity, body size of the occupant and proximity of the occupant to the airbag system prior to deployment. The future of airbags is extremely promising because there are many diverse applications ranging from motorcycle helmets to aircraft seating. In this article, an outline is given of the historical development of airbags and their value in saving lives is illustrated by supporting statistical data. The essential parameters required for airbag yarn and fabric components are discussed in detail. In addition, the processes involved in the manufacture, assembly and testing of airbag systems are explained. The mechanisms and chemical reactions involved in the deployment of different types of airbags are also discussed, and recent developments in airbag design and their possible future applications are reported...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Fourier {{spectrum}} {{has been}} a widely accepted approach by many researchers working {{in the area of}} analysis of fabric patterns and faults in the fabric. Due to more energy content in the Fourier power spectrum (FPS) as compared to Fourier spectrum (FS), the authors were motivated to use FPS to determine the periodicity of the <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>which</b> has regular repeating units. The DC suppressed FPS sum was studied on simulated as well as real fabric patterns. The simulated fabric patterns studied have horizontal and vertical stripes, diagonal pattern, checks, plain and twill weave patterns which repeat regularly. These patterns are obtained either by using a program developed by us or by a commercially available Texcard software or from NET. The comparative study of FS, DC suppressed FPS without and with zero padding was carried out on simulated as well as real fabric patterns. The marginals obtained from DC suppressed FPS have shown the superiority in identifying the periodicity over the method using only FPS. Further observation on the first and second significant peaks of DC suppressed FPS sum plot in frequency domain along u and v direction have been found to act as very good measure of the periodicity or repeat unit (RU) and thread count in warp and weft direction of the pattern image. The accuracy of thread count is more than 99 % respectively in both warp direction weft direction. It was also observed that the nature of power spectral view pattern identifies the fabric pattern. The details of the experimentation and the results thereof are presented in this paper...|$|E

The <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> with curved surfaces {{is a kind}} of single layer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics,</b> <b>which</b> was produced to smoothly fit three-dimensional solids. The warp or weft of the winding fabric bend were normally made with different lengths, which may result in shear deformation in many cases and accordingly twisting the structure of the fabric after fitted onto the solid. In order to solve the problem mentioned above, a theoretical formula was used to calculate the optimal intervals of the pick-spacing and an improved structure thus was developed in this study...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{performed}} analyses of knitted fabric integrating conductive yarn in textile-based electronic circuits, {{some of which}} established simulative models such as the resistive network model for knitting stitches. Compared to conductive knitted fabrics, limited studies have been presented regarding the resistive theoretical model of conductive <b>woven</b> <b>fabric.</b> In this paper, a simulation model was derived to compute the resistance of conductive <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> {{in terms of the}} following fabric parameters: structure, density and conductive yarn arrangement.

Based on this model, thermal conductive <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> with maximum energy management and cost control can be efficiently designed. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|The weavability {{limit and}} {{tightness}} for 2 D and 3 D <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{is an important}} factor and depends on many geometric parameters. Based on a comprehensive review of the literature on textile fabric construction and property, and related research on fabric geometry, a study of the weavability limit and tightness relationships of 2 D and 3 D <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> was undertaken. Experiments were conducted on a representative number of polyester and cotton <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> <b>which</b> have been <b>woven</b> in our workshop, using three machines endowed with different insertion systems (rapier, projectiles and air jet). Afterwards, these <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> have been analyzed in the laboratory to determine their physical and mechanical characteristics using air permeability-meter and KES-F KAWABATA Evaluation System for Fabrics. In this study, the current Booten’s weavability limit and tightness relationships based on Ashenhurst’s, Peirce’s, Love’s, Russell’s, Galuszynskl’s theory and maximum-weavability is reviewed and modified as new relationships to expand their use to general cases (2 D and 3 D <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics,</b> all fiber materiel, all yarns etc…). The theoretical relationships were examined and found to agree with experimental results. It was concluded that the weavability limit and tightness relationships are useful tools for weavers in predicting whether a proposed fabric construction was weavable and also in predicting and explaining their physical and mechanical properties...|$|R
