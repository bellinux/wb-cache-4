50|$|Detainer (from detain, Latin detinere); {{originally}} in British law, the act {{of keeping}} a person against his will, or the wrongful keeping of a person's goods, or other real or personal property. A <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>detainer</b> was a form {{for the beginning of}} a personal action against a person already lodged within the walls of a prison; it was superseded by the Judgments Act 1838.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, a {{detainer}} in {{the context}} of criminal law is a request filed by a criminal justice agency with the institution in which a prisoner is incarcerated, asking the institution either to hold the prisoner for the agency or to notify the agency when release of the prisoner is imminent. [...] The Supreme Court of the United States has held that the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act allows for a trial of any untried indictment, information, or complaint within 180 days. [...] However, the prisoner needs to enter a request for final disposition to begin the clock. [...] The U.S. Marshals are given the power to issue <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>detainers</b> in 28 U.S.C. 566(c), which is how the federal government interacts with the states to retrieve someone in state prison.|$|R
6000|$|One {{reason for}} this insincere quality {{may have been the}} fact that the very {{foundations}} of our neighborhood were artificial. Laura Matilda Street was [...] "made ground." [...] The land, not yet quite reclaimed, was continually struggling with its old enemy. We had not been long in our new home before we found an older tenant, not yet wholly divested of his rights, who sometimes showed himself in clammy perspiration on the basement walls, whose damp breath chilled our dining-room, and in the night struck a mortal chilliness through the house. There were no patent fastenings that could keep him out,--no <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> unlawful <b>detainer</b> that could eject him. In the winter his presence was quite palpable; he sapped the roots of the trees, he gurgled under the kitchen floor, he wrought an unwholesome greenness {{on the side of the}} veranda. In summer he became invisible, but still exercised a familiar influence over the locality. He planted little stitches in the small of the back, sought out old aches and weak joints, and sportively punched the tenants of the Swiss Cottage under the ribs. He inveigled little children to play with him, but his plays generally ended in scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping-cough, and measles. He sometimes followed strong men about until they sickened suddenly and took to their beds. But he kept the green-plants in good order, and was very fond of verdure, bestowing it even upon lath and plaster and soulless stone. He was generally invisible, as I have said; but some time after I had moved, I saw him one morning from the hill stretching his gray wings over the valley, like some fabulous vampire, who had spent the night sucking the wholesome juices of the sleepers below, and was sluggish from the effects of his repast. It was then that I recognized him as Malaria, and knew his abode to be the dread Valley of the shadow of Miasma,--miscalled the Happy Valley! ...|$|R

25|$|The {{first known}} use <b>of</b> the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis {{in a court}} of law {{occurred}} in England during the 1500s. The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis was identical in nature to a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> a similar name: the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram vobis. <b>Writs</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis were issued by the court of King's (or Queen’s) Bench while <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> coram vobis were issued by the court of Common Pleas.

50|$|The ancient <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis {{originated}} in the English judicial system during the sixteenth century.

The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis was identical to the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus; except, the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus was reserved exclusively for those who were held in prisons, and the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis was available to everyone else.|$|R

[...] Generally, anyone attacking their conviction must either file a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus {{if they are}} currently in-custody from a federal sentence or file a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis if {{they are no longer}} in-custody.

50|$|Obviously, a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> {{habeas corpus}} is a writ issued {{by a court}} and has binding effect. The right to request a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus origins from the {{principle}} of presumption <b>of</b> innocence. The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus is to protect individual freedom from arbitrary detention or arrest. The High Court Ordinance, Section 22(A), gives clear guidance on the application for and issue <b>of</b> <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus:One particular point is worth a mention in which {{the law does not}} limit on that only the accused has the right to request a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus but some other people can do it for the accused.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis (also {{known as}} <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> error coram nobis, <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram vobis, or <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> error coram vobis) {{is the name}} of a legal order {{allowing}} a court to correct its original judgment upon discovery of a fundamental error which did not appear in the records of the original judgement’s proceedings and would have prevented the judgment from being pronounced. [...] The term “coram nobis” is Latin for “before us” and the meaning of its full name, quae coram nobis resident, is “which [...] remain in our presence”. [...] The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis originated in the English court of common law in the English legal system during the sixteenth century.|$|R
50|$|A more usual {{remedy is}} not available. A federal {{prisoner}} in custody can only appeal his conviction or sentence through a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus.

A prejudgment <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> attachment may be used to freeze assets of a defendant while a legal action is pending.

By invoking the truth, the new remedy will not only compel military and government agents to release information about the desaparecidos but require access to military and police files. Reynato Puno announced earlier on the draft <b>of</b> the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> amparo - the Spanish for protection—which will prevent military officials in judicial proceedings to simply issue denials on cases of disappearances or extrajudicial executions.

[...] A petition for <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis is untimely unless filed within one year of the time a judgment becomes final in the trial court. [...] It is clear that a timely petition for <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis will almost always be filed while an appeal is pending. Pendency of the appeal does not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to consider the petition for <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis since a suit for <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis is a new action. [...] On the same day that a petition for <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis is filed in the trial court, the petitioner should also file in the appellate court a motion requesting that the appellate proceedings be stayed pending the trial court's decision on the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis.
