After an earthquake and witnessing a nearby mountain begin to smoulder, he realises he has in fact materialised in Pompeii one day before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. When he and Donna return to where the TARDIS landed, he discovers that a local merchant sold it to sculptor Lobus Caecilius. The Doctor and Donna go to Caecilius's house to retrieve it. Unknown to them, they have been followed by a soothsayer who reports to the Sibylline Sisterhood that the prophesised man in the blue box has arrived, and the Sisters fear the prediction that his arrival brings fire and death.|$|E

You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E

500|$|Psychiatric {{examinations}} {{and psychological}} tests conducted on Lamb at Kingston revealed an extremely immature {{young man who}} was strongly drawn to weapons. The prison doctors noted that the boy was very aggressive, did not tolerate discipline and had very little control over his behaviour. Soon after he arrived, Lamb assaulted another prisoner and had to be put into solitary confinement. The prison's director of psychiatry, George Scott, said that the boy had shown signs of [...] "an obvious mental breakdown". Not long after this, Lamb knelt beside his bed and pushed a broom handle into his rectum. When he was discovered in this state by a guard, Scott examined the boy immediately, having to sedate him to do so. [...] "I think this young man is developing a mental illness of hypomanic nature," [...] he wrote in his report. In further interviews conducted by Scott, Lamb related <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> described as [...] "elaborate fantasies involving robberies, fights, and shootings that demonstrated enormous hostility".|$|E

The Doctor identifies the beast as being from a species that is distantly related to the Nimon, previously a foe in the serial The Horns of Nimon; and the group witnesses two illusions of Weeping Angels, from the episodes [...] "Blink", [...] "The Time of Angels"/"Flesh and Stone". Though the audience is not shown {{the contents of the}} room (numbered 11) that the Doctor is lured to open, the sound of the TARDIS' cloister bell can be heard. [...] Young Amelia is shown waiting for her [...] "raggedy Doctor" [...] to return from the episode [...] "The Eleventh Hour."

Ian Hyland of the Sunday Mirror also disliked Adam's introduction, describing [...] "the introduction of a puppy-love sequence between Rose and a cute English boy" [...] as [...] "very, very irritating". SFX Magazine commented on the similarity between Adam's introduction to the future and that of Rose in [...] "The End of the World" [...] stating [...] "it was clearly a deliberate parallel on Russell's part, as part of his scheme to contrast and compare the reactions of Rose and Adam". Their website reviewer observed that Adam's [...] "comedy faint" [...] marked him out as an unsuitable traveller. Marc Edward DiPaulo of the University of Oklahoma notes that Adam's role in [...] "The Long Game" [...] is to provide satire on the media and to function as [...] "a condemnation of those who cannot stop immersing themselves in television, the Internet, iPods, and other nonstop broadcasters of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> calls [...] "useless information."" [...] Fraser McAlpine, reviewing Adam's appearances as companion for BBC America's Anglophenia blog describes him as a [...] "craven meddler" [...] and a [...] "social climber". By virtue of his failures, Adam becomes [...] "the companion that proves the worth of all of the other companions".|$|E

At the reception, River leaves her blank diary for Amy which prompts Amy to recall the Doctor and something he told {{her when she was}} seven during his rewind. She interrupts her father's speech, imploring the [...] "Raggedy" [...] Doctor from her memories to come back. As she recites the old wedding proverb ("something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue"), relating that to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> had said about the TARDIS, the TARDIS and the Doctor appear. The Doctor comes out of the TARDIS and after a brief conversation with Amy, introduces himself by saying [...] "Hello everyone! I'm Amy's imaginary friend, but I came anyway!" [...] and joins the wedding festivities. Afterwards, he returns River's diary and the vortex manipulator to her so she can return to her own time. She sadly tells him he will soon learn who she truly is and that it will change everything. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor explains to Amy and Rory that unanswered questions remain about the destruction of the TARDIS and the nature of [...] "the silence" [...] that will fall. The Doctor receives a telephone call alerting him to the presence of [...] "an escaped Egyptian goddess on the Orient Express, in space". He tells them that this will have to be goodbye. They agree that it is goodbye and Amy leans out of the TARDIS and yells [...] "Goodbye!". The three then leave on their next adventure.|$|E

2500|$|Akingbola has {{received}} a positive response from Holby City viewers regarding his character.

People of my parents' age tell me they're loving Malick – the older Nigerian guys love how he bosses people around! I’ve also had younger viewers tell me that they're glad they have a character they can relate to." [...] Critical response has also been generally positive. Malick's introductory episode was selected as recommended viewing by the Sunday Mercury. Inside Soap Katy Moon described him as having made a [...] "big impact from day one", with the observation: [...] "His arrogance, combined with his boundless determination {{to do the right thing}} by his patients, means that no one could have missed his arrival on the wards – be it the medics in the show or Holby viewers." [...] Simon of the Daily Mirror quipped that Malick was [...] "just <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> ordered" [...] to counterbalance the programme's weaker males.

Michael Hogan of The Telegraph felt that Capaldi's portrayal [...] "crackled with fierce intelligence and nervous energy". Capaldi's performance in [...] "Listen" [...] was praised with Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club stating [...] "Capaldi turns in a suitably fearless performance, reaching his obsessive crescendo {{as he prepares to}} meet whatever is waiting for him {{at the end of the}} universe". His acting in [...] "The Caretaker" [...] was praised with Ceri Radford of The Telegraph noting [...] "Capaldi's ability to mould the character of the Doctor into his own unique intergalactic curmudgeon", alongside Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy noting [...] "Capaldi's is the most complex and variable take on the Time Lord we've seen since Eccleston". Tom Baker praised his character [...] "instantly one felt: this fellow comes from far far away, he's strange. An instant frisson. And what's the word? Yes, got it! Alien, he's an alien. I salute him". Professor Brian Cox noted [...] "he's complex, menacing and vulnerable. Exactly <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> should be". Musician Marc Almond stated [...] "Peter Capaldi brings back a touch of darkness and ageless mystery to the Doctor that I feel had been missing, as well as a dash of menace and mischief. He has some of the abrasiveness of William Hartnell, the stylishness of Jon Pertwee and the eccentricity of Tom Baker – all my favourite Doctors". Alison Graham of Radio Times stated [...] "Peter Capaldi is the Victor Meldrew Doctor Who; he's abrasive, acerbic and has no truck with modern life". Upon interviewing Capaldi just weeks before his first episode, he quoted he was [...] "a more grown-up Doctor" [...] albeit one who is still [...] "mirthful. He's serious when he needs to be, but he's still quite comic". Patrick Mulkern added [...] "Peter Capaldi simply is the Doctor; the most persuasive since Tom Baker" [...] and described him as [...] "the Scotch-on-the-rocks Doctor – distilled, chilly, stinging on the palate but warming on the way down".|$|E
