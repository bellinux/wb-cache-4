5|$|The {{kitchen garden}} {{provides}} produce for the property's restaurant {{located in the}} adjacent Strode House; this includes many types of fruit and vegetables. The local St Mary & St Peter's CE VC Primary School, which has bases at Barrington and Ilton, has a vegetable plot <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> plant, tend and cook the produce; the walls are also strewn with apple, pear and plum trees. Attached to the garden is a squash court.|$|E
5|$|We give an acre for a cow or sheep willingly, {{while we}} shut our {{children}} and our chickens up in too limited spaces, and they suffer in consequence. Schools of the future must be provided with estates <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> will be surrounded with many natural and beautiful things. Part of the practical work was growing food for the school. In 1944 the daily two-course dinner, for staff and over 90 students, was mostly the school's farm's produce. After the war, from c.1948–55, the school received child migrants from Belgium, Greece and the United Kingdom. The school was known as Hagley State School until 1936, Hagley Farm School until 1976 and Hagley Farm Primary School since.|$|E
5|$|Black {{believes}} Prine is not {{driven by}} malice; he and Watts use {{the resources of}} the Millennium Group to find his home, discovering the dense writings across his floors. They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent, and took the children as he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time, wishing to protect this child when he learns which one it is destined to be. Black seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is able to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight. However, the advancing tornado forces them to take cover; it kills Prine and lifts the roof from the entombing bunker. It subsides as quickly as it arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. It turns out that the tornado destroyed the school <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> would have been if they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E

5|$|Leslie Richard Groves Jr. {{was born}} in Albany, New York, on 17 August 1896, the third son of four {{children}} of a pastor, Leslie Richard Groves Sr., and his wife Gwen née Griffith. A descendant of French Huguenots who came to America in the 17th century, Leslie Groves Sr. resigned as pastor of the Sixth Presbyterian church in Albany in December 1896 to become a United States Army chaplain. He was posted to the 14th Infantry at Vancouver Barracks in Washington in 1897. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish–American War in 1898, Chaplain Groves was sent to Cuba with the 8th Infantry. On returning to Vancouver Barracks, he was ordered to rejoin the 14th Infantry in the Philippines; service in the Philippine–American War and the Boxer Rebellion followed. The 14th Infantry returned to the United States in 1901 and moved to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The family relocated to there from Vancouver, then moved to Fort Hancock, New Jersey, the next year, and returned to Vancouver in 1905. Chaplain Groves was hospitalized with tuberculosis at Fort Bayard in 1905. He decided to settle in southern California and bought a house in Altadena. His next posting was to Fort Apache, Arizona. The family spent their summers there and returned to Altadena <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> attended school.|$|E
25|$|To {{solve these}} issues the founders created the {{communal}} children's houses, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> would {{spend most of}} their time; learning, playing and sleeping. Parents spent 3 to 4 hours a day in the afternoon with their children after work and before dinner.|$|E
25|$|<b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> {{were from}} Catholic families, the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland insisted on supervising their care and {{upbringing}} by running {{most of these}} institutions in Ireland. A handful of Irish Catholic authors such as Michael McCarthy and Frank Hugh O'Donnell criticised the Church's un-audited state funding, and the state's inadequate supervision in 1900-1910. They were generally ignored by the growing Nationalist movement that had firm support from the Church, and also by the British administration based in Dublin Castle.|$|E

25|$|Smith {{was born}} in Scotland, Maryland, in Saint Mary's County, the sixth of 17 {{children}} born to sharecroppers Guffrie and Parthenia Smith. His large family accounts for his unusual nickname. Of all the Smith children, Tubby was most fond of staying in the galvanized washtub <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were bathed. Smith says he tried to shake the moniker several times, but it stuck incessantly. He recalls that a 10th grade teacher who didn't tolerate nicknames {{was the last person}} to call him by his proper name, Orlando.|$|E

In early January 1334, the Arakanese raided Thayet, and sent the entire family of the governor to Launggyet on 7 January 1334. The family was treated well at the Arakanese court <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were educated by one of the most learned Arakanese monks of the day. Becoming a scholar in his own right, the young prince conducted himself well, and became popular in court circles and also with common people.|$|E

25|$|Although Leopold {{is portrayed}} (notably by Halliwell 1998) as {{generally}} quite worried about money, the Mozart family by 1773 evidently felt prosperous enough {{to upgrade their}} living quarters. They left the home in the Getreidegasse <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> had been born and moved to rooms in the Tanzmeisterhaus ("Dancing-Master's House"), which had been {{the home of the}} recently deceased dancing master Franz Karl Gottlieb Speckner. As tenants of Speckner's cousin and heir Maria Anna Raab, the Mozarts had eight rooms, including the quite large room that Speckner had used for dancing lessons. This the Mozarts used for teaching, for domestic concerts, for storing keyboard instruments sold by Leopold, and for Bölzlschiessen, a form of recreation in which family and their guests shot airguns at humorously designed paper targets.|$|E
25|$|Mann {{is perhaps}} best known for Immediate Family, her third collection, first {{exhibited}} in 1990 by Edwynn Houk Gallery in Chicago and published as a monograph in 1992. The New York Times said, “Probably no photographer in history has enjoyed such a burst of success in the art world.” The book consists of 65 black-and-white photographs of her three children, all under the age of 10. Many of the pictures were taken at the family's remote summer cabin along the river, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> played and swam in the nude. Many explore typical childhood themes (skinny dipping, reading the funnies, dressing up, vamping, napping, playing board games) but others touch on darker themes such as insecurity, loneliness, injury, sexuality and death. The controversy on its release was intense, including accusations of child pornography (both in America and abroad) and of contrived fiction with constructed tableaux.|$|E
25|$|City directories, Sanborn maps, {{abstract}} {{records and}} other historical sources help {{to paint a}} picture of the neighborhood. Within its boundaries, one finds a plentiful offering of largely unaltered working class cottages accompanied by a still robust commercial strip along West Markham as well as a bustling elementary school and the landmark Lamar Porter Field made famous by the local hero Brooks Robinson who grew up playing in its outfield. Even the Billy Mitchell Boys and Girls Club with its playground and open spaces serves as a reminder of fields and woods <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> of Stifft Station Historic District played as their neighborhood grew from a sprinkling of scattered houses {{in the first years of}} the twentieth century to the fully realized and largely stable neighborhood it remains today. Stifft Station Historic District is a credit to its humble but handsome housing stock, reasonable real estate prices, minimal intrusive or unsightly infill and, significantly, its residents willingness to acknowledge the importance of an active neighborhood association.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, in 1996, member {{countries}} of the European Union, per Directive 94/33/EC, agreed {{to a number of}} exceptions for young people in its child labour laws. Under these rules, children of various ages may work in cultural, artistic, sporting or advertising activities if authorised by the competent authority. Children above the age of 13 may perform light work for a limited number of hours per week in other economic activities as defined at the discretion of each country. Additionally, the European law exception allows children aged 14 years or over to work as part of a work/training scheme. The EU Directive clarified that these exceptions do not allow child labour <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> may experience harmful exposure to dangerous substances. Nonetheless, many {{children under the age of}} 13 do work, even in the most developed {{countries of the}} EU. For instance, a recent study showed over a third of Dutch twelve-year-old kids had a job, the most common being babysitting.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 {{the line}} was {{featured}} in the British drama film The Railway Children. The line {{was one of only}} a few heritage railways in the UK and was the only one at the time which had a tunnel (this {{was one of the most}} important locations needed for the film). The tunnel used is a lot shorter in reality than it appears in the film, for which a temporary extension to the tunnel was made using canvas covers. Locomotives that were chosen for the film included a Hudswell Clarke 0-6-0T no 31 Hamburg, GWR 5700 0-6-0PT no 5775, Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway 0-6-0 no 957 & GNR N2 0-6-2T no 1744. Railway locations used in the film included Mytholmes Tunnel near Haworth, the location for the paper chase scene was also shot at Mytholmes, as well as the one in which the children wave the girls' petticoats in the air to warn the train about a landslide. The landslide sequence itself was filmed in a cutting on the Oakworth side of Mytholmes Tunnel and the fields of long grass <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> waved to the trains are situated on the Haworth side of the tunnel.|$|E
500|$|Mike Scully {{wanted to}} do an episode <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> of Springfield {{would be subject to}} a curfew.

The name of the baseball announcer, Denis Conroy, was used because that is the name of writer Larry Doyle's uncle. Dan Castellaneta ad libbed Homer singing [...] "Hitler is a jerk, Mussolini...." [...] It was added in to the episode only for the purpose of filling time. The Chief Wiggum billboard sketch was inspired by Beaver Cleaver getting stuck in a soup bowl billboard during the [...] "In the Soup" [...] episode of Leave It to Beaver.

Keynes would receive considerable support from his father, including expert coaching to help him pass his scholarship exams and financial help both as a young man and when his assets were nearly wiped out at the onset of Great Depression in 1929.
