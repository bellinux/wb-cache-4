5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find many <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E
5|$|Under Weinberg's {{tenure as}} director, ORNL's Biology Division grew {{to five times}} the size of the next largest {{division}}. This division was charged with understanding how ionizing radiation interacts with living things and to try to find <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them survive radiation damage, such as bone marrow transplants. In the 1960s Weinberg also pursued new missions for ORNL, such as using nuclear energy to desalinate seawater. He recruited Philip Hammond from the Los Alamos National Laboratory to further this mission and in 1970 started the first big ecology project in the United States: the National Science Foundation— Research Applied to National Needs Environmental Program.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways used to treat loneliness, social isolation, and clinical depression. The first step that most doctors recommend to patients is therapy. Therapy is a common and effective way of treating loneliness and is often successful. Short term therapy, {{the most common form}} for lonely or depressed patients, typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During therapy, emphasis is put on understanding the cause of the problem, reversing the negative thoughts, feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the patient feel connected. Some doctors also recommend group therapy as a means to connect with other sufferers and establish a support system. Doctors also frequently prescribe anti-depressants to patients as a stand-alone treatment, or in conjunction with therapy. It may take several attempts before a suitable anti-depressant medication is found. Some patients may also develop a resistance to a certain type of medication and need to switch periodically.|$|E

Ingeborg Fischer-Thein, chairman of the International Association of Wagner Societies, where Rodolfo was a member, sent a letter to Germany's and the International Music Council saying the community was looking for <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> in the case. Fundraisers were carried out in music events and at the apartment complex where Rodolfo and Barbier lived in Bremerhaven. The city's mayor , along with local leader , showed their interest in the case and contacted the Embassy of Mexico in Berlin on December 6, 2011. The Cázares also got in contact with Germany's Minister for Foreign Affairs and with Bernd Neumann, who was the Representative of the Federal Government for Culture; with the Embassy of Mexico in Berlin and with more municipal authorities in Bremerhaven. The Media and Public Relations Department of the Embassy of Germany in Mexico City stated that they were sadden by the kidnapping but the case was out of their jurisdiction because Rodolfo was not a German citizen.|$|E

25|$|Information {{security}} threats come {{in many different}} forms. Some {{of the most common}} threats today are software attacks, theft of intellectual property, identity theft, theft of equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion. Most people have experienced software attacks of some sort. Viruses, worms, phishing attacks, and Trojan horses are a few common examples of software attacks. The theft of intellectual property has also been an extensive issue for many businesses in the IT field. Identity theft is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that person's personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information. Theft of equipment or information is becoming more prevalent today {{due to the fact that}} most devices today are mobile. Cell phones are prone to theft and have also become far more desirable as the amount of data capacity increases. Sabotage usually consists of the destruction of an organization′s website in an attempt to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers. Information extortion consists of theft of a company′s property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the information or property back to its owner, as with ransomware. There are many <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> protect yourself from some of these attacks but one of the most functional precautions is user carefulness.|$|E

She described Cho's behavior as [...] "arrogant" [...] and [...] "obnoxious" [...] at times, and that she tried several different <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him. Roy declined to comment on Cho's writings, saying only in general that they [...] "seemed very angry." [...] She added that Cho, when called on in class, would take 20 seconds to answer questions, and whispered his response. He also took cell phone pictures of her in class. After Roy became concerned with Cho's behavior and the themes in his writings, she started meeting with Cho to work with him one-on-one. However, she soon became concerned for her safety, and told her assistant that she would use the name of a dead professor as a duress code, in order to alert the assistant to call security. After Roy notified authorities of Cho's behavior, she urged Cho to seek counseling, but to her knowledge, Cho never followed through with the request, in spite of his insistence to the contrary.|$|E
