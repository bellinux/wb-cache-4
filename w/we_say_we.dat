2500|$|At {{the end of}} any {{financial}} period (say {{at the end of}} the quarter or the year), the total debits and the total credits for each account may be different and this difference of the two sides is called the balance. If the sum of the debit side is greater than the sum of the credit side, then the account has a [...] "debit balance". [...] If the sum of the credit side is greater, then the account has a [...] "credit balance".

2500|$|Catholic {{teaching}} describes {{truth as}} uprightness in human action and speech {{and is the}} virtue which consists of showing oneself true in deeds and truthful in words, and in guarding against duplicity, dissimulation, and hypocrisy. [...] The person of truth gives another his just due. Truthfulness balances {{what ought to be}} expressed and what ought to be kept secret: it entails both honesty and discretion. In justice, one man owes it to another to manifest the truth. The disciple of Christ consents to [...] "live in the truth," [...] that is, in the simplicity of a life in conformity with the Lord's example, abiding in his truth. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not live according to the truth."(1 John 1:6) ...|$|E

2500|$|These {{practices}} increased after U.S. troops left Iraq. When {{the government}} announced an arrest warrant against former deputy prime minister Tariq al-Hashimi, who had fled to the Kurdish-controlled regions of the country, it broadcast the confessions of three of his bodyguards to support charges that he had ordered the assassinations of rivals. This, and the other public displays of accused criminals, was criticized by foreign observers and some Iraqi officials. [...] "It is a crime to put this on television" [...] {{said one of the}} latter. [...] "It is a shame, and it is a legacy of the former dictator." [...] Security officials responded that they were trying to assure the Iraqi public that they were actively working to protect them and apprehend terrorists. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> caught the leader of Al Qaeda, who will believe it?" [...] said an Interior Ministry official. [...] "This is to show credibility. We are sure we are doing the right thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 1920s {{and most}} of the 1930s, the Labour Party's {{official}} policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and collective security under the League of Nations. At the 1934 Labour Party Conference, Attlee declared that, [...] "We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty. We are deliberately putting a world order before our loyalty to our own country. <b>We</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country." [...] During a debate on defence in Commons a year later, Attlee said [...] "We are told (in the White Paper) that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves. We do not think you can do it by national defence. We think you can only do it by moving forward to a new world. A world of law, the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system. I shall be told that that is quite impossible." [...] Shortly after those comments, Adolf Hitler proclaimed that German rearmament offered no threat to world peace. Attlee responded the next day noting that Hitler's speech, although containing unfavourable references to the Soviet Union, created [...] "A chance to call a halt in the armaments race...We do not think that our answer to Herr Hitler should be just rearmament. We are in an age of rearmaments, but we on this side cannot accept that position." ...|$|E
