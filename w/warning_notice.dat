25|$|At 1:47am on 29 July 2013 {{during a}} heavy storm, the alarm {{system on the}} glacier triggered, {{alerting}} the authorities to a serious flood risk. 95 firefighters and 70 soldiers of the gendarmerie were mobilised, and an evacuation plan put into effect, involving the townspeople of St Gervais, Sallanches and Passy Domanc gathering at pre-arranged assembly points.

25|$|As of 17 December 2015, 27 Financial Notices to Improve {{have been}} served upon Multi Academy Trusts, only 16 {{of which were}} still open as 11 of the organisations {{initially}} queried had improved and had their Notice to Improve removed. In its 2014 Annual Report, AET stated that the trust expected the EFA Notice to Improve to be lifted by March 2015. However the Financial <b>Warning</b> <b>Notice</b> remained in place in Autumn 2015. In the September 2015 AET Board meeting, the CEO Ian Comfort was cited explaining the situation by {{saying that he had}} not even been aware of the crucial deadline for reporting to the Education Funding Agency, and that was why the paperwork was not submitted that would have enabled the Financial Notice to Improve, to be lifted. Be that as it may, the Notice to Improve, was still in place requiring AET to improve, a full year later at the end of August 2016.|$|E
500|$|Exceptions {{are made}} for {{children}} and a person [...] "in the exercise of his calling" [...] (a professional person or somebody exercising a trade or skill). With children, occupiers must [...] "be prepared for children to be less careful than adults"; a <b>warning</b> <b>notice,</b> for example, would normally {{be good enough to}} alert adults to a potential danger, but not to alert children. This is another extension of a common law principle; in Glasgow Corporation v Taylor [...] 1 AC 44, a seven-year-old child died after eating poisonous berries from a bush in a park. The berries, which looked like cherries or blackcurrants, were found by the House of Lords to constitute an [...] "allurement" [...] to the child, who found Glasgow Corporation, which owned the park, liable. However, the situation is different if the child has a guardian with him, who one would expect to appreciate any obvious dangers, as in Phipps v Rochester Corporation [...] 1 QB 450. This was essentially the same as the existing common law; indeed, [...] "It is doubtful whether the Act alters the law at all on this point".|$|E
