Although Clive Barker wrote the original story, and also wrote and directed the first film, he has not written or directed any of the succeeding sequels.

25|$|It was {{not until}} the second serial, The Daleks, that the {{programme}} caught the imaginations of viewers and began to ingrain itself in the popular consciousness. This was primarily due to the Dalek creatures introduced in this story. Devised by scriptwriter Terry Nation and designer Raymond Cusick, they were completely un-humanoid and like nothing that had been seen on television before. Lambert had in fact been strongly advised against using Nation's script by her direct superior Donald Wilson, but used the excuse that they had nothing else ready in order to produce it. Once it was clear <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> success it had been, Wilson admitted to Lambert that he would no longer interfere with her decisions as she clearly knew the programme better than he did.|$|E

Lamont was first elected as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Pollok in 1999. She held the seat in 2003, when she faced a strong challenge from the Scottish Socialist Party leader Tommy Sheridan, and then again in 2007 and 2011.|$|E

Moseley explained, [...] "Peter's got his own issues to deal with, and Caspian's got his own issues to deal with, and when neither is willing to compromise, there's bound to be friction. Peter came back to Narnia expecting to be king again and that everyone would do as he said, and Caspian is unwilling to let him take over, so that causes some of it. That's really what happens. And it's a lot about humility. I think they both have to learn a certain humility [...] and that's really <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> king needs is to be humble, to listen to his people, to be willing to compromise, and they start off as these sort of angry teenagers, and become kings at the end." [...] In real life, the two actors got on well together. Moseley also stated that he identified with Peter, having gone back to school between shooting both films.
