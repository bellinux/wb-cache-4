5|$|After the {{purchase}} was approved, Jefferson drafted {{a system of}} governing the newly acquired territory. Fearing that the Federalists would oppose any system he had devised, he delivered his draft to Breckinridge {{and asked him to}} introduce it in the Senate as his own. To maintain the ruse, Breckinridge moved that a committee be formed to recommend a plan for governing Louisiana Territory. <b>Working</b> <b>through</b> the committee, he brought Jefferson's plan to the Senate floor with its essentials intact. Because the plan provided for the taxation of Louisiana residents without giving them representation in Congress, Federalists and some Democratic-Republicans opposed it. Nevertheless, it passed by a vote of 26–6.|$|E

5|$|David Moffat {{became the}} Rio Grande's {{president}} in 1885 and persuaded the company's other executives {{to go ahead}} with the Aspen connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, they built a narrow-gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork, today the route of the Rio Grande Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. <b>Working</b> <b>through</b> the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the German {{invasion}} of Poland and subsequent outbreak of war in September 1939, the Yugoslav Intelligence Service was cooperating with British intelligence agencies on a large scale across the country. This cooperation, which had existed to a lesser extent during the early 1930s, intensified after the Anschluss in 1938. These combined intelligence operations were aimed at strengthening Yugoslavia and keeping her neutral while encouraging covert activities. In mid to late 1940, British intelligence became aware of coup plotting, but managed to side-track the plans, preferring to continue <b>working</b> <b>through</b> Prince Paul. The SOE office in Belgrade went to significant lengths to support the opposition to the anti-Axis Cvetković government, which undermined the hard-won balance in Yugoslav politics that government represented. SOE Belgrade was entangled with pro-Serb policies and interests, and disregarded or underestimated warnings from SOE and British diplomats in Zagreb, who better understood the situation in Yugoslavia as a whole.|$|E

One Sunday morning, while {{everybody}} else is at church, Homer falls {{asleep on the couch}} smoking a cigar, which ignites some magazines and ultimately sets the whole house ablaze. Homer wakes up but quickly succumbs to the thick smoke and faints. Apu, chief of Springfield's volunteer fire department, rushes to the Simpson house with other firefighters including Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum, and Barney. Meanwhile, Ned runs into the burning house to rescue Homer and pulls him out just as the firefighters arrive. After the fire is out, Homer declares that God was delivering vengeance. Reverend Lovejoy counters that God was <b>working</b> <b>through</b> the hearts of Homer's friends, despite their different faiths. Homer agrees to give church another try and the next Sunday is there, albeit snoring loudly through the service. Appearing in his dreams again, God consoles Homer on the failure of his religion.

5|$|Punk cited {{his health}} {{as the main}} reason he left WWE, {{describing}} that in his final months in the company, he had been <b>working</b> <b>through</b> an untreated and potentially fatal MRSA infection, broken ribs, injured knees, and multiple concussions including one at the Royal Rumble, as well as having lost his appetite and ability to sleep well. Punk felt that WWE was pressuring and rushing him to wrestle before he had fully recovered. According to him, he found a lump {{on his back in}} November 2013 and it was diagnosed as a fatty deposit by Dr. Chris Amann, who refused to remove it despite Punk's requests. The week after Punk left WWE, his wife April Mendez convinced him to get the lump checked by her doctor. The doctor diagnosed it as a MRSA infection and told Punk that he could have died due to ignoring it for such a long time. Punk had the doctor evacuate the infection, describing it as the worst pain in his life, but said that once it was treated and he was on stronger medication, he was able to sleep better than he had in weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} facility for Daicon IV {{was in a}} dedicated studio in a building called the Hosei Kaikan that was owned by a textile union.

The Daicon IV film officially credits a production crew of twelve people. Hiroyuki Yamaga directed the production of Daicon IV with Hideaki Anno and Takami Akai as animation directors.

5|$|The reactor was {{powered up}} successfully, {{but after a}} few hours the power level dropped and the reactor shut down. Leona speculated that a water leak was the problem, rather than a {{radioactive}} poison. However, during the night the operators were able to power the reactor up again only to have it once more die away. The timings now pointed to a radioactive poison. After <b>working</b> <b>through</b> the numbers with slide rules and hand calculators, they determined the Neutron cross section of the poison, {{which turned out to be}} xenon-135. Fortunately, the DuPont engineers had equipped the reactor with 50 per cent more fuel tubes that the physicists had called for, and by loading them up, they managed to get the reactor started.|$|E
5|$|The story {{involved}} a strange force compelling Jamie to pilot the TARDIS to Scotland in 1746 where the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe find themselves isolated from their ship by a forcefield. They {{arrive at the}} foreboding Castle McCrimmon, Jamie's ancestral home near a misty loch. There they are met by Duncan, Factor to the ailing Laird, Sir James McCrimmon. Jamie shows Zoe around and she notices some strange cattle which then stand up - they are Yeti. The Yeti isolate the castle and the villagers fall {{under the influence of}} the Great Intelligence. One villager, Fiona, is immune and Jamie falls in love with her. The Intelligence aims to gain control of Jamie's body and settle in the castle as the Laird of McCrimmon when Sir James dies. The Doctor has to determine who the Intelligence is <b>working</b> <b>through,</b> with the Laird and the village sorceress being the prime candidates. It transpires that Duncan is protecting Fiona's mother, Morag - a woman with second sight. The Intelligence is defeated and, after Sir James dies with no heirs, Jamie is the last of the clan and is therefore the obvious choice for the new Laird.
