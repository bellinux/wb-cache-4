5|$|The poet Eka Budianta {{notes that}} {{a common theme}} in Soeman's works was the {{strength}} of love {{and its ability to}} overcome obstacles. Soeman wrote of the power of romance and marriage for love in response to the treatment of women in adat (traditional) culture. Among the Malays of Riau, arranged marriages were common, and <b>women</b> <b>would</b> sometimes be married to men older than their father. Before marriage, young <b>women</b> <b>would</b> be secluded and unable to interact with any men except for the ones chosen to be their husbands. Similarly, Soeman used Kasih Tak Terlarai to criticize the mistreatment of orphans after adoption.|$|E
5|$|As per the census, Zambia {{recorded}} a Total fertility rate (TFR), {{defined as the}} fertility rate of a woman throughout her life, of 5.9, with 7.0 in rural and 4.6 in urban areas. The most urbanized provinces, with higher socio-economic index like Lusaka {{recorded a}} lower TFR. Crude birth rate (CBR), the number of live births for each 1,000 births, stood at 35 in Zambia, with the Northern Province recording a maximum of 41. Child-woman ratio (CWR), the ratio of children aged 0–4 against women aged 15–49, was 738 children per thousand women and it was maximum in Northern province, where it was 880. The General fertility rate (GFR), the number of births per 1,000 child bearing women, was 147 as per the census. The Completed family Size (CF) was 6.4 in rural areas and 5.4 in urban areas. Gross reproduction rate (GRR), {{the average number of}} females births a <b>women</b> <b>would</b> have between ages 15–49, was 2.3, while the Net reproduction rate (NRR), the number of surviving female births a <b>women</b> <b>would</b> have between ages 15–49, stood at 2.1.|$|E

50|$|Obesity {{is defined}} as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or greater. A 5-foot-5-inch tall <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> be {{considered}} obese if she weighs 180 pounds or more and a 5-foot-8-inch tall <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> be considered obese if she weighs 200 pounds or more.|$|R

5|$|In ancient China and Korea, {{hair was}} {{regarded}} as a precious legacy from parents. Most people would never cut their hair after they became adults, and cutting off one's hair was a penalty for minor crimes. Both men and <b>women</b> <b>would</b> coil up their hair and many hair-coiling styles were developed.|$|E

5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while <b>women</b> <b>would</b> wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and <b>women</b> <b>would</b> have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
5|$|As a {{reflection}} of categories of sexuality so sharply defined {{by the government and}} society at large, lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women, particularly among the working class in the U.S. and Canada. Although many municipalities had enacted laws against cross-dressing, some <b>women</b> <b>would</b> socialize in bars as butches: dressed in men's clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed a more diminutive role as femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between the two would be ignored, or at least unable to date anyone, and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|But it {{was also}} during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint. Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint {{employed}} forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets {{to make sure they}} were the proper weight before coining. These <b>women</b> <b>would</b> sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E

5|$|Gradually, {{women began}} to author their own {{thoughts}} and literary works about lesbian relationships. Until {{the publication of}} The Well of Loneliness, most major works involving lesbianism were penned by men. Foster suggests that <b>women</b> <b>would</b> have encountered suspicion about their own lives had they used same-sex love as a topic, and that some writers including Louise Labé, Charlotte Charke, and Margaret Fuller either changed the pronouns in their literary works to male, or made them ambiguous. Author George Sand was portrayed as a character in several works in the 19th century; writer Mario Praz credited the popularity of lesbianism as a theme to Sand's appearance in Paris society in the 1830s. Charlotte Brontë's Villette in 1853 initiated a genre of boarding school stories with homoerotic themes.|$|E
5|$|In Original Stories, Wollstonecraft {{employed}} the then-burgeoning genre of children's literature {{to promote the}} education of women and an emerging middle-class ideology. She argued that <b>women</b> <b>would</b> be able to become rational adults if they were educated properly as children, which was not a widely held belief in the 18th century, and contended that the nascent middle-class ethos was superior to the court culture represented by fairy tales and {{to the values of}} chance and luck found in chapbook stories for the poor. Wollstonecraft, in developing her own pedagogy, also responded to the works of the two most important educational theorists of the 18th century: John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E
5|$|Initial reports {{suggested}} that the <b>women</b> <b>would</b> serve their sentence {{in one of three}} provinces. The decision upon a general-security women's corrective labor colony (the most common type of prison in Russia) in the Republic of Mordovia, approximately 400 kilometers from Moscow, was later confirmed by Tolokonnikova's husband. The women asked authorities to let them serve their sentence at the pre-trial detention facility in Moscow. Their request was denied, and Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were then dispatched to penal colonies in Mordovia and Perm Oblast, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The rituals {{performed}} at the statue by pregnant women involved walking round three times, reciting charms and touching one's abdomen. <b>Women</b> <b>would</b> also carry a band which would either be touched to the statue and then tied around their waist, or half of the band would be tied to the statue while the remaining half would be kept on the woman's body until the child was born. After the childbirth, the basin {{in front of the}} statue was used by women to bathe in. The rites performed in the honour of the statue were said to be similar to those performed by Phoenicians in the worship of their Venus.|$|E
5|$|The women {{worked from}} 8:30a.m. to 3:30p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working {{conditions}} were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost {{attention to the}} scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the <b>women</b> <b>would</b> file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very hot working environment. Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief {{from the heat and}} avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions than many other American women workers in the late nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, young men and <b>women</b> <b>would</b> spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends {{would be able to}} pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E

5|$|Tuatara {{feature in}} a number of {{indigenous}} legends, and are held as ariki (God forms). Tuatara are regarded as the messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster, and Māori women are forbidden to eat them. Tuatara also indicate tapu (the borders of what is sacred and restricted), beyond which there is mana, meaning there could be serious consequences if that boundary is crossed. Māori <b>women</b> <b>would</b> sometimes tattoo images of lizards, some of which may represent tuatara, near their genitals. Today, tuatara are regarded as a taonga (special treasure).|$|E
5|$|Women in Mediaeval and Renaissance Europe were legally {{assumed to}} be subject to their fathers, then to their husbands after marriage. The status of women within Mediaeval trades was largely {{dependent}} on the local interpretation of femme sole, the legal term for a single woman. This was usually the widow of a tradesman, who was permitted to continue her husband's business after his death, and often established in the rights and privileges of his trade guild or company. More rarely, single <b>women</b> <b>would</b> achieve success in their father's trade. Exceptions occurred mainly in trades linked to traditional women's occupations, such as haberdashery and needlecraft.|$|E
5|$|By 1782, the Johnsons {{had moved}} to Bryan's Station (future Lexington) in Fayette County. Johnson's mother was {{considered}} among the heroic women of the community because of her actions during Simon Girty's raid on Bryan's Station in August 1782. According to tradition, as Girty's forces surrounded the fort, the occupants discovered that they had almost no water inside to withstand a siege. Several Indians had concealed themselves near the spring outside the fort. The Kentuckians reasoned that the Indians would stay hidden until they attacked. Jemima Johnson approved {{a plan for the}} women to go alone and collect water from the spring as usual. Many men disapproved of the plan, fearing the <b>women</b> <b>would</b> be attacked and killed. However, faced with no other option they finally agreed. Shortly after sunrise, the women went to the spring and returned without incident.|$|E
