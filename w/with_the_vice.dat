5|$|On April 14, 2017, Representative Earl Blumenauer {{introduced}} the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act. This bill {{would replace the}} Cabinet as the body that, together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> President, determines whether Section 4 should be invoked. Under the bill, an eleven-member commission would conduct {{an examination of the}} President when directed to do so by a concurrent resolution of the Congress.|$|E
5|$|Due to a miscommunication, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) {{failed to}} follow its own search {{parameters}} in Rock Creek Park, leaving Levy's body to decompose for a year. Furthermore, the MPDC had been informed, and soon dismissed, that Ingmar Guandique, already arrested for attacking women in Rock Creek Park, had confessed to attacking Levy. The MPDC instead put {{much of its}} focus on the revelation that Levy {{was having an affair}} with Congressman Gary Condit, a married Democrat then serving his fifth term representing California's 18th congressional district, and a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Condit had an overwhelming alibi (he was in meetings <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> President), was never named as a suspect by police and was eventually cleared of any involvement in the disappearance. However, due to the cloud of suspicion raised by the intense media focus on the missing intern and the later revelation of the affair, Condit lost his bid for re-election in 2002.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April 1943 Lorković {{was removed}} from office after Lorković's cabinet chief, Ivo Kolak, {{was found guilty of}} gold {{smuggling}} and executed. Following his removal, Lorković was named a Minister in Government's Presidency, where he was responsible for relations with the German Army, and become a close associate of General Edmund Glaise von Horstenau. During the summer of 1943, he advocated cooperation with the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and represented the Ustaše in negotiations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> president of the HSS, August Košutić, about forming a coalition government. Lorković advocated a stronger government and greater independence in its activity. He initiated a new government to be led by himself as a prime minister and not the Poglavnik, but Pavelić named Nikola Mandić as prime minister on 2 September 1942. Lorković and some of his associates submitted their resignations, which were not accepted. Despite this setback, Lorković, along with Mandić, continued negotiations with HSS throughout September finalising them {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E

5|$|Agnew's pride {{had been}} stung by the {{negative}} {{news coverage of}} him during the campaign, and he sought to bolster his reputation by assiduous performance of his duties. It had become usual {{for the vice president}} to preside over the Senate only if he might be needed to break a tie, but Agnew opened every session for the first two months of his term, and spent more time presiding, in his first year, than any vice president since Alben Barkley, who held that role under Harry S. Truman. The first postwar vice president not to have been a senator, he took lessons in Senate procedures from the parliamentarian and from a Republican committee staffer. He lunched with small groups of senators, and was initially successful in building good relations. Although silenced on foreign policy matters, he attended White House staff meetings and spoke on urban affairs; when Nixon was present, he often presented the perspective of the governors. Agnew earned praise from the other members when he presided over a meeting of the White House Domestic Council in Nixon's absence but, like Nixon during Eisenhower's illnesses, did not sit in the president's chair. Nevertheless, many of the commission assignments Nixon gave Agnew were sinecures, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> president only formally the head.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{relieving}} Price as vice chief, McCormick {{was again}} promoted to vice admiral, with date of rank April 3, 1950. On December 20, 1950, President Harry S. Truman nominated McCormick for {{the rank of}} admiral, {{increasing the number of}} full admirals in the Navy to five. Truman's declaration of a national emergency had lifted the legal limits on the number of three- and four-star officers, and McCormick was promoted to grant him equal standing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> chiefs of staff of the Army and Air Force. He was confirmed in his new rank on December 22, 1950.|$|E
25|$|Adhering to the {{official}} cultural policy, Ralea was making efforts to be admitted into the Workers' Party. His application was politely turned down, but he was honored <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> presidency of the Great National Assembly Presidium and {{a seat on the}} republican Council of State. In 1962, Ralea was one of the guest speakers at a Geneva conference on the generation gap, alongside Louis Armand, Claude Autant-Lara, and Jean Piaget. Also that year, he helped with the recovery and reemployment of a former rival, Traian Herseni. Reportedly, Ralea excused Herseni's Iron Guard affiliation as a careerist move rather than a political crime. Together, they published Sociologia succesului ("The Sociology of Success"); Herseni used the pseudonym Traian Hariton.|$|E

50|$|On September 26, 1973, the House took up {{debate on}} Vice President Agnew's request. Congressman Paul Findley offered a resolution, H.

25|$|The {{meeting is}} held at 1 p.m. in the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes containing each state's certified vote and place them on tables in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political party). Relevant portions of the Certificate of Vote are read for each state, in alphabetical order.|$|E
25|$|While Barbour {{evidenced}} {{no personal}} history of {{an interest in}} Jewish affairs prior to rejoining the Senate in 1940, the plight of victims of Nazi genocide stirred him deeply. In April 1943, {{along with many other}} Congressmen and Senators, Barbour may have attended a performance of We Will Never Die, a pageant written by Ben Hecht and produced by the Bergson Group to commemorate two million European Jews who had already been murdered. In the fall of 1943, he was one {{of a small group of}} senators and congressmen who, together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> president, met with 400 rabbis who marched with the Bergson Group in Washington in 1943, shortly before Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. It was hoped their march would encourage the United States government to take a formal stand against the Holocaust. While President Franklin D. Roosevelt did not meet with the rabbis, Senator Barbour, along with a handful of Congressional colleagues, met them on the steps of the United States Capitol and expressed his commitment to their cause.|$|E

500|$|Barkley {{tried to}} mentor Scott Lucas and Ernest McFarland, his {{immediate}} successors as floor leader, by {{teaching them to}} work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> president as he had during Truman's vice presidency, but Truman's unpopularity made cooperation between the executive branch and the legislature difficult. After the U.S. entered the Korean War, Truman focused on foreign affairs, leaving Barkley to campaign for Democratic candidates in the 1950 midterm elections. He traveled over [...] and spoke in {{almost half of the}} states during the campaign. He felt ill when he arrived in Paducah on election day, and a doctor diagnosed him with a [...] "tired heart". Returning to Washington, D.C., he spent several days in Naval Hospital, but was able to preside when the Senate opened its session on November 28, 1950. Democrats lost seats in both houses but maintained majorities in each.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{moving to}} Washington, the Hobarts {{established}} {{themselves at the}} Arlington Hotel, which was the Washington home to many political men of the era, including Hanna. Soon, however, Pennsylvania Senator Don Cameron offered them the lease of the house he owned at 21 Madison Place, diagonally across Pennsylvania Avenue from the Executive Mansion (as the White House was still formally known). The asking price was $10,000 per year; the Vice President bargained Cameron down to $8,000 (equal to the vice presidential salary) by suggesting that the public might assume he stole the excess. Among the frequent visitors at {{what came to be}} known as the [...] "Cream White House" [...] was Hanna, by then a senator, who would come by for breakfast and talk <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> President until it was time for both to go to the Senate.|$|E

2500|$|Barbara Bush's {{eight years}} as Second Lady allowed her to become a common {{household}} name.

She traveled around the country and the world, both <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> President on official trips and by herself.

2500|$|Johnson {{sought to}} {{increase}} his influence within the executive branch.

[...] Kennedy's response was to sign a non-binding letter requesting Johnson to [...] "review" [...] national security policies instead. Kennedy similarly turned down early requests from Johnson to be given an office adjacent to the Oval Office, and to employ a full-time Vice Presidential staff within the White House. His lack of influence was thrown into relief later in 1961 when Kennedy appointed Johnson's friend Sarah T. Hughes to a federal judgeship, whereas Johnson had {{tried and failed to}} garner the nomination for Hughes {{at the beginning of his}} vice presidency. House Speaker Sam Rayburn wrangled the appointment from Kennedy in exchange for support of an administration bill.|$|E
