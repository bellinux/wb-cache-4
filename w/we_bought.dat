5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E

Drummond argued that the offer exploited a loophole in The JAMs' agreement with the MCPS: [...] "We were browsing around this record shop and came across these five copies of 1987.... We made it perfectly clear to the MCPS that we couldn't actually force the shops to send our LPs back.... ecause <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> them in a shop, these LPs don't come into the agreement {{and we can do}} what we like with them and not break any laws." ...|$|E
500|$|Johansson {{signed on}} to play Black Widow in Jon Favreau's Iron Man 2 (2010), {{a part of the}} Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Before she secured the role, she dyed her hair red to {{convince}} Favreau that she was right for the part, and undertook stunt and strength training preparing for the role. Johannsson said the character resonated with her, and she admired the superhero's human traits. The film earned $623.9million against its $200million budget, and received generally positive reviews from critics, but she was mostly criticized for her performance. Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph believed that she [...] "gets nothing to do but pout [...] perform a few swivel kicks", and Matt Goldberg similarly thought that she had little to do but look attractive. In 2011, Johansson played the role of Kelly, a zookeeper in the family film <b>We</b> <b>Bought</b> a Zoo alongside Matt Damon. The film garnered mainly favorable reviews, and Anne Billson praised Johansson for bringing depth to a rather uninteresting character. Johansson earned a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress: Drama nomination for her performance.|$|E

500|$|Elias Kifle Maraim Beyene, a {{survivor}} from Ethiopia being {{asked about his}} memory of Michael Jackson after his death remembers: [...] "I won't ever forget Michael Jackson because his contribution to the song We are the World had a very significant effect on my life. I am 50 now but 25 years ago I was living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which {{at that time was}} suffering from a long drought and famine. It was a terrible situation. Lots of people became sick and many more died. Around one million people in all were killed by the famine. In 1984 Michael Jackson, along with a number of other leading musicians, made the song We are the World to raise money for Africa. We received a lot of aid from the world and I {{was one of those who}} directly benefitted from it. The wheat flour that was distributed to the famine victims was different to the usual cereal <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> at the market. We baked a special bread from it. The local people named the bread after the great artist and it became known as Michael Bread. It was soft and delicious.|$|E
500|$|After he {{read the}} script, Connery {{realised}} {{the risk of the}} sequence with the sharks in Largo's pool and insisted that production designer Ken Adam build a Plexiglas partition inside the pool. The barrier was not a fixed structure, so when one of the sharks managed to pass through it, Connery fled the pool, seconds away from attack. Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian, [...] "We had to use special effects, but unlike special effects today, they were real. The jet pack we used in Thunderball was real - it was invented for the United States Army. Bloody dangerous, and it only lasted a couple of minutes. The ejector seat in the Aston Martin was real and Emilio Largo's boat, the Disco Volante, was real. You had power boats at that time, but there were no good-sized yachts that were able to travel at 40 to 50 knots, so it was quite a problem. But by combining a hydrofoil, which <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> in Puerto Rico for $10,000, and a catamaran, it at least looked like a big yacht. We combined the two hulls with a one-inch slip bolt and when they split it worked like a dream. We used lots of sharks for this movie. I'd rented a villa in the Bahamas with a saltwater pool which we filled with sharks and used for underwater filming. The smell was horrendous. This was where Sean Connery came close to being bitten. We had a plexiglass corridor to protect him, but I didn't have quite enough plexiglass and one of the sharks got through. He never got out of a pool faster in his life - he was walking on water." [...] When special-effects coordinator John Stears provided a supposedly dead shark to be towed around the pool, the shark, which was still alive, revived at one point. Due to the dangers on the set, stuntman Bill Cummings demanded an extra fee of £250 to double for Largo's sidekick Quist as he was dropped into the pool of sharks.|$|E

Pioneer's Executive Vice President Harding Luther Lawrence arrived at Continental {{as a result of}} the merger. Bob Six commented on more than on occasion that, [...] "the reason <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> Pioneer was to get Harding." [...] Harding Lawrence implemented several innovative changes at Continental as well as a flamboyant advertising campaign during his ten years as Mr. Six's protege. During Lawrence's tenure Continental grew by 500 percent. Lawrence left Continental in April 1965 to head Braniff Airways.|$|E
2500|$|With {{production}} on Aloha delayed, Crowe set his next feature, the family comedy-drama <b>We</b> <b>Bought</b> a Zoo, based on Benjamin Mee's memoir {{of the same}} name. Crowe collaborated with The Devil Wears Prada writer Aline Brosh McKenna on the screenplay. The book's story follows Mee, who buys and moves into a dilapidated zoo (now Dartmoor Zoological Park) in the English countryside. Looking for a fresh start along with his seven-year-old daughter and his troubled fourteen-year-old son, he hopes to refurbish the zoo and run it and to give his children what he calls an [...] "adventure". Crowe changed the location to the U.S.A. The film received a wide release on December 23, 2011 by 20th Century Fox, and starred Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson. The film has received positive reviews. The music of the movie was composed by Jonsi.|$|E

2500|$|Three members (Garred, Pritchard and Harris) of The Kooks all met as {{students}} at the BRIT School in Croydon, all three moving further south to join BIMM (where they met Rafferty who was from Brighton) in 2002. The inspiration to form a band came to Pritchard as he and Garred were out shopping for clothes one day in Primark as a joke. Speaking to MTV Garred said, [...] "we had a vision on how we wanted the band to look and stuff—so <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> some clothes and these hats, it was fun." [...] Sharing a love of The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Police, and David Bowie, Pritchard got Harris and Rafferty involved {{under the guise of}} a school music project. Pritchard himself said [...] "We got together just on a whim, really." [...] With a strong demo of their material Garred and Pritchard went in search of a gig, and according to Garred, they were able to book their first show simply because the landlord liked their hats. [...] "So we went in to get a gig, we don't have a demo blid burnt, and this guy told us, 'Well, you can't get a gig if you don't have a demo, but I like your hats, so I'm {{going to give you a}} gig'", said Garred. However, the band was unable to make the performance as they were finishing off their demo at the time.|$|E
2500|$|David Flying Hawk was {{the eldest}} son of Felix Flying Hawk. David was a {{performer}} with Wild West Shows and traveled with his grandfather Chief Flying Hawk. In 1924, David Flying Hawk performed in Rhode Island and had a notable encounter with a horse named “King Tut.” [...] “King Tut was a big bay, very rank horse, that <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> at Tribune, Kansas. [...] The real King Tut’s tomb had been discovered along about this time and papers were still carrying {{quite a bit of}} news about it, therefore the name King Tut. [...] The horse had been bucked away from a snubbing horse a few times and we thought he would develop; into a real good, tough bucking horse. [...] A lot of the credit for getting ole Tut started on the road to becoming a great horse must go to a Sioux Indian boy by the name of Dave Flying Hawk, who was on the Knights of Columbus rodeo with us in 1924. [...] This Indian and two others, of the carload that was with us, were bronc riders. [...] Dave was also part of the Indian dance troupe. The program for our opening performance in Providence, Rhode Island was somewhat in turmoil. [...] The Indian dancers had just finished when the arena director, Sammy Garrett, started calling for Flying Hawk to come to the bucking chutes, that his horse was in. [...] King Tut, being pretty wild. Had gone into the chutes first. [...] There being no time for Flying Hawk to change clothes, he came to the chutes in full dance costume—fringed buckskin clothes, feathers, bells—the whole works. [...] While the chute help saddled the big wild King Tut, who hadn’t been to town any more than the Indian had, Flying Hawk put on someone's boots and spurs and eased up over the chute and down onto Tut’s back. [...] When they opened the chute gate and those bells started ringing and those feathers started flopping, that horse went completely berserk. [...] The kid weathered the storm for about five jumps before he went into orbit. [...] It looked as though someone had shot a wild turkey—the crowd went wild. [...] They thought that it was a special act that Flying Hawk was putting on. [...] That was the funniest thong I’ve ever seen happened at a rodeo. [...] We sold King Tut, along with four or five top horses, to McCarty and Elliott of Cheyenne the next year. [...] I heard {{a few years ago that}} they bucked him until he was nearly twenty-six years old, but I’m sure that he was never as scared in his life as we was with Flying Hawk on board.” ...|$|E
