50|$|Slim is a {{boy whose}} {{astronomer}} father is visiting the country estate of an important industrialist. The industrialist's son, Red, has found two strange animals, and he enlists Slim in a plan to turn the animals into a circus act. The astronomer, meanwhile, tells the industrialist {{that he has been}} in contact with space aliens who want to open up their world to interstellar trade. Their <b>world</b> <b>needs</b> <b>help,</b> the astronomer says; for ever since the atomic wars that destroyed their old civilization, their world has been regressing. Unless something is done, their culture may face total collapse.|$|R
5000|$|Another common {{stereotype}} is that Americans {{want to be}} [...] "the world's policemen", {{believing that}} the entire <b>world</b> <b>needs</b> their <b>help</b> - even if this results in preemptive military intervention - because someone or something makes them inherently exceptional. This relatively recent stereotype spawned from Cold War and post-Cold War military interventions such as the Vietnam War and Iraq War, which many people opposed.|$|R

This is achieved through various initiatives like Food For Thought, plant 10 free trees and the free to join Carbon free dining.These initiatives encourage people to become environmentally conscious and educate them {{about the need for}} planting more trees. The main focus is on reducing the carbon footprint of people, businesses and restaurants while donating trees to some of the poorest communities in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The idea behind donating trees to these communities is to make them self sustainable.|$|R

Appel {{has argued}} that [...] "treating human beings differently, simply because they were born on the {{opposite}} side of a national boundary," [...] is inherently unethical. According to Appel, such [...] "birthrights" [...] are only defensible if they serve [...] "useful and meaningful social purposes" [...] (such as inheritance rights, which encourage mothers and fathers to work and save for their children), but the [...] "birthright of nationality" [...] does not do so. Economist and writer Philippe Legrain argues that the countries of the <b>world</b> <b>need</b> migration to <b>help</b> global trade and reduce the occurrence of regional wars.|$|R

'Lord Byron {{spent every}} {{shilling}} {{that the law}} allowed him out of her [...] property while he lived, and left away from her every shilling that he [...] could deprive her of by his will; yet she had, eventually, a large [...] income at her command. In the management of it, she showed the same [...] wise consideration that marked all her practical decisions. She [...] resolved to spend her whole income, seeing how much the <b>world</b> <b>needed</b> [...] <b>help</b> at the moment. Her care was for the existing generation, rather [...] than for a future one, which would have its own friends. She usually [...] declined trammelling herself with annual subscriptions to charities; [...] preferring to keep her freedom from year to year, and to achieve [...] definite objects by liberal bounty, rather than to extend partial help [...] over a large surface which she could not herself superintend.|$|R

40|$|Veterinary {{education}} must {{adapt to the}} changing demands that veterinary medicine is obligated to meet as it serves {{the needs of the}} ever-increasing global society. The <b>world</b> community <b>needs</b> the <b>help</b> of veterinary professionals to produce sufficient amounts of safe food, to control and eradicate the increasingly frequent transboundary transmission of disease, and to improve the health of both man and animals, at a global level as well as locally. In recognition of these mounting responsibilities, especially in the need for veterinarians in rural practice, one key venture in Australia has been the creation of the new veterinary school in Wagga Wagga. This paper describes the School’s mission and, in particular, the nature of the new veterinary programme that has been created. K. A. Abbot...|$|R

As a mortal, Ares shows a new humanity and conscience, but after getting his godhood back he seems to revert to his former cold-hearted self.|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of {{education}} {{there have been several}} attempts to innovate and improve the methodologies to improve the teaching and learning process. Those changes have had a minimal, but important advance because the positivist- knowledge centred view that had been pervading education during many years has now been superseded by a person centred paradigm which establishes that {{the most important part of}} any educational process is the student. Even so, there must be an important consideration to prepare students in order to be able to deal with the demand of qualification needed to perform a task and obtain a job. It is therefore a big task for teachers not only to prepare students for having an acceptable performance in their jobs, but also to form competitive persons whose personality can lead them to higher levels of competence and adaptation. The role of a teacher is not just to make the students focus on developing their knowledge of the <b>world.</b> Teachers <b>need</b> to <b>help</b> students develop their skills in order to master them in different contexts in the target language. In other words, the way students perform in class in terms of oral active participation might be fundamental to create a participation culture which may enable them to perform in other areas of their personal and professional life...|$|R
