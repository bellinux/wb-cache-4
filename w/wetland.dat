5|$|This modest {{beginning}} {{developed in}} time into {{the formation of}} the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, the only United Kingdom charity to promote the protection of <b>wetland</b> birds and their habitats, both in Britain and internationally. Although starting out at Slimbridge, the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust now owns or manages eight other reserves in Britain, and advocates for wetlands and conservation issues world-wide. WWT Consulting is an offshoot of the Wildlife & <b>Wetland</b> Trust and is based at Slimbridge. It provides ecological surveys and assessments, and offers consultancy services in <b>wetland</b> habitat design, <b>wetland</b> management, biological waste-water treatment systems and the management of reserves and their visitor centres. The Queen in later years became Patron to the WWT, and Prince Charles became the President.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wetlands</b> {{are special}} areas that they offer habitat for {{terrestrial}} and water life. <b>Wetlands</b> are nest sides also for amphibian, {{for this reason}} <b>wetlands</b> offer wide range diversity for species. <b>Wetlands</b> are also reproduction regions for birds. <b>Wetlands</b> have special importance for ecosystem because they obstruct erosion. <b>Wetlands</b> absorb contaminants from water therefore <b>wetlands</b> contribute to clean water and they offer more potable water. <b>Wetlands</b> obstruct waterflood. In that case <b>wetlands</b> must be maintained and conserved. <b>Wetlands</b> must be conserved because <b>wetlands</b> vanish very rapidly because of contamination, excessively agriculture, urban sprawl, dams…etc. this PhD thesis contributes to solve problems of <b>wetlands</b> that they are affected from urbanization especially metropolitan areas. Growth of cities requires more land for settlements; the more settlements bring about the more urban sprawl. The more urban sprawl deteriorates more natural regions. In this cycle <b>wetlands</b> are also affected from urbanization effects. In this sense some precautions should be developed {{in order to protect}} <b>wetlands</b> from urbanization effect. These precautions should include anticipation about effects of urbanization. An important tool for conserving <b>wetlands</b> and protecting these regions from cities is land uses and land use planning in city and regional planning. First step of land use planning is determination of settlement appropriateness. Settlement appropriateness contributes to choose correct locations for settlement in this respect <b>wetlands</b> can be affected in minimum level from urban sprawl. This PhD thesis inquires a method about buffer zones around <b>wetlands</b> and Thresholds in basin of wetlands; and this method is examined in two case study areas Mogan and Büyükçekmece Lake.

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{investigate}} the Land-Use and Land-Cover Change (LUCC) and landscape variation of lake-type <b>wetlands,</b> Huixian <b>Wetlands,</b> which locates in Guilin City of Guangxi province, southern China. The area of the <b>wetlands</b> significantly reduced from about 65 km 2 in 1950 s to 7. 79 km 2 after 50 years development. By the means of remote sensing retrieval, a series of remote sensing data(TM) in 1987, 1991, 2006 and 2009 were used to extract the information of Huixian <b>Wetlands.</b> The land use transition matrixes showed that, the increase of farmland leaded to the degeneration of the <b>wetlands</b> during 1987 - 2009. Referring to the natural <b>wetlands</b> in these years, 53. 99 % changed into farmland and 37. 83 % turned into artificial <b>wetlands.</b> Consequently, the area proportion of the artificial <b>wetlands,</b> accounting {{in all kinds of}} land use types in 1987, increased to 26. 82 % in 2009. Moreover, the total area of <b>wetlands</b> increased from 7. 29 km 2 to 7. 79 km 2 during 2005 - 2009, which showed that measures on the <b>wetlands</b> restoration were taken by local government works. The landscape indices were calculated to further analyze the landscape changes of the Huixian <b>Wetlands.</b> The results show that the mean area of patches increased during 1987 - 2005, but the edge density decreased. It proved that the <b>wetlands</b> had been developed with a high-intensity level in 1987 which coincides with the practical situation of local economy. Moreover, the temporal distribution of the farmland showed that the <b>wetlands</b> evolution following the degeneration mode: first, the <b>wetlands</b> are reclaimed into many patches; secondly, small pieces of farmland become a big one and the number of <b>wetlands</b> patches decreases; finally, the <b>wetlands</b> turn into other kinds of landscape...|$|R
