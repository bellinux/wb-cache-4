5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. I grew up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> seek out. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time I liked school and for {{the first time}} I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the {{property}} of Barnard College at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.|$|E

He stated, [...] "I always knew I wanted to be in films but I did not know exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. I loved movies and watched a lot of them.

Whether you are a DJ, or if you work with computers, or if you're a teacher, everyone has that point where they feel, 'I'm bored and this isn't <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do with my life.' ...|$|E

In an {{interview}} with Phillymag, Larter gave reason for the move: [...] "I took some time off to define myself outside the pressures of the industry. Part of me really needed to know if this is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the rest of}} my life." [...] In January 2005, she moved to Los Angeles for a role in Heroes.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Gomez said that [...] "A Year Without Rain" [...] was the first song she recorded for the album. She also explained why she named the album for the song, commenting, [...] "I feel like that song {{has a lot of}} meaning, and it also kind of was the start of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> base all the other songs around." [...] A Spanish-language version of the song titled [...] "Un Año Sin Lluvia" [...] was released through the iTunes Store on October 26, 2010.|$|E

Although he enjoyed his time in the TA, Dickinson {{realised}} {{that it was not a}} career choice, and so he applied for a place to read history at Queen Mary College, London. His parents wanted him in the army, but he told them that he wanted to get a degree first, which acted as his [...] "cover story", and immediately began playing in bands.|$|E

Reflecting on his arrival to the band, Mangini told Noisecreep, [...] "As I see it, as I look back, I really think what {{happened}} was that this band kind of started over. They were in a new place as they looked for a drummer, and I when got the news, after the shock wore off, I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do – which was just basically come in and try to support where they wanted to go.

500|$|With {{the lyrics}} on Entren Los Que Quieran, Residente {{took a more}} {{political}} approach, inspired by events that transpired after the last album. [...] "Calma Pueblo" [...] discusses various topics including dishonest politicians, lip-synching in live performances, and payola. Residente also references Calle 13's sponsors with the line [...] "Adidas doesn't use me, I use Adidas." [...] Residente originally wrote eight pages of lyrics for [...] "Calma Pueblo", but later [...] "deleted and deleted" [...] many of the words, as {{he felt that the}} song's subject matter [...] "can come off like cheap pamphleteering. And that's not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] "Digo Lo Que Pienso" [...] has been labeled as a [...] "scathing attack" [...] on San Juan mayor Jorge Santini.|$|E
500|$|It also {{incorporates}} a Queen-referencing chorus: [...] "I {{want you to}} rock me, yeah, I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care." [...] The track's lyricism regards a nostalgic message about a former significant other and a blatant double entendre for sexual intercourse. In the regard to its double entendre, Grigg noted, [...] "but at the same time, there's a vulnerability in it that's, like, so sweet for girls. It's a little self-deprecating. There's {{not a lot of}} overt machismo in the song". [...] "I approached it like high school," [...] said [...] Hollander: [...] "On the first record, they were freshmen, innocent and wide-eyed. Now it's sophomore year, there are parties and driver’s licenses, and the world is theirs for the taking. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> capture".|$|E

500|$|Laucke took up snooker, {{and became}} {{competent}} enough by age thirteen {{to gain a}} job as a demonstrator for the Brunswick Corporation, a snooker table manufacturer. Laucke learned billiards from George Chenier, a fellow Montrealer and the North American snooker champion. The two faced each again four years later at the North American snooker championships in Montreal, where Laucke won the championship. Laucke recalled: [...] "Then I decided to leave snooker, I had done <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do... My love for the guitar was overwhelming. There was a lot more money in snooker, but snooker was just a passion, and music was my love." [...] Laucke used his snooker winnings to finance 110trips from Montreal to New York City to study the classical guitar with Franco-Spaniard Rolando Valdés-Blain.|$|E
500|$|Oulahan and Lambert claimed [...] "Aubrey {{exercised}} his tremendous {{power with}} the canny skill and the ruthlessness of a Tatar khan." [...] Aubrey's treachery led the producer John Houseman in 1959 to dub him [...] "The Smiling Cobra." [...] Houseman in public was less direct. In December 1962, CBS announced it was spending $250,000 an episode on Houseman's hour-long drama on American history for the next season, The Great Adventure, but on July 25, 1963, CBS announced Houseman had resigned. The producer told The New York Times [...] "The kind of show they want is not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> produce" [...] but attributed his departure to a simple difference of opinion, the Times reporter stating Houseman [...] "expressed no criticism of CBS."

500|$|For the 1997 American {{television}} showing, {{the film}} was broadcast virtually unedited. The telecast {{was the first to}} receive a TV-M (now TV-MA) rating under the TV Parental Guidelines that had been established earlier that year. Tom Coburn, then an Oklahoma congressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television [...] "to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity", adding that it was an insult to [...] "decent-minded individuals everywhere". Under fire from both Republicans and Democrats, Coburn apologized, saying, [...] "My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say." [...] He clarified his opinion, stating that the film ought to have been aired later at night when there would not be [...] "large numbers of children watching without parental supervision".|$|E

I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note.

500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|E

Henderson is a person with dwarfism from England, who was badly injured by being tossed by a rugby fan in a bar. The speech by Dinklage brought media and public attention to the act of dwarf-tossing with Henderson's name being trended worldwide on social media. Dinklage turned down offers from talk shows to discuss the topic. He later explained that 20 years earlier he might have accepted these offers but that he's a [...] "little bit more at peace with things now and I—said <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say.
