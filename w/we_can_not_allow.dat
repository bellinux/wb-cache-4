Post-anthropocentrism is a heavyweight issue of the posthumanism, a critical theory, which is based on rejection of human domination over the world and which considers human as a part of life-itself.

40|$|A violÃncia Ã um fenÃmeno dominante na histÃria da humanidade desde tempos remotos. Ao enfatizarmos a violÃncia interpessoal, destacamos a mulher como um das principais vÃtimas, e a violÃncia {{conjugal}} como a modalidade mais praticada. Esse fenÃmeno se entrecruza com gÃnero, subjetividade, assimetria social, dimensÃes culturais e polÃticas. Dessa forma, sob o pressuposto de existir um hiato entre as propostas da polÃtica de abrigamento e a forma como ela estÃ sendo executada. Defendemos a tese: o Estado, representado pelo dispositivo casa-abrigo, assiste a mulher submetida Ã violÃncia conjugal por meio de aÃÃes de proteÃÃo fÃsica e jurÃdica, mas com pouco impacto no processo de reinserÃÃo social das abrigadas. Portanto, tivemos como objetivo geral: compreender a vivÃncia da mulher relacionada com o violÃncia domÃstica e com o abrigamento institucional. Objetivos especÃficos: apreender o modo como vivencia a violÃncia e a passagem pela casa-abrigo; identificar aÃÃes desenvolvidas pela instituiÃÃo durante o abrigamento na perspectiva das diretrizes e objetivos da polÃtica de abrigamento. Estudo descrito, com abordagem qualitativa, pautado nos princÃpios da hermenÃutica filosÃfica, por percebemos que o fenÃmeno da violÃncia, suas vÃtimas e seu entorno fazem parte de um universo subjetivo e complexo. O cenÃrio da pesquisa foi uma OrganizaÃÃo Governamental (casa-abrigo), mantida pelo governo do Estado do CearÃ. Como participantes contamos com 10 mulheres abrigadas no perÃodo da coleta de dados, ocorrida nos meses de setembro de 2009 e fevereiro de 2010. Os dados foram produzidos por meio de entrevista semiestruturada e oficinas temÃticas. Conforme os resultados mostram, o fenÃmeno da violÃncia sempre esteve presente de forma intensa na vida das abrigadas. Na tenra idade, os agressores eram pais, mÃes, irmÃos, padrastos e madrastas, com justificativas que variam de âeducarâ a punir. JÃ na fase adulta, a modalidade mais frequente Ã a violÃncia conjugal, exercida de forma fÃsica, psicolÃgica e sexual. SÃo mulheres de baixa renda, baixa escolaridade, a maioria Ã domÃstica/dona de casa. Relatam histÃrico de ideia suicida, queixas somÃticas, revolta, depressÃo e temor. Romperam a relaÃÃo violenta por medo de serem assassinadas por seus companheiros. Esse rompimento deu-se apÃs inÃmeras manifestaÃÃes de aÃÃes de extrema violÃncia por parte do agressor. A passagem pela casa-abrigo representa um perÃodo de isolamento agravado pelo Ãcio diÃrio. Gostariam de aproveitar o tempo na casa-abrigo para fazerem cursos, capacitaÃÃes, se alfabetizarem, terem momentos de lazer, entre os quais ir Ã igreja, vivenciarem oportunidades antes inexistentes. Para elas a Ãnica diversÃo Ã ver a programaÃÃo nos canais de TV. Ao nos aproximarmos da realidade de mulheres vitimadas pela violÃncia conjugal, usuÃrias da casa-abrigo, evidenciamos a lacuna entre diretrizes, objetivos e aÃÃes programÃticas da polÃtica de abrigamento, e como ela Ã aplicada na prÃtica das suas abrigadas. A exequibilidade das nossas polÃticas tem se tornado conhecida e aclamada atÃ mesmo pelos pouco politizados. NÃo podemos permitir que esse modelo polÃtico continue comprometendo vidas, sonhos, esperanÃas. Urge uma reflexÃo coletiva acerca do que queremos e o que temos em nosso panorama polÃtico. Essas mulheres, assim como muitos brasileiros atingidos por polÃticas limitadas e ineficientes, merecem a oportunidade de uma vida melhor, alimentada pelo sonho de ter sua cidadania respeitada e a satisfaÃÃo de realizÃ-lo. Violence is {{a dominant}} phenomenon {{in human history}} since ancient times. When emphasizing interpersonal violence we highlight the woman {{as one of the}} main victims, and the marital violence as the most practiced. This phenomenon intersects with gender, subjectivity, social asymmetry, cultural and political dimensions. Thus, under the assumption of a gap between the policy proposals of sheltering and how it is being executed. We defend the argument that the State, represented by the device safe house, assists the women subjected to domestic violence primarily through actions of physical and legal protection, but with little impact on the process of social reintegration of the sheltered. Therefore, we had as a general objective: to understand the experience of women related to domestic violence and the institutional sheltering. Specific objectives: learning how to experience the violence and the passage by the shelter home, identify actions taken by the institution for sheltering in anticipation of the guidelines and objectives of the policy of sheltering. Described study with a qualitative approach, based on the principles of philosophical hermeneutics, for realizing that the phenomenon of violence, its victims and its surroundings are part of a subjective and complex universe. The study setting was a Governmental Organization (shelter home), maintained by the state government of CearÃ. We had, as participants, 10 housed women in the data collection period, which occurred in September 2009 and February 2010. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews and workshops. As the results show, the phenomenon of violence was always present intensely in the sheltered life. At the tender age, the perpetrators were fathers, mothers, brothers, stepfathers and stepmothers, with explanations ranging from "educating" to punish. In the adult stage, the most frequent modality is marital violence, exercised physically, psychologically and sexually. They are women of low income, low education, most are domestic / housekeeper. They report a history of suicidal idea, somatic complaints, anger, depression and fear. They broke the violent relationship for fear of being murdered by their companions. This rupture occurred immediately after countless manifestations of shares of extreme violence by the aggressor. The passage by the shelter home represents a period of isolation compounded by the daily lack of entertainment or occupation. According to reports, people would like to spend time at the shelter home to do courses, training, become literate, have leisure time, including going to church, experiencing opportunities which did not exist before. The only fun for them is to see programs on TV channels. As we approached the reality of women victimized by domestic violence, users of the shelter home, we noted the gap between guidelines, objectives and programmatic actions of the policy of sheltering, and how it is applied in practice to their sheltered. The feasibility of our policies has been known and praised even by the less politicized. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> this model to continue committing political lives, dreams, hopes. Its necessary a collective reflection on what we want and what we have in our political landscape. These women, like many Brazilians assisted by limited and inefficient political actions, deserve the opportunity for a better life, fueled by the dream of having their citizenship respected and the satisfaction of making this dream became true...|$|E
