The first was in 1932 when embers from a nearby brush fire were blown toward the back lot causing four movie sets to be destroyed and resulting in over $100,000 damage. Seventeen years later, in 1949, another brush fire caused the complete destruction of one building and damage to two others. In 1957, the New York street film studio set was destroyed by an arson fire causing {{half a million dollars}} in damage. Ten years later, in 1967, twice as much damage was done <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Europe area and part of Spartacus Square was destroyed. It also destroyed the European, Denver and Laramie street sets. In 1987, the remaining portion of Spartacus Square was destroyed along with street sets and other buildings. As with the 1957 fire, this was suspected {{to be the result of}} an arsonist. Just three years later, another deliberate fire was started in the back lot. The New York Street set, the Ben Hur set and the majority of Courthouse Square were destroyed. In 1997, the seventh fire occurred at the back lot. A portion of the Courthouse Square was again destroyed, though most survived.|$|E
500|$|Critics and {{commentators}} have generally acknowledged that A Handful of Dust stands apart from Waugh's other prewar fiction. Philip Toynbee {{describes it as}} {{a turning point in}} Waugh's journey from outright satire to disillusioned realism: [...] "Much of this book is in the old manner, funny-preposterous laced with funny-bitter, but the whole tone and atmosphere are violently changed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> boy is killed". Likewise [...] Gerald Gould in The Observer, reviewing the book's initial publication in 1934: [...] "Here was the old gorgeous, careless note of contempt and disillusionment. Gradually, implacably, the note changes and deepens". [...] A later critic, John Cunningham, recognises that stylistically, the book in a different category from Waugh's other 1930s novels, both more ambitious and more ambiguous. Although, says Cunningham, [...] "t provokes as much knowing laughter as Waugh's other satires of manners", it is a significant step away from its predecessors, towards the Catholic [...] "comedies of redemption" [...] that would become the principal focus of his writing life.|$|E
500|$|The {{continued}} flow of gold from California made silver {{expensive in}} terms of gold, and U.S. silver coins began to flow {{out of the country}} for melting in 1849, a flow that accelerated {{over the next several years}} as the price of the metal continued to rise. By 1853, a thousand dollars in silver coin contained $1,042 worth of bullion. As silver coins vanished, the gold dollar became the only federal coin in circulation between the cent and the quarter eagle ($2.50 piece). As such, it was struck in large numbers and widely circulated. [...] According to Bowers in his book on the denomination, [...] "the years 1850 to 1853 were the high-water mark of the gold dollar, the glory years of the denomination <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> gold coins took the place of half dollars and silver dollars in everyday transactions." [...] This time came to an end in 1853 when Congress passed an act reducing the weight of most silver coins, allowing new issues of them to circulate.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{release of}} The Little Mermaid in 1989, Disney was {{unprepared}} for the success that would be achieved by both the film's soundtrack and its songs, particularly that of [...] "Part of Your World", which became an instant hit. The studio had not thought to prepare a single version of the song at the time {{because they did not}} expect that it would soon be demanded by local radio stations, at which it was heavily rotated. The success of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] has been overshadowed by [...] "Under the Sea" [...] and [...] "Kiss the Girl", two other popular songs from the film. While both [...] "Under the Sea" [...] and [...] "Kiss the Girl" [...] were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 62nd Academy Awards, which [...] "Under the Sea" [...] ultimately won, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] did not receive a nomination, which some critics have viewed as a snub. Benson believes that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not recognize [...] "Part of Your World" [...] because [...] "a story song at the time was probably not recognised really as much". However, when the film was released to VHS in 1998, Disney included a music video for [...] "Part of Your World" [...] starring Benson that appears towards the end of its closing credits. <b>When</b> <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> Mermaid was re-released to theaters in 1997, The Boston Phoenixs Jeffrey Gantz wrote that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] remains [...] "as poignant as ever". Tracy Dye of Bustle identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as her [...] "favorite Disney song of all time." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Esther Zuckerman described [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as [...] "a perfect 'I Want' song," [...] comparing it positively to “Wouldn’t It Be Loverly” from the stage musical My Fair Lady (1956).|$|E

Cold weather also made big and small game more difficult to find. as game would go into semi hibernation. [...] Also nut crops from oak, hickory, beech, walnut, butternut, and chestnut, failed at times; making the supply of these nuts scarce. Rivers froze early, and water became cold fast; so fishing became impossible. The Native populations had declined after epidemics of infectious diseases, for which they had no acquired immunity. [...] Native American populations were separated from Europe {{for thousands of years}} and had no immunity to these diseases that the Europeans brought with them. Many Native American populations were weakened from starvation due to the Little Ice Age, which was coldest during the 17th century. Their important corn, bean and squash crops failed due to spring frosts [...] and early frosts in autumn. [...] As the Native American population declined, more land was available for European settlement. All these factors made the Native American populations decline dramatically.|$|E

Initially, the parish also included the areas of Ponta and Ponta Ruiva, but which were later deannexed to form the parishes of the Fajãs (in 1676) and Nossa Senhora do Pilar (in 1693), respectively. About the same time, José António de Sousa Bettencourt, a natural and property-owner from the island of Graciosa, began constructing a hermitage in the area of Caveira, that was consecrated on 22 December 1763, to the invocation of the Sainted Souls of the Flames of Purgatory (...) [...] At the time, the inhabitants (numbering about 100 in 32 homes) were subject to the [...] "spiritual and corporal convenience" [...] of the parish of São Caetano in Lomba, since July 1757.
