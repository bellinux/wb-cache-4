The interior set took seven weeks {{to build and}} two <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into the studio. Controlled gas pipes were used to shoot jets of flames and a header was specially built to collapse on Phil. Salisbury had {{to ensure that the}} fire for the interior scenes matched that of the already-filmed exterior scenes. Producers decided to extend the 10 September episode featuring Peggy's departure by ten minutes, meaning it would clash with rival soap opera Coronation Street.|$|E

25|$|Although SSRIs arrive {{rapidly to}} the brain after {{administration}} and the effects on 5-HT re-uptake can be measured instantly, it takes about 2–4 <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> therapeutic effects. The SSRIs have very high and selective affinity for SERT and after administration they inhibit SERT immediately. SERT inhibition is implicated in the antidepressant activity of SSRIs. 70-80% inhibition of SERT is usually necessary to induce antidepressant effects and higher dosage does not induce greater antidepressant effects for average patients. Higher dosage does, however, increase the incidence and severity of adverse events associated with excessive 5-HT re-uptake inhibition.|$|E

[...] Alex Rocha of TV Guide was much more critical stating, [...] "it seemed that the show has taken a slight fall back.

500|$|Series creator David Shore {{traced the}} concept for House to his {{background}} as a patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled that [...] "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [...] and I {{thought that it would}} be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room." [...] In 2004, Shore and executive producers Katie Jacobs and Paul Attanasio pitched House to Fox as a medical detective showa hospital whodunit where the doctors would be the sleuths looking for the source of symptoms. The ideas behind House's character were added after Fox bought the show. Shore wrote the pilot with a vivid memory of a doctor's visit: he once had to wait two <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a doctor's appointment for a sore hip, by which point his pain had disappeared. Nevertheless, Shore stated that the doctors were [...] "incredibly polite". Shore later stated that, as he wrote the pilot, he fell in love with a character who, as a doctor, would actually ask the question [...] "Why am I wasting your time?".|$|E

Nicole Scherzinger, a guest judge, and Simon Cowell have both claimed to have come {{up with the idea of}} forming the band. In 2013, Cowell said that it [...] "took him 10 minutes to put them together as a group". Subsequently, the group got together for two <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to know each other and to practice. Styles came up with the name One Direction. For their qualifying song at [...] "judges' houses", and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of [...] "Torn". Cowell later commented that their performance convinced him that they [...] "were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well."

Musharraf's speech was quick to denounce terrorism generally, and militant groups operating in Kashmir specifically, promising a crackdown.

2500|$|Despite Gahan's {{increasingly}} severe personal problems, Gore tried repeatedly during 1995 and 1996 to get {{the band}} recording again. However, Gahan would rarely turn up to scheduled sessions, and when he did, it would take <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> any vocals recorded; one six-week session at Electric Lady in New York produced just one usable vocal (for [...] "Sister of Night"), and even that was pieced together from multiple takes. Gore was forced to contemplate breaking the band up and considered releasing the songs he had written as a solo album. In mid-1996, after his near-fatal overdose, Gahan entered a court-ordered drug rehabilitation program to battle his addiction to cocaine and heroin. With Gahan out of rehab in 1996, Depeche Mode held recording sessions with producer Tim Simenon.|$|E

Released in the United States in October 2002 and internationally in 2003, Simply Deep was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 602,000 copies in the United States. Released to an even bigger success in international territories, the album topped the UK Albums Chart and became a gold-seller in Australia, Canada and New Zealand, resulting in worldwide sales total of two and a half million copies. The album yielded three singles. [...] "Stole", a rock pop-influenced mid-tempo track about loss, was released as the album's lead single and became an international top-ten hit single, peaking at number two in Australia and the United Kingdom.

2500|$|However, {{performing}} such {{a sequence}} {{proved to be}} very dangerous. If one person crashes with the other, {{it could lead to}} the disproportion of the flight pattern and subsequently could result in death. Due to this, safety became a top priority for Core. Prior to shooting, the stuntmen went to the location, and to other locations which were similar, to start training in groups. In order to get comfortable with the wingtip-to-wingtip flights necessary to pull the scene off, the wingsuiters initially jumped from planes, racking up more than 500 jumps {{over the course of the}} year leading up to filming. They would fly in tight formations over and over again, simply as a way of getting accustomed to the idea of having someone nearby at all times. The production team also went to Switzerland 12 days prior to shooting to practice. [...] During the shoot, there were ground-based cameras with long lenses, and a helicopter with a gyro-stabilized camera as well. Since Core needed a series of shots to create the sequence, from point of view shots to profile shots of the wingsuiters cruising past the mountain to close-ups – unlike filming GoPro cameras – one of the wingsuiters needed to wear a cinema-quality camera on his head, rather than a GoPro. The task went to Florez and Boole, who had never done camera work before. The Red camera used in the flights weighed an astounding 15 pounds, enough to significantly alter the way pilots normally flew. The wingsuiters made over 60 jumps in the course of two <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all the shots. Corliss called it the most dangerous stunt that has ever been filmed for a movie.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} month, Kathy {{is shocked}} when Gavin appears in her home. She threatens {{to call the}} police, but he asks her to pass on a message to Sharon, revealing {{that he has been}} on holiday with her and Dennis, but she left. Dot Branning (June Brown) then arrives, and eventually she remembers Gavin from his childhood in Walford, saying that he was a troublemaker who stole money from Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), and warns Kathy off getting involved. Gavin simply says he wants the opportunity to be a good father and grandfather, and cries when he remembers that he was unwanted by his own mother. After Dot leaves, Kathy realises that Gavin does not like being on his own and promises to pass on the messaage. Before he leaves, he kisses Kathy as a thank you, saying he misses her. Kathy speaks to Sharon, who reveals that she left the holiday because Gavin hit Dennis. Sharon meets Gavin who says he did it out of love but Sharon wants nothing to do with him. Later, Sharon discovers that Gavin has collected Dennis from school and given him a mobile phone. She meets Gavin and offers him £100,000 to leave forever, revealing that she is selling her half of her bar to fund this. Gavin asks her for another chance but she rejects him and he leaves. After Sharon tells Gavin it will take some <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the money, Gavin sees Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) and her family and concludes that they must be wealthy. Gavin blackmails Clauedtte, threatening to reveal a secret from her past. Claudette attempts to pay Gavin with sex, but afterwards he says it is not a payment and asks how Claudette killed her husband, Henry. When he demands more money, she strikes him over the head with a candelabra. She believes he is dead and takes him to the basement, and when her son Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) arrives, she lies about the circumstances, but when Gavin escapes, her lies are revealed to Vincent. Gavin returns to Claudette's home and meets Vincent, who says Claudette has left the country. Gavin says he will track her down, so Vincent offers to pay off the money Gavin claims she owes him. Sharon then meets Gavin and gives him the money from her sale of her bar (to Vincent), and he asks for a reconciliation but she rejects him. He meets Margaret, saying she will get her share of the money, and states that Sharon is now dead to him as he has another plan, which Margaret calls [...] "insane".|$|E
