25|$|In the text, Milton conjectures {{about the}} {{formation}} of commonwealths. He comes up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> constitutionalism but not an outright anti-monarchical argument. He gives a theory of how people come into commonwealths and come to elect kings. He explains what {{the role of a}} king should be, and conversely what a tyrant is, and why it is necessary to limit a ruler's power through laws and oaths.|$|E
25|$|This book {{is about}} four {{children}} whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. But it is most about Peter who was the youngest.

When bilo or salamanga healing rituals are being conducted, the ombiasy may erect a special barrier (kiady) in front of the entrance to the house where the ceremony is being held as an indicator that anyone whose family member has recently died (as well as any foreigner or stranger outside the community) is forbidden to enter for concern about breaking the power of the healing spell.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have often}} noted that Updike imbued {{language}} itself <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> faith in its efficacy, {{and that his}} tendency to construct narratives spanning many years and books—the Rabbit series, the Henry Bech series, Eastwick, the Maples stories—demonstrates a similar faith in the transcendent power of fiction and language. Updike's novels often act as dialectical theological debates between the book itself and the reader, the novel endowed with theological beliefs meant to challenge the reader as the plot runs its course. Rabbit Angstrom himself acts as a Kierkegaardian Knight of Faith.|$|E
25|$|The temazcal, or ritual/purification {{steam bath}} {{is located on}} the east side of the ballgame complex. There is a shallow hole in the center of the area where rocks would be heated then {{sprinkled}} with water to produce steam. From the center of the sauna, there is a drainage ditch to take away excess and dirty water. Only the sunken foundation remains. The part above the surface was most likely constructed of adobe, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a thatched roof.

25|$|On {{the eve of}} 20 August presidential election, Karzai {{seemed at}} once deeply unpopular but also likely to win the {{majority}} of the votes. He was blamed by many for the failures that plagued the reconstruction of Afghanistan after the toppling of the Taliban government in 2001, from the widespread corruption and the resurgence of the (neo-)Taliban to the explosion of the poppy trade. His unpopularity and the likelihood of his victory formed an atmosphere <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> national demoralization, which could discourage many Afghans from voting and dash hopes for substantial progress after the election.|$|E
25|$|Wilmington's {{commercial}} {{importance as}} a major port afforded it {{a critical role in}} opposition to the British in the years leading up to the Revolution. Additionally, the city was home to outspoken political leaders who influenced and led the resistance movement in North Carolina. The foremost of these was Wilmington resident Cornelius Harnett, who served in the General Assembly at the time, where he rallied opposition to the Sugar Act in 1764. When the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act the following year, designed to raise revenue for the Crown <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> tax, Wilmington was the site of an elaborate demonstration against it.|$|E
25|$|The Laas Geel cave {{paintings}} {{are thought to}} be some of the most vivid rock art in Africa.

Besides long-horned cattle, the rock art also shows an image of a domesticated dog, several paintings of canidae as well as a giraffe. The site is excellently preserved due to the location of the paintings which are covered by the granite overhangs.|$|E

25|$|In 1957, the Prime Minister Habib Bourguiba (Habib Abu Ruqaiba) {{abolished}} the monarchy and firmly established his Neo Destour (New Constitution) party. The regime sought {{to run a}} strictly structured regime with efficient and equitable state operations, but not democratic-style politics. Also terminated was the bey, a quasi-monarchist institution dating back to Ottoman rule. Then Bourguiba commenced to dominate {{the country for the}} next 31 years, governing with thoughtful programs yielding stability and economic progress, repressing Islamic fundamentalism, and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation. The vision at Bourguiba offered was of a Tunisian republic. The political culture would be secular, populist, and imbued <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> French rationalist vision of the state at was buoyant, touched with élan, Napoleonic in spirit. Bourguiba then saw an idiosyncratic, eclectic future combining tradition and innovation, Islam with a liberal prosperity.|$|E
25|$|In a Year of Thirteen Moons (In einem Jahr mit 13 Monden, 1978) is Fassbinder most {{personal}} and bleakest work. The film follows the tragic life of Elvira, a transsexual {{formerly known as}} Erwin. In {{the last few days}} before her suicide, she decides to visit some of the important people and places in her life. In one sequence, Elvira wanders through the slaughterhouse where she worked as Erwin, recounting her history amid the meat-hooked corpses of cattle whose slit throats rain blood onto the floor. In another scene, Elvira returns to the orphanage where she was raised by nuns and hears the brutal story of her childhood. Fassbinder's camera tracks the nun (played by his mother) telling Elvira's story; she moves <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> military precision through the grounds, recounting the story in blazing detail, unaware that Elvira had collapsed and can no longer hear it.|$|E
25|$|The Neo Destour regime {{sought to}} run a {{strictly}} structured regime with efficient and equitable state operations, but not with democratic-style politics. In effect, Bourguiba dominated {{the country for the}} next 31 years. He governed with programs yielding stability and economic progress, repressing Islamic fundamentalism, and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation. The political culture would be secular, populist, and imbued <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> French rationalist vision of the state that was buoyant, touched with élan, even Napoleonic in spirit. Bourguiba then saw an idiosyncratic, eclectic future combining tradition and innovation, Islam with a liberal prosperity. Habib Bourguiba has been compared to Ataturk (Mustafa Kemal) of Turkey, as a unique national modernizing leader. Yet, what may be called an inclination to arbitrary methods when making government decisions, and to a kind of personality cult, detracted from Bourguiba's insight and substantial achievements.|$|E

25|$|The {{floor of}} the tank was {{watertight}} due to finely fitted bricks and mud laid on edge <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> plaster and the side walls were constructed in a similar manner. To make the tank even more watertight, {{a thick layer of}} bitumen (waterproof tar) was laid along the sides of the pool and presumably also on the floor. Brick colonnades were discovered on the eastern, northern and southern edges. The preserved columns had stepped edges that may have held wooden screens or window frames. Two large doors lead into the complex from the south and other access was from the north and east. A series of rooms were located along {{the eastern edge of the}} building and in one room was a well that may have supplied some of the water needed to fill the tank. Rainwater also may have been collected for this purpose, but no inlet drains have been found.It had a long bathing pool built with waterproof bricks.|$|E
25|$|Considered {{the most}} {{powerful}} wizard in the world, Dumbledore is benevolent and wise, a good wizard {{in the style of}} Merlin. He almost constantly gives off an aura of serenity and composure, rarely displaying intense emotions of anger or fear. Yet despite his benign nature, it is said that Dumbledore was the only wizard Lord Voldemort ever truly feared. Dumbledore is very eccentric and even slightly effeminate; he is very fond of knitting patterns and frequently wears flamboyant clothing (at one point, he is seen wearing a flowered bonnet). He is also known for his odd displays of whimsicality; he often uses humour to make people feel comfortable in his presence. As a supremely talented wizard, Dumbledore displays numerous examples of extraordinary powers. His abilities as a wizard are combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> cunning and subtlety of mind that allowed him to comprehend human nature and turn the better aspects of humanity (trust, love, and friendship) to Voldemort's disadvantage in particular.|$|E
25|$|Oldenberg (1894) {{surmised that}} the concept of Ṛta {{originally}} arose in the Indo-Aryan period from a consideration of the natural order of the world and of the occurrences taking place within it as doing so <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> causal necessity. Both Vedic Ṛta and Avestan aša were conceived of as having a tripartite function which manifested itself in the physical, ethical and ritual domains. In the context of Vedic religion, those features of nature which either remain constant or which occur on a regular basis were seen to be a manifestation of the power of Ṛta in the physical cosmos. In the human sphere, Ṛta was understood to manifest itself as the imperative force behind both the moral order of society as well as the correct performance of Vedic rituals. The notion of a universal principle of natural order is by no means unique to the Vedas, and Ṛta has been compared to similar ideas in other cultures, such as Ma'at in Ancient Egyptian religion, Moira and the Logos in Greek paganism, and the Tao.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{clothing}} {{was used by}} people during this age, including those made of cotton and silk. People living in hilly and deserted areas wore dresses made of foliage and flowers. Sheaths of grassy weeds (Korai) were used for making dress by the hill and forest area people. Skins of animals and barks of trees were also used. Men of the poorer classes wore only one piece of cloth around the waist. Women covered their upper body <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> dress called, kachchu. Among the higher classes, men wore two pieces: one around the waist and the other, the upper cloth, thrown over the shoulders. Women of sophisticated society wore half sarees, made of the finest cotton and silk fabrics, with embroidery. Both men and women sported long tresses of hair. The diet was plain, rice being the staple cereal, with millet, milk, butter and honey being in common use. Meat eating was common - people ate flesh of rams, deer, hare, fowl, porcupines, pigs and boar, fresh and dried fish. The kind of housing {{was determined by the}} type of geography of the land and the economic status of the occupants. The rich built their houses with tiled roofs and walls made of burnt bricks and mud, while the poor built their huts with mud and thatched it with grass, coconut leaves or palmyra palm leaves. Both in the huts and houses, the flooring was smeared with cowdung. The affluent had houses with porticoes, many storeys, open terraces and furnished their houses well. The inner walls of their houses were decorated with flowers and paintings, with cottages to protect them from the wind. Cots were in common use – the rich had luxurious beds decked with swan’s feathers and flowers, while the common people had beds woven with the straw of maize and the poorest people used beds made of grass or hay.|$|E
