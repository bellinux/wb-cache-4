40|$|Carcass {{quality of}} local sheep fed {{fermented}} rice straws supplemented with soybean oil ABSTRACT. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine if supplementation of soybean oil in the ration in order to increase conjugated linoleic acid of meat has concurrent effects on carcass characteristics and qualities of thin-tailed sheep. Sheep were fed fermented ricestraws supplemented with 0, 3 and 6 % soybean oil. The experimental design used was a Randomized Completely Block Design. Eighteen sheep with initial age of 6 - 8 months and initial bodyweight of 17. 46 ± 1. 61 kg were used. The treatments consisted of soybean oil supplementation 0, 3 and 6 %. Variables measured were carcass conformation, GR thickness, backfat thickness, subcutaneous fat score, and kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> score. Result showed that sheep fed ration with 0 % soybean oil produced carcass with carcass conformation score of 8. 50 ± 1. 05, GR thickness 11. 50 ± 1. 05 mm, back fat thickness 2. 67 ± 0. 82 mm, subcutaneus fat score 3. 50 ± 0. 55 mm, kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> score 2. 00 ± 0. 00. Sheep feed ration with 3 % soybean oil; carcass conformation score 8. 67 ± 1. 21, GR thickness 11. 67 ± 1. 21 mm, back fat thickness 2. 83 ± 0. 98 mm, subcutaneus fat score 3. 50 ± 0. 55, kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> score 1. 83 ± 0. 4. Sheep feed ration with 6 % soybean oil; carcass conformation score 9. 00 ± 1. 26, GR thickness 12. 50 ± 1. 52 mm, back fat thickness 3. 33 ± 0. 82 mm, subcutaneus fat score 3. 50 ± 0. 55, kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> score 1. 83 ± 0. 41. Score of carcass conformation, thickness of GR, thickness of back fat, score of subcutaneus fat, and score of kidney-pelvic fat were not influenced by supplementation of soybean oil. In conclusion, suplementation soybean oil in the ration to increase conjugetaed linoleic acid has no significant concurrent effect on carcass quality characteristics of local sheep...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thirty-two {{imported}} Merino wethers {{of similar}} age were equally assigned to two dietary energy levels (2. 32 and 2. 74 Mcal of ME/kg) and subdivided into two feeding periods (25 and 45 days). All wethers were group-fed at 3 % {{of their body}} weight daily and slaughtered {{at the end of}} each feeding period. The following performance measures and carcass traits were evaluated: average daily gain, feed efficiency, dressing %, kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat,</b> fat thickness, body wall thickness and longissimus dorsi area. The carcass of each wether was boned and proximate analysis was determined. Wethers fed on a high energy diet or those kept for 45 days on feed excelled (P< 0. 05) in the following measurements: final body weight, average daily gain, feed efficiency, dressing percentage, kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> weight, body wall thickness, dissectible lean and fat weights and chemical fat weight in their carcasses.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between abdominal and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> compartments and glucose and lipid metabolism were investigated in early postmenopausal women. Fifty-five healthy, postmenopausal women aged 52 - 53 yr {{participated in the}} study. Fat distribution (intra-abdominal and sc abdominal fat, and intrapelvic and sc <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat)</b> was estimated by computed tomography. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. In a multiple regression analysis, {{the size of the}} intra-abdominal fat compartment was the only significant predictor of insulin sensitivity (r(2) = 24 %; P = 0. 0002). Plasma triglycerides were closely related {{to the size of the}} intra-abdominal fat compartment (r(2) = 26 %; P < 0. 0001), whereas plasma free fatty acid concentrations only correlated to the size of the sc abdominal fat compartment (r(2) = 18. 5 %, P = 0. 001). In early postmenopausal women the amount of the intra-abdominal fat strongly influences insulin sensitivity and plasma triglyceride levels, whereas plasma free fatty acids are closely related to the amount of the sc abdominal fat. Accordingly, from a metabolic standpoint it seems most essential to reduce intra-abdominal fat in postmenopausal women...|$|R

40|$|Summary A genomic {{screening}} {{to detect}} quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting growth, carcass composition and meat quality traits was pursued. Two hundred nineteen microsatellite markers were genotyped on 176 of 620 (28 %) progeny from a Brahman · Angus sire mated to mostly MARC III dams. Selective genotyping, based on retail product yield (%) and fat yield (%), {{was used to}} select individuals to be genotyped. Traits {{included in the study}} were birth weight (kg), hot carcass weight (kg), retail product yield, fat yield, marbling score (400 slight 00 and 500 small 00), USDA yield grade, and estimated kidney, heart and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> (%). The QTL were classified as significant when the expected number of false positives (ENFP) was less than 0. 05 (F-statistic greater than 17. 3), and suggestive when the ENFP was < 1 (F-statistic between 10. 2 and 17. 3). A significant QTL (F 19; ENFP 0. 02) was detected for marbling score at centimorgan (cM) 54 on chromosome 2. Suggestive QTL were detected for fat yield at 50 cM, for retail product yield at 53 cM, and for USDA yield grade at 63 cM on chromosome 1, for marbling score at 56 cM, for retail product yield at 70 cM, and for estimated kidney, heart and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> at 79 cM on chromosome 3, for marbling score at 44 cM, for hot carcass weight at 49 cM, and for estimated kidney, heart and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> at 62 cM on chromosome 16, and for fat yield at 35 cM on chromosome 17. Two suggestive QTL for birth weight were identified, one at 12 cM on chromosome 20 and the other at 56 cM on chromosome 21. An additional suggestive QTL was detected for retail product yield, for fat yield, and for USDA yield grade at 26 cM on chromosome 26. Results presented here represent the initial search for quantitative trait loci in this family. Validation of detected QTL in other populations will be necessary...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the fatty acid (FA) composition of muscle and adipose tissues of Blanca Andaluza goat kids under organic and conventional grazing–based management system. Twenty-four twin kids (12 males, 12 females) were selected from each system. The FA profile was determined in the longissimus thoracis muscle, kidney and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat.</b> The percentages of C 17 : 0, C 17 : 1, C 20 : 1, C 20 : 4 n- 6, C 22 : 2 and several n- 3 FAs were higher in organic meat; C 12 : 0, C 18 : 1 trans- 11, CLA and C 20 : 5 n- 3 were lower in organic meat. The fat depots from the conventional kids showed lower percentages of C 12 : 0, C 14 : 0, C 15 : 0, C 17 : 0, C 17 : 1, C 18 : 3 n- 3 and atherogenicity index, and higher percentage of C 18 : 0.

We also assessed tenderness of 10 external pelvic tender points (EPTP) and of 7 internal pelvic tender points (IPTP). All study participants completed the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Inventory (NIH CPSI).

Conclusion Men with CP/CPPS have more tenderness compared to men without CPPS. Tenderness in men with CPPS is distributed throughout the pelvis and not specific to the prostate. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental model of peritoneal adhesions, in the rat, {{based on two}} relatively minor accidents that may occur during abdominal surgery in man: drying of the serosa, and bleeding. Drying alone had little effect; drying plus bleeding consistently produced adhesions to the dried area. Fresh blood alone produced adhesions between the three membranous structures [omentum and <b>pelvic</b> <b>fat</b> bodies (PFBs) ]. The formation of persistent adhesions required whole blood. Preformed clots above a critical size induced adhesions even without previous serosal injury; they were usually captured by the omentum and PFBs.

The unpaired Student t-test and Mann–Whitney U-test were used to analyze normally and nonnormally distributed continuous data, respectively. Propensity score matching was performed using NCSS software to evaluate the effect of pelvic fracture on mortality and expenditure. Results: Patients with pelvic fracture presented with a longer hospital stay, a higher likelihood of being admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and a significantly higher incidence of mortality (odds ratio [OR] 2. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 3 – 3. 5; P = 0. 003) than those <b>without</b> <b>pelvic</b> fracture.
