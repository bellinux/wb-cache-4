Primary teeth start to form {{in the development of the}} embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth <b>week.</b> <b>If</b> teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.|$|E

According to Svenska Dagbladet, support in 2011 was at 23 percent, and has risen somewhat significantly to 41 percent in September 2015, when only 39 percent of respondents were opposed to NATO membership. An October 2014 survey commissioned by TV4 News also showed slightly more respondents supporting membership than opposing it. In 2014, news that a military expert in Sweden had calculated that the country could hold out for a <b>week</b> <b>if</b> attacked temporarily lifted support for NATO membership in polls. A May 2017 poll by Pew showed that support for membership had risen to 47 percent.|$|E
