5|$|A lack of {{sufficient}} transport aircraft meant that 1st Airborne Division would be dropped in three separate lifts over three successive days. 1st Parachute Brigade {{and most of}} 1st Airlanding Brigade would land on 17 September, 4th Parachute Brigade {{and the rest of}} 1st Airlanding Brigade would land on 18 September, and on 19 September the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade would land, along with a supplies for the entire division. The division would use approximately 650 gliders during the operation, of which 39 would be Hamilcars. It appears that the Hamilcars that had been used by 6th Airborne Division and subsequently abandoned in June had been replaced, as records state that 64 of the gliders were available by September. Thirteen Hamilcars would be flown on 17 September and land in landing zone 'Z'. Eight of the gliders <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> 17-pounder anti-tank guns, their towing vehicles and crews, and the other five <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> ten Universal Carriers, two apiece; the Carriers were to act as transports for the airborne troops. On 18 September fifteen Hamilcars would land in landing zone 'X'; eight <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> a 17-pounder anti-tank gun, their towing vehicles and crews each, and the other four <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> eight Universal Carriers, which would once again act as transport for the airborne troops that were flown in. The final three were packed with ammunition and stores, {{as well as a number}} of sappers from the Royal Engineers; these were experimental loads, as it was believed that the Hamilcar might be a more efficient way of transporting supplies rather than the Horsa due to its larger size. On 19 September, ten Hamilcars would transport American engineers who belonged to the American 878th Aviation Engineer Battalion and their equipment, which included bulldozers, cranes and graders; they were to construct a forward airfield in landing zone 'W' after the gliders had been cleared away.|$|E
5|$|All {{recipes are}} written in the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical form {{that would not have}} been used to address a person of high rank. The instructions were most likely meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E

5|$|An August 1944 study {{anticipated}} that the ships <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> four early warning radars, including height-finders, four surface search radars and eight gunnery/fire-control radars. Historian David Hobbs wrote that they would mount Type 960 early warning, Type 982 intercept, Type 983 height-finding and Type 293M target indication radars. In addition a number of gunnery radars would also be needed.|$|E
5|$|Commandos {{on board}} would then {{disembark}} and use demolition charges to destroy nearby dock installations, searchlights and gun emplacements. The destroyer {{would then be}} blown up. At {{the same time the}} RAF <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> out a number of diversionary air raids in the area. Most of them failed because of heavy clouds and fog and very few bombers.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{postponement}} {{the scale}} of Operation Tsurugi was expanded to include 60 G4Ms carrying 300 naval commandos from the 101st Kure Special Naval Landing Force and 300 Army commandos from the 1st Raiding Regiment. It was planned that 20 G4Ms <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> naval commandos to Guam, another 20 <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> army commandos to Saipan and the remaining 20 would transport a joint Armyâ€“Navy force to Tinian. The revised plan also called for a B-29 to be captured and flown back to Japan. This attack was scheduled to take place between August19 and 23. Allied intelligence became aware of Operation Tsurugi, however, and another carrier attack on Honshu destroyed 29 G4Ms and 20 P1Ys on August9. While the operation was not called off after this raid, it did not go ahead after the Japanese surrender on 15August. The Japanese military also developed a plan to attack Saipan using Mitsubishi Ki-167 suicide aircraft during August, but nothing came of this.|$|E

5|$|Following the C-5 crash, {{and with}} the cause still unknown, the C-5 fleet was {{grounded}} and the MAC airlift was reduced to using C-141s and C-130s; rather than loading as many evacuees as possible, each evacuee required a seat and a seatbelt, {{reducing the number of}} passengers that could be carried on each flight. Each C-141 <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> 94 passengers while each C-130 <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> 75, although these restrictions were relaxed, and then ignored altogether as the pace of the evacuation quickened. Armed guards were also present on each flight to prevent the possibility of hijacking. American commercial and contract carriers continued to fly out of Tan Son Nhut, but with decreasing frequency. In addition, military aircraft from Australia, Indonesia, Iran, Poland, UK, France, and other countries flew in to evacuate their embassy personnel.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Shoup was molded by the {{progressive}} ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives {{fighting against the}} interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude, and his skepticism about American foreign policy, influenced by his small-town background, made him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use of military force. He felt the use of troops for economic or imperialist consideration was wrong, a viewpoint he <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> for his entire career.|$|E
5|$|Germany invaded Poland in {{the early}} morning of 1 September 1939. The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish {{territory}} Britain <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> out its obligations to Poland. When the House of Commons met at 6:00pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader Arthur Greenwood (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler.|$|E

5|$|In 23BC Emperor Augustus became gravely ill and his {{possible}} death {{threatened to}} plunge the Roman world into chaos again.

5|$|Salah {{planned to}} attempt another attack against Budapest on October 8, and al-Mezahi, whose {{battalion}} <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> out the second attempt, took the necessary preparations. The attack was canceled however, due to heavy Israeli aerial attacks against Port Said {{throughout the night}} of October 7/8. The Sa'iqa company continued to hold its positions east of Budapest for four days, until Salah decided to withdraw it due to the casualties it had sustained.|$|E

50|$|The Type IIIA U-boat was {{a planned}} {{minelayer}} {{similar to the}} Type IA U-boat. It {{would have had a}} larger outer hull than the Type IA, and featured a large, watertight cylindrical hangar on the aft deck, which <b>would</b> have <b>carried</b> two small motor torpedo boats.

A British slave ship of the period <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> around 193slaves and it was extremely unusual for a ship of Zong relatively small size to carry so many.|$|E

After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.|$|E
