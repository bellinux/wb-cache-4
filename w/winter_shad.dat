50|$|Today {{the river}} is not {{extensively}} used for navigation. It is {{an important source of}} electric power and public water supplies, as well as recreational use. While the Pee Dee is free-flowing in South Carolina, upstream in North Carolina, several dams have been constructed on it. The opening and closing of these dams causes dramatic swings in the depth of the river in South Carolina. The sharing of water between the two states has sometimes been a matter of controversy, particularly during period of drought. Some commercial fishing is done during the <b>winter</b> <b>shad</b> run, and for shrimp in the lower reaches. The river is excellent for recreational fishing and boating. There are numerous boat landings, yet most of {{the river is}} wild, with forests of tupelo, oak and gum along its shores. Herons and alligators can be seen along the way, and a lucky sighting of a bald eagle is possible.|$|E
50|$|Each {{year the}} college holds a themed ball, a {{scavenger}} hunt, and a satirical college play. Other events include various parties throughout the year, and residents can {{get involved with}} Clean Up Australia Day, tree planting, the ANZAC Day dawn service, World's Greatest <b>Shave,</b> <b>winter</b> sleep outs, movie nights, trivia nights, Relay for Life and various formal dinners.|$|R
60|$|The head {{continued}} so much affected, {{that the}} doctor said the hair must be taken off; which was done by old Master Warren, who singed the horses in the autumn, killed the pigs in the <b>winter,</b> and <b>shaved</b> the men on Saturday night. It {{was a very good}} thing for all parties; and he would take no pay for his trouble, but sent down a pitcher with what he called 'all manner of yarbs' steeping in it, with which, as he said, to 'ferment the boy's limbs.' Foment was what he meant; and Mrs. King thought, as it was kindly intended, and could do no harm, she would try if it would do any good; but she could not find that it made much difference whether she used that or common warm water. However, the good will made Paul smile, and helped to change his notion about its being very few that had any compassion for a stranger. So, too, did good Mrs. Hayward, who, when he was at the worst, twice came to sit up all night with him after her day's work; and though she was not as tender a nurse as Mrs. King, treated him like her own son, and moreover carried off to her own tub all the clothes she could find ready to be washed, and would not take so much as a mouthful of meat or drink in return, struggling, toil-worn body as she was.|$|R
50|$|The {{school year}} {{comes to an}} end and the summer {{holidays}} are about to begin. Ben manages to avoid going on holiday with his parents and instead joins Barney and Jenks and a bunch of other kids on an outdoor adventure holiday in Wales organised by the school. On arrival, they realise it is hardly going to be a holiday, with a sadistic camp instructor - whom they call Grenade-Head - and lousy food, weather and facilities. A couple of snotty public school kids are present are a pain, but there is an exception in a girl, Roz <b>Winters,</b> with partly <b>shaved</b> head and pierced nose, who picks up on and praises the boys' humour. But the holiday takes a turn when Roz mentions the strange locked room in the centre. The boys pull off a daring commando-like raid on the room, and discover a briefcase containing copies of paper-clippings, which show that the head of the centre is in fact a wanted dangerous criminal, They dispose of the case and papers, retaining ‘evidence’ about a supposed midnight rendezvous at a nearby ruined monastery the following Friday. The following evening they even see Morse-code messages being flashed by torch across the nearby lake confirming the meeting. The holiday is due to finish {{at the end of the}} week, with a big trek. Only Ben and Barney venture out in the night to the ruins to try to find out who is due to meet who. On arrival they soon hear the voice of Grenade-Head, followed by singing… and the appearance of Roz. It turns out the voice and singing was all on tape, and the whole set up was a prank played by Roz on the boys. She had been coming to the centre for years, and always playing pranks on others - this was her best yet. The boys congratulate her...until Jenks falls into a canyon breaking his leg.|$|R
40|$|Introduction of {{fish species}} to North American drainages has {{occurred}} for over 100 years. Introduced fish {{species have been}} documented to have adverse effects on both the environment and native species of the drainage into {{which they have been}} introduced. To better understand the effects that introduced species may have on a particular drainage, it is essential to understand aspects of the introduced species 2 ̆ 7 life history. The objectives of the current study is to quantify the age, reproduction, growth, condition and diet of the yellow bass, Morone mississippiensis, in Barren River Lake, Kentucky. Monthly collections from three areas on Barren River Lake were made via a boatmounted electrofisher from March 2008 to March 2009. Fish age was estimated by examining the sagittal otoliths of each individual. Reproductive condition was assessed using the mean gonadosomatic index (GSI) of all sexually mature individuals by month. Yearly growth rates were estimated by computing the mean length at age for each age class and subsequent calculation of the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF). To estimate the condition of yellow bass as it changed throughout the sample period, relative weight of each individual was calculated and the mean monthly relative weight was calculated. To examine the diet of yellow bass, diet items were identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level. Then, dry weight of each diet item was estimated and pooled by season to assess the season changes in the diet of yellow bass. Individuals of age group 3 were the most frequent. Mean GSI was significantly higher in March, April and May of 2008. Calculation of the VBGF yielded 254. 7 mm as the maximum attainable mean total length of yellow bass in Barren River Lake. VBGF predicted mean total lengths of age classes 0 - 8 were as follows: 21. 7 mm, 64. 4 mm, 99. 2 mm, 127. 7 mm, 151. 0 mm, 170. 0 mm, 185. 5 mm, 198. 2 mm, and 208. 5 mm. Relative weight was highest in summer. The diet of adult and sub-adult yellow bass relied heavily on chironomid larvae and pupae throughout the year, although diet item consumption was very low in <b>winter.</b> Young-of-year gizzard <b>shad</b> (Dorosoma cepedianum), however, became the most important adult diet item in the spring and summer. To better understand the impacts that the introduced yellow bass has on the ecosystem of Barren Rive Lake, a multi-year study including an estimation of relative abundance is recommended...|$|R
