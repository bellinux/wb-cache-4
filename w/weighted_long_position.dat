30|$|When the {{relative}} {{performance of the}} short position is better {{than that of the}} <b>long</b> <b>position,</b> this strategy is going to be profitable regardless of stock market regimes. So, a speculator who pairs a <b>long</b> <b>position</b> in a retail stock with a short position in a rival stock or an index ETF could end up with a profit. Pairs trading could be viewed alternatively as a mechanism to hedge both sector and market risks. When there is a financial crisis, two stocks both decline in value; but then the pair trade would result to a gain on the short position and an offsetting loss on the <b>long</b> <b>position.</b> This will yield a profit close to zero in spite of the large market movement. It is clear that this is a self-funding strategy as short sale proceeds may be utilised in creating the <b>long</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new financial product named Bonus Certificates PLUS and we provide detailed descriptions of the product specifications.

We develop a pricing formula to price the certificates. A sample of ten Bonus Certificates PLUS outstanding on December 2007 is presented as an example to examine how well the model fits empirical data. The profitability in the primary market is examined and the results show that issuing Bonus Certificates PLUS is a profitable business. The results are in line with pre-vious studies pricing other structured products. Finally, we simulate and present the sensitivities of the certificates to changes in different pricing inputs...|$|R

The traditional underlying argument is that low correlations of international stock returns make the variance of an international portfolio lower than the variance of a purely domestic portfolio when <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> are taken on the domestic and foreign markets. Our analysis of more than 100 portfolios involving developed and emerging markets shows that correlations are not adequately low to produce effective diversification when <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> are taken.

40|$|Abstract. Pairs {{trading is}} a common {{strategy}} used by hedge funds. It consists of a <b>long</b> <b>position</b> in one asset and a short position in another. When the spread between the two assets is observed {{to be out of}} equi-librium, a <b>long</b> <b>position</b> is taken in the underpriced asset and a short position in the overpriced one. If the spread narrows, both positions are closed, thus generating a profit. If, on the other hand, the spread increases, the position is liquidated at a pre-determined stop-loss level. We study when to optimally liquidate a pairs trading strategy when {{the difference between the two}} assets is modeled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
