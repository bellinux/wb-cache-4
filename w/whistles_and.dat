5|$|Like all cetaceans, {{killer whales}} depend heavily on {{underwater}} sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce {{three categories of}} sounds: clicks, <b>whistles,</b> <b>and</b> pulsed calls. Clicks {{are believed to be}} used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.|$|E
5|$|Musical accompaniment may be {{as simple}} as {{clapping}} hands and stomping feet, but traditional instruments include bells worn by dancers, clappers, drums and talking drums, flutes, horns, rattles, scrapers, stringed instruments, <b>whistles,</b> <b>and</b> xylophones; the exact combination varies with ethnic group and region. Some performers sing complete songs by themselves, accompanied by a harplike instrument.|$|E
5|$|Falkner Island Light {{was chosen}} for fog-signal {{experiments}} in 1865 and in 1902. In 1865, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up bells and <b>whistles</b> <b>and</b> tested the distances they could be heard. In 1879, a steam fog whistle was installed {{at the cost of}} $5000. In 1902, a air siren was installed and powered by two 16½ horsepower engines and used in an experiment in sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet was installed.|$|E

5|$|Like other corvids, ravens can mimic {{sounds from}} their environment, {{including}} human speech. Non-vocal sounds {{produced by the}} common raven include wing <b>whistles</b> <b>and</b> bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If {{a member of a}} pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return.|$|E
5|$|The {{masked shrike}} gives the harsh calls typical of this family, with {{repeated}} tsr, tzr or shek notes and some <b>whistles,</b> <b>and</b> when alarmed produces a rattling krrrr. The bill may be snapped when {{the bird is}} agitated. The song, up to a minute long, is soft for a shrike, with chattering sounds interspersed with rich warbles. It resembles the songs of Hippolais species, particularly the olive-tree warbler. On rare occasions, males may sing in flight.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{distinct}} call types made by Sunda slow loris adults, {{which can be}} divided into two categories: contact and contact-seeking calls such as <b>whistles</b> <b>and</b> short keckers (a social play and attention-seeking call), and aggressive and defensive calls such as long keckers, screams, snarls and grunts. Because they rely on crypsis to avoid predators, they do not make alarm calls. Infants emits clicks and squeaks when disturbed. During estrus, females make whistle calls when in visual contact with a male. When exploring new environments and during handling, it makes ultrasonic vocalisations out of the human hearing range.|$|E

5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and <b>whistles</b> <b>and</b> bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. He said something to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} is a noisy bird. Its song {{consists of}} a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more. Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone <b>whistles</b> <b>and</b> these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man-made noises. The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it has heard only once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next. After this variable section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.|$|E
25|$|All unpitched {{percussion}} {{instruments are}} grouped into the auxiliary percussion subsection, which includes an enormous variety of instruments, including drums, cymbals, bells, shakers, <b>whistles</b> <b>and</b> even found objects.|$|E

25|$|Jim Lockhart (born 3 February 1948), from James's St in Dublin, studied Economics and Politics at University College Dublin. He {{fell under}} the {{influence}} of Seán Ó Riada, wanting to build an orchestral sound out of Irish music. He plays keyboards, pipes, <b>whistles</b> <b>and</b> flute. He did vocals on a select number of songs, mainly in Manx or Irish.|$|E
25|$|After {{the middle}} pre-Classic, ceramic {{sculpture}} {{declined in the}} center of Mexico except in the Chupícuaro region. In the Mayan areas, the art disappears in the late pre-Classic, to reappear in the Classic, mostly in the form of <b>whistles</b> <b>and</b> other musical instruments. In a few areas, such as parts of Veracruz, the creation of ceramic figures continued uninterrupted until the Spanish conquest, but as a handcraft, not a formal art.|$|E
25|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that some specific whistles, called signature whistles, are used by dolphins to identify and/or call each other; dolphins have been observed emitting both other specimens' signature <b>whistles,</b> <b>and</b> their own. A unique signature whistle develops quite early in a dolphin's life, and {{it appears to be}} created in an imitation of the signature whistle of the dolphin's mother. Imitation of the signature whistle seems to occur only among the mother and its young, and among befriended adult males.|$|E

25|$|Real musical instruments, not {{previously}} {{associated with the}} pipe organ, were installed in the pipe chambers to be pneumatically operated at will by the organist. Such instruments as piano, drums, cymbals, xylophone, marimba, orchestra bells, chimes, castanets, wood blocks, and even tuned sleigh bells could be played from the organ keyboards. Sound effects such as train and boat whistles, car horns, sirens, bird <b>whistles,</b> <b>and</b> an imitation of ocean surf {{could be used to}} great effect at appropriate times during a silent film.|$|E
25|$|Wade helps Evans evade his gang, and as {{he finally}} boards the train, congratulates Evans, but Prince appears from behind and shoots Evans despite Wade's order to stop. Wade steps off the train, and when Prince returns his gun belt, {{abruptly}} executes Prince {{along with the rest}} of his gang. William appears and draws his gun on Wade but does not kill him, instead turning to his dying father. Wade boards the train and politely surrenders his weapon. Evans dies as William tells him he accomplished his mission. As the train disappears around a bend, Wade <b>whistles,</b> <b>and</b> his faithful horse pricks up his ears and gallops after the train.|$|E
25|$|A {{full-size}} replica {{steam locomotive}} GWR 3031 Class named The Queen was built at Steamtown, Carnforth, {{and this was}} combined with an ex-South Eastern and Chatham Railway tender and fittings from a GWR tender. The locomotive's bogie and rear wheels are also from another GWR tender, but the large driving wheels are only half complete (the lower half) {{and they do not}} sit directly on the rails. This allowed the locomotive to be rolled into position when the exhibition was built. The replica was completed in December 1982 and delivered by road in January 1983. Two mobile cranes hoisted it onto the viaduct, then it was rolled into position on temporary track. Tussaud's fitted smoke and steam generators so that steam was emitted from the cab, <b>whistles</b> <b>and</b> safety valves, and smoke from the chimney. A sound unit was also fitted.|$|E

25|$|The subway {{opened to}} the public on October 27, 1904, after opening ceremonies the day before {{attended}} by Mayor George B. McClellan, Jr.. More than 15,000 people were issued passes for the first series of rides from the platform. At precisely 2:35p.m., the first subway train departed from City Hall station with Mayor McClellan at the controls. The event was so heavily attended that police Commissioner McAdoo said every policeman in the city was on duty all day and far into the night. At the time of the opening, President A. E. Orr of the Rapid Transit Board requested that all New Yorkers join in the celebration by blowing <b>whistles</b> <b>and</b> ringing bells. At street level, in the pavement in front of City Hall, a plaque can still be seen commemorating groundbreaking for the subway in 1900.|$|E
25|$|The {{third major}} {{industry}} in West Chester {{in the late}} 1800s was the Sharples Separator Works. Philip M. Sharples built a shop in April 1881 and built many different things made out of wood or metal such as farm machinery and steam engines. He began manufacturing cream separators in 1883, which became his most profitable product. In 1889, he {{moved into a new}} factory on Maple Avenue that eventually employed 600 workers and produced 3,700 cream separators annually. After being sued in 1893, Sharples acquired a patent for his cream separator in 1897. Sharples added innovations like electric lighting, fire alarms, and steam <b>whistles</b> <b>and</b> helped transform West Chester into a major industrial hub. By the 1900 census, West Chester's population had expanded to 9,524 and was the largest town in Chester County with approximately 10 percent of its population.|$|E
25|$|On 6 February 2008, the England {{national}} football team took on Switzerland at Wembley Stadium. Before the game, {{pictures of the}} players {{who lost their lives}} at Munich were displayed on big screens, and England players wore black armbands. There was also a tribute to the Busby Babes in the match programme. Originally, a minute's silence was not to have been observed on the day, due to the Football Association's fears that the silence would not be respected by fans of Manchester United's rivals. However, they agreed that a minute's silence should be held. In the event, it was generally well-observed, but a small number of supporters made <b>whistles</b> <b>and</b> cat-calls and the referee cut the silence short after less than 30 seconds. Minute silences were also observed at the Northern Ireland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland games.|$|E
