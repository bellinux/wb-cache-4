40|$|Michelson-Morley type {{experiments}} are {{shown to be}} non-sequitors because their logic fails {{to take into account}} the relationship between <b>wavelenght</b> and propagation velocity. An exper-imental demostration of anisotropy in <b>wavelenght</b> is described. The experimental evidence cited to support the principle of relativity derives mainly from the Michelson-Morley experiment 1 and subsequently variants based on the same logic. That logic fails {{to take into account the}} relationship c = νλ (1) If a source and receiver are comoving, and if c (the speed of light) changes, then λ (the wave-lenght) must also change. The frequency ν cannot change as this would result in a continous increase or diminution of teh number of waves in the path, a circunstance in conflict with thermo-dynamics. It is, therefore, impossible to measure the one-way velocity of light by these means since, for example, if the velocity c were doubled, the <b>wavelenght</b> λ would also be doubled, and some crest would pass two points with the same time lapse as if the two parameters were not doubled. Light pulses generated by choppers of one sort or another behave in the same manner because a pulse is an ensemble of sine waves as taught by Fourier. The methods of Roemer and Bradley to measure the one-way velocity, while valid, are inconvenient to laboratory implementation. Taking either leg of the Michelson-Morley interferometer the round trip transit time may be written as t = L c...|$|E

40|$|We have {{obtained}} the first high-speed photometry of the eclipsing dwarf nova Z Cha at ultraviolet wavelengths with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We observed the eclipse roughly every 4 days over two cycles {{of the normal}} eruptions of Z Cha, giving a uniquely complete coverage of its outburst cycle. The accretion disk dominated the ultraviolet light curve of Z Cha {{at the peak of}} an eruption; the white dwarf, the bright spot {{on the edge of the}} disk, and the boundary layer were all invisible. We were able to obtain an axisymmetric map of the accretion disk at this time only by adopting a flared disk with an opening angle of approximately 8 deg. The run of brightness temperature with radius in the disk at the peak of the eruption was too flat to be consistent with a steady state, optically thick accretion disk. The local rate of mass flow through the disk was approximately 5 x 10 (exp - 10) solar masses/yr near the center of the disk and approximately 5 x 10 (exp - 9) solar masses/yr near the outer edge. The white dwarf, the accretion disk, and the boundary layer were all significant contributors to the ultraviolet flux on the descending branches of the eruptions. The temperature of the white dwarf during decline was 18, 300 K less than T(sub wd) less than 21, 800 K, which is significantly greater than at minimum light. Six days after the maximum of an eruption Z Cha has faded to near minimum light at ultraviolet <b>wavelenghts,</b> but was still approximately 70 % brighter at minimum light in the B band. About one-quarter of the excess flux in the B band came from the accretion disk. Thus, the accretion disk faded and became invisible at ultraviolet wavelengths before it faded at optical <b>wavelenghts.</b> The disk did, however, remain optically thick and obscured the lower half of the white dwarf at ultraviolet and possibly at optical <b>wavelenghts</b> for 2 weeks after the eruption ended. By the third week after eruptiuons the eclipse looked like a simple occultation of an unobscured, spherical white dwarf by a dark secondary star. The center of the accretion disk was, therfore, optically thin at ultraviolet <b>wavelenghts</b> and the boundary layer was too faint to be visible...|$|R

40|$|International audienceData from 53 shot records {{collected}} in a conventional, land, seismic reflection survey are inverted to obtain subsurface maps of short-wavelength variations in elastic parameters (impedance). The inversion method employs a robust, nonlinear, iterative, gradient algorithm which inverts waveform data; thus there is no picking of travel times or amplitudes. The algorithm is also computationnally expensive as it relies heavily upon elastic finite difference modeling. In addition, because a gradient search is employed to minimize the misfit between observed and modeled data, we attempt to solve only the weakly nonlinear problem associated with the short <b>wavelenghts</b> of imedance (information on the short-wavelengths of impedance is mainly derived from amplitude variations of the data). Resolving the long wavelengths of velocity (background) {{is thought to be}} a highly nonlinear problem, at least for waveform inversion, and is not attempted herein. For the inversion of this data set, long <b>wavelenghts</b> have been derived from well logs located along the seismic reflection profile. Although the data set is dominated by unconverted P wave arrivals, we obtain maps of the short <b>wavelenghts</b> of both P impedance and S impedance. Three well logs in the survey area confirm the validity of the P impedance map; however, no S velocity well log are available from this area. There are channel sands of economic interest which have a thickness of approximately 10 m in one well and are very thin or absent in the other two wells. The 10 m occurrence of channel sands is quite visible in both impedance maps. We note that because inversion in three dimensions of a realistically sized data set is simply not possible on present-day computers, all modeling was performed in two dimensions, and a rather crude conversion from spherical to cylindrical energy spreading was applied to the original field data before inversion. Other seismic reflection data in the survey area suggest that there is little lateral variation in the subsurface except for the channel sands; thus we feel that a two-dimensional inversion with energy compensation is justified...|$|R
