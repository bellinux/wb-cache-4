5000|$|The Spanish sparrow or <b>willow</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer hispaniolensis) is a {{passerine}} bird of the sparrow family Passeridae. It {{is found}} in the Mediterranean region and south-west and central Asia. It is very similar to the closely related house sparrow, and the two species show their close relation in a [...] "biological mix-up" [...] of hybridisation in the Mediterranean region, which complicates the taxonomy of this species.|$|E

The usual English name refers to {{the description of the}} species from Spain. The name <b>willow</b> <b>sparrow,</b> referring to the moist habitat of this bird, is sometimes used, especially when the Italian sparrow is considered the same species. The genus name Passer is the Latin for sparrow, and hispaniolensis is New Latin for [...] "Spanish".|$|E
