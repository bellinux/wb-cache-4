Original host and executive consultant for Double Dare 2000 Marc Summers said that [...] "there were issues" [...] with the revival. In an interview with AfterBuzz TV, {{he said that he}} felt the length of the Triple Dare Challenge took away from the game and that [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it the way we originally did it, we would have been fine, but unfortunately, it didn't happen".|$|E
500|$|On Boxing Day {{the glacier}} ascent was at last completed, and {{the march on}} the polar plateau began. Conditions did not ease; Shackleton {{recorded}} 31 December as the [...] "hardest day we have had". On {{the next day he}} noted that, having attained 87°6½′S, they had beaten North and South polar records. That day, referring to Marshall and Adams, Wild wrote: [...] "if we only had Joyce and Marston here instead of those two grubscoffing useless beggars <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it [...] easily." [...] On 4 January 1909, Shackleton finally accepted that the Pole was beyond them, and revised his goal to the symbolic achievement of getting within 100geographical miles of the Pole. The party struggled on, at the borders of survival, until on 9 January 1909, after a last dash forward without the sledge or other equipment, the march ended. [...] "We have shot our bolt", wrote Shackleton, [...] "and the tale is 88°23'S". They were 97.5geographical miles from the South Pole. The British flag was duly planted, and Shackleton named the polar plateau after King Edward VII.|$|E
500|$|Benfica's first {{competitive}} {{game was}} an away Primeira Liga opener against Rio Ave. Sánchez Flores {{did not have}} Reyes, and Jonathan Urretaviscaya started instead. At the Estádio dos Arcos, the home team scored first with a 55th-minute goal from José Semedo. A minute later Benfica evened the score, with Urreta assisting Nuno Gomes for the 1–1 final result. It was the fourth consecutive time that Benfica failed to win their league start. Sánchez Flores said that Rio Ave created unexpected problems: [...] "It was not a easy game. We had a quality opponent, who left us trailing when we were not expecting it." [...] During {{the last week of}} August Benfica brought in Honduran striker David Suazo on loan, sold right-back Nélson Marcos to Betis and was paired with Italian side Napoli in the UEFA Cup first-round draw on 29 August. A day later, Benfica hosted Porto for the first Clássico of the season. The visitors started better, converting a 10th-minute penalty kick for a Kostas Katsouranis foul against Lucho González. In the 56th minute, Cardozo exploited a mistake by Helton to head in the equaliser. Three minutes later Katsouranis was sent off, but Benfica held the tie until the final whistle. Quique Flores said, [...] "It was a good game. In normal conditions <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better, but circumstances made it a little harder." ...|$|E

Critics maintained it was hemorrhaging money, but Newhouse remained supportive, viewing the magazine under Brown as a start-up (which routinely lose money): [...] "It was practically a new magazine. She added topicality, photography, color. She did what <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> if we invented the New Yorker from scratch. To do all that was costly. We knew it would be." [...] Under Brown, its economic fortunes improved every year: in 1995 losses were about $17 million, in 1996 $14 million, and in 1997 $11 million.|$|E

The Prince de Neufchatel was making her first privateering cruise out of a U.S. port with a very small crew of 33 men. Four days out of Boston, she captured the English merchantmen Douglass and took it under tow. On 11 October, and with Douglass still under tow, Prince de Neufchatel met the British 40 gun frigate [...] off the southeastern tip of Martha's Vineyard. Of this battle, Captain Henry Hope of HMS Endymion said, [...] "the extraordinary feature of this affair {{lies in the fact that}} a vessel fitted out at private expense actually frustrated the utmost endeavours of an English frigate, of vastly superior force in guns and men, to capture the privateer. We lost as many men in our efforts to seize the Prince de Neufchâtel as <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> had my ship engaged a regular man-or-war of equal force.
