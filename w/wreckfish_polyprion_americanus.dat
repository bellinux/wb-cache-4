Experimental data showed a global 12. 7 % differentiation among samples mainly due to divergence among three different gene pools: North Atlantic, South Atlantic and Oceania.

40|$|The <b>wreckfish</b> <b>Polyprion</b> <b>americanus</b> is a {{component}} of directed and admixed species fisheries throughout its world range and has recently been identified for its aquaculture potential. Several wreckfish broodstocks were founded in Galician hatcheries {{in the last decade}} and are now approaching maturity. The combination of genetic markers with classic domestication strategies is a pertinent approach to preserve genetic variation and to slow down consanguineous-derived adverse effects. Genetic data from microsatellites used to characterize four Galician wreckfish stocks provide evidence of both, a significant interstock differentiation (7. 60 %) and a pronounced loss of allele diversity (26 %) in 80 % of the stocks. Such artificial sub-structuring linked to the erosion of gene diversity is most likely caused by sampling drift that stepped up from the North Atlantic population. Computer simulation of relatedness helps to appraise alternate breeding protocols to avoid uncontrolled inbreeding within stocks. We show that under a fixed number of breeders and a sex balanced contribution, two protocols consisting on randommatingamong broodstocks (ΔRxy= 2. 21 %) or enhancedwith a wild sample (ΔRxy= 0. 97 %), are far more advantageous strategies to slow inbreeding in F 1 and F 2 than breeding protocols within stock (ΔRxy= 6. 6 %).

40|$|The bass groper <b>Polyprion</b> <b>americanus</b> {{is a large}} {{demersal}} teleost (> 1. 5 m) that inhabits deep continental and oceanic island slopes (50 to 1000 m). Currently, {{this species}} is considered Critically Endangered by the IUCN {{and there is a}} moratorium on its capture in Brazil. Fishing for this species is no longer commercially viable in Bermuda and they are fully protected in South Africa. In most other locations, this species is rarely encountered and knowledge of its biology and catch history is limited. In the present study, specimens were collected from recreational and commercial catches (n = 151) in the southeastern Indian Ocean from 2005 to 2012. Otolith edge analysis was used to verify that a single opaque zone was deposited annually from May to September. A maximum age of 78 yr for females and 55 yr for males was determined from thin transverse sections of otoliths. The spawning period of this gonochorist was from autumn to early winter (March to June) and partitioned prior to that of the sympatric congener P. oxygeneios (June to September). The lengths and ages at which 50 % of females and males matured were 944 and 808 mm total length, and 14. 4 and 11. 2 yr, respectively. The exceptional longevity, slow growth and late maturation of P. americanus imply a high inherent vulnerability at relatively low levels of exploitation.

During four baited lander deployments carried out in the Bari Canyon (Southern Adriatic Sea, Central Mediterranean), at depths of 443 – 788 m, about 43 h of video records were taken, for a total of 619, 200 video frames. A total of 12 benthopelagic fish species (five chondrichthyes and seven osteichthyes) were identified. The blackspot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo) was the most often observed fish species. The depth of 787 m represents a new depth record for this fish in the Adriatic Sea. Groups of up to 40 individuals of P. bogaraveo were attracted to the bait and were shown in single frames. The individuals were observed both exploring the area and feeding actively on the bait. The European conger (Conger conger) was recorded at each deployment. Clear scavenger behaviour was also observed in this teleost fish and in the shark Etmopterus spinax. The shark species Centrophorus granulosus and Hexanchus griseus, which are considered ‘vulnerable’ on the published IUCN Mediterranean Regional Red List, were also recorded but, although attracted by the bait, they were never seen feeding on it.

Two types of "megahabitat" characterized by the virtual absence of fishing were explored. One was characterized by complex topography including mesohabitats with carbonate mounds and corals. The other type of megahabitat, although characterized by complex topographic features, lacks carbonate mounds and corals. The fishing vessel was equipped with a 3, 000 m monofilament longline with 500 hooks and snoods of 2. 5 m in length. A total of 9 hauls, using about 4, 500 hooks, {{were carried out}} both in the coral megahabitat and in the non-coral megahabitat during each survey. The fish Leucoraja fullonica and Pteroplatytrygon violacea represent new records for the SML coral province. The coral by-catch was only obtained in the coral megahabitat in about 55 % of the stations investigated in both surveys. The total catches and the abundance indices of several species were comparable between the two habitat typologies. The species contributing most to the dissimilarity between the two megahabitat fish assemblages were Pagellus bogaraveo, Galeus melastomus, Etmopterus spinax and Helicolenus dactylopterus for density and P. bogaraveo, Conger conger, <b>Polyprion</b> <b>americanus</b> and G. melastomus for biomass. P. bogaraveo was exclusively collected in the coral megahabitat, whereas C. conger, H. dactylopterus and P. americanus were found with greater abundance in the coral than in the non-coral megahabitat. Differences in the sizes between the two megahabitats were detected in E. spinax, G. melastomus, C. conger and H. dactylopterus.

Trap fishing gears were also utilised as another alternative fishing gears. The main objective of the exploratory survey was to improve the knowledge of the distribution and the population structure of the species target of the survey: Groupers (Epinephelus spp.), Kingclip (Genypterus blacodes), Brazilian sandperch (Pinguipes spp.) and other accompanying species. Some preliminary results of this exploratory survey are shown in this current work. Fishery and biological data were collected by scientific observers on board of the two vessels which took part in the exploratory fishing. The collected data were date, time, position, depth, SST, SBT, weather condition, catches, discards, length distributions, sex, maturity, stomach fullness… among others. Length distributions, sex ratio and maturity stage of the most abundant species in the catch are also shown. Catch, effort and CPUE by area, gear and depth strata were analysed. Regarding bottom longline gear, the most abundant species were Dogfish shark (Squalus sp), <b>Wreckfish</b> (<b>Polyprion</b> <b>americanus),</b> Tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus) and Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) in waters shallower than 200 m depth. Regarding Traps fishing gears, the most abundant species were crabs (Family Geryonidae) and Argentine conger (Conger orbignyanus) ...|$|E
40|$|Predation on Illex argentinus (Cephalopoda, Ommastrephidae) in {{southern}} Brazil (26 °S to 34 °S) was studied from {{its presence in}} contents of over 14 000 stomachs from 63 potential predator species including fishes, cephalopods, penguins and marine mammals. The size composition of I. argentinus in the diet of their main predators was estimated using regression equations that relate mantle length and body weight to beak size. The short-finned squid {{was found in the}} diet of 32 species and appears {{to play an important role}} in the trophic relations along the upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters, where it was found in the diet of the swordfish Xiphias gladius, the tunas Thunnus obesus, T. alalunga and T. albacares, and the <b>wreckfish</b> <b>Polyprion</b> <b>americanus.</b> These five species stand for more than half of the landings from the upper slope demersal and oceanic pelagic fisheries in the region. On the shelf, where the dominant squid was Loligo sanpaulensis, Illex argentinus was only occasionally found in the diet of a few neritic predators. In southern Brazil, overall predation was more intense on subadults and adults of the winter-spring spawning group on the upper slope and oceanic adjacent waters, differently from its southern range along Uruguay and Argentina waters where the short-finned squid is abundant on the shelf and is preyed upon mainly by the demersal fish assemblage...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The recent {{development}} of deep-water fisheries off Brazil is reviewed from biological, eco-nomic, and political perspectives. This {{process has been}} centered in the southeastern and southern sectors of the Brazilian coast (19 °- 34 °S) and was motivated by the overfishing of the main coastal resources and a gov-ernment-induced vessel-chartering program. Shelf break (100 - 250 m) operations by national hook-and-line and trawl vessels intensified in the 1990 s. Around 2000 - 2001, however, foreign-chartered longliners, gillnet-ters, potters, and trawlers started to operate in Brazilian waters, leading the occupation of the upper slope (250 - 500 m), mostly targeting monkfish (Lophyus gastrophysus), the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), the Bra-zilian codling (Urophycis mystacea), the <b>wreckfish</b> (<b>Polyprion</b> <b>americanus),</b> the Argentine short-fin squid (Illex argentinus), the red crab (Chaceon notialis), and the royal crab (Chaceon ramosae). Between 2004 and 2007, chartered trawlers established a valuable fishery on deep-water shrimps (family Aristeidae), heavily ex-ploiting the lower slope (500 - 1000 m). Total catches of deep-water resources varied annually from 5, 756 ton in 2000 {{to a maximum of}} 19, 923 ton in 2002, decreasing to nearly 11, 000 ton in 2006. Despite intensive data collection, the availability of timely stock assessments, and a formal participatory process for the discussion of management plans, deep-water stocks are already considered to be overexploited due to limitations of govern-ance...|$|E
40|$|Polyprion oxygeneios (hapuku) is an {{important}} commercial and recreational fishery species within New Zealand. Moreover, P. oxygeneios are currently being developed as a high-value New Zealand aquaculture species. There have been no previous studies on New Zealand’s P. oxygeneios that {{have been able to}} detect genetic differences among samples, which may be of use to either broodstock or fisheries managers. An understanding of the genetic structure of commercially harvested species maximises the potential for sustainable harvesting through effective management schemes. The primary goal of this thesis was to investigate the population genetic structure of P. oxygeneios using molecular markers to analyse samples collected from sites within New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The DNA sequence of the whole mitochondrial genome of P. oxygeneios was determined and it showed a similar structure and gene organisation to that of other species across a wide range of taxa. A set of species-specific control region primers was developed for P. oxygeneios and <b>Polyprion</b> <b>americanus,</b> and additional primers were designed for the 16 S and ND 6 genes of P. oxygeneios. A ~ 488 bp portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence from 274 individuals, and genotypes from 259 individuals using nine polymorphic microsatellite loci, were used to investigate the phylogeography and population genetic structure of P. oxygeneios. The mitochondrial DNA data failed to detect any significant differentiation between sample sites. However, the microsatellite DNA analyses showed that individuals sampled from the west coast of the South Island (Hokitika) were genetically distinct from individuals sampled at all other New Zealand sites. These two groups might be representative of two discrete populations of P. oxygeneios within New Zealand’s EEZ. These results suggest that the west coast South Island P. oxygeneios fishery should continue to be managed as a separate stock, with some possible revision of the Cook Strait fishery required. Analyses of the mtDNA and microsatellite DNA data of P. oxygeneios broodstock held at NIWA’s Bream Bay Aquaculture Park showed that they were not significantly differentiated from the wild populations (excluding Hokitika). Simulations also described the appropriate sampling efforts required to capture an appropriate level of genetic diversity when either establishing a new broodstock or supplementing an existing broodstock with new individuals. Continued management of the broodstock will be required to maintain the high levels of genetic diversity that have been captured in the founding broodstock in future generations...|$|R
40|$|The Argentinean short-finned squid, Illex argentinus, is {{distributed}} along {{the shelf and}} slope in the western South Atlantic from 22 ° to 54 °S. Since 1977 catches by a local and an international fleet increased by two orders of magnitude from c. 7 000 to > 700 000 t y-l. The species {{is associated with the}} Subtropical Convergence of the Brazil and Falkland (Malvinas) Currents. Three or four stocks are identified: the summerspawning stock (SSS), the south patagonic stock (SPS), the Bonaerensis-northpatagonic stock (BNS) and the southern Brazil stock (SBS), which may be a northern continuation of the BNS. Surveys of the shelf and adjacent oceanic waters from 29 ° to 54 °S have covered most of the year. Mature and spawned specimens, and rhynchoteuthion paralarvae of I. argentinus, have been found in summer over the northern Patagonian Shelf and in winter and spring from 29 ° to 38 °S, mainly off the Río de la Plata and along southern Brazil. Evidence suggests that the SPS, which supports the major fishery, makes a spawning migration northward to the confluence of the Brazil and Falkland (Malvinas) Currents, and paralarvae are subsequently carried to the confluence. The life span of I. argentinus is c. one year. Females grow faster and reach a larger size than males, and there is evidence that within a cohort, specimens hatching in warmer conditions have higher overall growth rates. Mantle length at maturity ranges from 142 to 250 mm for males and from 195 to 330 for females. Squid from the SSS are the smallest at maturity and those from the SPS are the largest. Potential fecundity could be as high as 750 000 in the largest females if spawning is intermittent and all eggs that attain a major axis of > 0. 05 mm at first maturity undergo complete vitellogenesis and are released. Crustacea are the major prey of I. argentinus {{in the southern part of}} the species range and fish increase in importance towards the north. It is preyed on by the most abundant demersal fishes of the patagonian Shelf. Off Argentina and Uruguay Merluccius hubbsi is a major competitor with I. argentinus for Engraulis anchoita as well as being predator and prey at different ontogenetic stages. In southern Brazil it is preyed upon by various species of tuna and the serranid <b>Polyprion</b> <b>americanus.</b> Future research should focus on the biology of the early ontogenetic stages, on gene flow among stocks and on the impact of the fishery for I. argentinus on other commercial species...|$|R
