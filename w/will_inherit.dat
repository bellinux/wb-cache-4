5|$|Cattle {{heterozygous}} for the F94L myostatin mutation have a 50% {{probability of}} passing the mutation to their progeny. Because the mutation has greatest effect on carcase traits, only 50% of progeny of a heterozygous parent <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> increased muscling {{associated with the}} mutation.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of Pokémon breeding, Pokémon are assigned {{to one or two}} breeding groups. When a male and female Pokémon that share at least one breeding group are left at a Pokémon Daycare, they may produce an egg, which will hatch into a young Pokémon. The young Pokémon <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> the species of its mother, and moves from its father. However, legendary Pokémon, among certain other species, cannot breed.|$|E
5|$|In {{a quaint}} rural village, {{an elderly man}} {{receives}} a card in the mail from his youngest grandson, Yogesh (Harman Baweja). In Mumbai, Yogesh's family consults an astrologer to learn if their eldest son, Jitu (Dilip Joshi), a debtor, will go to jail, and also give him Yogesh's birthdate to learn his future. They are astonished to hear that Yogesh <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> a fortune if he is married on the 20th of that month; the phone rings, and the family is overjoyed to hear that Yogesh's grandfather has made him his sole heir.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Krabs {{attempts}} to interest Pearl in {{working at the}} Krusty Krab—their family business—but {{she does not want}} to work there until she graduates from high school, believing it would negatively affect her social life. Despite this, she manages the Krusty Krab when Mr. Krabs cannot, and fills in for other employees when needed. She <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> the restaurant and her father's fortune when she grows older. Being a sperm whale, Pearl has the largest brain of any Bikini Bottom resident and is gifted in math. Mr. Krabs has tried to use this to his own advantage and wants Pearl to eventually become a bookkeeper for his restaurant.|$|E
5|$|On his deathbed, Mr. Dashwood {{tells his}} son {{from his first}} marriage, John, {{to take care of}} his second wife and three daughters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, since they <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> nothing. John's greedy and snobbish wife Fanny convinces him to give his half sisters {{practically}} nothing financially; John and Fanny immediately install themselves in the large house, forcing the Dashwood ladies to look for a new home. Fanny invites her brother Edward Ferrars to stay with them. Elinor and Edward soon form a close friendship, but Fanny haughtily tells Mrs. Dashwood that Edward would be disinherited if he married someone of no importance with no money. Mrs. Dashwood understands her meaning completely.|$|E
5|$|Pearl is {{a teenage}} sperm whale {{who lives in}} an anchor with her greedy father Mr. Krabs, {{the founder of the}} popular Krusty Krab {{restaurant}}. Pearl <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> the restaurant and become its owner when she grows older. She is currently employed at the town shopping center, the Bikini Bottom Mall. The identity and whereabouts of Pearl's unseen mother have never been explained directly by the characters. While supplemental materials indicate her father married a whale who gave birth to Pearl, Hillenburg is strongly against revealing this in an episode.|$|E
50|$|Faced {{with these}} symptoms, the second doctor {{suspected}} strychnine poisoning {{and refused to}} sign the death certificate. A postmortem was subsequently performed by the acting District Surgeon, Dr. Fergus. The {{cause of death was}} certified to be chronic nephritis and cerebral hemorrhage. Daisy Cowle, the sole beneficiary of her husband's <b>will,</b> <b>inherited</b> £1795.|$|R
5000|$|William Brugge (mentioned in his <b>will).</b> <b>Inherited</b> his father's {{lands in}} Brakenborowe and Horton.

50|$|In patrilineal societies, sons <b>will</b> customarily <b>inherit</b> {{an estate}} before daughters.|$|R
5|$|The next day, Bart {{plans to}} reveal what he witnessed, but Seymour and Edna {{fear that they}} would be fired if anyone found out and they swear him to secrecy. They hire him as their gofer so they can {{secretly}} exchange messages. Bart agrees for a while because the reward for his cooperation is that Milhouse <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> Bart's poor school record. Eventually, Bart grows frustrated about his home, school and social life continually being interrupted to help them advance their relationship, putting him in embarrassing situations. One afternoon at school, after he is embarrassed in front of his classmates by having to say one of Seymour's messages to Edna out loud, Bart bitterly gathers the entire school in front of a janitor's closet and he opens the door to reveal that Seymour and Edna are making out.|$|E
5|$|Both {{inside and}} outside battle, characters' {{relationships}} can be developed through interactions {{on and off the}} battlefield. As the strength of their relationships grow, certain abilities in battle are also strengthened. A feature introduced in Genealogy of the Holy War and used in later titles was an aspect of relationships. A man and woman who fall in love will have a child, and that child <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> certain skills and stats from them. One of the recurring features in the series is permanent death, a function in which units defeated in battle are permanently removed {{from the rest of the}} game with very few exceptions (the main character, a character pivotal to the main story). Up until Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem: Heroes of Light and Shadow, there was no option to disable permanent death. In New Mystery of the Emblem, a new Casual Mode was added, in which characters that died were revived at the end of a battle. Fates also added Phoenix Mode, in which characters slain during one turn are revived on the player's next turn. Another inclusion from Fates includes 'My Castle', a customisable castle that serves as the player's base of operations throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Heritable {{traits are}} passed from one {{generation}} to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism. However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci (multiple interacting genes).|$|E
50|$|By 1526 he {{was married}} to Isabel Lyster or Lister, {{daughter}} of Richard Lyster of Rowton, Shropshire. She survived him and acted as an executor of his <b>will,</b> <b>inheriting</b> half of his residual property. Thomas and Isabel Bromley left one daughter, Margaret. As there was no male heir the greater part of Bromley's property ultimately passed to Margaret.|$|R
25|$|Set in Auckland, New Zealand it centres on a self-centred lawyer, Will Carrington (Toby Sharpe), and {{the unusual}} family unit he is thrust into {{following}} {{the death of his father}} David, (Roy Billing). <b>Will</b> <b>inherits</b> half a stately house, half a racing greyhound with its live in trainer, Marty (Mick Innes), and guardianship of his estranged half-sister Lily (Susana Tang).|$|R
50|$|Occasionally, all {{chromosomes}} <b>will</b> be <b>inherited</b> {{from one}} parent. As a result, recessive traits can be expressed.|$|R
5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} hybrid vigour. These advantages are observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E
25|$|In the novel, Cedric is {{the eldest}} son since Edmund died and thus, <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> Rutherford Hall. In this version, Alfred is {{the eldest son}} after Edmund, and <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> the Hall; Harold is the second-eldest son (He becomes next-in-line to inherit the Hall after Alfred dies) and Cedric is the {{youngest}} son.|$|E

25|$|The Spiti Bhot {{community}} has an inheritance {{system that is}} otherwise unique to the Tibetans. Upon the death of both parents, only the eldest son <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> the family property, while the eldest daughter inherits the mother's jewellery, and the younger siblings inherit nothing.

25|$|Other Christians {{understand}} the soul as the life, {{and believe that}} the dead are sleeping (Christian conditionalism). This belief is traditionally accompanied by {{the belief that the}} unrighteous soul will cease to exist instead of suffering eternally (annihilationism). Believers <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> eternal life either in Heaven, or in a Kingdom of God on earth, and enjoy eternal fellowship with God.|$|E
25|$|Currently, MODY is {{the final}} {{diagnosis}} in 1%ndash&2% of people initially diagnosed with diabetes. The prevalence is 70–110 per million population. 50% of first-degree relatives <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> the same mutation, giving them a greater than 95% lifetime risk of developing MODY themselves. For this reason, correct diagnosis of this condition is important. Typically patients present with a strong family history of diabetes (any type) and the onset of symptoms is in the second to fifth decade.|$|E
25|$|Norrie {{disease is}} a genetic {{disorder}} caused by mutations in the NDP gene, located on Xp11.4 (GeneID: 4693). It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. This means that almost only males are affected. Sons of affected men {{will not have the}} mutation, while all of their daughters will be genetic carriers of the mutation. They also usually show no clinical symptoms, but <b>will</b> <b>inherit</b> the mutation to 50% of their offspring. Daughters receiving the mutated gene will also be, like their mother, asymptomatic carriers, but 50% of their sons will express clinical symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, Batman {{is presumed}} dead and is honored as a hero.
