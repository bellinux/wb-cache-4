5|$|In 1867, Clark {{became the}} third {{president}} of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (MAC), now the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He {{was the first to}} appoint a faculty and admit a class of students. Although initially successful, MAC was criticized by politicians and newspaper editors who felt it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of funding in a state that was growing increasingly industrial. Farmers of western Massachusetts were slow to support the college. Despite these obstacles, Clark's success in organizing an innovative academic institution earned him international attention.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Matchbox toys {{he played}} with as a child, Posehn {{decided to make the}} size of the game sprites {{resemble}} toys. Posehn contacted his friend, Tim Calvin, to assist with designing and creating the vehicle sprites. Though Calvin was a practising dentist at the time, he also had experience with 3D modelling. He rendered 3D models on a computer and reduced them to the desired size. Different views were obtained by rotating the models along a single axis. Calvin added colour to the sprites to meet the production staff's specifications; most required black, white, red, and blue, as well as four shades of colours like green and brown. Calvin eventually felt the rendering process <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of resources and attempted to create sprites on the pixel level himself without 3D models. The developers, however, preferred the sprites created from the models over Calvin's freestyle ones.|$|E

25|$|Disillusionment {{with the}} {{traditional}} political parties in general had been the impetus behind Reform's initial growth, but that growth was now felt to have stalled. Its {{claims to be a}} populist and Western protest party came under attack in 1997, when Manning accepted an offer to live at Stornoway, the official residence provided to the leader of the Official Opposition. Manning had previously said that Stornoway <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of taxpayer money and that he would not reside there.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{continuing}} the Amiens battle {{past the point}} of initial success, as had been done so many times in the past, the Allies shifted their attention elsewhere. Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.|$|E

It is the oldest case to result in charges in Lehigh County's history. On October 7, Snuka's lawyers agreed to forego a preliminary hearing, which the prosecution contended <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of court resources, given the thorough grand jury investigation. In return, they received transcripts and other evidence from that investigation, which defense attorney Robert J. Kirwan II said would be much more helpful in preparing Snuka's case than a hearing would have been.|$|E

25|$|When World War I {{broke out}} on 4 August 1914 No.9r was nearly ready for erection, and despite {{competing}} demands for materials and manpower for other projects, construction continued {{during the first}} months of the war. However, there was a feeling that the project was no longer favoured by the Admiralty: Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty was known to be unenthusiastic about airships, and on 12 March 1915 he cancelled the order for the ship. The reasons given for this decision were that it was expected that the war would be finished in 1915, and that the vessel would not be operational by then and thus <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of valuable resources.|$|E
25|$|When the Daughters of Bilitis or the Mattachine Society had a convention, {{the news}} was reported. The {{magazine}} compiled {{some of the first}} statistics about lesbians in the United States by sending their readership questionnaires, the first in 1957 and again in 1963. There was a marked difference in the tone of the magazine after Barbara Gittings heard Frank Kameny speak at the national DOB convention that attempting to find the cause of homosexuality <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of time since it was equal to heterosexuality. Many articles from 1956 to 1963 focused on ways to function in an overwhelmingly homophobic world, but gradually articles began to appear that were unapologetic in promoting lesbianism.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, Gold and 35 other {{delegates from}} New York City {{appeared}} at the convention and demanded to be recognized. The Credentials Committee refused to seat them, even though the Joint Board represented about 85 {{percent of the total}} IFWU membership. AFL President Green—tired of the constant conflict in New York City, believing Shachtman and the leadership of the IFWU were incompetent, and convinced that fighting the Joint Board <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of money—persuaded Shachtman to at least let Gold and the other Joint Board delegates speak before the convention to make their case. Gold delivered an impassioned speech in which he denounced the attacks on the political views of the Joint Board's leadership, argued that the union should be spending its money building solidarity and fighting employers, and pushed for strong internal democratic procedures in the IFWU. But despite his pleas, the convention refused to seat the delegates, and then revoked the charters of the locals which comprised the Joint Board.|$|E

25|$|Pétain {{wrote that}} German barrages were being fired daily, which made {{infantry}} attacks almost impossible and that varying French bombardments to obtain surprise made little difference, {{now that the}} German artillery had been reinforced and was ready at a moment's notice to begin barrage fire. German guns were registered on no man's land and had only to fire into the area to hit French infantry during an attack. The French counter-battery effort {{had to wait until}} German guns revealed themselves and then begin area fire near the German artillery, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of ammunition. Pétain wanted more air reconnaissance but aircraft wireless was of extremely short range and during attacks, confusion on the ground made artillery observation from the air impossible. As an alternative, Pétain suggested making highly detailed maps of the German rear areas and systematically bombarding German artillery emplacements continuously, rather than during attacks but the suggestions were impractical, {{due to the lack of}} ammunition.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Parsons and Smith brought Fertig some {{unpleasant}} orders from MacArthur's headquarters. The American Army {{was willing to}} provide radios and other equipment for Fertig's command, but these were only {{to be used for}} passing information on Japanese activities, from coastwatchers and other sources, to Australia. The guerrillas were ordered not to engage in offensive activities against the Japanese. Fertig admitted that gathering intelligence was an important mission that he would support. However, due to the numerous atrocities that the Japanese were committing against the Philippine population, the only way that Fertig could continue to recruit and maintain a guerrilla force was to aggressively attack the Japanese when and where the guerrillas had a chance of winning, so as to provide the Filipinos an outlet for revenge against the Japanese. Fertig stated that if he ordered his men to stop killing the Japanese, then his men would follow other leaders who would probably not be willing to cooperate with MacArthur's headquarters and its directives. In addition, General Charles A. Willoughby, MacArthur's Chief of Intelligence, was convinced that providing the guerrillas with arms and ammunition <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of resources. If a regular U.S. Army had been defeated by the Japanese in the Philippines, then no irregular force could do better. The guerrillas' only purpose was to provide intelligence and later, if fully equipped prior to the return of American forces to the Philippines, to fight as regular forces under the command of American officers.|$|E

500|$|However, {{interest}} in metaphysics – the philosophical {{investigation of the}} nature of the universe and existence – had become unfashionable by the time Whitehead began writing in earnest about it in the 1920s.

500|$|On August 3, 1964, Congress passed {{legislation}} {{providing for the}} striking of 45 million silver dollars.

The law had been passed at the urging of the Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield (Democrat–Montana), who represented a state that heavily used silver dollars.
