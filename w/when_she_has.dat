5|$|Screaming mouths {{appears in}} many of Bacon's works from the late 1940s to the early 1950s.

Bacon kept a close-up still of the screaming nurse, at the moment <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> {{been shot in the}} eye. He referred to the still in paintings throughout his career.|$|E

5|$|A month later, Jennifer is {{beginning}} to look pale, so she accepts a date with school goth/emo Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. At home, she finds Jennifer in her bedroom. Jennifer kisses her, initiating a brief makeout session, and soon explains what happened after the fire: Low Shoulder took her {{into the woods and}} offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not a virgin. As a result, when lead singer Nikolai murdered her, the ritual backfired and a demonic spirit took over her body. Unbeknownst to Needy, Jennifer also encountered Indian exchange student Ahmet after the fire and, upon hearing that no one knew he had survived, took him into the woods and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, making her rather difficult to kill.|$|E

With Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to Miami and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named Trevor Slattery, who says he is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin, using Slattery as a cover.

Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked.

5|$|Rhys treats Susan <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> an MS relapse and {{he tries}} {{to make sure she}} is {{prepared}} in case her condition becomes worse.

5|$|Some {{people of}} the Carnivàle are closely related. Apollonia and Sofie are {{introduced}} as mother and daughter working as fortunetellers. Sofie grew up not knowing her father, but has {{a vision of the}} Tattooed Man raping her mother later in the first season. In the season 2 opening episode, Management, the mysterious leader of the carnival, reveals himself as Lucius Belyakov, the Russian soldier of Ben's dreams. Moments before his death several episodes later, Belyakov learns that his son Alexei (Brother Justin) did not die in a train accident, as he had previously believed. In the meantime, Sofie has become the Crowes' maid. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a chat with Iris about her childhood, Iris has a vision of Brother Justin as a young man raping Apollonia during his seminary studies in Saint Paul. Although Iris only informs Norman of her suspicions, Sofie sees Brother Justin's tattooed chest in the final episode of season 2 and has implicit visions insinuating Brother Justin as her father. Future seasons of Carnivàle would have expanded the Belyakov genealogy, making a fusion with the Scudder genealogy possible.|$|E
5|$|Debra {{turns up}} unexpectedly, {{claiming}} she is homeless, but reveals she {{is planning to}} move to Greece <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> enough money and says Whitney can come with her. Whitney accepts, but later realises that Debra is using her and she is only there to hide from someone. Debra later tells Whitney she has a half-brother, Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott).

During the trial Whitney learns that Tiffany is Ricky's daughter. She is initially distressed, but accepts that Tiffany is still her sister although they are not related. She repairs her friendship with Todd, and they kiss at Ricky and Bianca's engagement party. Their reunion is short-lived, and Whitney breaks up with him in favour of Bianca's half-brother Billie Jackson (Devon Anderson). Whitney is attacked by Billie's jealous friend Kylie (Elarica Gallacher), and when his friends cause trouble at a grime night at The Queen Victoria pub (The Vic), Whitney asks him to choose between her and his former gang.

25|$|Mamoru also {{demonstrates}} a spiritual connection with Usagi: he can detect <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> transformed into Sailor Moon. Early {{on in the}} anime series, before they become friends, this connection forcibly transforms Mamoru into Tuxedo Mask {{so that he can}} protect her. In later episodes, he seems to have control over his transformations, although he still shows up shortly after the start of most of the battles, no matter how far away from the developing situation.|$|E

The dominant image in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem The Lady of Shalott, which is at least partly based upon Malory's story, is depicted in a painting by the Pre-Raphaelite painter John William Waterhouse, and is one that gives expression to a mythical idea that is far older than Sir Thomas Malory.|$|E

25|$|Calendar-based methods use {{records of}} past menstrual cycles {{to predict the}} length of future cycles. However, {{the length of the}} pre-ovulatory phase can vary significantly, {{depending}} on the woman's typical cycle length, stress factors, medication, illness, menopause, breastfeeding, and whether she is just coming off hormonal contraception. If a woman with previously regular cycles has a delayed ovulation due to one of these factors, she will still be fertile when the method tells her she is in the post-ovulatory infertile phase. If she has an unusually early ovulation, calendar-based methods will indicate she is still in the pre-ovulatory infertile phase <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> actually become fertile.|$|E

His marriage to Crystal is also strained <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> an affair. Crystal's uncle Maximus the Mad uses technology to cause Quicksilver to become psychotic. This drove him to frame the Avengers for treason as his perceptions are twisted to perceive them as having 'betrayed' him, forcing them to escape the government-sponsored Freedom Force, and then deal with Quicksilver's new 'team' of LMD-based duplicates of the Zodiac, until the Vision convinces Pietro to stand down by showing him images of his newborn nephews.|$|E

He orders that Saturninus be given a state burial, that Tamora's body be thrown to the wild beasts outside the city, and that Aaron be buried chest-deep and left to die of thirst and starvation. Aaron, however, is unrepentant to the end, regretting only that he had not done more evil in his life.|$|E
