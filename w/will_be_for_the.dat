25|$|When {{the parties}} express a clear {{intention}} in a choice-of-law clause, {{there is a}} rebuttable presumption {{that this is the}} proper law because it reflects the parties' freedom of contract and it produces certainty of outcome. It can only be rebutted when the choice is not bona fide, it produces illegality, or it breaches public policy. For example, the parties may have selected the particular law to evade the operation of otherwise mandatory provisions of the law which has the closest connection with the contract. The parties are not free to put themselves above the law and, in such cases, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> parties to prove that there is a valid reason for selecting that law other than evasion.|$|E
25|$|Understanding {{the motion}} of the canter is {{important}} if a person wants to ride the horse with a balanced, secure, yet flexible seat. To the rider, the horse's back feels as if it is moving both up and down as well as somewhat back and forth, not unlike {{the motion of}} a swing. When the hind legs engage (which occurs just before beat one), the horse raises its head and neck as its hind leg steps under. As the legs push off the ground (beats 1 and 2) the head and neck of the horse drops. When the leading leg (beat 3) touches the ground, the head and neck are as low as they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stride, and then they begin to come back up as the horse places its weight on its leading leg. During the suspension phase, the head and neck continue back to the highest point as the hind legs come back under the body.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, {{a playoff}} was {{introduced}} in season 2005–2006. It is used to determine which teams from the Eredivisie qualify for European football. The playoff system has been criticized by clubs, players and fans {{as the number of}} matches will increase. Under the original playoff format, it was possible, though thoroughly unlikely, that the runner-up would not qualify for Europe; the following year, the format was changed so that the second-place team was assured of no worse than a UEFA Cup berth. Starting in 2008–09, the format was changed yet again. The champion goes directly to the Champions League; the runner-up enters the second qualification round of the CL; the number three enters the fourth (and last) qualification round of the UEFA Europa League (EL; the new name of the UEFA Cup from 2009–10 onward) and the number four goes to the third qualification round of the EL. The only play-off <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> clubs placed 5th through 8th. The winner of that play-off receives a ticket for the second qualification round of the EL.|$|E

25|$|There {{are eight}} {{boarding}} houses, nine {{including the one}} no longer in operation, on the campus. The houses are run by a small team of teachers. The House Master (HM) has overall responsibility and is helped by the Assistant House Master (AHM). Either or both of these will be present at the daily house meeting and will oversee homework to make sure pupils are studying. The HM will organise any special house events, decide who the house captain <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> term as well as choosing a captain {{to take care of}} other house related goings on. The HM is also the person who most pupils would talk to if they had a problem although all teachers are available for help. Both the HM and the AHM normally have residences within the houses and so are very much part of the house. Each house has a matron who helps the pupils through their daily routine as well as a tutor to help the pupils in their studies. The year a pupil is in, and the amount of rooms in the house decides which pupils are allowed a room of their own, although it is normally decided that younger years share whilst senior pupils get their own rooms. All pupils rotate rooms each term.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{necessary}} for a trademark owner to take enforcement action against all infringement {{if it can be}} shown that the owner perceived the infringement to be minor and inconsequential. This is designed to prevent owners from continually being tied up in litigation for fear of cancellation. An owner can at any time commence action for infringement against a third party as long as it had not previously notified the third party of its discontent following third party use and then failed to take action within a reasonable period of time (called acquiescence). The owner can always reserve the right to take legal action until a court decides that the third party had gained notoriety which the owner 'must' have been aware of. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> third party to prove their use of the mark is substantial as it is the onus of a company using a mark to check they are not infringing previously registered rights. In the US, owing to the overwhelming number of unregistered rights, trademark applicants are advised to perform searches not just of the trademark register but of local business directories and relevant trade press. Specialized search companies perform such tasks prior to application.|$|E

500|$|Blanchard had {{performed}} regularly at the Tivoli Gardens, making ascents {{twice a week}} {{when she was in}} Paris. She had been warned repeatedly of the danger of using fireworks in her exhibitions. This display was to be a particularly impressive one with many more pyrotechnics than usual, and it appears that the warnings had made an impression on her. Some spectators implored her not to make the ascent, but others, eager to see the show, urged her on. One report suggested that she finally made up her mind and stepped into her chair with the words [...] "Allons, ce sera pour la dernière fois" [...] ("Let's go, this <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last time").|$|E
500|$|Writer Jon Spaihts created David as a {{shipboard}} android in {{the first}} draft of his screenplay for the prequel Alien: Engineers, as an exploration of the theme of creations and being in the presence of one's makers. Just as the humans aboard the Prometheus look to discover the secrets of their creators, the Engineers, David is already in the presence of his creators. Unlike his companions and android successors, David would be disillusioned by his creators and look to fashion himself into an entity defying their nature. Scott was in favor of the concept and urged writer Damon Lindelof to pursue it further while rewriting the script that would be adapted as Prometheus. Though David would perceive the concept of the Prometheus expedition to be frivolous, due to his disappointment in his creators, he would nonetheless be fascinated by the notion of creation. Therefore, the character's treacherous actions in the films, such as infecting the archaeologist Charlie Holloway with an alien mutagen, would be from a desire to create a new evolutionary generation of his own. Shortly after the release of Alien: Covenant, Scott explained that as David learns more about his lineage through humanity and the Engineers, [...] "He hates them. He has no respect for Engineers and no respect for human beings," [...] and concludes that eradicating them from existence <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> betterment of the universe.|$|E
