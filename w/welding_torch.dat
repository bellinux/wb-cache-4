5|$|Another popular {{method of}} growing {{synthetic}} diamond is {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD). The growth occurs under low pressure (below atmospheric pressure). It involves feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves, hot filament, arc discharge, <b>welding</b> <b>torch</b> or laser. This method is mostly used for coatings, but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size (see picture).|$|E
5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques. A related process, plasma arc welding, uses a slightly different <b>welding</b> <b>torch</b> {{to create a more}} focused welding arc and as a result is often automated.|$|E

5|$|Outside a {{protective}} atmosphere and magnetic field, {{there are few}} obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 106eV up to an extreme 1020eV of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of electrons is only about 1% of that of protons. Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers. According to astronauts, like Don Pettit, space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an arc <b>welding</b> <b>torch.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} <b>welding</b> <b>torch</b> nozzle {{depends on}} the amount of {{shielded}} area desired. The size of the gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E

50|$|The use {{of oxygen}} in gas-flame operations, such as metal welding, cutting and brazing {{is one of}} the most {{significant}} and common applications of this gas. Oxygen allows generating high-temperature flame in <b>welding</b> <b>torches</b> thus ensuring high quality and speed of work performance.|$|R
25|$|A <b>welding</b> <b>torch</b> head {{is used to}} weld metals. It can be {{identified}} by having {{only one or two}} pipes running to the nozzle, no oxygen-blast trigger, and two valve knobs {{at the bottom of the}} handle letting the operator adjust the oxygen and fuel flow respectively.|$|E
25|$|An {{emergency}} brake {{consisting of a}} piece of steel, around 1.5 inches thick and 18 inches long, which hangs under the car and is pushed into the track slot (the opening through which the grip reaches the cable) when the gripman pulls a lever.

25|$|The {{gasoline}} is fed either from a pressurised tank (whose pressure can be hand-pumped or fed from a gas cylinder). OR from a non pressurised tank with the fuel being {{drawn into the}} torch by venturi action by the pressurised oxygen flow. Another low cost approach commonly used by jewelry makers in Asia is using air bubbled through a gasoline container by a foot-operated air pump, and burning the fuel-air mixture in a specialized <b>welding</b> <b>torch.</b>|$|E
50|$|A flint spark lighter (sometimes {{just called}} a spark lighter, striker, or flint lighter) {{is a type}} of lighter used in many {{applications}} to safely light a gaseous fuel to start a flame. It is most commonly used for bunsen burners and oxyacetylene <b>welding</b> <b>torches.</b>|$|R

On March 20, 2010, the use of <b>welding</b> <b>torches</b> to remove the collapsed crane sparked a rooftop fire. The damage from the fire was minor, {{and there were no}} injuries.|$|R
25|$|Its {{abilities}} and overall appearance varied greatly during the classic series. The name implies that it operates {{through the use}} of sound waves to exert physical forces on objects remotely. During the Second Doctor's tenure, it functioned much as its name implied—using sonic waves to dismantle equipment or to bypass locks. In addition, it was used as a <b>welding</b> <b>torch</b> in Episode Five of The Dominators. In the audio commentary for The Sea Devils, Michael Briant claims to have suggested it as a one-off gadget in 1968.|$|E
25|$|On 27 June 2007, the Somerfield {{store in}} the Precinct was {{completely}} gutted in a fire during which the roof collapsed. Only a few shoppers suffered minor injuries. The fire was reportedly {{the result of an}} accidental ignition, after a <b>welding</b> <b>torch</b> being used to repair flood damage had been left ignited. The fire started at 13:10 on 27 June and was not extinguished until 23:30 the same day. All the shops in The Pavements were closed and evacuated. Other areas including the Market Hall were later evacuated as cordons were placed {{as a result of the}} smoke becoming worse.|$|E
25|$|At 14:30 on 9 February 1942, sparks from a <b>welding</b> <b>torch</b> used by Clement Derrick {{ignited a}} stack of life vests filled with {{flammable}} kapok that had been stored in the first-class lounge. The woodwork {{had not yet been}} removed, and the fire spread rapidly. The ship had a very efficient fire protection system, but it had been disconnected during the conversion and its internal pumping system was deactivated. The New York City fire department's hoses, unfortunately, did not fit the ship's French inlets. Before the fire department arrived, approximately 15 minutes after fire broke out, all onboard crew were using manual means in a vain attempt to stop the blaze. A strong northwesterly wind blowing over Lafayettes port quarter swept the blaze forward, eventually involving the three upper decks of the ship within an hour of the start of the conflagration. Capt. Coman, along with Capt. Simmers, arrived about 15:25 to see his huge prospective command in flames.|$|E

50|$|To improve weld purging on {{the front}} side of welds, a {{trailing}} shield can be attached to manual or automatic <b>welding</b> <b>torches</b> to follow behind as the weld is being made. In this way, the weld is kept under an inert gas shield for longer than normal, giving an improved weld quality, while allowing the welder to weld faster.|$|R
500|$|Manual gas {{tungsten}} arc welding {{is a relatively}} difficult welding method, due to the coordination required by the welder. [...] Similar to torch welding, GTAW normally requires two hands, since most applications require that the welder manually feed a filler metal into the weld area with one hand while manipulating the <b>welding</b> <b>torch</b> in the other. Maintaining a short arc length, while preventing contact between the electrode and the workpiece, is also important.|$|E
500|$|The {{level of}} heat input also affects weld quality. [...] Low heat input, caused by low welding current or high welding speed, can limit {{penetration}} and cause the weld bead to lift {{away from the}} surface being welded. If {{there is too much}} heat input, however, the weld bead grows in width while the likelihood of excessive penetration and spatter increase. Additionally, if the <b>welding</b> <b>torch</b> is too far from the workpiece the shielding gas becomes ineffective, causing porosity within the weld. This results in a weld with pinholes, which is weaker than a typical weld.|$|E
500|$|The {{first stage}} {{accelerated}} the missile at over 100g, reaching Mach 10 {{in a few}} seconds. At these speeds, aerodynamic heating caused the airframe's outer layer became hotter than an oxy-acetylene <b>welding</b> <b>torch.</b> The required acceleration required a new solid fuel mixture that burned ten {{times as fast as}} contemporary designs such as the Pershing or Minuteman. The burning fuel and aerodynamic heating together created so much heat that radio signals were strongly attenuated through the resulting ionized plasma around the missile body. It was expected that the average interception would take place at about [...] at a range of [...] after 10 seconds of flight time.|$|E
30|$|Laser Pilot MTF is a seam finder {{and can be}} used in robotic welding {{applications}} {{which involve}} a series of short welds, as commonly found in the automotive industry, that do not require real-time tracking, although correct placement of the <b>weld</b> <b>torch</b> {{in the beginning of the}} weld is needed. MTF uses a standard interface for communication to the robot controller.|$|R
50|$|Aliens: Colonial Marines is a first-person shooter {{which puts}} the {{player in the}} role of a United States Colonial Marine named Cpl. Christopher Winter. The player has access to iconic weapons from the movie such as the flamethrower, pulse rifle, smartgun, shotgun, pistol, and robotic sentry turrets.

50|$|In 1947, a fire {{broke out}} in the Musée des Beaux-Arts and devastated a {{significant}} part of the collections. This fire was an indirect consequence of the bombing raids of 1944: because of the destruction inflicted on the Palais Rohan, humidity had infiltrated the building, and moisture had to be fought. This was done with <b>welding</b> <b>torches,</b> and a bad handling of these caused the fire.|$|R
500|$|The CVD growth {{involves}} substrate preparation, feeding varying {{amounts of}} gases into a chamber and energizing them. The substrate preparation includes choosing an appropriate material and its crystallographic orientation; cleaning it, {{often with a}} diamond powder to abrade a non-diamond substrate; and optimizing the substrate temperature (about [...] ) during the growth {{through a series of}} test runs. The gases always include a carbon source, typically methane, and hydrogen with a typical ratio of 1:99. Hydrogen is essential because it selectively etches off non-diamond carbon. The gases are ionized into chemically active radicals in the growth chamber using microwave power, a hot filament, an arc discharge, a <b>welding</b> <b>torch,</b> a laser, an electron beam, or other means.|$|E
500|$|A novel {{feature of}} the game is its array of gadgets, often {{disguised}} as ordinary female fashion objects. For example, lipsticks double as various explosives, perfume bottles hold materials such as sleeping gas, a barrette also functions as a lockpick and poison dagger, sunglasses can be used for photographing evidence and detecting land mines, and a stylish belt buckle hides a zipcord inside it. Other over-the-top gadgets include a body-removing powder for disposing of incriminating corpses, a robotic poodle to distract guard dogs, and a rocket launcher disguised as a briefcase. An ordinary coin can be thrown to confuse enemies, giving the player the opportunity to sneak by without a guard noticing. A cigarette lighter can also be used as a miniature <b>welding</b> <b>torch.</b> These ingenious gadgets come from UNITY's gadget lab, led by its main inventor and scientist, Santa. [...] "Santa's Workshop" [...] continuously works on these covert gadgets, and provides Cate with them as the game progresses.|$|E
500|$|The basic {{technique}} for GMAW is quite simple, since the electrode is fed automatically through the torch (head of tip). By contrast, in gas tungsten arc welding, the welder must handle a <b>welding</b> <b>torch</b> {{in one hand}} and a separate filler wire in the other, and in shielded metal arc welding, the operator must frequently chip off slag and change welding electrodes. GMAW requires only that the operator guide the welding gun with proper position and orientation along the area being welded. [...] Keeping a consistent contact tip-to-work distance (the stick out distance) is important, because a long stickout distance can cause the electrode to overheat and also wastes shielding gas. Stickout distance varies for different GMAW weld processes and applications. The orientation of the gun is also importantit should be held so as to bisect the angle between the workpieces; that is, at 45 degrees for a fillet weld and 90 degrees for welding a flat surface. The travel angle, or lead angle, is the angle of the torch with respect to the direction of travel, and it should generally remain approximately vertical. However, the desirable angle changes somewhat depending on the type of shielding gas usedwith pure inert gases, the bottom of the torch is often slightly in front of the upper section, while the opposite is true when the welding atmosphere is carbon dioxide.|$|E
50|$|The {{general term}} “Sensors for Arc Welding” denotes devices which - {{as a part}} of a fully {{mechanised}} welding equipment - are capable to acquire information about position and, if possible, about the geometriy of the intended weld at the workpiece and to provide respective data in a suitable form for the control of the <b>weld</b> <b>torch</b> position and, if possible, for the weld process parameters.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the melted}} metal flows {{out of the}} workpiece, there must be room on the {{opposite}} side of the workpiece for the spray to exit. When possible, pieces of metal are cut on a grate that lets the melted metal fall freely to the ground. The same equipment can be used for oxyacetylene blowtorches and <b>welding</b> <b>torches,</b> by exchanging the part of the torch in front of the torch valves.|$|R
5000|$|Many torches now use a hose-supplied gas feed, {{which is}} often mains gas. They may also have a forced-air supply, from either an air blower or an oxygen cylinder. Both of these larger and more {{powerful}} designs are less commonly described as blowtorches, while the term blowtorch is usually reserved for the smaller and less powerful self-contained torches. The archaic term [...] "blowpipe" [...] is sometimes still used in relation to oxy-acetylene <b>welding</b> <b>torches.</b>|$|R
