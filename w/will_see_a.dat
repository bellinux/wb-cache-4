This has happened because of the advent of television. Burrakatha is a long-format art form. The point we are making is that if we don't protect these folk arts, they will be on their way out.|$|E

The Chaplain is available to provide spiritually supportive counseling, life review and may connect a patient with clergy they are comfortable with. At times the hospice Chaplain will officiate at a patient's funeral.|$|E
5|$|On July 25, 2013, a {{tentative}} deal was announced which <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> 20,000-25,000 seat stadium built at Buzzard Point costing $300 million. Following votes by the D.C. Council {{to approve the}} plan, it {{was signed into law}} on December 30, 2014. Under the July 2013 deal, the District of Columbia was to have obtained a portion of the necessary Buzzard Point property from the developer that owned it, in exchange for cash and a government building. D.C. United would kick the $150 million needed to construct the stadium on the city-owned land, which it would rent for 20 to 35 years. Under the deal as revised by D.C. City Council in December 2014, the city would instead pay fair market value for the developer's land, and use eminent domain if a deal could not be reached.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Oslo had two stations, {{the larger}} Oslo East Station (or OsloØ, {{located at the}} spot of the current OsloS) and Oslo West Station (OsloV), which served the Drammen Line. This caused a {{physical}} barrier between the {{two parts of the}} railway network, only connected by the Oslo Port Line which ran partly in city streets. Formal planning of a central station and a tunnel connecting the Drammen Line to OsloØ started in 1938, and the final plans were approved in 1968. The Oslo Tunnel opened on 1 June 1980, and made it possible to close OsloV in 1989. Nationaltheatret saw a major upgrade in 1999, when it was expanded to four tracks, and from 2008 to 2010, the tunnel <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> major technical upgrade. There are plans to build a second tunnel to increase train capacity west of Oslo.|$|E
5|$|Flying foxes {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe netting products <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E
5|$|The National Library of Somalia was {{established}} in 1975, and came under {{the responsibility of the}} Ministry of Education, Culture and Higher Education. In 1983, it held approximately 7,000 books, {{little in the way of}} historical and cultural archival material, and was open to the general public. The National Library later closed down in the 1990s. In June 2013, the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies organized a shipment of 22,000 books from the United States to Somalia as part of an initiative to restock the library. In December of the year, the Somali authorities officially launched a major project to rebuild the National Library.

5|$|The wet, or rainy, {{season is}} the time of year, {{covering}} one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location {{during the middle of the}} warm season. When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly.|$|E
