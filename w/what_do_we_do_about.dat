After Hannam's story Marshall rushed to advise staff by email that, CSIRO's climate models [...] "are {{among the best in}} the world", and contributed to proving global climate change. In his email, Marshall wrote: [...] "That question has been answered, and the new question is <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it, and how can we find solutions for the climate we will be living with?" [...] The Director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, UNSW Australia, Professor Andy Pitman, who is trying to secure new government funding for his climate center of excellence, described this assertion as [...] "among the most ill-informed statements I have ever heard from a senior executive." [...] Other experts rallied to vigorously challenge the underpinning logic of CSIROs proposed changes prompting Marshall to issue an official statement on 8 February alleging [...] "incorrect reporting by media". In his statement Marshall claimed that CSIRO's plans had been misrepresented and, although Marshall claimed that the CSIRO would retain the ability to support climate measurement in Australia, he nevertheless defended the decision to reduce climate change modeling and measurement to increase mitigation and adaptation: [...] "No one is saying climate change is not important, but surely mitigation, health, education, sustainable industries, and prosperity of the nation are no less important." [...] In defending his decisions, Marshall told the ABC [...] "I guess I had the realisation that the climate lobby is perhaps more powerful than the energy lobby was back in the '70s - and the politics of climate I think there's a lot of emotion in this debate", adding [...] "In fact it almost sounds more like religion than science to me" [...] Marshall later apologized for his reference to religion at the start of a subsequent Senate Estimates hearing.|$|E

5000|$|Kierkegaard {{challenges}} {{the reader with}} the question, [...] "Do {{you know what the}} discourse is about?" [...] Paul had been given Roman citizenship as a gift from God, he had been given this challenge of trying to guide an infant church into existence along with others chosen by Christ. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the positive gifts we have been given by God? These gifts become thorns if you don't use them. Martin Luther had commented about thorns much in the same way Kierkegaard does here when he wrote to his wife, [...] "Thou mayest tell M. Philipps to correct his postil. He never understood why our Lord, in the gospel, calls riches thorns. Here is the school to learn that. But I shudder to think that thorns, in the Scripture, are always threatened with fire. Wherefore I have the greater patience, if haply, by the help of God, I may be able to bring some good to pass." [...] (Martin Luther, To His Wife 1546) [...] Kierkegaard was grateful for the free gift of intellectual ability, imagination, and dialectical skills and he took these gifts as gifts that should be used in the service of God. Is it better to examine your own positive qualities or the negative qualities associated to your own self? Can knowledge become a thorn in the side? Here is how he said it in 1847 and then 1848, [...] Christ learned obedience from what he suffered-what he suffered when he who possesses the blessing was like a curse for everyone who came near him and for everyone who avoided him, an affliction for his contemporaries, like an affliction for those few who loved him, so that he had to wrench them out into the most terrible decision, so that for his mother he had to be the sword that pierced her heart, for the disciples a crucified love; an affliction for the vacillators, who basically perhaps in the hiddenness of a secret desire grasped the truth of his words but did not dare to join him but for that very reason also kept a thorn in their souls, a split in their inner being, a painful mark of having been his contemporaries; an affliction for the wicked, that he by his purity and holiness had to expose their hearts and make them guiltier than ever. What heavy suffering: to have to be the stumbling stone in order to be the Savior of the world! Soren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits 1847 Hong 1993 p. 254An observer will perceive how everything was set in motion and how dialectically: I had a thorn in the flesh, intellectual gifts (especially imagination) and culture in superabundance, an enormous development as an observer, a Christian upbringing that was certainly very unusual, a dialectical relationship to Christianity which was peculiarly my own, and in addition to this I had from childhood a training obedience, obedience absolute, and I was armed with an almost foolhardy faith that I was able to do anything, only one thing excepted, to be a free bird, though but for a whole day, or to slip out of the fetters of melancholy in which another power held me bound. Finally in my own eyes I was a penitent. The impression this now makes upon me is as if there were a Power which form the first instant had been observant of this and said, as a fisherman says of the fish, Let it run awhile, it is not yet the moment to pull it in. And strangely enough there is something that reaches back in my recollection, impossible as it is for me to say when I began this practice or why such a thing ever occurred to me: I prayed to God regularly, every day, that He would give me zeal and patience to perform the work He would assign me. Thus I became an author. *Soren Kierkegaard, The Point of View of My Work as an Author Lowrie translation, 1939, 1962 p. 82-83 ...|$|E

There is no Heisenbergian uncertainty that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{has become one of}} the most ominous medical challenges of the 21 st century.

So, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it and how do we do it? It makes a lot of sense to sort out what has been done in the field of AD so far and how we might learn from prior failures. The time, effort, and bil-lions of dollars spent by industry in the last twenty years searching for a pharmaceutical nostrum to pro-vide questionable palliation to patients who may not be aware of their surroundings has not helped in the battle to limit the number of people affected by AD. These nostrums, which are charitably called ‘cogni-tive enhancers’, do no such thing, not even in treating mild cognitive impairment or slowing-down conver-sion to AD [1]. The ethical imperative of this tactic is nothing less than a cruel approach to Alzheimer vic-tims and their care-takers.

40|$|In York Region, {{there is}} a growing {{awareness}} of the problem of youth homelessness. In the past many people saw it as a ‘big city’ problem, more likely to occur in places like downtown Toronto or Vancouver. But we now know from research that the factors that drive youth to become homeless are not isolated in big cities, but are also present in urban, suburban and rural areas. This is most certainly true of York Region. The question then becomes, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it? This report is the culmination of a community engagement process led by United Way York Region and supported by the Canadian Observatory on Homelessness. The goal of this initiative is the development of a more coordinated and integrated systems response to youth homelessness, one designed to support families and help young people stay in their communities, stay in school, and grow into an adulthood characterized by happiness, well-being and opportunity. The Leaving Home report presents the findings from the research project that was conducted over the summer of 2013 with 60 young people from York Region who had experienced homelessness, {{as well as a number}} of service providers. Informed by emerging Canadian and international practices, key recommendations are also presented.

40|$|There are two {{problems}} {{in the market for}} developing country debt: one is the immediate crisis. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the large volume of outstanding debt? A more subtle but no less important problem is that because contracts are un-enforceable and lenders have incomplete information about risk, capital is mis-allocated. This article examines the latter problem and reviews the nature and causes of the unenforceability. It shows that unenforceability results in higher interest rates on smaller and shorter-term loans than would otherwise be avail-able and discourages investment in developing countries. Similarly, unenforce-ability can explain the perverse timing of capital flows to developing countries, causing credit to flow into the country when income is high, and out when income is low. The article then analyzes the risk associated with three types of information asymmetries: information about the borrowers ' ability to repay, willingness to repay, and use of the loan proceeds. These asymmetries, the author argues, reinforce the effects of unenforceability. The prospects for remedying the immediate crisis are discussed, as is the need to be certain that the proposed solutions do not aggravate these problems. G overnments regularly intervene in credit markets in an attempt to rec-tify market failures. The U. S. government, for example, guarantees loans for students {{on the assumption that the}} market will provide too little credit for investment in human capital.

40|$|After reading 2 ̆ 2 Context and Culpability in Adolescent Violence, 2 ̆ 2 it is {{extremely}} difficult to deny the case that Professor Jeffrey Fagan has made for the integral nature of violence in the lives of adolescents—especially young males—in the inner city. Professor Fagan makes clear that violence is not only a daily occurrence in the lives of these young people, but he also explains persuasively that participation in violence is practically unavoidable. Professor Fagan 2 ̆ 7 s work demonstrates that violence is 2 ̆ 2 normative 2 ̆ 2 in the lives of inner city adolescents in many contexts. This means that in many cases violence by inner city teens is typical. Demonstrating the typicality of inner city teen violence is only the first part of Professor Fagan 2 ̆ 7 s thesis, as the demonstration inevitably leads to the next question. Once we are convinced that violence is normative for adolescents in many contexts, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it? Professor Fagan explores in part IV of his essay one potential answer: The possibility of excuse from criminal liability in cases where it can be shown that violence is a typical and predictable response for teens in certain contexts. He concludes that a case can be made for excusing these teens from criminal liability. Excusing a criminal offender because of his 2 ̆ 2 rotten social background 2 ̆ 2 (RSB) is not a novel concept. The notion gained prominence about twenty-five years ago. Thus, in making his case, Professor Fagan covers some familiar ground. But, importantly, Professor Fagan adds something new to the argument that revives the debate surrounding the excuse. Specifically, he constructs an argument for the validity of considering an offender 2 ̆ 7 s background in detennining whether the offender should be excused...|$|E
