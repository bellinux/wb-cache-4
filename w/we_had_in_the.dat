In the final cut of the film, however, most of the music was chosen by Sollett, editor Myron Kerstein and music supervisor Linda Cohen. Sollett said that he [...] "got lucky" [...] with the songs {{that he was able}} to choose because, within the financiers and the studio, [...] "there was nobody in that group who knew all that much about music or the music that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film".

[...] On November 5 a 125-page letter was sent from the Central Committee of the CPSU to its Chinese counterpart ignoring the existence of Albania as a socialist country and [...] "malign the Party of Labour of Albania." [...] Later noting this letter in regards to China, Hoxha wrote that, [...] "They distributed this voluminous material against China before the meeting, in order to prepare the terrain and to brainwash the delegations of other parties, and to intimidate the Chinese, to compel them to take a moderate stand, if they would not submit. This anti-Chinese material did not surprise us, but it strengthened the conviction <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> correctness {{of the line and}} the Marxist-Leninist stands of our Party in defence of the Communist Party of China." ...|$|E
