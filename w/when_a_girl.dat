5|$|A human {{going into}} an ala’s house, which is {{frequently}} {{deep in a}} forest, but may also be in the clouds, in a lake, spring, cave, gigantic tree, or other hidden remote place, or on an inhospitable mountain, can have varied consequences. If he approaches the ala with an appeal, and does not mention the differences between her and humans, he will be rewarded. Otherwise, he will be cruelly punished. According to one story, a stepdaughter, driven away from home by her stepmother, comes to an ala’s house; addresses her with the word mother; picks lice from the ala’s hair full of worms; and feeds the ala’s “livestock” of owls, wolves, badgers, and other wild animals; behaving and talking as if these things are quite normal to her, and is rewarded by the ala with a chest filled with gold. When the stepmother’s daughter comes to the ala’s house, she does the opposite, and the ala punishes her and her mother by sending them a chest of snakes, which blind them. In another example, when a prince asks an ala for her daughter’s hand, she saves him from other ale, and helps him get married. But <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> to whom an ala is the godmother visits the ala with her mother, the ala eats them both because the mother talked about the strange things in her house.|$|E
25|$|Today many non-Orthodox Jews {{celebrate}} a girl's bat mitzvah {{in the same}} way as a boy's bar mitzvah. All Reform and Reconstructionist, and most Conservative synagogues have egalitarian participation, in which women read from the Torah and lead services. In Orthodox communities, a Bat Mitzvah is celebrated <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> reaches the age of 12.|$|E
25|$|Some Islamic {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} it is not the calendar age that matters, rather it is the biological age of the girl that determines when she can be married under Islamic law. According to these Islamic scholars, marriageable age in Islam is <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> has reached sexual maturity, as determined by her nearest male guardian; this age can be, claim these Islamic scholars, less than 10 years, or 12, or another age depending on each girl.|$|E

He was unconscious for seven days and walked with braces for several months; because of this incident, Fred developed an extreme fear of hospitals and became prone to fits of rage.

25|$|Utagawa Kuniyoshi made Okabe about 1844 which {{depicts the}} death of Buddha. In recounting {{the death of}} Buddha, cats are {{supposed}} to be the only animals that not to weep. In Kuniyoshi's time, it was believed that <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> visited a temple after dark, she took the risk of being greeted by an old woman who would offer her to stay the night. Once inside the house, the old woman would become a witch and devour her. Therefore, a cat around temples could be the witch in a cat form.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> reaches menarche, she {{is held in}} the lap {{by adults}} in a ritual similar to that at birth. She is then {{partially}} secluded for some time, being covered with woven palm-leaf mats. After seclusion, she is cut with broken glass, and charcoal is rubbed into the wound to create a set of linear parallel tattoo marks. Men who have had sexual relations with her prior to menarche also undergo ritual purification at this time. Women keep their hair cut short and wear seed and tooth necklaces as tribal ethnic identifiers.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} part of a child's psychosocial environment is the family, and most of the social influence research has investigated features of family structure and function in relation to earlier or later female puberty. Most of the studies have reported that menarche may occur a few months earlier in girls in high-stress households, whose fathers are absent during their early childhood, who have a stepfather in the home, who are subjected to prolonged sexual abuse in childhood, or who are adopted from a developing country at a young age. Conversely, menarche may be slightly later <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> grows up in a large family with a biological father present.|$|E
25|$|Black bears feature {{prominently}} in the stories of some of America's indigenous peoples. One tale tells of how the black bear was a creation of the Great Spirit, while the grizzly {{was created by the}} Evil Spirit. In the mythology of the Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian people of the Northwest Coast, mankind first learned to respect bears <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> married the son of black bear Chieftain. In Kwakiutl mythology, black and brown bears became enemies when Grizzly Bear Woman killed Black Bear Woman for being lazy. Black Bear Woman's children, in turn, killed Grizzly Bear Woman's own cubs. The Navajo believed that the Big Black Bear was chief among the bears of the four directions surrounding Sun's house, and would pray to it in order to be granted its protection during raids.|$|E

25|$|On November 25, 2013, DeWine {{announced}} {{a second round}} of indictments. Another alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl came to light <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> came forward after the August rape. No charges have ever been filed in that case, or only after students discussed it. The highest-profile indictment was that of Steubenville City Schools superintendent Michael McVey, who was charged with obstructing justice, tampering with evidence, obstructing official business and falsification. It was later revealed that the charges against McVey were not related to the August rape. In 2015, McVey agreed in exchange for not facing charges to resign from his post, never seek employment in Steubenville education again and avoid contact with anyone involved in the investigation or case. In August 2015, McVey was hired by the Switzerland of Ohio Local School District as an elementary school principal, sparking outrage from many.|$|E
25|$|Ebadi {{has also}} defended various child abuse cases, {{including}} {{the case of}} Arian Golshani, a child who was abused for years and then beaten to death by her father and stepbrother. This case gained international attention and caused controversy in Iran. Ebadi used this case to highlight Iran’s problematic child custody laws, whereby custody of children in divorce is usually given to the father, even {{in the case of}} Arian, where her mother had told the court that the father was abusive and had begged for custody of her daughter. Ebadi also handled the case of Leila, a teenage girl who was gang-raped and murdered. Leila’s family became homeless trying to cover the costs of the execution of the perpetrators owed to the government, because in the Islamic Republic of Iran, it is the victim's family's responsibility to pay to restore their honor <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> is raped by paying the government to execute the perpetrator. Ebadi was not able to achieve a victory in this case, but she brought international attention to this problematic law. Ebadi also handled a few cases dealing with bans of periodicals (including the cases of Habibollah Peyman, Abbas Marufi, and Faraj Sarkouhi). She has also established two non-governmental organizations in Iran with western funding, the Society for Protecting the Rights of the Child (SPRC) (1994) and the Defenders of Human Rights Center (DHRC) in 2001.|$|E
500|$|As the German forces {{moved through}} Lanzerath {{and in front}} of their positions, Bouck and his men allowed lead members of the unit to pass, hoping to {{surprise}} the Germans.

Talking to the officers, she pointed in their general direction. An officer yelled a command, and the paratroopers jumped for ditches {{on either side of the}} road. The Americans thought she had given their position away and fired on the Germans, wounding several. (In October 2006, more than 50 years later, a writer found the now adult woman, still living in the village.

2500|$|Flapper dresses were {{straight}} and loose, leaving the arms bare (sometimes no straps at all) and dropping the waistline to the hips.

To enhance the view, some flappers applied rouge to their knees. Popular dress styles included the Robe de style. High heels also came into vogue at the time, reaching 2–3inches (5–8cm) high. Favored shoe styles were Mary Janes and T-straps in classic black, gold, silver, or nude shades.|$|E
