5000|$|Agents. The second {{iteration}} of {{the theory}} built on the analysis of collective action, and showed how this {{was linked to the}} mechanisms through which people make their activities meaningful and build commitments to them. Here, investments of social structural and social cognitive resources are expressed as emergent contributions to social action through a set of generative mechanisms: coherence (<b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> to make sense of objects, agency, and contexts); cognitive participation (<b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> to initiate and be enrolled into delivering an ensemble of practices); collective action (<b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> to enact those practices); and reflexive monitoring (<b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> to appraise the consequences of their contributions). These constructs are the core {{of the theory}}, and provide the foundation of its analytic purchase on practice.|$|R

[...] "But with a little patience we'll clear it up together--if you care enough about it," [...] he added more cheerfully. Letting his companion proceed again he continued: [...] "Heaven help us all, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>people</b> mean by impudence? There are many, I think, who don't understand its nature or its limits; and upon my word I've literally seen mere quickness of intelligence or of perception, the jump of a step or two, a little whirr of the wings of talk, mistaken for it. Yes, I've encountered men and women who thought you impudent if you weren't simply so stupid as they. The only impudence is unprovoked, or even mere dull, aggression, and I indignantly protest that I'm never guilty of that clumsiness. Ah for what do they take one, with their beastly presumption? Even to defend myself sometimes I've to make believe to myself that I care. I always feel as if I didn't successfully make others think so. Perhaps they see impudence in that. But I daresay the offence is in the things that I take, as I say, for granted; for if one tries to be pleased one passes perhaps inevitably for being pleased above all with one's self. That's really not my case--I find my capacity for pleasure deplorably below the mark I've set. This is why, as I've told you, I cultivate it, I try to bring it up. And I'm actuated by positive benevolence; I've that impudent pretension. That's what I mean by being the same to every one, by having only one manner. If one's conscious and ingenious to that end what's the harm--when one's motives are so pure? By never, never making the concession, one may end by becoming a perceptible force for good." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{theory of}} her stupidity, {{eventually}} embraced by her parents, corresponded {{with a great}} date in her small still life: the complete vision, private but final, of the strange office she filled. It was literally a moral revolution and accomplished {{in the depths of}} her nature. The stiff dolls on the dusky shelves began to move their arms and legs; old forms and phrases began to have a sense that frightened her. She had a new feeling, the feeling of danger; on which a new remedy rose to meet it, the idea of an inner self or, in other words, of concealment. She puzzled out with imperfect signs, but with a prodigious spirit, that she had been a centre of hatred and a messenger of insult, and that everything was bad because she had been employed to make it so. Her parted lips locked themselves with the determination to be employed no longer. She would forget everything, she would repeat nothing, and when, as a tribute to the successful application of her system, she began to be called a little idiot, she tasted a pleasure new and keen. When therefore, as she grew older, her parents in turn announced before her that she had grown shockingly dull, it was not from any real contraction of her little stream of life. She spoiled their fun, but she practically added to her own. She saw more and more; she saw too much. It was Miss Overmore, her first governess, who on a momentous occasion had sown the seeds of secrecy; sown them not by anything she said, but by a mere roll of those fine eyes which Maisie already admired. Moddle had become at this time, after alternations of residence of which the child had no clear record, an image faintly embalmed in the remembrance of hungry disappearances from the nursery and distressful lapses in the alphabet, sad embarrassments, in particular, when invited to recognise something her nurse described as [...] "the important letter haitch." [...] Miss Overmore, however hungry, never disappeared: this marked her somehow as of higher rank, and the character was confirmed by a prettiness that Maisie supposed to be extraordinary. Mrs. Farange had described her as almost too pretty, and some one had asked what that mattered so long as Beale wasn't there. [...] "Beale or no Beale," [...] Maisie had heard her mother reply, [...] "I take her because she's a lady and yet awfully poor. Rather nice people, but there are seven sisters at home. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>people</b> mean?" ...|$|E
