A plan for using newly available jet aircraft {{and nuclear weapons}} to wage a possible future war with the United States was laid out by Novikov and shown to Nikita Khrushchev, who turned the proposal down in favor of ballistic missiles.|$|E
5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although it <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On {{the eve of the}} Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|PerdiccasII {{sided with}} Sparta in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) between Athens and Sparta, and in 429 BC Athens retaliated by persuading Sitalces to invade Macedonia, {{but he was}} forced to retreat owing to a {{shortage}} of provisions in winter. In 424 BC, Arrhabaeus, a local ruler of Lynkestis in Upper Macedonia, rebelled against his overlord Perdiccas, and the Spartans agreed to help in putting down the revolt. At the Battle of Lyncestis the Macedonians panicked and fled before the fighting began, enraging the Spartan general Brasidas, whose soldiers looted the unattended Macedonian baggage train. Perdiccas then changed sides and supported Athens, and he <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> down Arrhabaeus's revolt.|$|E

5|$|The Elephant Man exhibit was {{moderately}} successful, {{and made}} money {{primarily from the}} sales of the autobiographical pamphlet. Merrick <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> {{his share of the}} profits aside, hoping to earn enough to one day buy a home of his own. The shop on Whitechapel Road was directly across the road from the London Hospital, an excellent location, as medical students and doctors visited the shop, curious to see Merrick. One visitor was a young house surgeon named Reginald Tuckett. Like his colleagues, Tuckett was intrigued by the Elephant Man's deformities and told his senior colleague Frederick Treves.|$|E
5|$|While the Soviet {{offensive}} continued, Field Marshal von Manstein <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the SS Panzer Corps—now {{reinforced by}} the 3rd SS Panzer Division—{{under the command of}} the Fourth Panzer Army, while Hitler agreed to release seven understrength panzer and motorized divisions for the impending counteroffensive. The Fourth Air Fleet, under the command of Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen, was able to regroup and increase the number of daily sorties from an average of 350 in January to 1,000 in February, providing German forces strategic air superiority. On 20 February, the Red Army was perilously close to Zaporizhia, signaling the beginning of the German counterattack, known to the German forces as the Donets Campaign.|$|E

Shields <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it back together from memory, yet when it came to mastering the album, to Creation's dismay, he needed 13 days, rather than the usual one day.|$|E

5|$|During the battle, San Martino {{collided}} with Regina Maria Pia {{and had her}} ram bow twisted, causing leaks in her hull. Shortly thereafter, Persano broke off the engagement to consolidate his forces, but his ships, low on coal and ammunition, and with badly demoralized crews, could not be rallied by Persano's half-hearted attempt to launch an attack. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; as night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. San Martino had been hit numerous times, and had her side armor penetrated by one shell, which {{did not succeed in}} penetrating the timber backing. Twice during the engagement, the ship was set on fire by Austrian shells, though her crew <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the fires out. After the battle, Vacca replaced Persano; he was ordered to attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out.|$|E
5|$|The {{successive}} {{rulers of}} Monaco tended to live elsewhere and visit their palace only occasionally. Charles III was succeeded in 1889 by Albert I. Albert married Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton, {{a daughter of}} Scotland's 11th duke of Hamilton, and his German wife, a princess of Baden. The couple had one son, Louis, before their marriage was annulled in 1880. Albert was a keen scientist and founded the Oceanographic Institute in 1906; as a pacifist he then founded the International Institute of Peace in Monaco. Albert's second wife, Alice Heine, an American banking heiress who was the widow of a French duke, did much to turn Monte Carlo into a cultural centre, establishing both ballet and the opera in the city. Having brought a large dowry into the family she contemplated turning the casino into a convalescent home for the poor who would benefit from recuperation in warm climes. The couple, however, separated before Alice <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> her plan into action.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{published}} {{an account of}} his disputation with Oxford Catholics over the Eucharist in 1549, along with a treatise further explaining his position. The disputation largely dealt with the doctrine of transubstantiation, which Vermigli strongly opposed, but the treatise <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> forward Vermigli's own Eucharistic theology. Vermigli's Eucharistic views, as expressed in the disputation and treatise, were influential in the changes to the Book of Common Prayer of 1552. Vermigli weighed in again on Eucharistic controversy in England in 1559. His Defense Against Gardiner was in reply to Stephen Gardiner's 1552 and 1554 Confutatio Cavillationum, itself a reply to the late Thomas Cranmer's work. At 821 folio pages, it was the longest work on the subject published during the Reformation period.|$|E

5|$|In 991 he {{provided}} military {{assistance to the}} Hamdanid emir of Aleppo, Sa'd al-Dawla, which enabled the latter to defeat the rebel Bakjur, who with Fatimid help tried to seize Aleppo. Early in the next year, a Fatimid army under Manjutakin advanced on Aleppo. Manjutakin sent a messenger to Bourtzes, claiming that his conflict was with Aleppo, and did not involve the Byzantines, but Bourtzes had the messenger arrested. After defeating the Hamdanids in battle near Apamea, Manjutakin laid siege to Aleppo for 33 days, after which he left part of his forces behind and led the rest to confront Bourtzes, who was marching to the city's aid. At the ensuing battle at Siderophygon (Arabic Jisr al-Hadith) Bourtzes and his men were defeated. Manjutakin followed up his success by capturing the fortress of Imm, commanded by Bourtzes' nephew, and taking him and 300 troops prisoner, before embarking on a plundering raid through Byzantine territory as far as Germanikeia (Ar. Mar'ash). The Fatimid general returned to Aleppo, {{but was unable to}} take it and withdrew later in the year. At about the same time, the Muslim population of Laodicea, Antioch's seaport, rose in revolt, but Bourtzes <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it down and deported the populace to the interior of Byzantine territory in Asia Minor.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held; {{there were two}} 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Since Singapore was a night race, the practice sessions started at a later local time; 18:00 {{for the first and}} 21:30 for the second session on Friday. This meant that the gap between the first two practice sessions was half an hour shorter than in other races. The two Mercedes cars were fastest in the first session on Friday, with Nico Rosberg topping the time sheets at 1:47.995. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton was second, 0.319 seconds behind, while Daniel Ricciardo was 0.017 seconds slower in third, ahead of the two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen, even though Vettel briefly left the track in turn five {{towards the end of the}} session. While Ricciardo felt he could go even faster, his teammate Daniil Kvyat <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in only eight laps due to a fuel system problem, and he finished the session eighteenth, just ahead of the two Manor Marussia drivers. Manor's Alexander Rossi placed last, albeit close to teammate Will Stevens, before crashing out at turn 18, ending the last timed runs of all other drivers left on track.|$|E
