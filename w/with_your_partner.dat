When I was a kid, pop could be dangerous but still massive. Michael Jackson would grab his crotch. Prince would rock assless chaps".|$|E

5000|$|Winning battles grants {{the player}} {{experience}} points which go toward gaining levels, making the characters stronger in the process, {{and just like}} Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals, several monsters (called [...] "Disc Monsters" [...] in this title and caught in battle {{in a similar manner}} to Pokémon) can be captured instead of slain and used to fight with the party. The monsters can be fused with Eldin, Torma or Rami for three turns in combat once a character's Installation Points ("IP") reach their maximum. These points are visible by a gauge just beneath a characters hit points and ability points, and fill up when they are hit by an enemy. In your new merged state, you lose control of the character but gain two abilities. The first is invincibility: while you're merged <b>with</b> <b>your</b> monster <b>partner,</b> you can not be hurt or given status ailments in any way. The second is a special attack (depends on what form you're in) {{that may or may not}} do more damage than your characters normally can: this same move is repeated until all three turns pass. Once three turns go by, you and <b>your</b> monster <b>partner</b> revert to normal. It's important to note that you can't merge <b>with</b> <b>your</b> selected <b>partner</b> unless he or she has built up at least three hearts worth of Loyalty with the character (Loyalty can be found on the monster's status menu; the max number of hearts is five). Loyalty is raised by simply having <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> accompany <b>your</b> party and earn experience from fights (the partner does not have to actually be an active fighter to raise its Loyalty).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rapport, {{the feeling}} of being "in sync " <b>with</b> <b>your</b> {{conversational}} <b>partners,</b> is argued to underlie many desirable social effects. By generating proper verbal and nonverbal behaviors, virtual humans have been seen to create rapport during interactions with human users. In this paper, we introduce our approach to creating rapport following Tickle-Degnen and Rosenberg’s three-factor (positivity, mutual attention and coordination) theory of rapport. By comparing with a previously published virtual agent, the Rapport Agent, we show that our virtual human predicts the timing of backchannel feedback and end-of-turn more precisely, performs more natural behaviors and, thereby creates much stronger feelings of rapport between users and virtual agents...|$|R
