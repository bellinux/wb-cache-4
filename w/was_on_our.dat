25|$|The {{witnesses}} {{described the}} Blessed Virgin Mary as being clothed in white robes {{with a brilliant}} crown on her head. Over the forehead where the crown fitted the brow, she wore a beautiful full-bloom golden rose. She was in an attitude of prayer with her eyes and hands raised towards Heaven. St. Joseph stood on Our Lady's right. He was turned towards her in an attitude of respect. His robes were also white. St. John <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>Our</b> Lady's left. He was dressed in white vestments and resembled a bishop, with a small mitre. He appeared to be preaching and he held an open book in his left hand.|$|E

We told him this was the second single. Course, we had no idea that it would be. He sat there, grinning—'Definitely! Definitely a single!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In Bach's typical {{format of}} the chorale cantata cycle, {{the text of the}} first and the last stanza is {{retained}} unchanged, while an unknown librettist paraphrased the inner stanzas, in this case to three movements, two arias framing a recitative. According to Wolff, the librettist may have been Andreas Stübel, writing already in 1724/25. The theme of the chorale is connected to the gospel in a general way: our life depends on God's help and is lost without it. A connection is also provided by the image of flooding water that the psalm conveys, which begins [...] "If it had not been the Lord who <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> side" [...] (...) , and continues [...] "then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul, then the proud waters had gone over our soul" [...] (...) [...] The poet paraphrased it in the central recitative to [...] "" [...] ("Their fury would have, like a raging tide and like a foaming wave, flooded over us").|$|E

As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> back wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
