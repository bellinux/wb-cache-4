The following day, Reid accepted a coaching role assisting Williams {{until the end of}} the 2015–16 season. Although he was yet to feature for the club that season due to injury, Reid still harboured hopes of playing again and told Forest Player HD “I’m going to be coupling this with my rehab – I had my operation four <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> – and I’m still trying to get back".|$|E

He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E

Soon after her marriage her husband began to manifest the same symptoms and had since shown them from time to time; but was, with her help, always able to overcome them. A few <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> she observed that he did not look well, and when questioned {{he said that he was}} unable to get the idea of this arsenical poison out of his mind. He had been steadily growing worse ever since, but still had hoped to overcome the trouble until the last. After the death the body had turned black.|$|E

5|$|Martin next awakes in Doggett's home. Wells tells Doggett the {{description}} of the killer but the man isn’t in lock-up yet because that won’t happen until Wednesday. Doggett and Wells arrive at the apartment and retrieve the nanny cam, but discover that someone disabled the cam and used its remote control, a device no one knew about except Mr. and Mrs. Wells and their nanny, Trina Galvez. At Trina Galvez’s home, Wells and Doggett discover the killer, a man named Cesar Ocampo, who threatened to kill Galvez's family if she refused him entrance. At the station house, Doggett informs Wells that Ocampo only wants to talk to him. Ocampo reveals that his brother, Hector, was sentenced to time in prison for a false conviction. Wells bargains with Cesar Ocampo, saying that if Cesar confesses to Vicky’s murder, he will take a look at his brother’s case. Cesar tells him that Hector hung himself in a jail cell a few <b>weeks</b> <b>ago.</b> Doggett calls Martin Wells out into the hall and the police arrest Martin because they have a case against him. Evidence against Ocampo isn’t strong enough yet.|$|E
5|$|The {{leader of}} the Fireflies, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), {{promises}} to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House outside the quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Full infection normally occurs in under two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> and that her immunity {{may lead to a}} cure. The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected; believing in Ellie's importance, Tess sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies. With the help of Bill (W. Earl Brown), a smuggler who owes Joel a favor, they acquire a working vehicle. Driving into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter); after they escape the city, Sam is bitten by an infected, but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead and commits suicide out of grief.|$|E
25|$|Although HRT {{admitted}} {{they crossed the}} line two <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> when they reported {{the results of the}} exit polls conducted by RTL and Nova TV, they once again 'borrowed' the results for the second round election night.

Finally, exactly nine days after the election, on 19 January, she was released of her duties as chief editor.|$|E

25|$|After the Bucs {{defeated}} Carolina, 12–9, in an ‘ugly’ game three <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> in Charlotte, the rematch {{was billed}} as another defensive struggle, though with a twist. While this was indeed a matchup of the league's first and third-ranked defenses, it also marked the returns of starting quarterbacks Brad Johnson and Rodney Peete, each of whom missed the last game between the two. Statistically, Johnson and the Bucs’ defense came out on top, though Bucs Head Coach Jon Gruden complimented the Panthers’ work, as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{action in}} this year's Tour Championships {{began with the}} Red Group with Wimbledon {{champion}} Petra Kvitová and 2008 finalist Vera Zvonareva. Having lost to Zvonareva in straight sets just a few <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> in Tokyo, Kvitová had her {{work cut out for}} her, but this time it was different - Kvitová hadn't lost an indoor match all year and her huge serve, powerful groundstrokes and strong net play were working like a charm as she raced out to a 6–2, 4–1 lead. Things got tougher as the unforced errors began to creep into Kvitová's game, and Zvonareva closed the gap to 4–all in the second set; but the No.3-seeded Kvitová broke again for 5–4 and served it out, getting two errors in a row from the No.6-seeded Zvonareva to get to match point then knifing a forehand volley. The series between the two is now knotted at 3–3. Kvitová ended with an even differential, 24 winners to 24 errors; she won 17 of 23 net points (including match point). Zvonareva was −9 (eight winners, 17 errors).|$|E
25|$|As {{time went}} by, Bradbury tended to dismiss {{censorship}} as a chief motivating factor for writing the story. Instead he usually {{claimed that the}} real messages of Fahrenheit 451 were {{about the dangers of}} an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. In the late 1950s, Bradbury recounted:In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451, I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.|$|E

25|$|Marlo, Chris and Snoop visit Michael at home. Marlo {{questions}} {{him about}} the ring he is wearing on a {{chain around his neck}} and Michael reports that he took it from someone. Marlo is shocked, as the ring, which he initially took from Old Face Andre as part of a punishment for his stash house being robbed by Omar, had been stolen from Marlo by Omar several <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> in the poker game robbery, and then by Officer Walker from Omar when he was falsely arrested for murder, and then by Michael from Walker when the schoolboys ambushed him and covered him with yellow paint in an alley. Michael offers to give him the ring, unaware of its past, but Marlo allows him to keep it. Dukie descends and offers to ready Bug for school. Marlo tells Michael that he is putting him in charge of Bodie's corner and that he has another task for him. Snoop asks Michael who they killed for him and he reveals that it was Bug's father.|$|E

Jack and Georgina Sparks (Michelle Trachtenberg) deal with the arrangements of Chuck and Blair's wedding. Before the ceremony, Serena and Blair have a conversation over why she is still talking to Dan after he published a negative chapter about her a few <b>weeks</b> <b>ago.</b> Overhearing their conversation, Dan leaves and gives to Nate his final chapter, which is about Gossip Girl. Blair and Chuck are married by Cyrus (Wallace Shawn) and right after, the police arrive to question them. At the same time, everyone's phones ring: Dan's chapter has been published in The Spectator, in which he reveals that he is Gossip Girl. Various characters react over the Gossip Girl reveal, including Vanessa (Jessica Szohr), Juliet (Katie Cassidy), Agnes (Willa Holland) and Lola (Ella Rae Peck), as well as Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Rachel Bilson, preparing to audition for a role in the adaptation of Dan's book, is told of Gossip Girl's identity by Kristen Bell, who shares a conspiratorial wink with the audience. Dan finally explains why he created Gossip Girl and says Jenny (Taylor Momsen) knew it all along.|$|E
25|$|The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in an {{internal}} report by delegate George Burnier, stated the following in April 1920:There are two distinct military organizations in Hungary: the national army {{and a kind}} of civil guard which was formed when the communist régime fell. It is the latter which has been responsible for all the reprehensible acts committed. The Government managed to regain control of these organizations only a few <b>weeks</b> <b>ago.</b> They are now well-disciplined and collaborate with the municipal police forces.This deep hostility toward Communism would be the more lasting legacy of Kun's abortive revolution. It was a conviction shared by Horthy and his country's ruling class that would help drive Hungary into what might have been a fatal alliance with Adolf Hitler.The nation of the Hungarians loved and admired Budapest, which became its polluter in the last years. Here, {{on the banks of the}} Danube, I arraign her. This city has disowned her thousand years of tradition, she has dragged the Holy Crown and the national colours in the dust, she has clothed herself in red rags. The finest of the nation she threw into dungeons or drove into exile. She laid in ruin our property and wasted our wealth. Yet the nearer we approached to this city, the more rapidly did the ice in our hearts melt. We are now ready to forgive her.|$|E

25|$|On 19 October 2008, {{the news}} media began to {{broadcast}} the news of Pakistan Army troops, led by an army lieutenant, being locked in a fierce battle with foreign militants to keep open the line routes to NATO forces in Afghanistan. For several months, the foreign militants {{had been trying to}} either attack or seal off the supply routes. The army battle reports indicated that the local commander, Mohammad Tariq al-Fridi, had seized terrain around the mile-long Kohat Tunnel. The military intelligence reports had held al-Fridi responsible for coordinated suicide bomb attacks and rocket strikes against convoys emerging from it. The TTP spokesman, Maulvi Omar, claimed that his foreign fighters would lay down their arms if the Pakistan Army ceased intense fighting. The military refused his offers and a tactical military operation was launched to secure the tunnel routes after TTP seized five trucks carrying weapons and ammunition. They held the tunnel for a week before they were driven out in fierce fighting with the military. Since then, Tariq and his men have returned several times to attack convoys, in a response, the army launched its latest onslaught after a suicide bomb attack at one of its bases near the tunnel six <b>weeks</b> <b>ago.</b> In a massive manhunt operation, Tariq was killed along with hundreds of militants while trying to flee the battle in a combat air operation. The operation ended with five civilians were killed and 45 were injured, including 35 soldiers, when a pickup truck packed with explosives was driven into a checkpoint.|$|E
25|$|On February 9, the NLD {{released}} {{a statement saying that}} Thein Lwin, a member of NNER, was suspended from his position in the party’s central executive committee indefinitely. Another statement released by the NLD also announced the suspension of its Central Education Committee chaired by Thein Lwin. Aung San Su Kyi, the leader of the NLD, also said that it was a conflict of interest for a party member to be involved in an organization independent of the party. Thein Lwin responded by saying that he believed “student demands are righteous”. The statement came out as Thein Lwin along with other education advocates and student representatives attended the third quadripartite meeting with Deputy Minister of Education and reached an agreement to resume further talks on February 11 at Yangon Region Parliamentary building. At the same time, the students marching from Mandalay were approaching Pyay in Bago Region and were about a mile away from a barricade set up by 200 riot police and 100 Swan Arr Shin members. About 300 residents from nearby towns accompanied the students to protect them due to rumors of a possible crackdown. Meanwhile, the students marching from Tanintharyi Region arrived in Mawlamyine, the capital of Mon State the day before and held several demonstrations joined by the locals (thein lwin suspended). The third group leaving from Ayeyarwady Region reportedly arrived in Maubin, about 100 miles away from Yangon. In Dedaye, in the northwest of Maubin and about 56 miles from Yangon, around 400 riot police were deployed. The student protesters called for negotiations with the police in case of a potential confrontation and the police informed that they were there to provide security not to stop the protests. Moreover, the fourth group of around 300 students left Pakokku, following the path that the group from Mandalay took several <b>weeks</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
