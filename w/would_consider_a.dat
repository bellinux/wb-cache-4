5|$|After the Pacquiao fight, Cotto {{moved to}} the light middleweight division. On June 5, 2010, he fought against undefeated Israeli WBA Light Middleweight Champion Yuri Foreman at Yankee Stadium in New York City. Bob Arum had said that if Cotto were to win, he would become a front runner to defend the WBA belt against Manny Pacquiao in November. Cotto stated that he <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> return to the welterweight division, {{in case of an}} {{interesting}} fight. Cotto ended up knocking Foreman down with a signature left hook to the body in the ninth round, after Foreman tore his knee, Cotto, claiming the WBA light middleweight title, his fourth overall in three different weight divisions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} both South African and South American plants {{were placed in}} this same genus. By {{the early nineteenth century}} Amaryllis had become a {{polymorphic}} (diverse) genus with about 50 species from what we <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> dozen genera today, and attempts were made to separate it into different genera. This work commenced in 1819 with the contributions of the English botanist, the Revd. William Herbert in Curtis's Botanical Magazine which he expanded in 1821 in The Botanical Register, identifying 14 species of the new genus of Hippeastrum, and only leaving three species in Amaryllis. The rest of the Amaryllis species he transferred to other genera, several of which he created. Herbert further refined his descriptions of Hippeastrum in his work on the Amaryllidaceae in 1837.|$|E
5|$|The {{nomination}} in April 2005 {{of a new}} NASA Administrator with an engineering rather than accounting background, Michael D. Griffin, changed the situation, as Griffin stated he <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> manned servicing mission. Soon after his appointment Griffin authorized Goddard to proceed with preparations for a manned Hubble maintenance flight, saying he would make the final decision after the next two shuttle missions. In October 2006 Griffin gave the final go-ahead, and the 11-day mission by Atlantis was scheduled for October 2008. Hubble's main data-handling unit failed in September 2008, halting all reporting of scientific data until its back-up was brought online on October 25, 2008. Since {{a failure of the}} backup unit would leave the HST helpless, the service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for the primary unit.|$|E

Up until Dennis Wise's resignation as director of football at Newcastle in April 2009, many fans directed the blame of Keegan's exit at both owner Mike Ashley and Dennis Wise as a result of such a role being established and poorly used. The club was warned by the LMA on 5 September 2008 to develop a structure which would satisfy the next manager to replace Keegan to avoid a similar situation repeating itself and damaging the club's image.|$|E
25|$|According to Brackett, he and Wilder never {{considered}} anyone except Gloria Swanson {{for the role}} of Norma Desmond. Wilder, however, had a different recollection. He recalled first wanting Mae West and Marlon Brando for the leads, but never approached either with an offer. He contacted Pola Negri by telephone, but had a difficult time understanding her heavy Polish accent. They also asked Norma Shearer if she would portray Norma Desmond, but she rejected the role due to both her retirement and distaste for it. They were considering Fred MacMurray to play opposite her as Joe. The filmmakers approached Greta Garbo, but she expressed no interest. Wilder and Brackett then visited Mary Pickford, but before even discussing the plot with her, Wilder realized she <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> role involving an affair with a man half her age an insult, so they departed. They had considered pairing Montgomery Clift with her.|$|E

25|$|A {{coalition}} government had been widely {{considered as a}} potential outcome of this election {{and the first to}} be formed since 1999. Foreign embassies in Turkey have expressed their expectation for a coalition while speculation in the media has centred over the possible make-up of the incoming government. In April, the CHP announced that it could form a coalition with any party that supports judicial independence and the separation of powers and hinted at a possible CHP-MHP-HDP coalition, since all three parties are fiercely critical of the governing AKP. It was perceived to be unlikely that the MHP and HDP, which are right-wing Turkish nationalist and left-wing Kurdish nationalist parties respectively, would join a coalition together. This was confirmed when MHP leader Devlet Bahçeli recommended that those who suggested such a coalition to 'see a doctor'. However, the MHP formed a coalition with the centre-left Democratic Left Party in 1999 and fielded a joint presidential candidate with the centre-left CHP in 2014, making a potential coalition with the CHP a possibility. The HDP have also signalled a potential coalition with the CHP, though co-leader Selahattin Demirtaş staunchly rejected any electoral alliance between them. On 2 June, Demirtaş stated that they would never form a coalition with the AKP but <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> coalition deal with the CHP.|$|E
25|$|The {{oscillating}} universe theory—that {{the universe}} {{will end in}} a collapse or 'big crunch' followed by another big bang, and so on—dates from 1930. Cosmologists such as professor Alexander Vilenkin from Tufts University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Max Tegmark suggest that if space is sufficiently large and uniform, or infinite as some theories suggest, and if quantum theory is true such {{that there is only}} a finite number of configurations within a finite volume possible, due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, then identical instances of the history of Earth's entire Hubble volume occur every so often, simply by chance. Tegmark calculates that our nearest so-called doppelgänger, is 1010115 meters away from us (a double exponential function larger than a googolplex). In principle, {{it would be impossible to}} scientifically verify an identical Hubble volume. However, it does follow as a fairly straightforward consequence from otherwise unrelated scientific observations and theories. Tegmark suggests that statistical analyses exploiting the anthropic principle provide an opportunity to test multiverse theories in some cases. Generally, science <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> multiverse theory that posits neither a common point of causation, nor the possibility of interaction between universes, to be an ideal speculation. However, it is a fundamental assumption of cosmology that the universe continues to exist beyond the scope of the observable universe, and that the distribution of matter is everywhere the same at such a large scale (see cosmological principle).|$|E
25|$|Limestone Lad, {{began the}} next season by making his debut in a flat race, {{finishing}} third in a two-mile maiden race at Navan and then finished second to the mare Liss A Paoraigh in the Lismullen Hurdle at the same track on 3 November. A week later he won the Brown Lad Hurdle again at Naas, leading {{all the way and}} winning by six lengths when conceding more than twenty pounds to his five opponents. Seven days later he attempted to record his second win in the Morgiana Hurdle and started third favourite behind Ned Kelly who was unbeaten in seven races over hurdles including the Herald Champion Novice Hurdle, and Youlneverwalkalone who had won the Hatton's Grace Hurdle in 2000. Limestone Lad led until overtaken by Ned Kelly at the second last but rallied to regain the lead on the running and won by half a length. On 7 December, the gelding, ridden by Paul Carberry won the Hatton's Grace Hurdle for the second time, making all the running to win from Liss A Paoraigh, Ned Kelly and Bannow Bay. After the race, Michael Bowe named the Stayer's Hurdle at Cheltenham as his horse's main target but said that he <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> run in the Champion Hurdle if the ground was soft.

25|$|FOA's Torsten Magnusson {{met with}} the American envoy Howard A. Robinson in November 1954, and Malte Jacobsson from the Atom Committee talked to Counter Admiral Lewis Strauss from Atomic Energy Commission in April 1955. Sweden {{indicated}} {{that it would be}} interested in purchasing approximately 25 nuclear devices. In 1957, Ambassador Erik Boheman raised the question at the US State Department, while the Swedish Ministry of Defense inquired about sending Swedish officers to train on the use of nuclear weapons. Boheman also mentioned that Denmark and Norway had already purchased weapons systems that could carry nuclear warheads, although neither country had devices to deploy on such systems. The American response was dismissive because Sweden, as a non-NATO state, did not have any mutual defense agreement with the US, which was a requirement in American law to even consider nuclear weapons cooperation. The message was clear - if Sweden reconsidered its nonalignment policy, the US <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> new request from Sweden, otherwise discussions would be fruitless. Analysis from the US State Department in 1959, showed that Sweden {{did not have to be}} a NATO-member for the proposed nuclear weapons sales, but it had to, at the very minimum, have an agreement with the US regarding use of nuclear weapons, which would imply Sweden renouncing nonalignment. On April 6, 1960, the United States National Security Council decided that the Americans should not support the Swedish ownership of nuclear weapons, nor did it approve of the idea of a Swedish nuclear weapons program. The US Government believed that Western interests would be best served against the Soviet Union if Sweden invested its limited resources in conventional weapons, rather than an expensive nuclear weapons program.|$|E
