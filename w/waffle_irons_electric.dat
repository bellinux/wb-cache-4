50|$|Traditional <b>waffle</b> <b>irons</b> are {{attached}} to tongs with wooden handles and are held over an open flame, or set on a stove. Most modern <b>waffle</b> <b>irons</b> are self-contained tabletop electrical appliances, heated by an electric heating element controlled by an internal thermostat. Professional waffle makers are usually made of cast iron whereas domestic models are often teflon coated. Many have a light that goes off when the iron is at the set temperature. Most modern <b>waffle</b> <b>irons</b> - particularly cast aluminum ones - are coated with a non-stick coating (e.g. teflon) to prevent the waffles from sticking to them. Cast-iron waffle makers are usually not coated and require seasoning like a cast-iron frying pan.|$|R
