"Till the World Ends" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Dr. Luke and Max Martin, with additional writing by American recording artist Kesha and Alexander Kronlund, and additional production by Billboard. In {{an interview for}} Spin on February 11, 2011, Kesha announced she had co-written the song with Luke and Martin for Femme Fatale. She explained it was inspired by [...] "me imagining [...] and any female musician touring the world. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> and you're having an amazing, magical night and you don't {{want to go to}} sleep and you want it to last until the world ends." [...] On March 2, 2011, the single's cover art, in which Spears appears sitting on a couch in a sweater and heels, was posted at Deezer.com. This was followed by a 30-second snippet of the song, which appeared at Amazon.de. [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] leaked online on March 3, 2011, which prompted Spears to post hours later on her Twitter account, [...] "Looks like the cat's out of the bag..." [...] She formally premiered the single at On Air with Ryan Seacrest, on March 4, 2011, at 10:00 EST (15:00 UTC). [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was made available on iTunes the same day, several days earlier than originally planned. Following the announcement, Kesha spoke to MTV News stating that [...] "I consider myself a songwriter before and above everything else, so it's an honor to write for one of pop music's biggest icons." [...] During an interview with Seacrest, Spears described [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] as [...] "fun. I like it. It's good energy. [...] I'm a vibe person, and I think I love good-mood songs, and if it puts me in a good mood, it clicks for me." ...|$|E

"The {{world has}} {{had plenty of}} tragedy to deal with {{recently}} so I {{wanted to do something}} that had a 'feel good' flavor to it [...] So <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and have a good time, if you get dressed up in the right thing, all eyes will be on you — it doesn't matter if it's Monica or whoever else."Monica Arnold, MTV News ...|$|E
2500|$|Springfield {{introduced}} the Motown sound {{to a wider}} UK audience, both with her covers of Motown songs, and by facilitating the first UK TV appearance for The Temptations, The Supremes, The Miracles, and Stevie Wonder on {{a special edition of}} the Ready Steady Go! show – which was produced by Wickham – called The Sound of Motown. On 28 April 1965 it was broadcast by Rediffusion TV, with Springfield opening each half of the show accompanied by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas and Motown's in-house band, The Funk Brothers. The associated Tamla-Motown Revue featuring The Supremes, The Miracles and Wonder had started in London in March, and according to The Supremes' Mary Wilson, the tour was a flop: [...] "It's always... disheartening <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there and you see the house is half-full... but once you're on stage... You perform as well for five as you do for 500." [...] Wickham, a fan of the Motown artists, booked them for the Ready Steady Go! special and enlisted Springfield to host it. In 1966 Springfield released three additional UK Top20 hits: [...] "Little By Little" [...] and two dramatic ballads – one written by Carole King: [...] "Goin' Back" [...] and [...] "All I See Is You," [...] written by Ben Weisman & Clive Westlake, which also reached the US Top20. In August and September 1966, she hosted Dusty, a six-part music and talk show weekly BBC TV series. A compilation of her singles, Golden Hits released in November 1966, reached No.2 in the UK. From the mid-1960s, Springfield would use the pseudonym [...] "Gladys Thong" [...] when recording backing vocals for other artists including Madeline Bell, Kiki Dee, Anne Murray and Elton John. Bell was a regular backing singer on early Springfield albums, and the pair co-wrote [...] "I'm Gonna Leave You" [...] with Lesley Duncan, which appeared as the B-side of [...] "Goin' Back." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I was reading,' she proceeded, 'all night long. I began <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> {{and read}} till you came home again. The strangest story, Jonas! And true, the book says. I'll tell it you to-morrow.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If you fellers {{had done}} as I wanted you'd be way up now, {{the same as}} I am. Of course, I don't blame you for being afraid; but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on such work the only way is to hold on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{happen to}} know," [...] she replied [...] "that Miss Silvester left the place at {{which she had}} been staying about the time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> walking yesterday. And I thought you might have seen her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard her}} this morning: 'Eh, Mrs. Morel! I {{was going to}} do that,' <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> in the rain for some coal," [...] he said. [...] "That looks a lot like your being able to manage servants!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, miss; I said I was to {{have shown}} him in, {{if you had been}} at home. Perhaps I did wrong; I told him what <b>you</b> told me <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> this morning--I said <b>you</b> had <b>gone</b> to read at the Museum." ...|$|R

"Now {{you have}} learned your trade," [...] said Phil, finally, [...] "you can {{graduate}} as full-fledged scavengers. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> don't fail to place that bag of nasty stuff {{in a corner of}} your own room.

60|$|You {{will often}} hear such words as those <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> into the world, into great towns, where men meet {{together}} much. Let me give you, young people, a little advice about that beforehand; for, fine as it sounds, it is hollow and false at root.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have noticed}} {{that you have been}} {{behaving}} very foolishly," [...] Mrs. Dowsett said quietly, [...] "and that for the last week you have been taking Robert with you as an escort <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of an evening. I suppose you did that to annoy Cyril, but I don't think that he minded much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Which is a {{contingency}} you naturally wished to avoid? I congratulated you upon your prudence once before.

[...] "Against open {{violence}} you can well defend yourself, but against a blow from behind with a dagger, skill and courage are of little avail. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> after dark, I pray {{you let your}} army servant follow closely behind you, and see that his sword is loose in its scabbard." ...|$|E
60|$|They 'ad their guesses, {{and then}} they went in and asked, {{and as soon as}} Gerty found that it was only three-and-sixpence she began to feel in her pocket for 'er purse, just like your wife does <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with 'er, knowing all the time that it's on the mantelpiece with twopence-ha'penny and a cough lozenge in it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, really,' said Sheila, 'it {{seems very}} {{difficult}} to get at the truth sometimes. And when illness is in the house I cannot understand why there should be no one available to answer the door. You must have left it ajar, unsecured, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out.</b> And pray, what if Dr Ferguson had been some common tramp? That would have been a nice thing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come now, Bannister," [...] said Holmes. [...] "It will {{be clear}} to you, from what I have said, that only you could have let this young man out, since you were left in the room, and must have locked the door <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out.</b> As to his {{escaping}} by that window, it was incredible.

6000|$|That old Osborne's {{mind was}} {{changing}} was pretty clear.

Then he said, [...] "It's not respectful, sir, of you younkers to be imitating of your relations. Miss O., <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> adriving to-day, leave my card upon Mr. Sedley, do you hear? There's no quarrel betwigst me and him anyhow." ...|$|E
60|$|MAUD. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> with Guy, it wasn't {{three minutes}} before he came. Mother had just told us about--well, about {{something}} beastly. Father wanted us to go, and we agreed to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> for five minutes while he talked to mother. We went, and {{when we came back}} he told me to get a cab to take mother home. Poor mother stood there looking like a ghost, and he began hunting and hauling her towards the door. I saw red, and instead of a cab I fetched that policeman. Of course father did black his eye. Guy was splendid.|$|R
6000|$|... "They say I forget most things," [...] {{says the}} old man, with a smile; [...] "but I ain't so bad as that quite. Only this mornin', <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> my darter says, 'Father, {{do you know}} why you have a black coat on?' 'In course I know why I have a black coat,' says I.

6000|$|... "MY DEAR MR. PERKINS," [...] she began--"Although I am {{not your}} soul's adored, I {{performed}} her part for once, since I have read your letter, as I told her. You {{need not be}} very much alarmed, although Lucy is {{at this moment in}} bed and unwell: for the poor girl has had a sad scene at her grand uncle's house in Baker Street, and came home very much affected. Rest, however, will restore her, for she is not one of your nervous sort; and I hope <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come in the morning, you will see her as blooming as she was <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to-day on that unlucky walk.|$|R

60|$|They are {{for ever}} and ever moving the furniture. When {{you come in}} in the night you can {{calculate}} on finding the bureau where the wardrobe was in the morning.

This will disgust you. They like that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly, {{they are}} men of too high rank and too great fashion for a {{hard-working}} poor soldier like me; {{and if you}} continue to live with such, believe me, you will find numbers of us humdrum people can't afford to keep such company.

6000|$|... "So {{she will}} remain for this night and that day which follows," [...] said Ayesha, [...] "and when she wakes it will be, I think, to believe herself once more a happy child.

Of her father you must tell her that he died <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to hunt the river-beasts together, and if she seeks for certain others, that they have gone away. But I think that she will ask little more when she learns that he is dead, since I have laid that command upon her soul." ...|$|R

I don't know how I found it all out exactly, but I have found it out, and I can't bear the suspense any longer, and so you must {{tell me all about}} it.

6000|$|... "Oh, nothing--EVERYTHING! It's no use,--YOU can't understand! YOU like it, I {{know you}} do. I can see it; it's your style. But it's stupid, it's awful, Clarence!

And 'my own mamma,' indeed! As if I didn't know, Clarence, that she ISN'T. And papa, caring for nothing but this hideous, dreary rancho, and the huge, empty plains. It's worse than school, for there, at least, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>you</b> could see something besides cattle and horses and yellow-faced half-breeds! But here--Lord! it's only a wonder I haven't run away before!" ...|$|R
