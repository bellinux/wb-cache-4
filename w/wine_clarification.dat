To better understand this variability and its potential impact on quality, suspended solids in several red musts were characterized and the performances of different clarification techniques compared. Methods and results : Results show a large variability in turbidity and total wet suspended solids between different raw and clarified musts, {{and a lack of}} correlation between these values. Clarification is always higher for vacuum filtration than for disk-stack or decanter centrifugation, with strong differences between musts for a given process. Despite a large size distribution, most of suspended particles are micronic and submicronic. TEM observations and analyses indicate that they are mostly membrane and organelle fragments along with (macro) molecular aggregates formed during juice extraction. Their overall composition differs from that found in white musts. Conclusion : Particle heterogeneity and size distribution account for the difficulties encountered in red must clarification. Results also raise the question of the relationship between must turbidity and content in compounds likely to affect wine quality.

40|$|Aims: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop polysaccharide- degrading wine strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which are able to improve aspects of <b>wine</b> processing and <b>clarification,</b> as well as colour extraction and stabilization during winemaking. Methods and Results: Two yeast expression/secretion gene cassettes were constructed, namely (i) a pectinase gene cassette (pPPK) consisting of the endo-polygalacturonase gene (pelE) from Erwinia chrysanthemi and the pectate lyase gene (peh 1) from Erwinia carotovora and (ii) a glucanase/xylanase gene cassette (pEXS) containing the endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanase gene (end 1) from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and the endo-β- 1, 4 -xylanase gene (xynC) from Aspergillus niger. The commercial wine yeast strain, VIN 13, was transformed separately with these two gene cassettes and checked for the production of pectinase, glucanase and xylanase activities. Pinot Noir, Cinsaut and Muscat d'Alexandria grape juices were fermented using the VIN 13 [pPPK] pectinase- and the VIN 13 [pEXS] glucanase/xylanase-producing transformants. Chemical analyses of the resultant wines indicated that (i) the pectinase-producing strain caused a decrease in the concentration of phenolic compounds in Pinot Noir whereas the glucanase/xylanase-producing strain caused an increase in phenolic compounds presumably because of the degradation of the grape skins; (ii) the glucanase/xylanase-producing strain caused a decrease in wine turbidity, especially in Pinot Noir wine, as well as a clear increase in colour intensity and (iii) in the Muscat d'Alexandria and Cinsaut wines, the differences between the control wines (fermented with the untransformed VIN 3 strain) and the wines produced by the two transformed strains were less prominent showing that the effect of these polysaccharide-degrading enzymes is cultivar-dependent. Conclusions: The recombinant wine yeasts producing pectinase, glucanase and xylanase activities during the fermentation of Pinot Noir, Cinsaut and Muscat d'Alexandria grape juice altered the chemical composition of the resultant wines in a way that such yeasts could potentially be used to improve the clarity, colour intensity and stability and aroma of wine.

30|$|The biotechnological {{potential}} of pectinolytic enzymes {{is well known}} due to their various industrial applications wherever degradation of pectic substances is required. This includes food related processes like fruit juice clarification, tissue maceration, <b>wine</b> <b>clarification,</b> coffee and tea fermentation and many others (Kashyap et al. 2001). It {{has been reported that}} pectinases have a share of almost 5 % of global enzyme sales (Alimardani-Theuil et al. 2011). Commercial pectinases used in food industry normally contain a mixture of enzymes that split pectic compounds; which traditionally includes PG (polygalacturonase), PL (pectin lyase) and PME (pectin methylesterase) (Del Cañizo et al. 1994). Pectinolytic enzyme production occupies about 10 % of the worldwide manufacturing of enzyme preparations (Semenova et al. 2006). Industrial production of microbial pectinolytic enzymes is mainly done by filamentous fungi, especially Aspergillus niger (Naidu and Panda 1998). Aspergillus species produce a large number of enzymes particularly involved in the degradation of pectic substances (van den Brink and de Vries 2011). However, the variety of enzyme sets differs between fungal species (Benoit et al. 2012).|$|E

Recently, {{for the first time}} relevant amount of the S-glutathionylated and S-cysteinylated precursors (GSH- 3 MH and Cys- 3 MH) of 3 -mercaptohexan- 1 -ol (3 MH) and 3 -mercaptohexyl acetate (3 MHA) have been identified in commercial grape tannins (Larcher et al., 2013). This evidence suggested new opportunities of technological use of these adjuvants for improving the exotic-fruit flavour profile of wine after fermentation. This hypothesis was experimentally investigated fermenting 17 Mueller Thurgau (MT) and 15 Sauvignon Blanc (SB) grapes according to 2 lab-scale distinct protocols: TAN and REF (respectively, with and without addition in the juice of a selected grape tannin particularly rich in GSH- 3 MH and Cys- 3 MH). Wines obtained from must added of grape tannin were significantly richer in the total content of the 2 thiols (expressed as sum of the molar concentrations; Tukey’s test, p < 0. 001) with median contents of 12. 6 nmol/L in TAN vs. 5. 16 nmol/L in REF for MT, and 11. 3 nmol/L vs. 2. 69 nmol/L for SB wines.

The secondary fermentation was done in an air tight container in which a tube was passed into a clean bottle containing clean water. The essence was to monitor the course of fermentation. This was allowed until completion of fermentation as was evidenced by lack of the appearance of bubbles in the container usually within 3  weeks. Secondary fermentation was done for 21  days. When fermentation stopped, the wine was promptly racked off the lees ensuring minimum exposure to oxygen. After secondary fermentation, the wines were clarified. The clarification/fining were done using bentonite (a clarifying agent). Exactly 500  g of bentonite was dissolved in two litres of boiling water and stirred properly to a gel form. This was allowed to stand for 24  h. Then 150  g of the gel-like bentonite was transferred into each of the wine followed by stirring to dissolve properly. A small quantity of the mixture was collected in a clean bottle which was covered tightly and was used to monitor the process of clarification. This was done for a period of 3  months. Filtration was done after the <b>wines</b> had completed <b>clarification</b> using muslin cloth, sieve and syphon tubes sterilized by 70  % alcohol.

Depending on porosity membranes, filtering can also ensure the microbiological stabilization of wine. Passing through the membrane does not affect wine quality, giving them the opportunity for reuse. Filtering ensures good stability and clarity of wines. <b>Wine</b> <b>clarification</b> by sedimentation during unduly prolonged technology and filtering ensures rapid separation (streaming) of wine. When filtering wine through porous layers, the particles in suspension to be involved in yeast sediment deposited in the bottom of the container and which could have a favorable role on wine olfacto-taste) may be retained on the surface or depth filter layer so that wine passing through filter surface should not affect its sensory qualities...|$|E
40|$|Several papers {{investigated}} the complex chemical and technical {{properties of the}} family of tannins. In particular, they studied their role in wine stabilisation phenomena, the peculiar ability to modify the beverages sensory perception (e. g. astringency, colour and flavour), but also the beneficial health effects (e. g. antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, possible uses as anti-cancer or against cardiovascular diseases) [1, 2]. They are traditionally classified as hydrolysable tannins (gallotannins, ellagitannins and flavonoids) [3], that are mainly derived from several plant material [4, 5], and condensed tannins, that are generally extracted from grape tissues [6]. O. I. V. identifies the tannins produced from different botanical sources as juice and <b>wine</b> <b>clarification</b> adjuvants (Recueil des methods Internationales d’analyses, 2013), while the European Authorities recognise them as flavourings and food ingredients (EU Regulation No. 2232 / 96, EC No 1334 / 2008).

40|$|Keeping of {{red wine}} in bottles is very {{important}} for its maturation and quality. However, there are numerous changes that happen during that period, usually caused by oxidative processes and changes in structure and content of polyphenolic compounds. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of Inactivated dry yeast (IDY) products on aging, phenolics content, colour stability and sensory characteristics {{of red wine}} Prokupac (Serbian autochthonous variety). The treatment of wine was done by 3 different IDYP (Lallemand, Canada) : Optimum White, Opti Less and Noblesse, applied as 0. 2 [*]g/L and 0. 4 [*]g /L during 15 days. Subsequently, <b>wine</b> <b>clarification</b> was done, followed by filtration and bottling. Untreated wines were used for comparison. Wine was subjected to accelerated aging (10 days at 55 						° 					C) and also to normal aging conditions during one year. To determine the influence of IDYP following parameters were monitored: dissolved O 2, free and total SO 2, sugar free extract, content of total phenolics, flavonoids, flavan- 3 -ols and anthocyanins, percent of polymeric color, color tint, color intensity and sensory characteristics (Panel method). The obtained results clearly show that IDY products are good scavengers of oxygen and have a positive impact on wine quality preservation and its organoleptic characteristics. However, a slight decrease of polyphenols content was detected...|$|E
40|$|Fining agents {{derived from}} animal and mineral sources {{are widely used}} to clarify and {{stabilize}} white wines. Nevertheless, health and environmental problems are being raised, concerning the allergenic and environmental impact {{of some of those}} fining products. In this study, our aim is to validate the potential of non-allergenic protein extracts, obtained from an alternative and safe source, naturally present in wine: oenological yeasts. Three untreated white wines were used in this work in order to evaluate the impact of these novel yeast protein extracts (YPE) in terms of the <b>wine</b> <b>clarification</b> and stabilization improvement. Two separated fining trials were thus conducted at laboratory scale and the yeast alternatives were compared with reference fining agents, obtained from mineral, animal and vegetable origins. Our results indicate that yeast protein extracts were capable to promote (i) brilliance/color improvement, (ii) turbidity reduction (76 - 89 % comparing with the untreated wines) and (iii) production of compact and homogeneous lees (44 % smaller volume than obtained with bentonite). Additionally, after submitting wines to natural and forced oxidations, YPE treatments revealed (iv) different forms of colloidal stabilization, by presenting comparable or superior effects when particularly compared to casein. Altogether, this study reveals that yeast protein extracts represent a promising alternative for white wine fining, derived from an entirely non-allergenic and sustainable origin...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{study was conducted}} on nine batches of wine, from the same initial wine, subjected to malolactic fermentation and ageing in barrels, under different technological conditions: Malolactic fermentation in barrel or in tank, with or without <b>wine</b> <b>clarification,</b> ageing with or without lees and stirring or no stirring of the lees. Samples were taken of the initial wine, of the wine {{at the end of}} malolactic fermentation, of the wines after clarifying treatments, and after 3, 6, 9, 12 and 14 months of ageing in the barrel, making a total of 48 wines. As a result of the anthocyanin analysis of all the wines studied, a total of 21 different anthocyanin compounds were detected, which can be classified into four groups: simple glucosides, acetyl glucosides, cinnamoyl glucosides and pyroanthocyanins. During MLF, it was shown that the effect of the container used seems to be more important than the metabolic activity of the bacteria responsible for the process. From application of the LSD test, significant differences were found in the concentrations of all the anthocyanin compounds identified due to ageing time and significant differences were also revealed for most anthocyanin compounds in relation to the manufacturing method, especially {{the presence or absence of}} lees. This study was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia (Projects AGL 2006 - 04514 and PETRI 95 - 0759 OP). We are grateful to GABARBIDE S. A.

40|$|Wine {{strains of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae have no to weak natural {{pectinase}} activity, despite their genetic ability to secrete an endo-polygalacturonase. The addition of external pectinase of fungal origin has therefore become a common step of winemaking {{in order to}} enhance the extraction of compounds located in the grape berry skins during maceration and to ease <b>wine</b> <b>clarification</b> after maturation. Recently, the strong pectinase activity of a wine strain of Saccharomyces paradoxus has been reported. In this study, the endo-polygalacturonase-encoding gene of S. paradoxus was sequenced and its activity was characterised, compared with that of S. cerevisiae and tested under winemaking conditions through overexpression of both genes individually in S. cerevisiae. A few differences in the amino acids sequences between the two proteins were revealed and the activity of the Pgu 1 enzyme of S. paradoxus was shown to be weaker under winemaking conditions. Clear indicators of extracellular activity were observed in the wines made with both recombinant strains (i. e. enzyme activity in cell-free wine, higher methanol concentration and higher free-run wine), but the actual composition of the wines fermented with the mutants was only sparingly altered. Although unexpectedly found in lower concentrations in the latter wines, phenolic compounds were shown to be the most discriminatory components. Overexpressing the PGU 1 gene of S. paradoxus or that of S. cerevisiae did not make much difference, showing that the higher activity of S. paradoxus strains under laboratory conditions could be due to a different regulation mechanism rather than to a different sequence of PGU 1. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|International audienceFor {{the first}} time in the literature, a shear {{enhanced}} process (or dynamic filtration) called Rotating and Vibrating Filtration (RVF technology) was investigated for <b>wine</b> <b>clarification.</b> The impact of membrane material (hydrophilic PES and hydrophobic PTFE with a cut-off of 0. 2 μm), wine composition (filtered wine, FW and Crude simulated wine, CSW) and operating conditions (transmembrane pressure and rotational frequency) are reported. RVF module is characterized by a complex hydrodynamic generated by a 3 flat blades impeller in a confined cell. An additional driving force is generated by rotational frequency and is taken into account to calculate the apparent and real permeabilities. Filtered wine (FW) generates an irreversible fouling whatever hydrophilic or hydrophobic membrane material. Even if PES membranes performances (Lp 0 final = 1670 L. h- 1. m- 2. bar- 1) were higher compared to those of PTFE membranes (Lp 0 final = 170 L. h- 1. m- 2. bar- 1), nor rotational frequency (mechanical stress), nor water rinsing did significantly remove or reduce fouling but, on the contrary, favors its compression and membrane plugging. Crude simulated wine (CSW) includes pectins, tannins and mannoproteins. CSW filtration runs demonstrated a mechanical impact onto fouling reduction with PES and PTFE membranes. However mechanical efficiency is moderated by material properties which generated irreversible fouling with different magnitudes. PTFE and PES permeability gains stand for + 34 % and + 300 % respectively. Finally, a “critical frequency” is defined above which a permeability increase and hydraulic resistance reduction is induced by rotational frequency (22 and 30 Hz for PES and PTFE membranes respectively) ...|$|E
30|$|Textile {{synthetic}} dyes have {{stable and}} toxic molecules. They affect biological systems by inducing mutations and causing cancer, {{when they are}} discharged in to the water bodies. Many methods are used for dye removal, they includephysical/chemical adsorption, oxidation, biological treatments (Akar et al. 2013), microbial biomass and enzyme treatments (Anjaneyulu et al. 2005). Among these, biological treatment methods especially using microbial enzymes are highly efficient for dye degradation (Peralta-Hernandez et al. 2009; Baldeva et al. 2013). Azo/synthetic dyes contain aromatic and phenolic compounds. Degradation of these compounds in azo dyes is a challenge in current research. Microbial enzymes are capable of removing phenolics and aromatic amines present in the azo dyes (Claus 2003; Casas et al. 2007). The enzyme laccase, has enormous biotechnological applications such as in paper pulp bleaching, decolorization of synthetic dyes, <b>wine</b> <b>clarification,</b> fruit juice processing, bioremediation, ethanol production, biosensors, biofuel cells, organic synthesis and drug synthesis (Mayer and Staples 2002; Hadzhiyska et al. 2006; Zhu et al. 2011). Generally industrial dyes are highly tolerant to light, temperature, oxidization. Hence enzymatic degradation is preferable over physicochemical methods of dye degradation (Niladevi and Prema 2008). Microbial enzymes have been studied mostly for terrestrial fungal strains in dye degradation (Shubo Deng et al. 2005). They are economical and {{can be applied to}} a wide range of dyes degradation process (McMullan, et al. 2001; Robinson et al. 2001; Saparrat and Hammer 2006; Xiangkang et al. 2011). Such a study in marine strains is largely wanting. Hence the present study was undertaken with the objectives of optimizing conditions required for the laccase production by T. harzianum/Hypocrea lixii TSK 8 and also enzymatic degradation of synthetic dye by using statistical method.|$|E
