5|$|In 1998, No.84 <b>Wing</b> was reorganised as {{a special}} {{transport}} <b>wing,</b> headquartered at Richmond. The Caribous were transferred to No.86 <b>Wing</b> and No.84 <b>Wing</b> took over responsibility for No.33 Squadron, operating Boeing 707 tanker-transports, and No.34 Squadron, operating VIP transports, in addition to controlling No.32 Squadron. By mid-2006, No.32 Squadron had converted to Beech King Air 350s and transferred to Air Force Training Group, while No.84 <b>Wing</b> had assumed control of No.285 Squadron and Air Movements Training and Development Unit (AMTDU). AMTDU was subsequently moved under the direct aegis of ALG, and No.33 Squadron under No.86 <b>Wing,</b> following the retirement of the 707s. No.37 Squadron, by then the RAAF's sole Hercules unit, was transferred from No.86 <b>Wing</b> to No.84 <b>Wing</b> in 2010. No.35 Squadron, which had been merged with No.38 Squadron in 2000, was re-formed under No.84 <b>Wing</b> in 2013 to operate Alenia C-27J Spartan tactical transport commencing in 2015; the squadron was detached from the <b>wing</b> in January 2014 but is scheduled to return as the Spartan becomes operational.|$|E

Consequently, Ibn al-Ashtar's left <b>wing</b> was driven back, but under Abdallah ibn Warqa' al-Saluli they collected themselves and joined Ibn al-Ashtar's right <b>wing.</b> Afterward, Ibn al-Ashtar directed the right <b>wing</b> under al-Azdi to assault the Umayyads' left <b>wing</b> in the hope that Umayr ibn al-Hubab would hold true to his promise and fall back as agreed. However, Umayr held his ground and fierce fighting ensued.|$|E

5|$|Another {{feature of}} the <b>wing</b> was its washout. The {{trailing}} edge of the <b>wing</b> twisted slightly upward along its span, the angle of incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the <b>wing</b> roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} <b>wing</b> drop, often leading to a spin. As the <b>wing</b> roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in the <b>wing</b> of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the <b>wing</b> design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the delta <b>wing.</b> The delta <b>wing</b> had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept <b>wing</b> in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large <b>wing</b> area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta <b>wing</b> also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E

The vice commander is also an assistant of the <b>wing</b> commander, serving as the coordinator of various special projects. The chief of staff {{is responsible for the}} staff members located at <b>wing</b> headquarters, who are independent of the individual squadrons. Finally, the <b>wing</b> commander is responsible for connecting the two groups and ensuring that the chief of staff uses the <b>wing</b> staff members to benefit the squadrons who receive these benefits through the vice commander.|$|E
