In my case it meant tremendous amount of reading at an early age... I read, listened to radio... I became utterly besotted with daytime serials... it enabled me {{to live in an}} imaginary world where one is comfortable with abstract ideas, dominated by stories, narrative, and characters.|$|E
500|$|According to Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine, Late Registration {{serves as}} an {{exhibition}} of [...] "the stealthy power of West's storytelling." [...] West stated that his goal for the album was to touch on topics that {{people from all walks}} of life could find relatable, while remaining true to himself: [...] " [...] raps that were just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith." [...] The opening track [...] "Heard 'Em Say" [...] is a [...] "mournfully contemplative" [...] song that [...] "talks about being honest <b>with</b> <b>yourself</b> in a world that is not." [...] The song is written from the perspective of an afflicted, impoverished American quietly lamenting the fallacies of society and questioning the ways of the world around him. West delivers a tongue-in-cheek lyrical narrative within [...] "Gold Digger" [...] in which he critically depicts the disastrous life of a man married to a woman who manipulates him for financial gain. However, another story arises within the third verse, which illustrates a once destitute black male who earns a fortune and decides to leave a loyal, unselfish girlfriend for a white woman.|$|E
500|$|Rangel rose {{rapidly in}} the House, due to his {{political}} skills, hard work, knowledge of legislative matters, and genial manner. [...] In 1974, {{he became the first}} black ever named to the House Committee on Ways and Means, a position he assumed in 1975 (and left the Judiciary Committee), and by 1979 had become the chairman of its important Subcommittee on Health. [...] In 1976, he was named to the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. [...] By 1979, Rangel {{was a member of the}} influential House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. [...] Rangel combined his solidly liberal views–interest group ratings in 1978 indicated he was the most liberal member of the New York State congressional delegation–with a pragmatic approach towards finding political and legislative compromises. [...] Rangel built alliances with others in Congress (collaborating for example with Michigan Republican Guy Vander Jagt on welfare reform measures), with people in governmental agencies, and with the Carter administration. [...] In some cases Rangel was criticized for being too pragmatic, such as when he switched his position on natural gas deregulation; Rangel denied that he did so in exchange for the authorization of a new federal building in Harlem. [...] Rangel said of himself, [...] "I guess I'm practical, but you have to live <b>with</b> <b>yourself</b> and make sure you are not so practical that you sell out a part of yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have <b>with</b> <b>yourself,</b> with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

2500|$|Castle {{remained}} in cabinet until Wilson's resignation in April 1976. The {{head of the}} Downing Street policy unit, Bernard Donoughue, records in his diary that he warned Wilson that Castle's dogged pursuit of personal policy stances on public health would [...] "wreck the NHS". Donoughue claims that Wilson agreed, but admitted he would leave it to his successor to resolve. Castle lost her place as a cabinet minister when her bitter political enemy James Callaghan took over from Wilson as prime minister in 1976 and dismissed her almost immediately upon taking office. In an interview many years later, discussing her removal from office by Callaghan, she claimed that the Prime Minister had told her he wanted [...] "somebody younger" [...] in the Cabinet, to which she famously remarked that perhaps the most restrained thing she had ever achieved in her life was not to reply with [...] "Then why not start <b>with</b> <b>yourself,</b> Jim?" [...] (Callaghan was four years older than Wilson, the man he was replacing).|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, Haggard and {{his third}} wife Leona Williams {{divorced}} after five stormy years of marriage. The split served as a license to party for Haggard, who {{spent much of the}} next decade becoming mired in alcohol and drug problems. Haggard has stated that he was in his own mid-life crisis, or [...] "male menopause," [...] around this time. He said in an interview from this period: [...] "Things that you've enjoyed for years don't seem nearly as important, and you're at war <b>with</b> <b>yourself</b> as to what's happening. [...] 'Why don't I like that anymore? [...] Why do I like this now?' And finally, I think you actually go through a biological change, you just, you become another.... Your body is getting ready to die and your mind doesn't agree." [...] He was briefly a heavy user of cocaine, but managed to kick the habit. Despite these issues, he won a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance for his 1984 remake of [...] "That's The Way Love Goes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sackville-West {{constantly}} {{sought to}} improve Woolf's self-esteem, telling {{her not to}} think of herself as a sickly semi-reclusive who needed to hide herself from the world, but rather praised her for her health, her liveliness and sense of wit, her intelligence and achievements as a writer. Sackville-West led Woolf to a reappraisal of herself, helping her to develop a more positive self-image, and a sense that her writings were the products of her strengths, rather than her weakness. From the age of 15 on, Woolf had been led to believe by her father's doctor and her father that reading and writing had a deleterious effect on her nerves, and she needed to engage in physical labour like gardening to prevent a total collapse of her nerves, leading Woolf to spend her time obsessively engaging in physical labor. Woolf tended to push herself relentlessly until illness, whether real or imagined, became the only way that she could relax without guilt. Sackville-West was the first to persuade Woolf that her nervous aliments had been misdiagnosed, and she was better to engage in reading and writing to calm her nerves, advice that was taken. Under her influence, Woolf learned to spend her time switching from one form of intellectual activity to another, from writing a novel to a book review to reading a book, instead of spending her time in physical activities that sapped her strength. In 1925, Sackville-West wrote to Woolf: [...] "Why do you give so much of your energies to the manuscripts of other people? You told me in London that you had at least six novels in your head but were being severe <b>with</b> <b>yourself</b> until you should go to Rodmell. Now you are at Rodmell and what of the six novels? Between Ottoline, Gertrude Stein, and bridal parties which cause you to faint, what time is there for Virginia?" [...] Sackville-West tried to persuade Woolf to learn to relax without guilt, telling her she would feel better if she only learned to rest.|$|E
