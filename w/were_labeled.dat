5|$|In 1832, James S. Mason of Philadelphia {{began the}} {{commercial}} production of shoe blacking and inks. In 1851, James S. Mason & Co. constructed a building at 138/140 Front St. where ultimately ten million boxes were produced annually, to hold tins of blacking produced by two hundred employees. Later, tins of blacking <b>were</b> <b>labeled</b> as Mason Shoe Polish. This business ceased operation in 1919 {{and the building}} was razed in 1973.|$|E
5|$|On June 21, 2011, it was {{announced}} that a new Halloween film, at the time titled Halloween 3D, would be released on October 26, 2012. At the time of the announcement, there was no director or writer attached to the project. Originally, Patrick Lussier and Todd Farmer <b>were</b> <b>labeled</b> as writers but dropped out due to their occupancy on the Hellraiser reboot. There was no confirmation if a new script had been written or if any cast or crew members from previous films in the series would be involved. The film was dropped from the release schedule on October 26, 2012, as no work had progressed on the film.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Session {{also had}} a {{negative}} impact on several leading Soviet academic neuroscientists, such as Pyotr Anokhin, Aleksey Speransky, Lina Stern, Ivan Beritashvili, and Leon Orbeli. They <b>were</b> <b>labeled</b> as anti-Pavlovians, anti-materialists and reactionaries and subsequently they were dismissed from their positions. In addition to losing their laboratories some of these scientists were subjected to torture in prison. The Moscow, Leningrad, Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian schools of neuroscience and neurophysiology were damaged for a period due to this loss of personnel. The Joint Session ravaged productive research in neurosciences and psychiatry for years to come. Pseudo-science took control.|$|E

50|$|Carrillo used many intervals, {{although}} {{mainly in}} multiples of 4 such as 16, 32, and 64 so that between {{each of the}} whole tones, 16, 32, or 64 additional notes were created. Carrillo called these intervals 16hs of a tone, 32nds of a tone, and 64ths of a tone, respectively. As a result, C would <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> 0, D flat would <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> 8, D would <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> 16, E flat would <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> 24, E would <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> 32, etc., for 16ths of a tone.|$|R
5|$|The Sachsen {{class of}} four ships {{was built in}} the late 1870s to early 1880s. The ships—, , , and —were {{designed}} to operate as part of an integrated coastal defense network. The ships were intended to sortie from fortified bases to break up an enemy blockade or landing attempt, and <b>were</b> <b>labeled</b> as Ausfallkorvetten (sortie corvettes) by the Imperial Navy. As a result of their intended roles, they were given a short cruising radius and were not intended for high-seas operations. Armed with six 26cm guns, they were, however, intended to fight hostile ironclads on relatively equal terms.|$|E
5|$|The final {{versions}} of the sonatas convey {{the impression of a}} single unit, and were likely notated in close succession during September 1828. The sonatas <b>were</b> <b>labeled</b> Sonate I, II, III, respectively, and Schubert wrote {{at the bottom of the}} last folio of the third sonata the date September 26. As compared to the sketches, the final versions are written much more neatly and orderly, with full notation and greater care for small details.|$|E
5|$|The basic prototypes of the M32 {{were created}} by Lima Locomotive on January 11, 1943. The prototypes <b>were</b> <b>labeled</b> T5, T5E1, T5E2, T5E3, and T5E4. These designs competed against the T2 and T7 designs, which both had a turret mounted boom, at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. The T5 was {{declared}} superior to the T2 and T7 designs after several weeks of testing. The four prototypes were sent to Aberdeen (T5 and T5E1), Camp Hood (T5E2), and Camp Seely (T5E4). However, during the testing the T5E3's engine was damaged, so it could not go through further testing. OCM 21553 standardized the designs of the T5, T5E1, T5E2, T5E3, and the T5E4 as the M32, M32E1, M32E2, M32E3, and the M32E4 in June 1943. This protocol also terminated the T7 project. However, the M32E4 did not enter production. Many M32s were converted into M34 Prime Movers, which were used to tow heavy artillery. The M34s were unarmed, and had special equipment to pull heavy artillery.|$|E

5|$|The {{research}} Fischbach {{conducted at}} Columbia University stemmed from his previous work at Harvard University, Washington University {{and with the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute of Health. The specialized focus of his research was on the influence trophic factors could have on the survival of nerve cells and the efficiency of synapses. After his arrival to Columbia, Fischbach {{was focused on the}} expression of neuregulin in regards to neuromuscular synapses, signaling pathways in the brain, transcription factors, as well as work on autism. His research on Neuregulin-1 revealed a possible function in CNS neurogenesis since the neuregulins <b>were</b> <b>labeled</b> throughout proliferation with an anti-MAP2 antibody and an anti-nestin antibody were suggested to have become neuron-restricted progenitors. Some of his other research examined the relationship between neuregulin and expression of myosin heavy chain and transcription factors in human muscle. The research found that treatment including neuregulin increased the number of acetylcholine receptors {{on the surface of the}} myotube as well as an increase in the early growth response family for transcription factors. These findings impact the available knowledge regarding muscle spindle fiber formation, myosin heavy chains development, and the feasibility of mimicking muscle development processes in vitro.|$|E

25|$|Jainism {{along with}} Buddhism has been {{categorized}} as atheist philosophy i.e. Nāstika darśana by {{the followers of}} Vedic religion.
