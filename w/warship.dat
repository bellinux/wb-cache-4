5|$|His {{next project}} was to develop Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, which became the world's largest shipyard. Opened as Chesapeake Dry Dock & Construction Company, the {{shipbuilding}} was intended to build boats to transition goods from the rails to the seas. With president Theodore Roosevelt's declaration to create a Great White Fleet, the company entered the <b>warship</b> business by building seven of the first sixteen warships. Today, the shipyard holds a dominant position in the American <b>warship</b> construction business.|$|E

5|$|After visiting Cavite on Luzon, the gunboat {{headed for}} Japan on 3 April and {{underwent}} repairs there from 9 April to 19 May before {{heading back to}} the Philippines. The <b>warship</b> arrived at Cavite on 27 May and resumed patrols on 3 June. She spent another seven months conducting patrols in the Philippines and supporting the Army’s operations in the island chain. On 3 January 1901, she departed Cavite and shaped a course for Hong Kong. The gunboat arrived in that British colony on the 6th and began over six months of repairs. At the completion of that work, she departed Hong Kong on 25 June. After a visit to Shanghai, the <b>warship</b> headed back to the United States in July and arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 19 August. She was decommissioned there on 5 September 1901.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{landed on}} Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942 and seized an airfield, later called Henderson Field, that was under {{construction}} by the Japanese military. There were several subsequent {{attempts by the}} Imperial Japanese Army and Navy, using reinforcements delivered to Guadalcanal by ship, to recapture the airfield, which ultimately failed. In early November 1942, the Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the airfield. Several Japanese <b>warship</b> forces were assigned to bombard Henderson Field {{with the goal of}} destroying Allied aircraft that posed a threat to the convoy. Learning of the Japanese reinforcement effort, U.S. forces launched aircraft and <b>warship</b> attacks to defend Henderson Field and prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal.|$|E

5|$|For three hours, Experiment battled the barges, sinking two {{and killing}} {{a great many}} of the picaroons. During this time two of the barges left the <b>warship</b> and {{attacked}} the merchant ships. These barges managed to protect themselves from Experiment by sailing behind the schooner Mary, which was between the two barges and the <b>warship.</b> The Haitians boarded Mary and killed her captain. Many of the crew jumped into the sea, and the rest hid in the hold. The second barge attempted to take Daniel and Mary but was sunk by fire from Experiment. Once the Haitians had boarded Mary, Experiment opened fire upon her with grapeshot, driving the picaroons off.|$|E

50|$|From {{the early}} 1820s, the British Navy began {{building}} {{a number of}} small steam <b>warships,</b> and by the 1830s many navies were experimenting with steam-powered <b>warships.</b> This first generation of steam <b>warships,</b> termed 'paddle warships' (in the categories of frigate, sloop, gunvessel or other), used paddlewheels mounted on either the sides or in the center. The ships were equipped with large guns, generally mounted on one deck (although some larger paddle <b>warships</b> carried guns on two deck levels). Paddlewheels were proven in a number of Admiralty trials to be less efficient than the propeller or 'screw', and more vulnerable to damage, and from the late 1840s onwards navies began to build screw-driven steam <b>warships.</b>|$|R
