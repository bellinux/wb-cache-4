[...] Jackson continued, [...] "I think right around the midway point of [...] season the show decided what it wanted to be. From about the midway, point it got on a pretty good streak of episodes. I can’t remember the exact number, but the two-part episode where Dunham gets kidnapped.

500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by Rob Thomas and John Enbom and {{directed}} by John T. Kretchmer, marking Thomas' sixth writing credit for Veronica Mars, Enbom's tenth writing credit for the series, and Kretchmer's ninth directing credit for the show. [...] "Not Pictured" [...] reveals Cassidy [...] "Beaver" [...] Casablancas as the perpetrator behind Veronica's rape and the bus crash. Thomas and the crew had planned for Beaver to be the second season antagonist since the character's first appearance in [...] "M.A.D.". Thomas said, [...] "We knew that Beaver was the killer of Season 2 when <b>we</b> <b>introduced</b> him in Season 1. We knew his motivation, so playing him as the picked-upon, less-manly Casablancas boy was all by design." [...] An episode earlier in the series, titled [...] "A Trip to the Dentist", supposedly revealed that Duncan had had sex with Veronica {{when they were both}} under the influence of drugs, a fact which is potentially negated by this episode. When writing the episode, Thomas and Diane Ruggiero did not plan for Beaver to be the actual rapist, with Thomas saying that [...] "I wish I could claim that we were that clever." ...|$|E

2500|$|We agonised {{over the}} {{inclusion}} of [...] "Yesterday" [...] in the show. It is such a famous song, the icon of an era, but had it been heard too much? The story of {{the addition of the}} original string quartet is well known, however, few people know how limited the recording was technically, and so the case for not including it was strong, but how could we ignore such a marvellous work? <b>We</b> <b>introduced</b> it with some of Paul's guitar work from [...] "Blackbird", and hearing it now, I know it was right to include it. Its simplicity is so direct; it tugs at the heartstrings.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the world}} record attempt, Dr. Wolfgang Schreiber, President of Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S, said “When <b>we</b> <b>introduced</b> the Vitesse, we {{established}} the top speed for open-top driving to be 375 km/h. Still, we could not {{let go of the}} idea of reaching the 400 km/h mark with this car as well. The fact that we have succeeded in reaching 408.84 km/h is a thrill for me, and it reaffirms once again that Bugatti is the leader when it comes to technology in the international automotive industry." [...] The driver, Anthony Liu, claimed [...] "Even at such high speeds it remained incredibly comfortable and stable. With an open top, you can really experience the sound of the engine and yet even at higher speeds I did not get compromised by the wind at all.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On Wills' {{return to}} Tulsa late in 1957, Jim Downing of the Tulsa Tribune {{wrote an article}} headlined [...] "Wills Brothers Together Again: Bob Back With Heavy Beat". The article quotes Wills as saying, [...] "Rock and Roll? Why, man, that's {{the same kind of}} music we've been playin' since 1928!... We didn't call it rock and roll back when <b>we</b> <b>introduced</b> it as our style back in 1928, and we don't call it rock and roll the way we play it now. But it's just basic rhythm and has gone by a lot of {{different}} names in my time. It's the same, whether you just follow a drum beat like in Africa or surround it with a lot of instruments. The rhythm's what's important." [...] The use of amplified guitars accentuates Wills's claim; some Bob Wills recordings from the 1930s and 1940s sound similar to rock and roll records of the 1950s.|$|E
