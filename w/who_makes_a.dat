5|$|More recently, several legal {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} by French jurists. These generally consider it likely that Le Gris was the real culprit based on Marguerite's evidence, although none of course could prove so conclusively. A major exception to this trend was a book written in 1890 by a descendant of Le Gris named F. White Le Grix, <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> determined effort to defend his ancestor.Jager, p.206 Most recently, the story was studied in Eric Jager's work The Last Duel, which also considers Le Gris the likely rapist and has attracted the interest of Martin Scorsese, who is reportedly planning to make a feature film based on the book.|$|E
5|$|Attorneys {{have long}} used {{peremptory}} challenges to exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E
25|$|The use of evidentiality has pragmatic {{implications}} in languages {{that do not}} mark evidentiality distinctly from epistemic modality.

25|$|In October 2014, Universal {{released}} the action horror film Dracula Untold. Luke Evans portrays the title character, with Sarah Gadon and Dominic Cooper in supporting roles. Rather than adapting Stoker's original novel, the film creates an origin story for Dracula by portraying {{the story of}} Vlad the Impaler, <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> deal with an ancient vampire to obtain dark powers {{in order to save}} his kingdom from an advancing Turkish army. In this version, Dracula is depicted as an anti-hero instead of a villain, as he is determined to protect his family and people at all costs.|$|E
25|$|The same year, Ryan {{was cast}} in the action thriller Proof of Life with Russell Crowe, {{directed}} by Taylor Hackford. In the film, she portrayed the distraught wife of a kidnapped engineer, played by David Morse, while relying on a resourceful troubleshooter <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> profession of dealing with international bandits. While the film became a lukewarm critical and commercial success, grossing $63million worldwide, it garnered much reportage in the tabloid press in association with Ryan and Crowe's affair. Stephen Holden, film critic for The New York Times, did not think the film worked well and opined that the actors did not connect.|$|E
25|$|The race {{begins with}} a warm-up lap, after which the cars {{assemble}} on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap {{is often referred to}} as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> mistake may regain lost ground provided he has not fallen to the back of the field). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid.|$|E

25|$|Lord Lowborough, {{a friend}} of Huntingdon's and Anabella's husband, is apathetic but devoted. Melancholic, dour and gloomy, he is in {{complete}} contrast to Huntingdon. He used to gamble and drink too much alcohol and developed an addiction to opium, but after his financial ruin gradually reforms himself. Lowborough truly loves Annabella, and her infidelity brings him such suffering that only his Christian faith and strong will keep him from suicide. Later he divorces her and after some time marries a plain middle-aged woman, <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> good wife to him and a stepmother to his children with Annabella — {{a son and a}} nominal daughter. Lord Lowborough also has some resemblances to Branwell, such as a life of debauchery, periods of remorse/religious torments, and opium, as well as moral weakness.|$|E
25|$|Several of {{the major}} cast members return from {{previous}} Judd Apatow projects: Seth Rogen, Martin Starr, Jason Segel, and James Franco all starred in the short-lived, cult television series Freaks and Geeks which Apatow produced.

25|$|While many Americans cite {{income as}} the prime {{determinant}} of class, occupational status, educational attainment, and value systems are equally important variables. Income is in part determined by the scarcity of certain skill sets. An occupation that requires a scarce skill set which is attained through higher educational degree, and which involves higher autonomy, responsibility and influence, will usually offer higher economic compensation. Qualifying for such higher income often requires that individuals obtain the necessary skills (e.g., by attending law, medical, or postgraduate school) and demonstrate the necessary competencies. There are also differences between household and individual income. In 2005, 42% of US households (76% among the top quintile) had two or more income earners; as a result, 18% of households but only 5% of individuals had six-figure incomes. To illustrate, two nurses each making $55,000 per year can out-earn, in a household sense, a single attorney <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> median of $95,000 annually.|$|E
