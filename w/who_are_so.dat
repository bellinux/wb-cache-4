25|$|Heidegger {{theorized that}} Dasein exists {{as an agent}} who is always-already engaged in a world with other human beings. Charles Taylor built on Heidegger's work {{when he talked about}} engaged agency, or the idea that Dasein is an agent inescapably engaged in his world. What Heidegger, and later Taylor, are saying is that that world is {{constantly}} “there-for-us” to experience prior to any abstract, disengaged scientific theorizing, and this is where hermeneutics starts to deviate from mainstream psychological and personality theories. In other words, Dasein (a person) does not need to scientifically analyze human interaction to take part in it. All he needs to do is observe human interaction, interpret what those observations mean for him, and then participate accordingly. Heidegger termed this description as being-in-the-world, i.e. human beings exist in the world as active participants <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> deeply immersed that their world around them becomes utterly inescapable, especially when trying to understand themselves.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, in a {{building}} within the lower quarter of the city, mosaics depicting the head of Dionysus and Oceanus and Tethys with sea creatures were discovered. From 1996 onward, {{with the threat of}} being submerged under the waters of the new dam, salvage excavations were carried out by C. Abadie Reynal of Nantes University in France, together with archaeologists from Gaziantep and Şanlıurfa museums. In 1999 a mosaic pavement depicting the mythological Minos bull was discovered at Mezarliküstü, {{and at the end of}} the excavation season, further mosaics were visible at the thresholds of other rooms. Not wishing to leave the mosaics at the mercy of the treasure hunters <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> active in the area, the acting director of Gaziantep Museum, Fatma Bulgan, decided to continue excavations through the winter months. Despite difficult weather conditions they went on to uncover a fountain with its own tank at a depth of three metres, a marble figure of Apollo, as well as, another mosaic pavement with nine figures depicting Achilles being taken by Odysseus to fight in the Trojan War.|$|E

25|$|Responsible men {{can become}} more deeply {{convinced}} of {{the truth of the}} doctrine laid down by the Church on this issue if they reflect on the consequences of methods and plans for artificial birth control. Let them first consider how easily this course of action could open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards. Not much experience is needed to be fully aware of human weakness and to understand that human beings—and especially the young, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> exposed to temptation—need incentives to keep the moral law, and it is an evil thing to make it easy for them to break that law. Another effect that gives cause for alarm is that a man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman, and, disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium, reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires, no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection.|$|E
500|$|The {{dominant}} {{theme in}} Joehana's work is social criticism, particularly regarding socioeconomic conditions. In Rasiah nu Goreng Patut, he criticised those who sought material wealth above {{all other things}} through the Eulis Awang and her family, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> enraptured by their greed {{that they do not}} realize that the man asking for Eulis Awang's hand in marriage is not who he claims to be. In Tjarios Eulis Atjih, the main characters Arsad and Eulis Atjih, while both exemplifying greed and its inevitable repercussions, further show that wealth is not eternal: both lose their wealth and societal positions, then must earn a living. In the novel, Johanna calls on the rich to support and defend the poor, not despise them. That both rich and poor should receive equal treatment is emphasised in Tjarios Agan Permas: ...|$|E
500|$|Well, what {{happened}} there is, of course—now all of you must adjust your brains—the biggest work of art there has ever been. The fact that spirits achieve with one act something which we in music could never dream of, that people practise ten years madly, fanatically for a concert. And then die. [...] And that is the greatest work of art that exists for the whole Cosmos. Just imagine {{what happened}} there. There are people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> concentrated on this single performance, and then five thousand people are driven to Resurrection. In one moment. I couldn't do that. Compared to that, we are nothing, as composers. [...] It is a crime, you know of course, because the people did not agree to it. They {{did not come to}} the [...] "concert". That is obvious.

500|$|The part of John Munch {{was based}} on Jay Landsman, a {{practical}} joker who was known in his homicide unit for his morbid wit. Both Belzer and the character Munch he portrays are cynical, caustic former hippies <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> similar that Belzer declared the character [...] "exactly as I would be if I were a cop". Stanley Bolander was inspired by Detective Donald Worden who, like his on-screen counterpart, was nicknamed [...] "The Big Man". Ned Beatty only met Worden once before taking on the role, {{and he said the}} detective had [...] "an uncluttered mind and a near-photographic memory". Beau Felton {{was based on}} Detective Donald Kincaid, and Felton's clashes with Pembleton were based on Kincaid's real-life strong dislike for Harry Edgerton. Kay Howard was based in part on the female Detective Bert Silver, and in part on the male Detective Rich Garvey, who experienced a real-life string of good luck in solving consecutive cases, just as Howard did in the first season.|$|E
500|$|Cortese {{believed}} that Ruby {{fell in love}} with Sam {{over the course of the}} season, though she questioned whether this was [...] "true love" [...] or her being [...] "in love with what he can do". As Cortese noted, [...] "He has something she can nurture. It's almost like a mother bear and her cub [...] how protective she is... Sam's all , so it's almost like giving birth, in a weird, messed-up way." [...] She stated that the sex scene between her character and Sam was [...] "about two people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> broken and sad" [...] and compared it to similar sex scenes from the film Monster's Ball. Although Ruby eventually reveals herself as a traitor, Kripke wrote her final scene with the intention of depicting Ruby as [...] "the opposite of evil" [...] and to show that Ruby does care about Sam, despite her manipulation of him to free Lucifer; Kripke explained that, in Ruby's mind, she had to lead Sam down that path because [...] "it was for his own good".|$|E
500|$|Williamson {{included}} {{the death of}} the character Principal Himbry (Winkler) based on this input and in doing so inadvertently resolved a problem in the script's finale. Williamson had struggled to find a reason for several extraneous characters to leave a party scene so that the killer could attack, finally determining that the announcement of the discovery of Himbry's corpse would serve to remove the non-essential characters <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> upset that they leave the party before (and enabling) the start of the murders. Concerning the killers' motives, Williamson felt it was essential for the audience to learn why the antagonists had become killers, but he also felt it was potentially scarier if they had no motivation. Opinions at the studio were split between those who believed a motive was needed for resolution and those who felt the action was scarier without one. As there were two killers, Williamson decided to do both: Billy Loomis had the motive of maternal abandonment, while the second killer, Stu Macher, jokingly suggests [...] "peer pressure" [...] as his motive when prompted.|$|E

[...] Heigl was critical of her character's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George, which she deemed [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot." [...] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that: People <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> infallible, perfect and moral tend {{to be the first to}} slip and fall. But I would love to see how she deals with the consequences of what she's done, because what’s interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.' I'd like to see Izzie take some culpability.|$|E

2500|$|The {{extensive}} use of stereotypes is another controversial aspect of the show, though the intent is actually {{to make fun of}} bigotry.

2500|$|I brought Beyoncé {{a number}} of {{references}} and we picked some out together. Most were German modern-dance references, believe it or not. But it really evolved.

The letter was addressed to her as “Walker-Black”. Walker had never been married, didn’t use a hyphenated name, and had never had the last name Black. It appeared as if someone forgot to remove the race notation before signing and sending out that letter. James Anderson, Lindner's lawyer, apologized to Walker saying it was a [...] "simple mistake.

[...] The lawyer said [...] "Basically, it's a tempest in a teapot," [...] he said, adding that [...] "some people are just hypersensitive if from a simple mistake they can call someone a racist." [...] Walker responded, [...] "It's easy to say that when you're not on the receiving of a racist comment, but racist attacks are emotionally and mentally draining. And I am far from sensitive.

2500|$|A new Christmas special episode {{aired on}} 25 December 2007 on BBC One, in which pop star George Michael made a guest appearance. He was {{featured}} in several scenes with Irish nurse, Bernie, including one kissing scene. The character of Lauren {{was killed in a}} kayaking accident during the episode. Rumours had emerged about this story line in July 2007. Kathy Burke and Tamzin Outhwaite also guest starred, and the special averaged with 6.4 million viewers. The episode was subject to criticism when some viewers complained about the amount of swearing, and accused Tate of bigotry over the depiction of a family from Northern Ireland as terrorists, whose Christmas presents included a balaclava and a pair of knuckle dusters, in reference to The Troubles. A statement was issued from the BBC that read [...] "Catherine Tate creates characters <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> over the top as to be almost cartoon-like and this is where her genius lies. Her comedy is never meant to offend any viewer and is always based on satire and grotesque exaggeration." [...] After the complaints were made, an Ofcom report later concluded that the show was not offensive and did not violate broadcasting regulations. An extract from the Ofcom report read [...] "Overall this episode was typical of the Catherine Tate Show and would not have gone beyond the expectations of its usual audience. For those not familiar with the show, the information given at the start was adequate." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1885, {{after his}} return to America, Judge set about to revitalize the Movement in the United States. The real {{beginning}} {{of the work of}} Theosophy in the United States began in 1886, when Judge established The Path, an independent Theosophical magazine. Until this time, not much had been accomplished in the way of growth of the Society in America. [...] Mr. Judge addressed the common man in homely language and with simple reason. The Path showed that he had found himself and was now cultivating the area of his greatest usefulness, as a writer. His natural interest in the welfare of others affected everything he did, so that his articles and Theosophical talks are cast in the idiom of the common man.In his first editorial, he wrote: [...] "It is not thought that utopia can be established in a day...Certainly, if we all say that it is useless...nothing will ever be done. A beginning must be made and it has been made by the Theosophical society...Riches are accumulating {{in the hands of the}} few while the poor are ground harder every day as they increase in number...All this points unerringly to a vital error somewhere...What is wanted is true knowledge of the spiritual condition of man, his aim, and destiny...those who must begin the reform are those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> fortunate as to be placed in the world where they can see and think out the problems all are endeavouring to solve, even if they know that the great day may not come until after their death." ...|$|E
