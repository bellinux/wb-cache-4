25|$|For {{some of the}} Indian tribes, the {{elimination}} of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally, although other tribes were not so affected. The Ohio Country was now more available to colonial settlement, due {{to the construction of}} military roads by Braddock and Forbes. The Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory was not completed until 1769, and it had modest repercussions. The British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of Indian tribes who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>business</b> with them. This migration also caused a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek, historic enemies who were now competing for land. The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave. Most went to Cuba, including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine, although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico.|$|E

They further contend that sweatshop jobs are not necessarily inevitable.

[...] People critical of sweatshops believe that [...] "free trade agreements" [...] do not truly promote free trade at all but instead seek to protect multinational corporations from competition by local industries (which are sometimes unionized).
