25|$|For {{any given}} level of {{clinical}} impairment, {{there is a}} higher degree of neuropathological change in the brains of those Alzheimer's disease sufferers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> in greater number of activities. This is true even when education and IQ are controlled for. This suggests that differences in lifestyle may increase cognitive reserve by making the individual more resilient. Mortimer et al. performed cognitive testing on a population of 678 nuns in 1997, in which they showed that different levels of cognitive activity and performance were possible in patients diagnosed with Alzheimers. One subject showing reduced neocortical plaques survived with mild deficits, despite (or due to) low brain weight.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have found}} that {{men are more likely}} to engage in extramarital sex if they are {{unsatisfied}} sexually, while women are {{more likely to engage in}} extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that sexual satisfaction may be more important to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, & Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass & Wright also found that men and women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.|$|E

500|$|The Itchy & Scratchy Show (often {{shortened}} as Itchy & Scratchy) is {{a running}} gag and fictional animated television series {{featured in the}} American animated television series The Simpsons. It usually appears {{as a part of}} The Krusty the Clown Show, watched regularly by Bart Simpson and Lisa Simpson. Itself an animated cartoon, The Itchy & Scratchy Show depicts a sadistic anthropomorphic blue mouse, Itchy (voiced by Dan Castellaneta), who repeatedly maims and kills an anthropomorphic, hapless threadbare black cat, Scratchy (voiced by Harry Shearer). The cartoon first appeared in The Tracey Ullman Show short [...] "The Bart Simpson Show", which originally aired November 20, 1988. The cartoon's first appearance in The Simpsons was in the 1990 episode [...] "There's No Disgrace Like Home". Typically presented as 15-to-60-second-long cartoons, the show is filled with gratuitous violence. The Simpsons also occasionally features characters <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> with the production of The Itchy & Scratchy Show, including Roger Meyers Jr. (voiced by Alex Rocco, and, later, Hank Azaria), who runs the studio and produces the show.|$|E
500|$|FIFA's {{decision}} to choose [...] "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" [...] {{as the official}} song was negatively received by South African people, who felt Shakira was not the [...] "right person to represent the country's first World Cup," [...] arguing that an African artist should have been assigned the role. South African musicians were also displeased regarding the lack of native acts scheduled to perform at the FIFA World Cup Kick-Off Celebration Concert on 10 June 2010. They expressed anger towards the South African Football Association (SAFA) for letting international artists like Alicia Keys, the Black Eyed Peas, and Shakira to headline the event. Subsequently, the Creative Workers Union of South Africa planned a demonstration to be held on 15 April, but called it off after SAFA announced that the repertoire of performing acts would be finalised after [...] "consultation with fans and host cities." [...] Danny Jordaan, head of the South African World Cup Organising Committee and president of SAFA, released a statement assuring that [...] "the incredibly talented South African and African music industry will play a major part in the tournament's off-field success and character." [...] Freshlyground's violinist Kyla-Rose Smith defended FIFA's {{decision to}} select [...] "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" [...] as the official song, saying: [...] "I think that the World Cup is a global event but it’s also a business, a huge marketing exercise. FIFA requires a musician of a certain global reach to appeal to all {{the different kinds of}} people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> and witness and watch the World Cup.
