25|$|Popper {{regarded}} {{theories that}} have survived criticism as better corroborated {{in proportion to}} the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, {{in sharp contrast to the}} inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true. Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are lots of <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).|$|E
25|$|Thermoplastics are a {{category}} of polymers that can be reheated and reshaped, {{and there are several}} <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can be used to create a bicycle frame. One implementation of thermoplastic bicycle frames are essentially carbon fiber frames with the fibers embedded in a thermoplastic material rather than the more common thermosetting epoxy materials. GT Bicycles {{was one of the first}} major manufacturers to produce a thermoplastic frame with their STS System frames in the mid 1990s. The carbon fibers were loosely woven into a tube along with fibers of thermoplastic. This tube was placed into a mould with a bladder inside which was then inflated to force the carbon and plastic tube against the inside of the mould. The mould was then heated to melt the thermoplastic. Once the thermoplastic cooled it was removed from the mould in its final form.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, the Students' Representative Council (SRC) was {{established}} to provide representation to the institution's students in relations with management and staff, this was {{in contrast to the}} mainly social activities of the SUS and the WSH, who were both recognised societies of the SRC. The SRC had offices on University Square, close to the WSH premises and held its meetings in the Union building. These three student organisations came together in 1965 to address <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could work better and be more inclusive of all students at the University, in advance of the opening of a new Union building opposite the main Lanyon Building on University Road. This resulted in the establishment of a combined constitution for the three which were {{to be known as the}} Students' Representative Council of the Students' Union, which took effect from 1 October 1966. Its name was shortened to the Students' Union in 1975, with the SRC renamed the Students' Union Council in the early 2000s.|$|E

25|$|Unions {{have made}} some {{attempts}} to organize across borders. Eder observes that transnational organizing {{is not a new}} phenomenon but has been facilitated by technological change. Nevertheless, he claims that while unions pay lip service to global solidarity, they still act largely in their national self-interest. He argues that unions in the global North are becoming increasingly depoliticized while those in the South grow politically, and that global differentiation of production processes leads to divergent strategies and interests in different regions of the world. These structural differences tend to hinder effective global solidarity. However, in light of the weakness of international labor, Herod writes that globalization of production need not be met by a globalization of union strategies in order to be contained. Herod also points out that local strategies, such as the United Auto Workers' strike against General Motors in 1998, can sometimes effectively interrupt global production processes in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not before the advent of widespread market integration. Thus, workers need not be connected organizationally to others around the world to effectively influence the behavior of a transnational corporation.|$|E
500|$|Bikes, {{as complex}} mechanisms, {{have a variety}} of modes: {{fundamental}} <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can move. These modes can be stable or unstable, depending on the bike parameters and its forward speed. In this context, [...] "stable" [...] means that an uncontrolled bike will continue rolling forward without falling over as long as forward speed is maintained. Conversely, [...] "unstable" [...] means that an uncontrolled bike will eventually fall over, even if forward speed is maintained. The modes can be differentiated by the speed at which they switch stability and the relative phases of leaning and steering as the bike experiences that mode. Any bike motion consists of a combination of various amounts of the possible modes, and there are three main modes that a bike can experience: capsize, weave, and wobble. A lesser known mode is rear wobble, and it is usually stable.|$|E
500|$|Feminist {{economics}} often {{assert that}} power relations exist within the economy, and therefore, must be assessed in economic models in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> previously have been overlooked. For example, in [...] "neoclassical texts, {{the sale of}} labor {{is viewed as a}} mutually beneficial exchange that benefits both parties. [...] No mention is made of the power inequities in the exchange which tend to give the employer power over the employee." [...] These power relations often favor men and there is [...] "never any mention made of the particular difficulties that confront women in the workplace." [...] Consequently, [...] "Understanding power and patriarchy helps us to analyze how male-dominated economic institutions actually function and why women are often at a disadvantage in the workplace." [...] Feminist economists often extend these criticisms to many aspects of the social world, arguing that power relations are an endemic and important feature of society.|$|E

500|$|Chinese {{immigrants}} to the United States were met with considerable distrust, resentment, and discrimination almost {{from the time of}} their first arrival. [...] Many politicians argued that the Chinese were so different in so many <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> not only would never (or even could) assimilate into American culture, but that they represented a threat to the country's principles and institutions. [...] In this climate of popular anti-Chinese sentiment, Congress in 1882 enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act, which placed limits on Chinese immigration to the United States. [...] (The original Chinese Exclusion Act was amended several times—such as by the 1888 Scott Act and the 1892 Geary Act—and as a result it is sometimes referred to in the plural as the [...] "Chinese Exclusion Acts".) [...] Chinese already in the U.S. were allowed to stay, but they were ineligible for naturalization and, if they left the U.S. and later wished to return, they needed to apply anew and obtain approval again. Chinese laborers and miners were specifically barred from coming (or returning) to the United States {{under the terms of the}} law.|$|E
500|$|Writer Sangita Gopal {{analysed}} the [...] "intensification of {{the aesthetic}} effects of Hindi cinema" [...] in the narrative scheme of the film. During the confrontation scene between Yash and Rahul Raichand, a [...] "thundering background score" [...] coupled with [...] "360° panning shots" [...] were used to build up melodrama. She added that while such scenes simply began by reprising previous face-offs in several melodramatic Hindi films (such as Mohabbatein of 2000), they gradually shifted [...] "to a more realist register as the framework moves from a sociology to a psychology of the family". Mazur mentioned the use of [...] "dream sequences" [...] in the film {{as a means of}} escapism. He referred to the song [...] "Suraj Hua Maddham" [...] as an extradiegetic sequence that allowed Rahul and Anjali to be physically intimate [...] "in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not in the real world of the film." [...] He added that the characters conveyed a plethora of emotions not through extensive dialogue but through the exchange of glances, which were demonstrated by extreme close-ups on their eyes.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{temporary}} undivided supportive {{attention from}} another person often {{gives rise to}} strong feelings, apparently towards that person, typically of [...] "falling in love" [...] with them. This {{is similar to the}} phenomenon of transference, particularly when one of the partners is felt to have more authority because, for instance, they are more experienced, are teachers of co-counselling, or have authority roles within the organisation. The organisations differ in the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> handle this. [...] The inability to trust and feel in real relationships is often exacerbated by the pseudo-intimacy of co-counseling, making transference more likely and more dangerous.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{a medical}} {{professional}} diagnoses a patient {{there are numerous}} <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could choose to treat the patient. Often psychiatrists will develop a treatment strategy that incorporates different facets of different approaches into one. Drug prescriptions are very commonly written to be regimented to patients along with any therapy they receive. There are three major pillars of psychotherapy that treatment strategies are most regularly drawn from. Humanistic psychology attempts to put the [...] "whole" [...] of the patient in perspective; it also focuses on self exploration. Behaviorism is a therapeutic school of thought that elects to focus solely on real and observable events, rather than mining the unconscious or subconscious. Psychoanalysis, on the other hand, concentrates its dealings on early childhood, irrational drives, the unconscious, and conflict between conscious and unconscious streams.|$|E
2500|$|The Meles {{government}} {{created an}} ethnic-based federalism, which {{came under attack}} by some Ethiopians. [...] Meles' TPLF party believed {{that there was no}} choice—this was the only solution to the centuries-old oppression by centralist governments, and to domination of culture, language, politics and economy by one ethnic group, namely the Amhara. On the other hand, some parties like the OLF (Oromo Liberation Front), which was a partner in drafting the constitution, see Amhara and Tigrayan domination of the country. The aim of the government policy was to empower all ethnicities and develop their cultures and languages. Also it was widely seen as a solution to the demand of governance preferred by the ethnic-based liberation fronts and parties participating in the July Convention of Nationalities in 1991. In response to critics who say ethnic federalism can bring divisions, Meles said that this policy served many interests, including equitable distribution of wealth and empowerment of ethnicities. He said the [...] "ethnic basis of Ethiopia's democracy stemmed from the government's fight against poverty and the need for an equitable distribution of the nation's wealth: peasants must be enabled {{to make their own decisions}} in terms of their own culture. Power must be devolved to them in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> understand, and they understand ethnicity.... Other approaches to development had been hegemonic and exploitative and had led to internecine strife and civil war." ...|$|E
