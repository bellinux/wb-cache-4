5|$|Some {{of these}} {{approximately}} 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships, saloons and hotels; many <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> rot {{and some were}} sunk to establish title to the underwater lot. By 1851 the harbor was extended out into the bay by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships. By 1870 Yerba Buena Cove had been filled to create new land. Buried ships are occasionally exposed when foundations are dug for new buildings.|$|E
50|$|The five main {{universities}} in Bergen, Oslo, Trondheim, Tromsø and Stavanger all offer {{a wide selection}} of courses within most fields, while certain minor fields have <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the specialised universities, including veterinary studies and sports. Many educations <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the regional colleges.|$|R

It <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> our {{imagination}} to paint for us {{a picture of}} this weeping; it <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> us to conclude that these precious tears were symbolical of the grief of Italy herself; that the catastrophe that provoked them must have been terrible indeed.|$|R
5|$|The Authority's {{principal}} innovation was its supranational character. It had a broad area {{of competence}} to ensure {{the objectives of the}} treaty were met and that the common market functioned smoothly. The High Authority could issue three types of legal instruments: Decisions, which were entirely binding laws; Recommendations, which had binding aims but the methods <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> member states; and Opinions, which had no legal force.|$|E
5|$|The {{court was}} told of three other cases. Captain John Bromfield, Robert Newton and James Thompson all died after similar {{treatment}} from Acton: a beating, followed by {{time in the}} hole or strong room, before being moved to the sick ward, where they <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> {{lie on the floor}} in leg irons.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} plagued with serious engine trouble, {{culminating}} in the failure of an entire turbine on 2 November. Moreno was forced to put in at Rockland, Maine—where many of the observers on board <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> be brought back by train to Camden—before proceeding for repairs to the Fore River Shipyard, which had built the ship's engines.|$|E

5|$|A {{soldier who}} participated in the battle {{reported}} that only 20 uninjured troops <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> defend the police station as the second Syrian column reached Samakh (Tzemah). The only heavy weapon the defenders possessed was ineffective against Syrian armor. Fearing their forces would be completely cut off, an order was given by the Haganah to retreat and leave the wounded, Tzvika Levkov among them. The retreat was disorganized and heavy Israeli casualties were recorded as Samakh's police station fell. Reinforcements from the Deganias, commanded by Moshe Cohen, arrived but were immediately hit by the Syrians and did not significantly affect the battle. Aharon Israeli, a platoon commander in these reinforcements, wrote that it was clear as soon as they arrived that the battle was over. Cohen would not hear of a retreat initially, but when the force saw Levkov fall into a trench, they hastily withdrew.|$|E
5|$|According to Brelsford, {{the elderly}} Harrison Clark {{remained}} highly respected among {{the indigenous people}} and was sometimes called upon to settle disputes. His last job was personnel manager at a local mine. He dedicated his final years to the writing of {{a book about his}} life, the manuscript for which was lost when his house burned down. Clark alleged that the BSAC orchestrated the fire to stop him from publishing unflattering information about the early days of Company rule. He died from heart disease in Broken Hill on 9 December 1927, aged about 67, and was buried in the Protestant section of the town cemetery. The modest savings he possessed {{at the time of his}} death <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> his sister in Port Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of the French Army from the northern sector, the Belgians <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> guard the fortified city of Antwerp. Four infantry divisions (including the 13th and 17th Reserve Infantry Divisions) engaged the German Eighteenth Army's 208th, 225th and 526th Infantry Divisions. The Belgians successfully defended {{the northern part of the}} city, delaying the German infantry forces while starting to withdraw from Antwerp on 16 May. The city fell on 18/19 May after considerable Belgian resistance. On 18 May the Belgians received word that Namur's Fort Marchovelette had fallen; Suarlee fell on 19 May; St. Heribert and Malonne on 21 May; Dave, Maizeret and Andoy on 23 May.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{evacuation}} of the St Kildian inhabitants, these sheep were farmed. However, when the St Kilda archipelago's human inhabitants were evacuated in 1930, the sheep of Hirta were also removed and in 1932 they were replaced by Soays, which still live there {{as well as on}} Soay itself. Meanwhile, the remaining sheep on Boreray <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> become feral; these became the only survivors of the crofters' sheep, {{and one of the few}} surviving descendants of the Dunface. This means that they are the original, unmodified sheep that used to be farmed on the island. In the 1970s half a dozen of them were exported to form the basis of a breeding population on the mainland, but the majority of Borerays still remain on the island.|$|E
5|$|By the 14th century, castles were {{combining}} defences with luxurious, sophisticated {{living arrangements}} and landscaped gardens and parks. Early gunpowder weapons {{were used to}} defend castles {{by the end of}} the 14th century and gunports became an essential feature for a fashionable castle. The economics of maintaining castles meant that many <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> decline or abandoned; in contrast, a small number of castles were developed by the very wealthy into palaces that hosted lavish feasts and celebrations amid elaborate architecture. Smaller defensible structures called tower houses emerged in the north of England to protect against the Scottish threat. By the late medieval period, town walls were increasingly less military in character and more often expressions of civic pride or part of urban governance: many grand gatehouses were built in the 14th and 15th centuries for these purposes.|$|E
5|$|Danebury was {{abandoned}} around 100BC, {{in common with}} the trend across Britain for hill forts to fall out of use around that time. Once again, the east gate was burnt down, although this time it was not replaced. Most of the inhabitants deserted Danebury, and groups of bodies were disposed of in charnel pits. The site continued in use, but on a much smaller scale than before. Buildings <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> decay and the interior of the fort became used for grazing. By the start of the 1st centuryAD, the settlement of Danebury was probably nothing more than a single farm.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the number}} of camps that {{surrounded}} it, its secure rearward location, and multiple telegraph connections with Washington, Alexandria, and other forts defending Washington, Fort Corcoran became the headquarters for Washington's defenses south of the Potomac River. On September 6, 1862, General Fitz John Porter assumed command of those defenses and made his headquarters at Fort Corcoran. He was only at Fort Corcoran for a short time before he {{and the rest of his}} command were withdrawn from the defenses of Washington in order to counter Lee's advance into Maryland. A bare handful of artillerymen <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> man the guns of the forts along the Arlington Line. Following the climactic Battle of Antietam, Porter and his men returned to Fort Corcoran. A few months following Antietam, Porter was court-martialed for his actions at the Second Battle of Bull Run and was removed from command.|$|E
5|$|During the 1939–40 season {{football}} was stopped following Britain's {{declaration of war}} and was not resumed {{until the end of}} World War II. This was because most British men were sent to the army. Stockport played only two matches in the 1939–40 season before war was declared, losing both and being bottom of the league. Regional league competitions were set up; appearances in these tournaments do not count in players' official records. Due to teams having a depleting number of players most teams resigned from football, the clubs that <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> compete used guest players to make up their numbers. The FA Cup was also suspended and replaced with the Football League War Cup.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} part of {{qualifying}} (Q1), Mercedes was able to refrain from using the faster super-soft tyres, nevertheless setting times below 1:16. Fastest in the session was Romain Grosjean, who was narrowly quicker than the Mercedes drivers, but on the softer tyre compound. With Button not participating, four drivers <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> be eliminated. The two Manor drivers once more did not make the cut and took 18th and 19th on the grid, with Roberto Merhi out-qualifying his teammate Will Stevens {{for the first time in}} a qualifying that both drivers participated in. Joining them on the sidelines were two more prominent drivers: both Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa suffered from problems with their power units, finishing 16th and 17th respectively.|$|E

5|$|Few tasks <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> {{complete}} {{when the}} 1977 construction season began. Most of the pump stations {{had been turned}} over to operating personnel by construction workers, and environmental mitigation and cleanup {{was in full swing}} as Alyeska repaired tundra damage caused by construction. Associated-Green, which had performed its construction tasks well, was assigned the job of finishing the final touches on the main pipeline. The last 160 miles of hydrostatic testing were done, 33 remedial welds were completed, and 45 miles of pipe were insulated, among other tasks. Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total. On May 31, the final pipeline weld took place.|$|E
5|$|His {{library and}} {{collections}} <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> his widow Sara and their children. Joseph Banks, an English botanist, {{wanted to buy}} the collection, but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala. In 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried {{to sell it to}} Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, James Edward Smith, who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books. Smith founded the Linnean Society of London five years later.|$|E
5|$|In 1593 {{he married}} Catherine Leigh, {{daughter}} of Sir Thomas Leigh of Stoneleigh Abbey in Warwickshire. Catherine {{came from a}} wealthy Protestant family and brought with her a dowry of £2,000, but also a religious association that offered Robert some respite from the recusancy laws then in effect. From {{the death of his}} grandmother the following year he inherited a property at Chastleton, in Oxfordshire. The couple's first son William died in infancy, but their second son Robert survived, and was baptised at Chastleton's Protestant church on 11November 1595. When Catesby's father died in 1598, his estates at Ashby St Ledgers <b>were</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> his wife, while Catesby and his family remained at Chastleton. Catesby had seemed happy to remain a Church Papist but after his wife's death later that year he became radicalised, and reverted to a more fanatical Catholicism.|$|E
