40|$|This article {{examines}} the responses of a <b>white-collar</b> <b>union</b> to massive membership decline in the period 1996 to 2000. During this time the union’s officials attempted to adopt a new mode of operation based on the ‘organising model’. The role of the organiser was redefined, {{attempts were made to}} split the union’s ‘servicing ’ and ‘organising’ functions so that more resources could be directed to organising, and an increasingly planned and evaluated approach to organising was adopted. Whilst the impact of these changes is still emerging, the article discusses the significant organisational impacts their formulation and adoption has engendered. The article suggests that although the ‘organising model ’ emphasises the active participation of members in union affairs, there has been little member involvement in the change process in this union to date...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{considerable}} membership shifts between the Swedish union confederations LO (blue-collar), TCO (white-collar) and Saco (white-collar), but above all {{it is about the}} rising share of union members in occupational/professional unions in the last few decades. This development corresponds to Saco's increased share of union members (8 per cent in 1990, 15 per cent in 2008). Also within TCO occupational/professional unions have increased their share of the members. Among <b>white-collar</b> <b>unions</b> this category of unions today contains a majority of members. Anyhow, the largest Swedish unions are vertical unions including Unionen, the largest TCO union formed by a merger between two other TCO <b>unions.</b> The <b>white-collar</b> confederation TCO has proposed a merger with the rapidly expanding Saco, but the latter has rejected all such invitations.

40|$|Career {{coaching}} for {{job seekers}} {{has become increasingly}} prevalent when guiding {{the management of the}} self in practices such as writing Curriculum Vitae (CV). This article explores career coaching by a Swedish <b>white-collar</b> <b>union</b> targeted at students. Through a framework of ‘governmentality in action ’ (Brownlie, 2004), the article focuses on the interaction between career coaches and students and how this discursive practice is negotiated in talk. The concept of discursive positioning is used to analyse talk in interaction and the way people are positioned in discourse by their own and others ’ utterances (Davies and Harré, 1990). The findings point to obstacles and ambiguities in the construction of a ‘sellable ’ self. They also show that subjects actively participate in their own self-construction. Further, the category of a marketing self indicates obstacles emanating from gender and national identity in this context. Keyword...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} two widely researched attitudes of union members-satisfaction with {{and commitment to}} their union-using 1987 - 88 data on 1, 675 union members in professional occupations in Sweden and 476 blue- and <b>white-collar</b> <b>union</b> members in Canada. The authors find, first, that union commitment and union satisfaction are theoretically and empirically different constructs. Second, tests of a theoretical model of union attitude formation indicate that different (though overlapping) sets of factors influence union commitment and union satisfaction. One finding is that activities and processes that provide members with greater information about the union, such as new member orientation programs, newsletters sent to members 2 ̆ 7 homes, and participation in union activities, effectively promote union commitment, but not union satisfaction. The results are very similar across the two samples, suggesting that they have cross-cultural generalizability...|$|E
40|$|This {{study will}} examine whether Russian labor is truly “quiescent” by {{examining}} general activity in Moscow from 2000 to 2014 and then focusing on <b>white-collar</b> <b>union</b> activity.

These findings are important {{in the context of}} other post-communist states (Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic) as they indicate that institutional differences like method of unionization and unions’ political involvement led to different results for white-collar unions in these countries. Finally, this study makes clear that while institutional differences and the legacy of communism can lead to different outcomes, white-collar unions in Moscow have effectively used various forms of political pressure to press for concessions and policy changes...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{stability}} of centralized wage-setting systems {{in light of the}} on-going decentralization of labor relations in much of the Western world. It takes the decline of peak level bargaining in Sweden, the traditional archetype of centralized collective bargaining, as its key case for study, but is intended to speak to other cases as well. Like many earlier analysts, we argue that centralization offers potential economic gains by internalizing the costs of inefficient wage inflation. With this potential benefit, however, comes a cost: centralized decisions are not sufficiently responsive to local conditions. To avoid excessive inflexibility, the center can allow for "wage drift" at the local level (i. e., local wage settlements above the central agreement), but once the center allows wage drift, it becomes difficult to distinguish between justifiable drift due to local economic conditions and unjustifiable drift in the self-interest of local bargaining pairs. Thus, centralized wage-setting systems face a tradeoff: allowing less drift makes it easier to monitor local bargaining pairs but harder to achieve the appropriate responsiveness to local conditions. We develop a game-theoretic model of this tradeoff, and consider how the center's optimal policy moves towards decentralization (i. e., towards allowing more drift) as the cost of inflexibility rises. We then interpret the evolution of centralized bargaining in Sweden in light of the model. We argue that centralized bargaining flourished when the private-sector blue-collar workers (represented by LO) dominated the workforce, but began to wane as public-sector and <b>white-collar</b> <b>unions</b> grew in strength, as skill differentials in decentralized labor markets grew in size, and as product-market competition intensified (especially through the shortening of product lifecycles). ...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{case study}} from recent {{innovations}} in the Swedish <b>white-collar</b> <b>union,</b> Sif, this article introduces and develops the concept of membership interface unionism (MIU). The concept, it is argued, captures similar trends in trade unionism as that noted in the UK by Heery and Kelly in their concept of managerial unionism. Both these recent forms of unionism are signified by closer relations between the professional organization and individual members. Membership interface unionism, however, has distinctive features that signal an explicit embrace of the practices of customer relationship management (CRM) : member involvement in service development and utilization of market research; new individually tailored, proactive enabling services, often offered through Internet solutions; and more responsibilities for lay members at the company level. The first and third of these features, it is argued, are somewhat contradictory in that company-level representation has weakened. The article concludes by acknowledging the threats towards participative unionism in the apparent move towards individual service provision...|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on the relationship between trade union members and their union assumes that the gender of the member influences this relationship in a number of ways. Using survey data of members of one <b>white-collar</b> <b>union,</b> we test this proposition, focusing specifically on the impact of gender on attitudes towards trade unionism. participation in trade union activities, and priorities for trade union action. We conclude that, with the exception of relative weightings of priorities, gender is not a significant influence on these variables. A number of gender-related differences within trade unions are readily discernible. The Australian Bureau of Statistics data on trade unions shows a 1986 unionization rate of 63 per cent for male employees and 44 per cent for female employees (ABS 1986), and the proportion of official union positions held by females is substantially less than the female share of total, membership (Horsley et al. 1980; Wilkinson 1983). In addition, {{it has been argued that}} female members participate in union affairs at a lower level than male members (Geare et al. 1979; Hargreaves 1982). A number of recent quantitative studies have, however, queried the relevance of gender to some; of these differences. For example, it has been argued that differences in unio...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{document}} key elements of union strategy at Sydney (Lidcombe) branch of Australia's Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) in an attempt to document and critique its branch level strategy in the year immediately after the removal of the Howard-Costello Government. Design/methodology/approach – A case study approach is used in analysing data obtained from internal CFMEU documents and correspondence; interviews with the New South Wales State Secretary of the CFMEU Andrew Ferguson, union organisers, one former organiser who worked for a number of years at Western Sydney but is now with a <b>white-collar</b> <b>union</b> in the education sector, and construction workers; CFMEU official publications; news media stories and a series of building site visits. The authors use a theory framework of Roman Catholic social teaching to frame the discussions and analyze the case study findings. Findings – In focus groups with construction workers, the authors find one challenging external constraint for the CFMEU: reaching out to and meeting effectively the needs of younger workers especially those from families hostile to unionism. However, younger workers seem to hold a mix of individualistic and collectivist philosophies. The final case shows the CFMEU organiser Tulloch to be adaptable and flexible in the heat of industrial disputation. Finally, the fact that building workers brought the asbestos issue to CFMEU's attention in the final case study shows union willingness to pursue issues not initiated by the union. Originality/value – The paper documents the fact that the CFMEU has the ability and potential to rebuild its influence on building sites in Sydney and win further favourable outcomes for exploited and vulnerable workers within its sphere of influence. Through the theoretical framework, the authors point that as it does so it will assist in bringing to fruition the Roman Catholic social teaching that presents strong trade unions as a valid form of collective voice for workers and a way for collective and individual labour to retain in practice the dignity that God has already clothed them with.
