50|$|All National Rail {{services}} at Farringdon {{are served by}} Thameslink trains between St Pancras International and City Thameslink using part of the City <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> and Snow Hill Tunnel respectively.|$|R
25|$|Overhead electrification, {{completed}} in 1982, allowed the northern section {{to run as}} the Midland City Line from Bedford via the Midland Main Line to St Pancras, and via the City <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> to Moorgate.|$|R
5|$|From 1863, part of King's Cross was an {{intermediate}} station. On the extreme {{east of the}} site, King's Cross York Road station was served by suburban trains from Finsbury before they followed the sharply curved and steeply graded York Road Tunnel to join the City <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> to Farringdon, Barbican and Moorgate. In the other direction, trains from Moorgate came off the <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> via the Hotel Curve, to platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) which rose to the main line level. Services to and from Moorgate were diverted via the Northern City Line from November 1976. The station remained in occasional use until it was completely closed on 5 March 1977.|$|R
50|$|Snow Hill tunnel was {{constructed}} by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&DR) to connect its tracks from the Ludgate Viaduct {{to those of the}} recently opened Metropolitan Railway's <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> south of Farringdon station. To the north-west, the <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> in turn connected to the tracks of the Great Northern Railway at King's Cross and the Midland Railway at St Pancras via tunnels running beneath the two main line termini. Snow Hill tunnel thus provided the crucial link in the only north-south railway route through central London, enabling cross-London passenger and goods services to be run by a number of main line railway companies.|$|R
5000|$|Passenger trains {{from the}} Great Northern line, via the York Road and Hotel curves at King's Cross to the <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines,</b> ran until the Great Northern's {{electrification}} on 1976. The City <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> were renamed the Moorgate line when overhead electrification {{was installed in}} 1982, allowing the Midland City Line service to run from Bedford via the Midland Main Line to Moorgate on the Thameslink service. The Thameslink platforms at Barbican were closed again in March 2009 {{as part of the}} Thameslink Programme to allow [...] to have its main line platforms extended across Thameslink's Moorgate branch. As a result, Barbican is no longer a multimodal station.|$|R

25|$|For most {{of their}} life the <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> ran from King's Cross to , and were {{completed}} in 1866 when the Metropolitan Railway was widened from two to four tracks between King's Cross and Farringdon and a four-track railway opened from there to Moorgate.|$|R
50|$|In 1863 the Metropolitan Railway {{opened a}} line from Paddington to Farringdon, the world's first {{underground}} railway. The City <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> project, completed in 1868 built quadruple track from King's Cross to Moorgate, with platforms on both lines at all the stations.|$|R
25|$|On 1 October 1863, the GNR began {{a shuttle}} service from King's Cross to Farringdon Street via the city <b>widened</b> <b>lines,</b> but through {{suburban}} services {{did not use}} this line until 1 March 1868, and then were extended to Moorgate Street on 1 June 1869.|$|R
50|$|In 1940 Metropolitan Railway {{services}} (today's Metropolitan, Circle and Hammersmith and City line services) {{ceased to}} call at the station due to bomb damage. Today's sub-surface underground platforms, further west, were opened in March 1941, but <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> services continued to use the original station until 1979.|$|R
50|$|The LCDR R {{class was}} {{a class of}} 0-4-4T {{locomotives}} on the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR). No. 207 (eventually no. 31666) is notable as being the last former LCDR locomotive to be withdrawn from service. The whole class was fitted with condensing apparatus for working on the <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1877 {{there were}} 58 daily trips from the MR over the <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> their own South London depots {{and to the}} LB, LC and SER {{destinations}} mentioned above. There {{must have been a}} similar number of workings from the GNR, details of which {{can be found in the}} working timetables at the National Archives.|$|R

50|$|British Rail (Eastern Region) {{took over}} control of the Northern City Line from London Underground in 1975, as part of the Great Northern lines {{suburban}} electrification. The Highbury Branch of the Northern line was terminated. Services from Finsbury Park to Moorgate were diverted to the Northern City Line from the City <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> the following year. The City <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> were renamed the Moorgate line when overhead electrification was installed in 1982, allowing the Midland City Line service to run from Bedford via the Midland Main Line to Moorgate on the Thameslink service. The Moorgate Thameslink branch closed permanently in December 2009 as part of the Â£6billion Thameslink Programme (the platforms at Farringdon were extended across the tracks leading to the Moorgate branch); however, as of late October 2013, there is still a sign over Platform 2 with 'Trains to Bedford' and an arrow pointing to the now disused platforms.|$|R
5|$|The new tracks from King's Cross to Farringdon {{were first}} {{used by a}} GNR freight train on 27 January 1868. The Midland Railway {{junction}} opened on 13 July 1868 when services ran into Moorgate Street before its St Pancras terminus had opened. The line left the main line at St Paul's Road Junction, entering a double-track tunnel and joining the <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> at Midland Junction.|$|R
5|$|With {{connections}} to the GWR and GNR under construction and {{connections to}} the Midland Railway and London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LC) planned, the Met obtained permission in 1861 and 1864 for two additional tracks from King's Cross to Farringdon Street and a four-track eastward extension to Moorgate. The Met used two tracks: the other two tracks, the City <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines,</b> used mainly by other railway companies.|$|R
2500|$|The {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} the station substructure and connecting lines was given to Messrs. Waring, with Barlow's assistant Campion as supervisor. The lower floor for beer warehousing contained interior columns [...] wide, and [...] deep carrying girders supporting the main station and track. The connection to the <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> (St. Pancras branch) ran below the station's bottom level, in an east-to-west direction.|$|R
50|$|Nos. 643 and 644 were {{fitted with}} {{condensing}} apparatus when built, for {{working on the}} Metropolitan Railway <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> and this was added to some others in the 1890s. From 1887 they were reboilered with Dean pattern boilers and the wheels were enlarged by 1 in by means of thicker tyres. The class was reboilered again with Belpaire fireboxs (but not pannier tanks) between 1916 and 1925.|$|R

50|$|The {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} the station substructure and connecting lines was given to Messrs. Waring, with Barlow's assistant Campion as supervisor. The lower floor for beer warehousing contained interior columns 15 ft wide, and 48 ft deep carrying girders supporting the main station and track. The connection to the <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> (St. Pancras branch) ran below the station's bottom level, in an east-to-west direction.|$|R
2500|$|On 28 July 1914 the First World War broke out, and on 5 August 1914 the City <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> assumed major {{strategic}} importance as {{a link between}} the channel ports and the main lines to the north, being used for troop movements and freight. During the four years of war the line saw 26,047 military trains, which carried [...] of materials, but sharp curves prevented ambulance trains using this route.|$|R
50|$|Since 1996 Chiltern Railways {{has used}} its lines south of Aylesbury for local {{services}} into London, and the alternative route south of Haddenham and <b>widened</b> <b>lines</b> south of Neasden for its intercity main line from Birmingham to London. In 2008, in a scheme partly funded by the Department for Transport, about three miles of line north of Aylesbury as far as Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station station was brought back into passenger use.|$|R
25|$|Goods depots opened near Farringdon on the <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines.</b> Smithfield Market Sidings opened 1 May 1869, {{serviced}} by the GWR. The GNR opened its depot on 2 November 1874, the Midland followed with its Whitecross depot on 1 January 1878. Finally the Met opened its depot at Vine Street in 1909, {{serviced by}} electric locomotives from West Hampstead The GNR goods depot closed on 15 January 1956 and Smithfield Market was last served by train on 28 July 1962.|$|R
5000|$|A station (...) {{was opened}} at Wellington when the line reached the town on 1 May 1843. It {{was a typical}} Brunel design but was rebuilt in 1932 when two loop lines were put in. This entailed the {{platforms}} being moved back to accommodate the <b>widened</b> <b>lines.</b> These platforms are clearly visible and a goods shed still stands {{on the east side}} of the line at the Taunton end of the station, although the station closed on 5 October 1964.|$|R
25|$|Train loads were {{restricted}} {{through the}} tunnel section, and there was little scope for running longer and fewer trains. More paths were available for goods trains after the cessation of passenger services in 1916. Freight traffic continued and was of considerable importance in both World Wars. With the decline of wagonload freight traffic from the 1960s and the National Freight Train Plan of 1968, more use {{was made of the}} West London <b>Line,</b> allowing the <b>Widened</b> <b>Lines</b> to be abandoned for such traffic.|$|R
50|$|After {{acceptance}} trials at Doncaster, they entered service between April and June 1959. They were based at Hornsey, although at weekends were usually located at Hitchin engine shed. It had been British Rail's original intention {{to work the}} locos across London on the <b>widened</b> <b>lines</b> but the locomotives {{were found to be}} too heavy. The first of the class was held at Vulcan Foundry whilst EE tried to reduce the weight but this could not be completed to a satisfactory standard.|$|R
