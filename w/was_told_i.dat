500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{interviews}} in 2002 and 2011, Depp claimed he has Native American ancestry, and that “I <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> was Cherokee {{as a kid}}. I <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> was Creek Indian as a kid and Chickasaw.” He has also claimed that his [...] "great-grandmother was {{quite a bit of}} Native American." [...] He has no evidence for these claims, only personal belief and Kentucky lore among non-Natives. Depp's genealogy has since been done by third-party researchers, who discovered the ancestors he believed to be Native actually had very distant African-American ancestry. Despite this discovery, Depp has continued to claim or imply he is Native. Depp's claims came under question when Indian Country Today Media Network stated that Depp has never inquired about his heritage nor does the Cherokee Nation recognize him as a member. This has led to criticism from the Native community, including of his choice to portray Tonto, a Native American character, in The Lone Ranger. Critical response to his claims from the Native community also included satirical portrayals of Depp by Native comedians.|$|E

I hated it. You had to kiss everybody's ass... You {{had to be on}} your political toes all the time. You would not believe the backstage politics. You were getting stabbed in the back constantly. I was so happy when I <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> was gone [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1945, and for {{the next}} two years, Julie Andrews {{performed}} spontaneously and unbilled on stage with her parents. [...] "Then came the day when I <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> must go to bed in the afternoon because I was going to be allowed to sing with Mummy and Pop in the evening," [...] Andrews explained. She would stand on a beer crate to sing into the microphone, sometimes a solo or as a duet with her stepfather, while her mother played piano. [...] "It must have been ghastly, but it seemed to go down all right." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1988, Yorke left Oxford {{to study}} at the University of Exeter, which put On a Friday on hiatus aside from holiday break rehearsals. Yorke had wanted to apply to St John's to read English at the University of Oxford [...] "because that's what {{everybody}} did. But I <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> couldn't even apply – I was too thick. Oxford University would have eaten me up and spat me out. It's too rigorous." [...] At Exeter, {{he worked as a}} DJ, performed experimental music with a classical ensemble, and played with the band Headless Chickens, performing songs including future Radiohead material. He also met artist Stanley Donwood, with whom he collaborates to produce artwork for Radiohead releases, and printmaker Rachel Owen, with whom he was in a relationship for over two decades.|$|E
2500|$|Cohen {{was born}} on September 21, 1934, into a middle-class Canadian Jewish family {{residing}} in Westmount, Quebec, an English-speaking suburb of Montreal. His mother, Marsha (Masha) Klonitsky, {{was the daughter of}} a Talmudic writer, Rabbi Solomon Klonitsky-Kline, and emigrated to Montreal in 1927 from Lithuania. His paternal grandfather, whose family had moved from Poland to Canada, was Lyon Cohen, the founding president of the Canadian Jewish Congress. His father, Nathan Cohen, owned a substantial clothing store and died when Cohen was nine years old. The family observed Orthodox Judaism, and belonged to Congregation Shaar Hashomayim, to which Cohen retained connections all his life.

2500|$|The antagonists Grendel and Grendel's {{mother are}} portrayed by Crispin Glover and Angelina Jolie, respectively. Glover had {{previously}} worked with Zemeckis in Back to the Future, when he portrayed George McFly. Zemeckis had found Glover tiresome on set, {{because of his}} {{lack of understanding of}} shooting a film, but realized this would not be a problem as on a motion capture film he could choose his angles later. Glover's dialogue was entirely in Old English. Jolie had wanted to work with Zemeckis, and had read the poem years before but could not remember it well until she read the script and was able to recall basic themes. The actress recounted her first impression of her character's appearance by saying [...] "...I <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to be a}} lizard. Then I was brought into a room with Bob, and a bunch of pictures and examples, and he showed me this picture of a woman half painted gold, and then a lizard. And, I’ve got kids and I thought 'That's great. That's so bizarre. I'm going to be this crazy reptilian person and creature.'" [...] Jolie filmed her role over two days when she was three months pregnant. She was startled by the character's nude human form, stating that for an animated film [...] "I was really surprised that I felt that exposed." ...|$|E

60|$|As a {{delicate}} attention to me, Mrs. Bunch's skin was preserved, and presented when the tale <b>was</b> <b>told.</b> <b>I</b> kept it some time, {{but the next}} Christmas I made it into muffs for several dolls, who were sent me to dress; and very nice little muffs the pretty black fur made, lined with cherry silk, and finished off with tiny tassels.|$|E
6000|$|... "Presently she came," [...] he continued. [...] "The {{change was}} there, too. She was dressed simply enough, but even I, in my inexperience, knew the difference.
