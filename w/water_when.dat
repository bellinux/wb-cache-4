5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates {{from side to side}} to force the animal through the <b>water</b> <b>when</b> swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the <b>water</b> <b>when</b> the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E

5|$|A steam {{devil is}} a {{rotating}} updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations {{do not involve}} high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over <b>water,</b> <b>when</b> cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{artisans}} used {{stone to}} carve statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints {{were obtained from}} minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with <b>water</b> <b>when</b> needed.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{advancing}} science, several experiments observing {{the reaction of}} frogs to slowly heated water {{took place in the}} 19th century. In 1869, while doing experiments searching for the location of the soul, German physiologist Friedrich Goltz demonstrated that a frog that has had its brain removed will remain in slowly heated water, but an intact frog attempted to escape the <b>water</b> <b>when</b> it reached 25°C.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of their}} water is {{obtained}} from their food, though they will drink <b>water</b> <b>when</b> available.

5|$|On the Faroe Islands mainly Pilot Whales {{are killed}} by drive hunts for their meat and blubber. Other species are also killed on rare {{occasion}} such as the Northern bottlenose whale and Atlantic White-sided Dolphin. The Northern bottlenose whale is mainly killed when it accidentally swims {{too close to the}} beach and cannot return to the <b>water.</b> <b>When</b> the locals find them stranded or nearly stranded on the beach, they kill them and share the meat to all the villagers.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} predators of bowheads are humans. Killer {{whales are}} also known predators. Bowheads seek {{the safety of}} the ice and shallow <b>waters</b> <b>when</b> threatened by killer whales.|$|R
50|$|During the day, Stomiiformes stay in deep <b>waters.</b> <b>When</b> the sun sets, {{most of them}} {{follow the}} dimming {{sunlight}} up to near-surface waters, which are richer in animal life such as small fishes and planktonic invertebrates. During the night, these Stomiiformes hunt and feed on such organisms, swimming back to deeper <b>waters</b> <b>when</b> the sun rises. They apparently are able to measure {{the intensity of the}} sunlight that reaches them. They will thus move to stay always in the zone where light intensity is very low, though it is not entirely dark.|$|R

5|$|Presently {{the only}} major streams {{entering}} the basin come from mountains {{to the west and}} northwest, but during the Pleistocene they likely transported more <b>water.</b> <b>When</b> lower sea levels entrenched a more southerly course of the Colorado River, Lake Cahuilla may have been nourished solely by local runoff during the Wisconsin glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Research by Jennifer A. Clack and {{her colleagues}} showed that the very {{earliest}} tetrapods, animals similar to Acanthostega, were wholly aquatic and quite unsuited to life on land. This {{is in contrast to}} the earlier view that fish had first invaded the land — either in search of prey (like modern mudskippers) or to find <b>water</b> <b>when</b> the pond they lived in dried out — and later evolved legs, lungs, etc.|$|E
5|$|Service on {{the subway}} system is {{occasionally}} disrupted by flooding from rainstorms, even minor ones. Rainwater can disrupt signals underground and require the electrified third rail to be shut off. Every day, the MTA moves 13 million gallons of <b>water</b> <b>when</b> it is not raining. Since 1992, $357 million {{has been used to}} improve 269 pump rooms. By August 2007, $115 million was earmarked to upgrade the remaining 18 pump rooms.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{sturgeons}} usually inhabit {{primarily the}} temperate {{waters of the}} northern hemisphere. Gulf of Mexico sturgeons are probably adapted to warmer water temperatures. Due to sturgeons' predilection for cooler <b>waters,</b> <b>when</b> <b>water</b> temperatures rise too high, sturgeon will try to find cool spring waters which serve as thermal refuges until temperatures drop again.|$|R
5|$|The {{extraction}} of beryllium from its compounds {{is a difficult}} process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, {{and its ability to}} reduce <b>water</b> <b>when</b> its oxide film is removed. The United States, China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial-scale {{extraction of}} beryllium. Beryllium production technology is in early stages of development in Russia after a 20-year hiatus.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} browses {{primarily}} at dusk or at dawn, and {{is associated with}} the gerenuk and the impala. The lesser kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in the dry season. However, unlike the gerenuk, the lesser kudu rarely prefers Acacia species and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding. The lesser kudu does not have a great requirement for water, and can browse in arid environments. It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species in the dry season, and drinks <b>water</b> <b>when</b> sources are available.|$|E

5|$|Typically, {{conventional}} hydroelectricity complements {{wind power}} very well. When {{the wind is}} blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their <b>water.</b> <b>When</b> the wind drops they can, provided they have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.|$|E
5|$|Behavior {{is known}} {{mainly from the}} marsh rice rat and O.couesi, with some {{scattered}} data from the other species. Oryzomys are semiaquatic, spending {{much time in the}} water, and otherwise mainly live on the ground; both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi are known to be excellent swimmers and will flee into the <b>water</b> <b>when</b> disturbed. Both are also active during the night and build nests of interwoven vegetation, which may be suspended above the water. Breeding may occur throughout the year in both species, but is known to be seasonally variable in the marsh rice rat. In both, gestation takes about 21 to 28days and litter size is usually one to seven, averaging three to five. Young marsh rice rats and O.couesi become reproductively active when about 50days old.|$|E
5|$|Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of rising magma with ground <b>water.</b> <b>When</b> dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of the vent with {{a thick layer of}} pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds of miles from the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E
