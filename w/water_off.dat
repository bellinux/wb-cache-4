5|$|However, recent {{research}} {{supports the idea}} that the lead found in the water came from the supply pipes, rather than another source of contamination. It was not unknown for locals to punch holes in the pipes to draw <b>water</b> <b>off,</b> increasing the number of people exposed to the lead.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{were created}} in 2001 to realign {{portions}} of the Columbia Park jogging path that were in lower areas or overlapped by sprinklers, to prevent flooded and slippery paths.

50|$|The {{species is}} {{widespread}} in deeper <b>waters</b> (samples <b>off</b> South Africa {{have been obtained}} from ~650 m) and occurs {{on a variety of}} shark species.

25|$|The <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> of {{the coast}} of San Diego–Tijuana are densely {{populate}} by the denizens of the kelp forests. Kelp forests are found {{to a great extent}} and are populated by Garibaldi, leopard sharks, gobies, rockfish, and sculpins. Great white sharks have been observed in the <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> the coast, while there are numerous documentations of their occurrence in the <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Guadalupe Island. From the confines of the forests, ocean-going species such as the Ocean sunfish are observed.|$|R
5000|$|Atlantic Spanish {{mackerel}} (Scomberomorus maculatus) {{occupy the}} <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> {{the east coast}} of North America from the Cape Cod area south to the Yucatan Peninsula. Its population is considered to include two fish stocks, defined by geography. As summer approaches, one stock moves in large schools north from Florida up the coast to spawn in shallow <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> the New England coast. It then returns to winter in deeper <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Florida. The other stock migrates in large schools along the coast from Mexico to spawn in shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico off Texas. It then returns to winter in deeper <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> the Mexican coast. These stocks are managed separately, even though genetically they are identical.|$|R
5|$|Two {{ships of}} the United States Navy have been christened USS Nassau; USS Nassau (LHA-4), an amphibious assault ship, is named {{specifically}} {{in recognition of}} this battle, while USS Nassau (CVE-16) was named for Nassau Sound, the body of <b>water</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Florida near Jacksonville.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.incarnatum are tiny, oval to roughly spherical, and measure 35–1250 by 200–450μm. The {{floating}} balls are sometimes enclosed {{in a loose}} subiculum, with a whitish surface that is byssoid (consisting of fine threads). The peridium (the outer protective tissue layer) is 18–30μm thick, byssoid, and made of clamped hyphae typically 2.5–4μm in diameter intertwined with dendrophyses (irregularly branched cystidia) 1μm in diameter. The surface of the peridium is hydrophobic, a feature that helps keep <b>water</b> <b>off</b> the growing hymenium during its development, and gives the fruit body buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|Fierce waves pushed {{large amounts}} of water to coastal areas in Fujairah of the United Arab Emirates, forcing roads to be closed and traffic diverted. Civil defence and police were on duty to manage the road closures, while {{municipal}} workers pumped the excess <b>water</b> <b>off</b> the roads. The road connecting Kalba and Fujairah was closed due to the road being submerged by water. The waves along the coastline were reported to be 10m (32ft) high, which destroyed about a dozen fishing boats. About 300boats were moved from the water or emptied of equipment, and overall damage to the port of Fujairah was reported as severe. A boat sank by the port, leaving its ten passengers missing.|$|E

5|$|Following the Soviet {{capture of}} that city, the {{remaining}} crew detonated scuttling {{charges in the}} wreck on 21 March to further destroy the ship. After the war, the ship was raised during 1945–46 by the Soviet Navy and transferred to Tallinn. Although reference books long stated that she was scrapped there or in Marienburg, in actuality she was towed out in 1948 and beached for long-term use as a target in shallow <b>water</b> <b>off</b> the island of Osmussaar in the Gulf of Finland. Last used for target practice around 1966, the remains are now submerged. Her bell {{was held in the}} collection of the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden as of 1990.|$|E
5|$|Occurring {{close to}} shore from the surf zone {{to a depth}} of , the milk shark favors turbid <b>water</b> <b>off</b> sandy beaches and {{occasionally}} enters estuaries. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, juvenile milk sharks inhabit seagrass meadows composed of Amphibolis antarctica and Posidonia australis. Although some sources state this species avoids low salinities, it has been reported several times from fresh water in Cambodia, as far upstream as the Tonlé Sap. Milk sharks may be found anywhere in the water column from the surface to the bottom. Off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, its numbers fluctuate annually with a peak in summer, suggesting some form of seasonal movement.|$|E
5|$|She {{was struck}} from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 November 1920 and loaned to the War Department, then {{used as a}} target ship for {{experimental}} artillery. She was scuttled in shallow <b>water</b> <b>off</b> Pensacola in January 1921 and bombarded by the coastal batteries of Fort Pickens and by railway artillery. She was returned on 20 February 1925 to the navy, which offered her for scrap, but no acceptable bids were received. Another attempt to scrap her was made in 1956, but the state prevented this. Eventually the ship was declared {{the property of the}} State of Florida by the Supreme Court of Florida. On 10 June 1993—the centennial anniversary of her launching—the site became the fourth Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve. In 2001 the wreck was also added to the National Register of Historic Places, and it still serves as an artificial reef and diving spot. The Massachusetts figurehead is on display in Dahlgren Hall at the United States Naval Academy.|$|E

5|$|At {{its closest}} {{approach}} to China, Saomai generated high waves that coincided with high tide, resulting in extensive damage. In {{preparation for the}} storm, schools in Ningbo were forced to close, and ferry service was discontinued. Over 20,000people were evacuated by the Chinese government onto higher land. The most severely affected Chinese province was Zhejiang. A station in Dinghai District observed 102mm (4.02in) of rain in 18hours, equivalent to {{more than half of}} that station's monthly average. In Zhoushan, 20,000hectares of farmland were inundated and 2,500homes collapsed. Off the island, ten fishing boats collided, and another oil tanker capsized. Areas in Gaoting were submerged under as much as 1m (3.3ft) of <b>water.</b> <b>Off</b> the coast, 225boats and 130piers were damaged. In Shanghai, 20streets were flooded and hundreds of homes were flooded with water. At nearby Hongquiao Airport, an Airbus A340 bound for Paris slipped off the runway. Though no people were injured, the airport was closed for eight hours. The typhoon also caused the Huangpu River to rise to its third highest level in recorded history.|$|E

25|$|In {{a series}} of expeditions, a team of marine archaeologists led by Ballard {{identified}} {{what appeared to be}} ancient shorelines, freshwater snail shells, and drowned river valleys in roughly 300 feet (100 m) of <b>water</b> <b>off</b> the Black Sea coast of modern Turkey. Radiocarbon dating of freshwater mollusk remains indicated an age of about 7,000 years.|$|E
25|$|The mouse {{catshark}} is frequently caught incidentally by commercial trawl fisheries operating in deep <b>water</b> <b>off</b> Europe and western Africa. However, {{it may be}} small enough to escape most nets, and there are likely parts of its wide range that see little fishing activity. Because there are no substantial threats to its population, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as of Least Concern.|$|E
