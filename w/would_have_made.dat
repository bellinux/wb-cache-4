5|$|In the Early Historic Period The {{domain of}} the Cenél nGabraín {{appears to have been}} centred on Kintyre and Knapdale and may have {{included}} Arran, Jura and Gigha.

5|$|A unique {{feature of}} {{architecture}} of ancient Sri Lanka, vatadages were {{built for the}} protection of small stupas that had an important relic enshrined in them or were built on hallowed ground. If the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is the shrine built by Parakramabahu I, the relic of the tooth of the Buddha would have been enshrined within it. Another possibility is that the alms bowl used by the Buddha may have been enshrined here. Both these relics were important objects in ancient Sri Lankan culture, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the Polonnaruwa Vatadage {{one of the most significant}} and venerated buildings in the country.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Greeks of Laconia and Arcadia, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of a certain Michael, tried to stop the Franks at the olive grove of Kountouras in northeastern Messenia. Modern scholars have traditionally identified this Michael with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, founder of the Despotate of Epirus, but this identification has been questioned more recently by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, as the fragile nature of his control over Epirus <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a departure to aid the Moreote Greeks a major and unlikely gamble.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{disagreement}} {{as to whether}} Craig was deserving of the captaincy, the team proceeded smoothly without infighting. Prior to the Fifth Test, Craig wanted to drop himself due to poor form, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> Harvey captain. Peter Burge, the third member of the selection panel and a Harvey supporter, was comfortable with this, but Harvey relinquished his opportunity to seize the leadership by ordering Burge to retain Craig. When the vote was formally taken, Harvey and Burge outvoted Craig, who was still offering to drop himself.|$|E

5|$|If {{traditional}} {{practices were}} adhered to, feasting would have continued for two days, while guests {{would have given}} gifts, mainly of money, to the newlyweds. The wedding ceremony would have culminated with the guests entering the bridal chamber, where they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> various sexual references and innuendos, led by a figure with his face painted black. In Chinese rural tradition, the bride was expected to show the bloodstains on the bed sheets from her wedding night to prove that her hymen had been broken during sexual intercourse, {{and that she had}} therefore been a virgin.|$|E

5|$|In November 2000, the Indians offered Ramirez a seven-year, $119million contract. While this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> Ramirez {{the highest-paid}} player in baseball, {{the deal was}} {{rejected}} by Ramirez and his agent, Jeff Moorad, who were seeking a ten-year, $200million contract. Ramirez was reportedly pursued by the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners, but in December agreed to an eight-year, $160million deal with the Boston Red Sox, with $20million options for 2009 and 2010, pushing {{the total value of}} the contract to $200million for 10years.|$|E
5|$|In the 1780s, Catherine {{slightly}} favored Poniatowski {{over the}} opposition, {{but did not}} support any of his plans for significant reforms. Despite repeated attempts, Poniatowski failed to confederate the sejms, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> them immune to liberum veto. Thus, although he had {{a majority in the}} Sejms, Poniatowski was unable to pass even the smallest reform. The Zamoyski Code was rejected by the Sejm of 1780, and opposition attacks on the king dominated the Sejms of 1782 and 1786.|$|E
5|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{concludes that}} the large body size of sauropods <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates because {{they would not have}} been able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.|$|E

Gray acquired the stations' non-license assets on May 1, 2014; both stations were then taken off the air on June 13, 2014, with Fox programming being moved to subchannels of the NBC North Dakota stations (KMOT, KQCD-TV and KFYR-TV). On August 27, 2014, the stations were sold to Legacy Broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Opisthocoelicaudia {{may have}} been able to rear up on its hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several {{skeletal}} features that might have been related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum, the flaring ilia, and the fused pubic symphysis, may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of rearing.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus lacked these bony struts, and the {{connection}} between the nasals and lacrimals was weak. Instead, a backwards projection of the maxilla was massively developed in Tarbosaurus and fit inside a sheath formed from the lacrimal. This projection was a thin, bony plate in North American tyrannosaurids. The large backwards projection suggests that force was transmitted more directly from the maxilla to the lacrimal in Tarbosaurus. The lacrimal was also more firmly anchored to the frontal and prefrontal bones in Tarbosaurus. The well-developed connections between the maxilla, lacrimal, frontal and prefrontal <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> its entire upper jaw more rigid.|$|E
