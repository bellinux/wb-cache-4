25|$|In {{response}} to the cruiser's signal, Detmers ordered that Kormorans disguise be dropped, for the Dutch flag {{to be replaced by}} the Kriegsmarine ensign, and for the guns and torpedoes to open fire. Accounts disagree on which ship fired first, but agree that both opened fire almost simultaneously. The first shots from Sydney, a full, eight-shell salvo from the main guns, were reported in most accounts to have passed over Kormoran, although some of the Germans said that shells punched through the funnel and the <b>wireless</b> <b>office</b> at bridge level without exploding, and hit the water {{on the far side of}} the raider. One analysis claims that this was either a warning shot just over the superstructure, or an attempt to destroy the raider's bridge as a prelude to capture. With Kormorans opening salvo (which consisted of two shells instead of four because the raider's two centreline guns were slower to decamouflage), the gunnery officer attempted to bracket the cruiser's bridge but failed to hit it, with the shells striking other parts of the ship or missing completely. Two torpedoes from Kormorans starboard above-water tubes were launched simultaneously with the raider's attack, and the close proximity of the target allowed the use of the anti-aircraft and close defence guns to rake Sydneys flank, thus preventing the use of the cruiser's secondary weapons.|$|E

2500|$|Sydney {{attempted}} {{to open the}} gap between the two ships as she opened fire. This was hampered by the loss of both rangefinders, requiring each mounting to be targeted and fired locally. The first two salvoes missed, but two shells from the third struck: one exploding in Emdens <b>wireless</b> <b>office,</b> another by the Germans' forward gun. [...] Heavy fire from Sydney damaged or destroyed Emdens steering gear, rangefinders, and the voicepipes to the turrets and engineering, and knocked out several guns. The forward funnel collapsed overboard, then the foremast fell and crushed the fore-bridge. A shell from Sydney landed in the aft ammunition room of Emden, and the Germans had to flood it or risk a massive explosion.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent salvoes {{from the}} raider were more accurate. The second, three-shell salvo {{destroyed}} Sydneys bridge and damaged her upper superstructure, including the gun direction control tower, <b>wireless</b> <b>offices,</b> and foremast. The fourth [...] gun was ready by this time, and all four began to fire: {{the third and}} fourth salvoes knocked the cruiser's [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] turrets out of action before they could fire a second time, and the fifth hit Sydney on the waterline in proximity to the forward engine room, although one shell hit high and destroyed the Walrus. Kormorans guns were aimed at Sydneys waterline and upper deck during the next three salvoes. After the sixth German salvo, Sydney resumed fire with her aft turrets: [...] "Y" [...] turret fired less than four times with little effect, but multiple shots from [...] "X" [...] turret struck Kormoran, damaging the raider's machinery spaces, wounding the sailors manning one of the guns, and starting a fire in an oil tank.|$|R

Such networks have important applications ranging from providing Internet access to rural, suburban and under-privileged communities to enterprise <b>wireless</b> <b>offices.</b> However, there are serious challenges in provisioning broadband connectivity using such networks due to the limited throughput caused by interference between mesh routers and coping with {{the dynamics of the}} wireless channel. ^ In this thesis I first deploy a large operational wireless mesh network at Purdue University to understand the behavior of such networks as well as performance problems with currently available state-of-the-art protocols and hardware. This thesis then proposes novel link and network layer protocols that can harness new hardware and technologies such as multiple radios, network coding, directional antennas and cheap storage to significantly improve the performance of wireless mesh networks. Finally, to enable actual deployment of these enhanced high-performance wireless meshes, the thesis proposes a novel method for provisioning service plans for users of such networks. All the research proposals have been implemented and evaluated on the testbed and advance the state-of-the-art in wireless mesh networking thus reducing barriers to their widespread adoption. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — With {{the advent}} of {{cognitive}} radio technology, new paradigms for spectrum access can achieve near-optimal spectrum utilisation by letting each user sense and utilise available spectrum opportunistically while regulating the interference it imposes on other users through interference constraints. However, the simplest and most common forms of such constraints are binary and transmitter-centric, which are often inefficient since they only consider pair-wise sets of transmitters. Hence, we propose a non-binary receiver-centric constraint model for spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. Such a model {{is in line with}} the recently proposed interference temperature metric that constraints whole subsets of transmitters, thereby permitting interfering signals to be introduced and enabling additional communication, leading to improved spectrum utilisation. These constraints are easy to generate and check, and are currently being used to devise a co-operative negotiated etiquette for cognitive radios offering heterogeneous services in a <b>wireless</b> <b>office</b> networking scenario.

A device or a system is said to be (electromagnetically) compatible if it does not cause interference with other systems, if it is not susceptible to emissions from other systems, and finally if it does not cause interference with itself. Therefore, the goal is to produce less interfering and less susceptible (i. e., highly immune) devices. An EMC problem has three components; the interfering source, the victim and coupling paths. Undesired interference may be eliminated by one of these three ways: (i) by suppressing the emissions at the source, (ii) by making the victim less susceptible (highly immune), and (iii) by removing the coupling path...|$|E
