Society has adjusted to the avian conquest, though with minor bird-related cultural changes—for example, while some holidays such as Christmas and Tanabata are celebrated much {{as they are in}} the present day, a major event in the game is Legumentine's Day, an amalgamation of the traditions of Valentine's Day and Setsubun. In a more grim case, the terms war dove and war hawk have been re-purposed as labels for two opposing political factions divided over the ongoing mutual hostility between birds and the human minority: the altruistic Dove Party, <b>who</b> <b>advocate</b> for cooperation and peace between the two groups, and the militant Hawk Party, whose goal is to exterminate humanity altogether. By the time Hatoful Boyfriends narrative begins, the Dove Party, the Hawk Party, and their respective schools of thought dominate much of the world's politics.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>who</b> <b>advocate</b> against greater {{government}} involvement in healthcare have {{asserted that the}} difference in costs {{between the two nations}} is partially explained by the differences in their demographics. Illegal immigrants, more prevalent in the U.S. than in Canada, also add a burden to the system, as many of them do not carry health insurance and rely on emergency rooms— which are legally required to treat them under EMTALA— as a principal source of care. In Colorado, for example, an estimated 80% of undocumented immigrants do not have health insurance.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{reducing}} {{poverty and}} increasing China's wealth, Deng's reforms {{have been criticized}} by the Chinese New Left for increasing inequality and allowing private entrepreneurs to purchase state assets at reduced prices. These accusations were especially intense during the Lang-Gu dispute, in which New Left academic Larry Lang accused entrepreneur Gu Sujung of usurping state assets, after which Gu was imprisoned. The Hu-Wen Administration adopted some New Left policies, such as halting privatizations and increasing the state sector's importance in the economy, and Keynesian policies that have been criticized by some Chinese economists <b>who</b> <b>advocate</b> a policy of deregulation, tax cuts and privatization.|$|E

25|$|There {{developed}} a split among UDF elected officials, between those such as Gilles de Robien and Pierre-Christophe Baguet, who favored closer {{ties with the}} UMP, and those such as François Bayrou <b>who</b> <b>advocate</b> independent centrist policies, while others such as Jean Dionis du Séjour tried steering for a middle course. The most likely reason {{for many of the}} UDF's elected officials favouring close ties with the UMP was that most of the UDF's elected positions are obtained through cooperative alliances with UMP. However, the party's base overwhelmingly favored independence. At the congress of Lyon, on 28–29 January 2006, 91% of the members voted to retain the independence of the UDF from the UMP and transform it into an independent centrist party. This outcome meant that the orientation of the evolving UDF would be that of a social-liberal party aiming for a balance between social-democratic and conservative policies.|$|E
25|$|The {{appointment}} process {{stands in}} stark contrast with the highly public selection and confirmation process for justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. While {{there are people who}} are critical of the secrecy of the process and <b>who</b> <b>advocate</b> a more public method for appointments, there are relatively few who dispute the quality of appointees. Three Chief Justices (Sir Adrian Knox, Sir John Latham and Sir Garfield Barwick) had previously been conservative politicians prior to their appointment. However, there is frequent criticism of Barwick's intervention in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, when he gave advice to Governor-General Sir John Kerr. On the other side of politics, Labor politicians Dr H. V. Evatt QC, Sir Edward McTiernan and Lionel Murphy QC were also appointed to the High Court; Murphy, Attorney-General in the Whitlam government, was criticised by the conservative side at the time of his appointment but after a decade in office had risen, on occasion, to the heights of Acting Chief Justice. His reputation was gravely damaged in 1985 after illegal police phone-tapping led to charges that he had attempted to pervert the course of justice. He was eventually acquitted of all charges.|$|E
25|$|The Praxe {{is a body}} {{of ritual}} and custom founded upon ancient traditions {{and it is a}} {{controversial}} part of Coimbra's academic life to which no university student is indifferent. Part of the attraction of Coimbra's academic life, aside from its recognized excellence is that it is more Praxe, having unique rituals that set it apart from other institutions and give its students a special sense of participation in academic rituals that developed hundreds of years ago. Though these rituals are seen as crude and violent by some, they remain an important reference in the academic experience of the students for others. The rules of the Praxe are contained in a book (The Code of Academic Praxe, by a committee of older students of the AAC – Associação Académica de Coimbra), which prescribes appropriate student behavior for activities like drafting, evaluation, groups or bands and the Burning of the Ribbons rituals. Even inside the AAC, Coimbra's student organisation, there are anti-Praxe groups and people <b>who</b> <b>advocate</b> for more thorough reforms in traditional rituals. The Freshman (1st yr.) period (the lowest category in the Praxe hierarchy) is, for many students, a time of good and lasting memories of never to be repeated events. One of the most visible and distinctive traditions is the use of the academic costume of the University of Coimbra, a black suit and cape worn on special occasions by the students, which was adopted by other Portuguese universities and is actually used by students of almost all higher education institutions in the city and across the country.|$|E
