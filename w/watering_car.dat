50|$|The {{electric}} tram {{services were}} originally operated by 30 four-wheeled double decked cars supplied by Dick, Kerr & Co. In 1904, six bogie <b>cars</b> and a <b>water</b> <b>car</b> (used for keeping down the {{dust on the}} streets) {{were added to the}} fleet, also from Dick, Kerr & Co. No further trams were acquired, and a planned extension from the Caversham Road terminus across Caversham Bridge to Caversham itself was abandoned because of the outbreak of World War I. The war also led to a significant maintenance backlog.|$|R

50|$|Another {{interesting}} fact {{which is}} less known is that apart from rolling stock manufacture Liluah made immense contribution to the war machinery of Allied Forces during the Second World War. Apart from rolling stock required for transport of military equipment Liluah also produced hundreds of Ambulances, <b>Water</b> <b>Cars,</b> tanks, armoured vehicles and lorries. Ammunitions were also produced for the British Army, the Indian Army and Royal Air force. Minor items like tent pegs etc. were also in thousands. All the above illustrates the technical expertise and skill developed within the workshop. An essay published in 1945 in East Indian Railway Magazine by D.K. Whitworth describes how great a job was done by railwaymen at Liluah between 1938 and 1942.|$|R
40|$|Part 1 : Simulation, Optimization, Monitoring and Control TechnologyInternational audienceThis {{paper is}} {{discussed}} the Anhui agricultural industrialization {{using the method}} of principal component analysis. The indexes include per capita net income of farmers in Anhui province, non-agricultural employment rate, urbanization rate, the total power of agricultural mechanization, universal ratio of rural <b>water,</b> <b>car</b> villages, the proportion of industrial waste water by sewage treatment in total emission. Results show that Anhui agricultural industrialization is still at a relatively low level, thus accelerating the pace of agricultural industrialization has become the key of economic development in Anhui province. Finally, this article provides the specific policy recommendations to accelerate agricultural industrialization and reduces the gap of income...|$|R

50|$|The {{special train}} {{used in the}} film {{consisted}} of Southern Pacific 4449, its auxiliary <b>water</b> <b>car,</b> and four passenger cars. It departed its home base in Portland, Oregon, on March 5 and arrived in Los Angeles on March 9. Over the next four days, the interior of one passenger car was redone by Touchstone crews since it would appear in one scene. In addition, two Southern Pacific flatcars {{were added to the}} train and a mockup of the 4449's cab was placed on one of them. This mockup was used for some cab shots, since it is easier to move the camera around in it than in the real thing. Over the eight days between March 14 and March 21, several scenes were filmed at Southern Pacific's Taylor Yard.|$|R
50|$|The {{lines at}} Rhodes and at Middleton Fountain were {{connected}} end-on {{during the next}} two months. Between April and July 1925, the tracks at Sudden (at a position in Manchester Road west of Silk Street) were reconstructed and connected to the Rochdale Corporation system by Rochdale Corporation at a cost of £2519 (c.£128,300 in 2016). Similarly, Oldham Corporation joined the two systems together at the municipal boundary between Chadderton and Oldham (approximately 25 yards east of Lansdowne Road). Manchester Corporation bought the buses for £250 (approx £12,700 in 2016) each. The <b>water</b> <b>car</b> and snow plough (number 21) was sold to the South Lancashire Tramways Company for £40. The depot at Hilton Fold Lane was retained by Middleton Corporation, eventually demolished and houses were built on the site.|$|R

50|$|Rainwater tanks {{can reduce}} {{stormwater}} runoff volumes and stormwater pollutants from reaching downstream waterways.

50|$|Director Stephen Hopkins {{later said}} of the shoot:We had snake bites, {{scorpion}} bites, tick bite fever, people getting hit by lightning, floods, torrential rains and lightning storms, hippos chasing people through the <b>water,</b> <b>cars</b> getting swept into the water, and several deaths of crew members, including two drownings.... Val came to the set under the worst conditions imaginable. He was completely exhausted from doing The Island of Dr. Moreau; {{he was dealing with}} the unfavorable publicity from that set; he was going through a divorce; he barely had time to get his teeth into this role before we started; and he is in nearly every scene in this movie. But I worked him six or seven days a week for four months under really adverse conditions, and he really came through. He had a passion for this film.|$|R
50|$|Access to Jomfruland is by <b>water</b> taxi, <b>car</b> ferry, or {{by private}} vessel. The island has several guest harbours.

40|$|Water over Fremont's tracks posed {{a problem}} for the Lake Shore Electric Railway {{whenever}} the Sandusky River rose past flood stage. Ingenuity led to the building of car Number 444.

5000|$|From 1908 to 1970, an almost-annual train (skipped 1924, WWII years) carried {{travelers}} between Union Station in Denver, Colorado and the Cheyenne Depot Museum. The final {{train in}} 1970 had 27 cars with 1,127 guests. Revived in 1992 for the Denver Post's 100th anniversary, the [...] "Centennial Special" [...] used Amtrak locomotives with Ski Train coaches and carried almost 800 passengers, including Colorado Governor Roy Romer and Denver Mayor Wellington Webb. In 1994, the excursion train returned as an annual event. It typically consists of Union Pacific 844, a Union Pacific <b>water</b> <b>car,</b> a helper diesel engine, a tool car, {{and as many}} as 22 passenger coaches. After Denver's Union Station renovation resulted in a greatly shortened passenger platform, the train's been based at a site near the Denver Coliseum, where it's on display the day before. Tickets for the popular trip are available by lottery and proceeds benefit the Denver Post Community Foundation.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947 the {{institution}} was officially closed {{as a result}} of overcrowding, deteriorating health conditions and maintenance concerns with the [...] "Otter". The institution was then transferred to the newly established Eventide Home {{on the site of the}} former RAAF Station Sandgate. Dunwich was then opened up to government land sales and mining of mineral sand resources. From 1947 to 1957 a number of passenger ferries serviced both Dunwich and Amity Point from Brisbane, Redland Bay and Cleveland. The first drive-on drive-off ferry commenced operation in 1964 and ran from Cleveland to Dunwich using the beach as a ramp for loading and unloading. However, with further development and an increase in sand mining a deep <b>water</b> <b>car</b> ferry ramp was needed. Consequently, plans were made to reclaim land to the south east of the causeway providing a place for barge landing. Today this reclaimed land is the site of barge and water taxi landings servicing an ever increasing number of residents and visitors.|$|R
