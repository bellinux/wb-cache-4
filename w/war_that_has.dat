He was sent to assassinate a girl named Luna due to Boss' fears that she would liberate humanity from his grip. Her death resulted in a <b>war</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> humanity on the losing end with robots being on the verge of death due to the radical change in the environment; a legend was made known to the robots that Casshern's death can save them all.|$|E

They travel south, meet Sugriva, marshall an army of monkeys, and attract dedicated commanders such as Hanuman who is a minister of Sugriva. Meanwhile, Ravana harasses Sita and tries to make her into a concubine. Sita refuses him. Ravana is enraged. Rama ultimately reaches Lanka, fights in a <b>war</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> many ups and downs, but ultimately prevails, kills Ravana and forces of evil, and rescues his wife Sita.

25|$|In Syria, protests {{erupted in}} mid-March and {{were met by}} {{government}} repression. The brutal repression radicalized the opposition and the country slid into full scale civil <b>war</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> left more than 100,000 killed by July 2013. Less significant protests also occurred in Algeria, Jordan, Morocco, Oman and Saudi Arabia. The initial hopes of democratic change have faced several setbacks in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Bahrain, Egypt and Tunisia. A report by Freedom House in 2012 suggested that while Tunisia was showing significant improvements, Egypt's improvements were limited and there were declines in some areas. Bahrain {{on the other hand}} was scoring record declines and was ranked lowest. The situation in Yemen was not much better than Bahrain.|$|E
25|$|In Yemen, {{small-scale}} protests started {{shortly after}} the Tunisian Revolution. Protesters were emboldened {{by the fall of}} Mubarak and their numbers grew. The president, Ali Abdullah Saleh was able to remain in power for months before signing an agreement in November by which he handed over power, but remained a political player. In Bahrain, protests erupted on 14 February and were met by repression. A month later, the government called in troops from neighboring Persian Gulf countries to put down protests and announced a state of emergency. In Libya, protests started on 17 February in the eastern city of Benghazi. They developed into a civil <b>war</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> claimed the lives of tens of thousands. In September, six months after the UN Security Council-sanctioned NATO military intervention, the de facto ruler Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed.|$|E
500|$|Despite its fame, [...] "In Flanders Fields" [...] {{is often}} ignored by {{academics}} teaching and discussing Canadian literature. The poem is sometimes {{viewed as an}} anachronism; It spoke of glory and honour in a <b>war</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> since become synonymous with the futility of trench warfare and the slaughter produced by 20th-century weaponry. Nancy Holmes, professor at the University of British Columbia, speculated that its patriotic nature and use {{as a tool for}} propaganda may have led literary critics to view it as a national symbol or anthem rather than a poem.|$|E

An American academic writing for The Nation reported that [...] "60,000 persons gathered {{on the bank of}} the river to hear Gandhi's call to arms.

500|$|The episode {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} more recent reviews: Rob Cromwell of The Guardian listed the final scene among six [...] "perfect end-of-show finales", saying of Blackadder: [...] "It was brilliantly funny throughout, right up until the last 60 seconds", and praising the writers and {{producer}} John Lloyd for [...] "deliver a perfectly pitched, poignant ending". Comparing Blackadder Goes Forth to the 2012 war serial Birdsong, Alison Graham of the Radio Times commented that [...] "Nothing ... evokes the terror of those unspeakable battlefields or leaves such an overwhelming sense of loss as [...] going over the top to their certain death". Den of Geek's Carley Tauchert placed the episode second on her list of [...] "top 10 TV show endings", calling it [...] "one of the greatest interpretations of the madness of <b>war</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> ever been put on film". Reviewing the episode for The A.V. Club, Kate Kulzick described it as [...] "...a masterpiece, a hilarious and painful crystallization of everything Blackadder does well. It is without a doubt the best episode of the series and more than that, it’s one of the best series finales in television history". She particularly praised it for [...] "...its masterful balancing of comedy and tragedy. Both are interspersed throughout, with each character given moments of laugh out loud brilliance and poignant reflection", concluding that [...] "...there {{is no such thing as}} a perfect television show or episode, but “Goodbyeee” comes dang close". The academic and theatre director Mary Luckhurst contrasted the regular British comedic treatment of the Second World War with the absence of comedies set in the First World War, until the Blackadder series, which she considered [...] "an important British dramatic treatment" [...] of the War.

2500|$|During the Cold War, {{concepts}} such as mutual assured destruction (MAD) led lawmakers and government officials in both the United States and the Soviet Union to avoid entering a nuclear war that could have had catastrophic consequences on the entire world. Various scientists and authors, such as Carl Sagan, predicted massive, possibly life-ending destruction of the Earth {{as the result of}} such a conflict. Strategic analysts assert that nuclear weapons prevented the United States and the Soviet Union from fighting World War III with conventional weapons. [...] Nevertheless, the possibility of such a war became the basis for speculative fiction, and its simulation in books, films and video games became a way to explore the issues of a <b>war</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> thus far not occurred in reality. The only places a global nuclear war has ever been fought are in expert scenarios, theoretical models, war games, and the art, film, and literature of the nuclear age. The concept of mutually assured destruction was also the focus of numerous movies and films.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{opened with}} a lengthy prologue. [...] In some theaters, the prologue was {{performed}} by live actors and an orchestra. [...] It included music composed by Victor Schertzinger and depicted a peaceful country home, with hills in the distance, a stream and clouds floating peacefully through the sky. Suddenly, the boom of a cannon is heard, artillery guns belch fire, and a Zeppelin flies over the city dropping bombs. [...] In the smoke, [...] "Civilization" [...] is depicted kneeling pleadingly {{at the feet of}} a menacing [...] "God of War." [...] Soldiers are seen retreating before deadly gas. [...] Against these scenes, the film's title cards express the film's anti-war message, concluding with the following comments:"Today, the great sorrowful eyes of this same Son of God gaze down upon blackened fields, where the mangled bodies of men are strewn as grains of wheat, upon flaming shattered hamlets and stricken firesides. [...] As He listens to the screaming of the shells, the crashing of monstrous guns, all the ghastly symphony of the reddest war mankind has ever known, His heart must recognize the bitter truth in the statement of one of the world's foremost educators— That in nineteen centuries Civilization has failed to accept honestly the teachings of Jesus Christ. [...] This is an allegorical story of a <b>war</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> laughed at the world's flaunting boast of a higher progress. It does not concern itself as to which side is in the right or wrong, but deals with those ranks which are paying, the grim penalty—the ranks of Humanity. [...] If the awful trail of battle stretches vividly through the scenes of the narrative, it is in the hope that a shocked and appalled world may henceforth devote itself more earnestly in the cause of peace. [...] Let our Civilization not be a mockery of our cherished ideals, but rather a synonym of that glorious work—Humanity. [...] Dedicated to that vast, pitiful army whose tears have girdled the universe—the mothers of the dead." ...|$|E
