[...] "The {{focus was on}} producing the record for Kendrick, I wanted to shine as a producer first. I wanted to show that side off {{more than anything else}} and that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my one verse then let Kendrick go ape-sh-- crazy all over the rest of it." [...] As for the A$AP Rocky feature on [...] "Brothers," [...] Cudi explained that he made the decision to go with a minimal hook and let the Harlem rapper dominate the track: [...] "I felt like that was a perfect beat for A$AP to get on there and speak some truths and talk to the younger generation, because he's in a place where a lot of kids are up to him and Kendrick. I just wanted to hear him say something a little bit more thoughtful, and he did that — he showed up. I was blown away by his craftsmanship, his professionalism and his overall mojo." ...|$|E

Kipling remembers, [...] "Often and often afterwards, the beloved Aunt would ask me <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never told any one how I was being treated. Children tell little more than animals, for what comes to them they accept as eternally established. Also, badly-treated children have a clear notion {{of what they are}} likely to get if they betray the secrets of a prison-house before they are clear of it".|$|E

2500|$|Regarding his {{treatment}} of the family he had with his wife, he stated, [...] "I am not the beast the media make me to be". Regarding {{his treatment}} of Elisabeth and her children in the cellar, {{he explained that he}} brought flowers for Elisabeth and books and toys for the children into the [...] "bunker", as he called it, and often watched videos with the children and ate meals with Elisabeth and the children. Fritzl decided to imprison Elisabeth after she [...] "did not adhere to any rules any more" [...] when she became a teenager. [...] "That is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do something; I had to create a place where I could keep Elisabeth, by force if necessary, away from the outside world." [...] He suggested that the emphasis on discipline in the Nazi era, during which he grew up, might have influenced his views about decency and good behavior. The chief editors of News magazine noted in their editorial that they expected Fritzl's statement to form the basis of the defence strategy of his lawyer. Critics said his statement may have been a ploy to prepare an insanity defence.|$|E
