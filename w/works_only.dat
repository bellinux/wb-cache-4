5|$|In 1768 Johnson {{went into}} {{partnership}} with John Payne (Johnson {{was probably the}} senior partner); the following year they published 50 titles. Under Johnson and Payne, the firm published a wider array of works than under Johnson and Davenport. Although Johnson looked to his business interests, he did not publish <b>works</b> <b>only</b> to enrich himself. Projects that encouraged free discussion appealed to Johnson; for example, he helped Priestley publish the Theological Repository, a financial failure that nevertheless fostered open debate of theological questions. Although the journal lost Johnson money in the 1770s, {{he was willing to}} begin publishing it again in 1785 because he endorsed its values.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the C {{submitted}} another bill {{to increase}} its capacity by enlarging its tunnels to the larger diameter used for the tunnels of the more recently built railways to allow larger, more modern rolling stock to be used. Together, the works proposed in these bills would enable the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE)'s trains to run over the C's route and vice versa, effectively combining the two separate railways. Tunnel enlargement <b>works</b> <b>only</b> restarted after World War I when an extension of time was granted in February 1919. The Moorgate to Clapham Common section reopened on 1 December 1924, approximately {{eight months after the}} rest of the line.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that <b>works</b> <b>only</b> by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary search. This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there are enough. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem is solved by binary search, as dividing the array in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E
5|$|It is Christmas in Bikini Bottom and Plankton is {{miserable and}} angry for {{committing}} so many naughty deeds, {{that he always}} gets on Santa's naughty list, making him unable to receive his Christmas wishthe Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element <b>works</b> <b>only</b> on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E

25|$|This {{situation}} has been {{complicated by the}} most recent revision of the Holidays Act. The holiday is Mondayised only if the employee would not usually work on weekends.

But an employee who usually worked Saturdays would not get the Monday holiday as they did not work on the Saturday.|$|E
25|$|During his lifetime, Pachelbel {{was best}} known as an organ composer. He wrote {{more than two hundred}} pieces for the instrument, both liturgical and secular, and {{explored}} most of the genres that existed at the time. Pachelbel was also a prolific vocal music composer: around a hundred of such works survive, including some 40 large-scale <b>works.</b> <b>Only</b> a few chamber music pieces by Pachelbel exist, although he might have composed many more, particularly while serving as court musician in Eisenach and Stuttgart.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of fields this {{strategy}} <b>works</b> <b>only</b> for addition. For multiplication it fails because 0 {{does not have a}} multiplicative inverse. An ad hoc attempt to deal with this would be to define 0−1=0. (This attempt fails, essentially because with this definition 0×0−1=1 is not true.) Therefore, one is naturally led to allow partial functions, i.e., functions that are defined only on a subset of their domain. However, there are several obvious ways to generalize notions such as substructure, homomorphism and identity.|$|E

25|$|Gilles Mureau (also Mureue, as he spelled it himself) (c. 1450 – July 1512) was a French {{composer}} and {{singer of the}} Renaissance.
