25|$|The second first-person {{narration}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>from</b> Alhambra is {{altogether different}} from the first – here we are not offered her history, but rather a history of 20th century cinema – a past which she seems to adopt as her own, {{as if she were}} each of the characters in those films. “The Middle” deals, again, with each of the family members’ experiences of Amber: she throws Astrid’s camera off a bridge into the road, she seduces Magnus, and reveals flaws in Eve and Michael’s relationship. “The Middle” ends with Eve throwing Amber out of their holiday home.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of these belligerent powers and the desolation they helped create appears to have made the relative peace offered in the far south of the country under the Hindu kings of Travancore, Madurai, Tanjore and Mysore, far more desirable and induced many Hindus to migrate there. A fact supporting this idea, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>from</b> English chroniclers in the 17th century, who state that their procurement of goods along the Western Concan and Canara coasts, suffered severely after the Mogul invasions and the mass depopulation of the peninsula they caused. Another statement often encountered in their annals is that the economic growth of the factory at Fort St. George, Madras was in a large measure attributable {{to the fact that}} many people chose to settle there to escape the chaotic conditions farther north. When we consider, in conjunction with these two facts, Fort St. George's position as a newly established, well-fortified and growing settlement in Aurangzeb's time, and therefore a secure refuge, a mass exodus southwards seems to have occurred in the period in question.|$|E

2500|$|The {{style of}} writing is unusual, {{different}} from the other scrolls. It is written in a style similar to Mishnaic Hebrew. While Hebrew is a well-known language, the majority of ancient Hebrew text in which the language is studied is generally biblical in nature, which, of course, the Copper Scroll is not. As a result, [...] "most of the vocabulary is simply not found in the Bible or anything else <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>from</b> ancient times." [...] The orthography is unusual, the script having features resulting from being written on copper with hammer and chisel. There is also the anomaly that seven of the location names are followed by a group of two or three Greek letters. Also, the [...] "clauses" [...] within the scroll mark intriguing parallels to that of Greek inventories, from the Greek temple of Apollo. This similarity to the Greek inventories, would suggest that scroll is in fact an authentic [...] "temple inventory." ...|$|E
2500|$|In AD 132, Zhang Heng of China's Han dynasty {{invented the}} first {{seismoscope}} (by the definition above), which was called Houfeng Didong Yi (translated as, [...] "instrument {{for measuring the}} seasonal winds and {{the movements of the}} Earth"). The description <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> <b>from</b> the History of the Later Han Dynasty, says that it was a large bronze vessel, about 2 meters in diameter; at eight points around the top were dragon's heads holding bronze balls. [...] When there was an earthquake, one of the mouths would open and drop its ball into a bronze toad at the base, making a sound and supposedly showing the direction of the earthquake. On at least one occasion, probably at the time of a large earthquake in Gansu in AD 143, the seismoscope indicated an earthquake even though one was not felt. The available text says that inside the vessel was a central column that could move along eight tracks; this is thought to refer to a pendulum, though it is not known exactly how this was linked to a mechanism that would open only one dragon's mouth. The first ever earthquake recorded by this seismoscope was supposedly somewhere in the east. Days later, a rider from the east reported this earthquake.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} Ibn Taymiyyah did not enjoy popularity among the intelligentsia of his day. Yossef Rapoport and Shahab Ahmed assert {{that he was a}} minority figure in his own times and the centuries that followed. Caterina Bori goes further, arguing that despite popularity Ibn Taymiyya may have enjoyed among the masses, he appears to have been not merely unpopular among the scholars of his day, but somewhat of an embarrassment. [...] notes similarly that Ibn Taymiyyah had [...] "very little influence on mainstream Sunni Islam until the nineteenth century." [...] and that he was [...] "a little-read scholar with problematic and controversial views" [...] and that [...] "The idea that Ibn Taymiyyah had an immediate and significant impact on the course of Sunni Islamic religious history simply does not cohere with the evidence that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>from</b> the five centuries that elapsed between his death and the rise of Sunni revivialism in the modern period." [...] On the other hand, [...] of SOAS university says that Ibn Taymiyyah, [...] "was perhaps the most eminent and influential Ḥanbalī jurist of the Middle Ages {{and one of the most}} prolific among them. He was also a renowned scholar of Islam whose influence was felt not only during his lifetime but extended through the centuries until the present day." ...|$|E
