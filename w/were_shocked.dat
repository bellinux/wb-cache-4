The Bukit Assek loss saw the defeat of its president and the then Deputy Chief Minister of Sarawak, Wong Soon Kai. The defeat spelled the end of Wong's political career and {{the election of the}} DAP's Wong Ho Leng to the Sarawak State Assembly. Wong Ho Leng subsequently lost the Bukit Assek seat in the 2001 state election, but regained it in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Many long-time {{employees}} of Olympus Corp <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> and angry, and felt {{betrayed by the}} executives who were responsible for bringing public humiliation onto the company. Former director Koji Miyata started a web site, called Olympus Grassroots, demanding clean-up at the company they say they love. Miyata also circulated a petition targeted at employees calling on the reinstatement of Woodford. As Olympus has a 70-percent market share in endoscopy, the scandal caused anxiety and concern among the medical profession, which sees Olympus endoscopes as irreplaceable.|$|E

5|$|As Feodora grew older, various suitors were {{considered}} for marriage. The exiled Prince Peter Karađorđević, thirty-six years her senior, unsuccessfully requested {{her hand in}} marriage. Another potential candidate was her cousin Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In late 1897, Feodora became engaged to Prince Henry XXX of Reuss, and they married the following year, on 24 September 1898 in a Lutheran ceremony at Breslau. The groom was fifteen years older than his bride and a captain in a Brunswick regiment, but not wealthy or particularly high-ranked. Many in the family <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> at the marriage, but the Dowager Empress was at least pleased that her granddaughter seemed happy with the match.|$|E
5|$|Nebraska {{was ranked}} No. 1 in the Associated Press preseason poll, and {{lived up to}} the ranking in its first game of the season. On September 7, Nebraska {{overwhelmed}} the Michigan State Spartans, 5514. After an off week, however, Nebraska fans <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> by one of the first big national upsets of the season as Nebraska was shut out by No. 17 Arizona State, 190. The loss dropped Nebraska to No. 8 in the rankings, but as the season wore on, Nebraska rose through the ranks as the Cornhuskers won seven consecutive games. Nebraska's 101 record to that point earned it a trip to the first-ever Big 12 Championship Game in St. Louis, Missouri, against the Texas Longhorns.|$|E
5|$|Before {{relation}} with his later wife Gertrud Weiss, Leo Szilard's life {{partner in the}} period 1927 – 1934 was kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue in this work. Szilard married Gertrud (Trude) Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They {{had known each other}} since 1929, and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver {{for weeks at a time}} when they had never been together for more than a few days before. Single people living together was frowned upon in the conservative United States at the time, and after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began to worry that she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of his friends <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> when they found out, as it was widely believed that Szilard was a born bachelor.|$|E

5|$|Blues harpist Cyril Davies ran the London Skiffle Club at the Roundhouse {{public house}} in London’s Soho, {{which served as}} {{a focal point for}} British skiffle acts. Like guitarist Alexis Korner, he had worked for Chris Barber, playing in the R segment Barber {{introduced}} to his show and as part of the supporting band for visiting US artists. They began to play together as a duo and in 1957, deciding their central interest was blues, they closed the skiffle club and reopened a month later as The London Blues and Barrelhouse Club. It acted as a venue for visiting artists and their own performances. The visit of Muddy Waters in 1958 had a major impact on the duo and on the nature of British R in general. Initially British audiences <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> by Waters's amplified electric blues, but he was soon playing to ecstatic crowds and receiving rave reviews. Where British blues had often emulated Delta blues and country blues in the emerging British folk revival, Davies and Korner, who had supported Waters on tour, now began to play high-powered electric blues, forming the band Blues Incorporated.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} June, {{the other}} parties had been intimidated into disbanding. This {{included}} the Nazis' nominal coalition partner, the DNVP; with the SA's help, Hitler forced its leader, Hugenberg, to resign on 29 June. On 14 July 1933, the NSDAP was declared the only legal political party in Germany. The demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial, and political leaders. In response, Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934. Hitler targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who, along {{with a number of}} Hitler's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher), were rounded up, arrested, and shot. While the international community and some Germans <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> by the murders, many in Germany believed Hitler was restoring order.|$|E
5|$|His nephew and biographer (Ferdinand Brock Tupper) {{asserts that}} shortly after Brock joined the regiment, a {{professional}} dueller forced a match on him. As the one being challenged Brock had {{his choice of}} terms, and he insisted that they use pistols. His friends <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> as Brock was a large target and his opponent an expert shot. Brock, however, refused to change his mind. When the duellist arrived at the field, he asked Brock to decide how many paces they would take. Brock insisted that the duel would take place not at the usual range, but at handkerchief distance (i.e., close range). The duellist declined and subsequently {{was forced to leave}} the regiment. This contributed to Brock's popularity and reputation among his fellow officers, as this duellist had a formidable reputation and was reportedly regarded as a bully in the regiment. During his time with this regiment, Brock served in the Caribbean, where he fell ill with fever and nearly died. He did not fully recover until after returning to England in 1793.|$|E

5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} matches, {{although}} there were instances of the English bowlers pitching the ball short and causing problems with their pace, full bodyline tactics were not used. There had been little unusual about the English bowling except the number of fast bowlers. Larwood and Voce were given a light workload in the early matches by Jardine. The English tactics changed {{in a game against}} an Australian XI team at Melbourne in mid-November, when full bodyline tactics were deployed for the first time. Jardine had left himself out of the English side, which was led instead by Bob Wyatt who later wrote that the team experimented with a diluted form of bodyline bowling. He reported to Jardine that Bradman, who was playing for the opposition, seemed uncomfortable against the bowling tactics of Larwood, Voce and Bowes. The crowd, press and Australian players <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> by what they experienced and believed that the bowlers were targeting the batsmen's heads. Bradman adopted unorthodox tactics—ducking, weaving and moving around the crease—which did not meet with universal approval from Australians and he just 36 and 13 in the match.|$|E
5|$|Not {{knowing that}} Okello had given orders to kill no whites, the Americans living in Stone Town {{fled to the}} English Club, where the point for {{evacuation}} was. Those travelling in the car convoy to the English Club <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> to see the battered bodies of Arab men lying {{out on the streets}} of Stone Town with their severed penises and testicles shoved into their mouths. As part of Okello's carefully laid out plans, all over the island, gangs of Africans armed with knives, spears and pangas (machetes) went about systemically killing all the Arabs they could find. The American diplomat Don Petterson described his horror as he watched from his house as he saw a gang of African men storm the house of an Arab, behead him in public with a panga, followed by screams from within his house as {{his wife and three children}} were raped and killed, followed by the same scene being repeated at the next house of an Arab, followed by yet another and another. After taking control of Stone Town on the first day, the revolutionaries continued to fight the Manga for control of the countryside for least two days afterwards with whole families of Arabs being massacred after their homes had been stormed.|$|E

5|$|Originally Mary {{believed}} that many nobles supported her marriage, but things soon turned sour between the newly elevated Bothwell (created Duke of Orkney) {{and his former}} peers, and the marriage proved to be deeply unpopular. Catholics considered the marriage unlawful, since they did not recognise Bothwell's divorce or {{the validity of the}} Protestant service. Both Protestants and Catholics <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> that Mary should marry the man accused of murdering her husband. The marriage was tempestuous, and Mary became despondent. Twenty-six Scottish peers, known as the confederate lords, turned against Mary and Bothwell, raising an army against them. Mary and Bothwell confronted the lords at Carberry Hill on 15 June, but there was no battle as Mary's forces dwindled away through desertion during negotiations. Bothwell was given safe passage from the field, and the lords took Mary to Edinburgh, where crowds of spectators denounced her as an adulteress and murderer. The following night, she was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle, on an island in the middle of Loch Leven. Between 20 and 23 July, Mary miscarried twins. On 24 July, she was forced to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son James. Moray was made regent, while Bothwell was driven into exile. He was imprisoned in Denmark, became insane and died in 1578.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{problems}} {{continued to}} multiply. By 1925, Carin's mother was ill. The Görings—with difficulty—raised {{the money in}} the spring of 1925 for a journey to Sweden via Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Danzig (now Gdańsk). Göring had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> by his deterioration. Carin, who was ill with epilepsy and a weak heart, had to allow the doctors to take charge of Göring; her son was taken by his father. Göring was certified a dangerous drug addict and was placed in Långbro asylum on 1 September 1925. He was violent {{to the point where he}} had to be confined to a straitjacket, but his psychiatrist felt he was sane; the condition was caused solely by the morphine. Weaned off the drug, he left the facility briefly, but had to return for further treatment. He returned to Germany when an amnesty was declared in 1927 and resumed working in the aircraft industry. Hitler, who had written Mein Kampf while in prison, had been released in December 1924. Carin Göring, ill with epilepsy and tuberculosis, died of heart failure on 17 October 1931.|$|E
5|$|The final major {{campaign}} {{in which the}} PanzerI formed {{a large portion of}} the armoured strength was Operation Barbarossa, 22June 1941. The 3,300 German tanks included about 410 PanzerI's. By the end of the month, {{a large portion of the}} Red Army found itself trapped in the Minsk pocket, and by 21September Kiev had fallen, thereby allowing the Germans to concentrate on their ultimate objective, Moscow. Despite the success of Germany's armour in the Soviet Union, between June and September most German officers <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> to find their tanks were inferior to newer Soviet models, the T-34 and KV series. Army Group North quickly realized that none of the tank guns currently in use by German armor could penetrate the thick armour of the KV-1. The performance of the Red Army during the Battle of Moscow and the growing numbers of new Soviet tanks made it obvious the PanzerI was not suitable for this front. Some less battle-worthy PanzerIs were tasked with towing lorries through mud to alleviate logistics problems at the front.|$|E
