25|$|In {{the first}} couple of decades there was no {{traditional}} marriage in the kibbutz. If a man and woman <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>married,</b> they went to the housing office and requested a room together. Not having traditional marriage was seen as a way to dissolve the patriarchy and give women their own standing without depending on a man (economically or socially) and was also viewed as a positive thing for the community as a whole, as communal life was the main aspect of the kibbutz.|$|E
500|$|Richard Rennison (29 October 1889 – 5 August 1969) was {{the last}} [...] "anvil priest" [...] at Gretna Green, Scotland.

She became a resident trainee nurse at the Woolton Convalescent Hospital, and later worked as a private secretary for Ernest Vickers, who was an industrial magnate with businesses in Manchester and Liverpool.

500|$|Hugh Mackie {{purchased}} the Old Blacksmith's Shop at Gretna Green in 1890 and resided there as [...] "anvil priest" [...] until 1926 {{when he was}} looking to retire and find a replacement. Mackie found Richard Rennison, who had recently joined the community, and by October 1927, Rennison was presiding over marriages and acting as caretaker of the shop. The shop had ceased any metalwork in 1900 and was solely used for marriage ceremonies. A natural showman, Rennison soon became the resident [...] "anvil priest" [...] and set about marrying people. He would regularly point out that, although {{he was not a}} member of the clergy, he could marry people as he was [...] "No Sinner" [...] – the reverse of his surname! In his first ten years, he married around 2000 couples, the majority of whom were couples between 40 and 60 years old. By 1939, the number of marriages he had performed had increased past 4000 due to the many young men who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>married</b> before starting their service in World War II.|$|E
500|$|When {{other girls}} were {{thinking}} of marriage, Mimi Stanley talked of challenges and adventures. She once confided that she never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>married,</b> as she hated {{the idea of being}} [...] "tied to the kitchen sink". She became a resident trainee nurse at the Woolton Convalescent Hospital, to which Smith delivered milk every morning. Smith started seriously courting Mimi in the spring of 1932, but was constantly thwarted by her indifference and her father's interference. George Stanley (Mimi's father) would only allow the couple to sit in the back room of the family home in Newcastle Road when he or his wife were in the front room, and before it grew too late he would burst into the back room and loudly order Smith home. The courtship lasted almost seven years, but Smith grew tired of waiting, so after delivering milk to the hospital one morning he gave her an ultimatum that she must marry him, [...] "or nothing at all!" [...] The youngest sister of the Stanley family, Julia Stanley, had married Alfred Lennon nine months before, on 3 December 1938.|$|E

500|$|On 23June 1941, {{during the}} opening phase of Operation Barbarossa, the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, Ostermann, in a free-hunting mission in the Lithuanian airspace north of Kaunas, intercepted a formation of nine Tupolev SB's and claimed two shot down in flames. Ostermann survived a belly landing following combat with more SBs in south-eastern Latvia on 26 June. On 5 July he claimed three SB-3 Soviet bombers in combat over the Velikaya River at Ostrov. He claimed his 19th and 20th aerial victory on 6July in the same combat area. On the Eastern Front he claimed JG54's 1,000th victory {{of the war on}} 1August 1941. He became the eighth member of JG54 to receive the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (...) on 4September 1941 after 29 aerial victories. The award was presented on 10September 1941 in Dno by Generaloberst (Colonel General) Alfred Keller. He claimed his 50th aerial victory on 9January 1942, the 60th on 28January 1942 and the 70th on 19February 1942. After this series of aerial victories Ostermann was sent on home leave. The reason for his leave was that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>married.</b> Back home, on his way to his wedding ceremony, Ostermann was arrested and put in jail. A German police officer had assumed that Ostermann, with his childlike features, was actually a schoolboy who was playing a prank and illegally wearing a Luftwaffe uniform and military decorations. The consequences endured by the police officer for his bad judgement remain unknown.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike his {{predecessors}} and successors, Paul VI refused to excommunicate the opponents. He admonished {{but did not}} punish those with other views. The new theological freedoms which he fosteredresulted in a pluralism of opinions and uncertainties among the faithful.

Conservatives complained, that [...] "women wanted to be priests, priests <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>married,</b> bishops became regional popes and theologians claimed absolute teaching authority.

[...] Changes such as the reorientation of the liturgy, alterations to the ordinary of the Mass, alterations to the liturgical calendar in the motu proprio Mysterii Paschalis, and the relocation of the tabernacle were controversial among some Catholics.|$|E

It was a time when there were few White women on the southwestern frontier. It was not unusual for White men to marry Mexican or Native American women for companionship.
