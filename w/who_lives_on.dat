5|$|SpongeBob {{is often}} seen hanging around with his best friend Patrick, <b>who</b> <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> the same street as him. SpongeBob's {{unlimited}} optimistic cheer often leads him to perceive the outcome of numerous endeavors and the personalities of those around him as happier than they actually are; for instance, he believes that Squidward enjoys his company {{in spite of the}} fact that he clearly loathes him. SpongeBob's greatest goal in life is to receive his driver's license from Mrs. Puff's boat driving school, but he panics and crashes whenever he is in a boat. He lives in a submerged pineapple with his pet snail Gary.|$|E

Myst is the home of an {{explorer}} named Atrus, <b>who</b> <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> the island with his wife Catherine and two sons, Sirrus and Achenar. An unnamed protagonist drops into Myst and finds the island strangely deserted. As the player explores Myst, they discover Sirrus and Achenar trapped inside two books. Both swear that their parents are dead due to the machinations of the other brother, and instruct the player to repair their books so they can be freed. In truth, Atrus and Catherine are merely imprisoned, and both Sirrus and Achenar are guilty of growing power-hungry and destroying Atrus' books. The player frees Atrus, leading to the events of the sequel Riven.|$|E

500|$|Disguised as a priest, Conan infiltrates the temple, {{but he is}} discovered, captured, and tortured. [...] Doom lectures him on {{the power}} of flesh, which he {{demonstrates}} by hypnotically enticing a girl to leap to her death. He then orders for Conan to be crucified on the Tree of Woe. [...] The barbarian {{is on the verge of}} death when he is discovered by Subotai and brought to Akiro, the Wizard of the Mounds, <b>who</b> <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> a burial site for warriors and kings. [...] The wizard summons spirits to heal Conan and warns that they will [...] "extract a heavy toll", which Valeria is willing to pay. [...] These spirits also try to abduct Conan, but he is restored to health after Valeria and Subotai fend them off.|$|E
500|$|The path to {{the afterlife}} as {{laid out in the}} Book of the Dead was a {{difficult}} one. The deceased was required to pass a series of gates, caverns and mounds guarded by supernatural creatures. These terrifying entities were armed with enormous knives and are illustrated in grotesque forms, typically as human figures with the heads of animals or combinations of different ferocious beasts. Their names—for instance, [...] "He <b>who</b> <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> snakes" [...] or [...] "He who dances in blood"—are equally grotesque. These creatures had to be pacified by reciting the appropriate spells included in the Book of the Dead; once pacified they posed no further threat, and could even extend their protection to the dead person. Another breed of supernatural creatures was 'slaughterers' who killed the unrighteous on behalf of Osiris; the Book of the Dead equipped its owner to escape their attentions. [...] As well as these supernatural entities, there were also threats from natural or supernatural animals, including crocodiles, snakes, and beetles.|$|E

500|$|The {{song that}} {{plays on the}} radio during the break in the Thanksgiving {{football}} game is [...] "Get Dancing" [...] by Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes. The game is played at the Pontiac Silverdome, then home to the Detroit Lions, who also play on Thanksgiving. Lisa says the following about her centerpiece: [...] "It's {{a tribute to the}} trailblazing women who made our country great. See, there's Georgia O'Keeffe, Susan B. Anthony, and this is Marjory Stoneman Douglas. I'm sure you haven't heard of her, but she worked her whole life to preserve the Florida Everglades." [...] The poem Lisa is seen writing in her room after her centerpiece is destroyed is a reference to Allen Ginsberg's poem [...] "Howl". Lisa also keeps a book of Ginsberg's work on a bookshelf next to Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road, and a collection of poems by Edgar Allan Poe. Feeling hungry, Bart decides to steal food from the old, rich Mr. Burns, <b>who</b> <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> the corner of Croesus and Mammon, two mythological figures of greed. A member of Burns' security staff reads the novel Les Misérables.|$|E
500|$|Peter {{mentions}} {{starring in}} Starlight Express, {{which is a}} rock musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber; although Peter's role as shown onscreen {{has little to do}} with the actual performance. While Stewie and Chris are lost in the forest overnight, Stewie plays a guessing game with one of the answers being Thornton Melon. Stewie looks at the television audience wondering why the majority of them chose Thornton Melon, then Stewie notes that Thornton Melon was the character that Rodney Dangerfield played in the 1986 film Back to School. It was in fact a quote by Henry David Thoreau. Stewie's reference to a newspaper headline saying [...] "Stewie Defeats Truman" [...] is a takeoff of the famous [...] "Dewey Defeats Truman" [...] headline, which erroneously predicted that Thomas E. Dewey would defeat Harry S. Truman in the 1948 presidential election. Peter's new career as a psychic is a parody of John Edward and his TV series Crossing Over. While the police depend on Peter to help them find someone, Peter stalls by pretending to channel the spirit of Lou Costello; his exchange with Joe about the missing man, Mr. Hu <b>who</b> <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> First Street, is a takeoff of the famous Abbott and Costello routine [...] "Who's on First?". Also, there was a cutaway to the Enterprise from the original [...] series showing Spock winning the lottery (with the numbers 18, 24, 41 and 72), then cussing at everyone shortly before leaving. Nana Visitor voices the Enterprise viewscreen, while series writer and producer John Viener voices Spock in the cutaway.|$|E
