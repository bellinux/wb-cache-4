5|$|Baker's last {{published}} <b>work,</b> <b>Right</b> Wing, {{as well as}} his posthumous novels Testosterone and Anarchy, {{represent a}} stylistic departure in that he inserts himself into the plot as either a secondary character or the protagonist. The latter two were edited, {{and in the case of}} Anarchy, partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart. Testosterone needed only minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E
5|$|The rich art {{elaborated}} by the Muisca {{has inspired}} modern artists and designers in their creativity. Muisca motives are represented as murals, in clothing and as objects found {{all over the}} former Muisca territories {{as well as in}} animated clips and video games. The art of the indigenous inhabitants of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense is well studied by many different researchers who published their <b>work</b> <b>right</b> from the beginning of colonial times. The conquistador who made first contact with the Muisca, Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, wrote in his memoires about a skilled and well-organised civilisation of traders and farmers. Friar Pedro Simón described the relation between art and the religion and later contributions in the analysis of the various artforms have been made by Alexander von Humboldt, Joaquín Acosta and Liborio Zerda in the 19th century, Miguel Triana, Eliécer Silva Celis and Sylvia M. Broadbent in the 20th century and modern research is dominated by the work of Carl Henrik Langebaek Rueda, Javier Ocampo López and many others.|$|E
25|$|But these differences, though {{demonstrating a}} Lagašite respect of {{religious}} figures simply {{in the amount}} of time and energy they required, is not as telling as the language Gudea uses to justify any punishment. Whereas Sargon or Naram-Sin simply demand punishment to any who change their words, based on their power, Gudea defends his words through tradition, “since the earliest days, since the seed sprouted forth, no one was (ever) supposed to alter the utterance of a ruler of Lagaš who, after building the Eninnu for my lord Ningirsu, made things function as they should”. Changing the words of Naram-Sin, the living god, is treason, because he is the king. But changing the words of Gudea, simple governor of Lagaš, is unjust, because he made things <b>work</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

40|$|In 2011, the Labor {{government}} released {{asylum seekers}} arriving by boat {{into the community}} on bridging visas {{for the first time}} since the policy of mandatory detention was introduced in 1992. Initially, the bridging visas included an entitlement to work. A ‘no work condition’ was added to bridging visas granted from August 2012. In December 2014, the government undertook to reinstate work entitlements to asylum seekers in the community on bridging visas. As at September 2015, there were 28, 938 asylum seekers living in the community who had arrived by boat, some with <b>work</b> <b>rights</b> and some without.

Following this, Priyanka Chopra, {{who had worked with}} Baweja in Love Story 2050, was cast to play all twelve of the potential brides, each related to one of the twelve zodiac signs. On casting Chopra, Gowariker said: [...] "I have always liked Priyanka's <b>work,</b> <b>right</b> from [...] She's been fabulous in all her films.

The present study investigated the impact of Australia&# 039;s refugee determination process (RDP) on psychiatric morbidity in community-based asylum-seekers (AS) and refugees. Psychiatric morbidity was predicted to be greater in AS than refugees, and to persist or increase as a function of time in the RDP. The effect on mental health of demographic and socio-political factors such as health cover and <b>work</b> <b>rights</b> were also investigated. Psychiatric morbidity was measured prospectively on five mental health indices at baseline (T 1, n= 131) and an average of 15. 7 months later (T 2, n= 56). Psychiatric morbidity in AS significantly decreased between time points such that it was no longer greater than that of refugees at T 2. Caseness of PTSD and demoralisation reduced in AS who gained protection; however, those who maintained asylum-seeker status at T 2 also had a significant reduction in PTS and depression symptom severity. Reduced PTS and demoralisation symptoms were associated with securing <b>work</b> <b>rights</b> and health cover. Living in the community with <b>work</b> <b>rights</b> and access to health cover significantly improves psychiatric symptoms in forced migrants irrespective of their protection status...|$|R

2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi asked Rabbi Ishmael {{the son of}} Rabbi Jose if he {{had learned}} from his father the actual meaning of [...] "And on the seventh day God {{finished}} the work that He had been doing" [...] (for surely God finished God's work on the sixth day, not the Sabbath). He compared it to a man striking a hammer on an anvil, raising it by day and bringing it down immediately after nightfall. (In the second between raising the hammer and bringing it down, night began. Thus, he taught that God finished God's <b>work</b> <b>right</b> {{at the end of}} the sixth day, so that in that very moment the Sabbath began.) Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai taught that mortal humans, who do not know exactly what time it is, must add from the profane to the sacred to avoid working in the sacred time; but God knows time precisely, can enter the Sabbath by a hair's breadth. Genibah and the Rabbis discussed [...] Genibah compared it to a king who made a bridal chamber, which he plastered, painted, and adorned, so that all that the bridal chamber lacked was a bride to enter it. Similarly, just then, the world lacked the Sabbath. (Thus by means of instituting the Sabbath itself, God completed God's work, and humanity's world, on the seventh day.) The Rabbis compared it to a king who made a ring that lacked only a signet. Similarly, the world lacked the Sabbath. And the Midrash taught that this is one of the texts that they changed for King Ptolemy (as they could not expect him to understand these explanations), making [...] read, [...] "And He finished on the sixth day, and rested on the seventh." [...] King Ptolemy (or others say, a philosopher) asked the elders in Rome how many days it took God to create the world. The elders replied that it took God six days. He replied that since then, Gehenna has been burning for the wicked. Reading the words [...] "His work" [...] in [...] Rabbi Berekiah said in the name of Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon that with neither labor nor toil did God create the world, yet [...] says, [...] "He rested [...] [...] [...] from all His work." [...] He explained that [...] states it that way to punish the wicked who destroy the world, which was created with labor, and to give a good reward to the righteous who uphold the world, which was created with toil. Reading the words [...] "Because that in it He rested from all His work which God created to make," [...] in [...] the Midrash taught that what was created on the Sabbath, after God rested, was tranquility, ease, peace, and quiet. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Jose ben Nehorai that as long as the hands of their Master were working on them, they went on expanding; but when the hands of their Master rested, rest was afforded to them, and thus God gave rest to the world on the seventh day. Rabbi Abba taught that when a mortal king takes his army to their quarters, he does not distribute largesse (rather, he does that only before the troops go into battle), and when he distributes largesse, he does not order a halt. But God ordered a halt and distributed largesse, as [...] says, [...] "And He rested [...] [...] [...] and He blessed." [...] (Not only did God afford humanity a day of rest, but God also gave humanity the gift of a sacred day.) ...|$|E
