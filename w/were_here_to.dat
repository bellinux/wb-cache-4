5|$|The {{witnesses}} took {{ten hours}} to testify, {{during which time}} the court sat continuously. After a short break, the judge began his summing up, taking two hours to charge the jury. The judge urged the jury to put their prejudice at hearing that Thornton had sex with Ashford out of their heads; they <b>were</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> determine if Thornton was guilty of the offence charged. He pointed out to the jury the lack of concealment exhibited by Thornton, his admission of the sexual act and of being with Ashford until 4a.m. The judge told them {{it was not possible}} for Thornton to have committed the acts alleged by the prosecution and still have made it to the Holden farm {{by the time he was}} seen by Heydon, and stressed that Thornton did not act like a man who ran. The judge concluded by reminding the jury that it was better a murderer go free than an innocent man be convicted.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of August 16, the weather cleared, and Stark ordered his men {{to be ready to}} attack. Stark is reputed to have rallied his troops by saying they <b>were</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> fight for their [...] "natural born rights as Englishmen" [...] and he added [...] "There are your enemies, the Red Coats and the Tories. They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow." [...] Upon hearing that the militia had melted away into the woods, Baum assumed that the Americans were retreating or redeploying. However, Stark had decided to capitalize on weaknesses in the German's widely distributed position, and had sent sizable flanking parties to either side of his lines. These movements were assisted by a ruse employed by Stark's men that enabled them to get closer safely without alarming the opposing forces. The Germans, most of whom spoke no English, had been told that soldiers with bits of white paper in their hat were Loyalists, and should not be fired on; Stark's men had also heard this and many of them had suitably adorned their hats.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{told the}} United States Secret Service he rented the Hyatt hotel room at Adolf's request {{and that he}} {{believed}} [...] "without a doubt" [...] that Adolf came to Denver to kill Obama. According to a police affidavit, [...] "Johnson said the only reason for such killing would be because Obama is black." [...] During an August 25 interview with KCNC-TV, a CBS owned-and-operated television station in Denver, Johnson first denied being personally involved with the plot and, when asked whether he felt the men had serious plans {{to go through with}} the assassination, he said, [...] "Looking back at it, I don't want to say yes, but I don't want to say no." [...] Eventually, however, he admitted the other two men had planned a killing when he said, [...] "Yeah, they <b>were</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> do that, to assassinate him ... it's about as hard for me to swallow as it is for you to understand." [...] Johnson said the plan was for Adolf to, [...] "shoot Obama from a high vantage point using a [...] sighted at 750 yards". Johnson said the shooting was to take place during Obama's acceptance speech on August 28 at the Democratic National Convention in INVESCO Field at Mile High. Johnson told the station, [...] "He don't belong in political office. Blacks don't belong in political office. He ought to be shot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Quantrill {{himself said}} that his {{motivation}} for the attack was [...] "to plunder, and destroy the town in retaliation for Osceola." [...] That was {{a reference to the}} Union's attack on Osceola, Missouri in September 1861, led by Senator James H. Lane. Osceola was plundered and nine men were given a drumhead court-martial trial and executed. Several other Missouri towns and large swaths of the Missouri countryside had been similarly plundered and burned by Unionist forces from Kansas. Castel (1999) concludes that revenge was the primary motive, followed by a desire to plunder. The retaliatory nature of the attack on Lawrence was confirmed by the survivors. [...] "The universal testimony of all the ladies and others who talked with the butchers of the 21st ult. is that these demons claimed they <b>were</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> revenge the wrongs done their families by our men under Lane, Jennison, Anthony and Co." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 10:25am, Bravo Company de-bussed as the Iraqis were {{swarming}} {{around them}} and the ringleaders in the crowd were encouraging the locals to attack Bravo Company. As they de-bussed to throw back the crowd, the rear vehicle noticed that the Iraqi Militia contingent were {{no longer in the}} convoy. Such was the intensity of the rock throwing and the sheer numbers of locals in the crowd, Bravo took the decision to fire rubber bullets at the ringleaders. Whilst the soldiers were well aware that using rubber bullets could either calm or inflame a situation, they felt that they had no choice given the intensity of the crowd, who were being told via the loudspeakers on the minarets that the British <b>were</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> [...] "rape the women [...] attack them!" [...] One of the ringleaders was identified, and a Corporal using the baton gun fired and felled the ringleader from [...] away. After two more baton rounds were fired, the crowd surged forward and the Non-commissioned officer (NCO) of Bravo Company (Sgt Gordon Robertson) fired warning shots into the air from his rifle and other troops followed suit. At this the crowd moved back and allowed them space to move, but it was later realized that the local Iraqis had gone to get their weapons. In their minds, the British had fired first, so {{it was a matter of}} pride that they returned fire. At 10:30am, Iraqi gunmen would return fire and Bravo would defend themselves with the result of the first Iraqi's dying. One witness in the crowd claimed that children were throwing stones at the Paratroopers and when one of the paratroopers went into a firing position, a local man called Tassir thought a child would be shot, so he levelled his weapon at the paratroopers. The British troops fired on him first as they thought he was going to shoot, and after that, the crowd became completely hostile. At this point, the RMPs were only [...] away from the Paratroopers. Ahmed Younis, a member of the crowd on the morning, said The market was very crowded. I threw myself on the ground and shouted to everyone to run away or get down. The shooting lasted about five minutes but there were bullets going everywhere. They were firing on automatic. I couldn't believe it when they started shooting. Sheikh Shejar said [...] The Iraqi side fired first. Later they went to the police station and attacked there. The mob wanted to shelter at the police station and use it as a base to attack the British.|$|E
