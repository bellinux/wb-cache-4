5|$|The {{screenplay}} for Whisky Galore! {{was written by}} Compton Mackenzie and Angus MacPhail, based on Mackenzie's own novel; he received £500 {{for the rights to}} the book, and a further £1,000 because of the film's profitability. Mackendrick and Danischewsky also worked on the script before further input from the writers Elwyn Ambrose and Donald Campbell, and the actor James Robertson Justice, who also appeared in the film. The film and novel's story was based on an incident in the Second World War, when the cargo ship SS Politician ran aground off the north coast of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides. Local inhabitants from the island, and from nearby South Uist, heard that the ship was carrying 22,000 cases of whisky; they rescued 7,000 from the wreck before it sank. Mackenzie, a Home Guard commander on the island, took no action against the removal of the whisky. The plot underwent some modification and condensation from the novel, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background removed; in particular, much of the religious aspect of the novel was left out, with the novel's Protestant Great Todday and Roman Catholic Little Todday being merged into the single island of Todday.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the serial}} was filmed on {{location}} in Aldbourne, Wiltshire. The location shoot was awarded two weeks' filming, {{more than double the}} usual amount at the time, leading {{to a lot of the}} finished story being set outside, rather than in studio. Membury airfield in Berkshire and Bridge Farm, Ramsbury, were also used briefly as locations. Filming began on 19 April 1971 and saw pleasant, sunny weather for the first week, leading to sudden overnight snow in the second week - causing filming to be delayed. Some episode one scenes were filmed at night - a rarity for the show, although some of these scenes were filmed during daylight with a dark filter put over the camera lens. Other dark indoor scenes were filmed in a disused aircraft hangar at Bridge Farm, Ramsbury. Filming for the serial caused great excitement in Aldbourne, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village residents appearing as extras, as well as the Headington Quarry Morris dancers performing a routine in episode four.|$|E

Diana can be very charming and this hides the fact that she is looking after herself and her interests. Of this, Badler said [...] "She is the smiling assassin, but she's irresistible as she has the wit, the brain and the moves to get away with it!" [...] To go with her job and personality, Diana has a glamorous wardrobe, which Badler said is the complete opposite of hers. Badler explained that Diana is more conservative as she wears a lot of beige, silver and grey, with Cartier watches. She added [...] "There are many power suits and stilettos!" ...|$|E

She arrives in Erinsborough from New York {{on a business trip}} and decides to try {{to take control of the}} company. She also wants to get revenge on the former lover who broke her heart, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis).

She is described as a [...] "villainess", a [...] "dangerous femme fatale" [...] and a woman on a mission.

[...] "Boys Wanna Fight" [...] criticizes world affairs and [...] "Sex Is Not the Enemy" [...] is about moral guardians, inspired by the outcry caused by Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl. The songs about relationships follow Manson's tendency to discuss dark topics and emotions; [...] "Bleed Like Me" [...] discusses [...] problems with empathy [...] and [...] "Bad Boyfriend" [...] is about [...] "a predatory female meeting a predatory man". The album closer [...] "Happy Home" [...] is about conflict within the band and in the wider world during production, the search of forgiveness, peace and {{coming to terms with}} one's place in a chaotic world.|$|E
500|$|An {{unfinished}} {{version of}} the album was leaked onto BitTorrent websites and P2P services months before the release date. Drummer Aaron Gillespie, during the short time after the recording of Define the Great Line, recorded the debut album for his side-project The Almost, which was produced by Seattle producer Aaron Sprinkle and was released April 3, 2007. In April 2006, the band had been courted by several major record labels, instead re-signing with Tooth & Nail Records because they felt that major labels [...] "don't get heavy bands" [...] and [...] "we don't really agree <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business practices major labels employ sometimes." [...] On April 21, Underoath flew to Sweden to work with Popcore Films, to create music videos for [...] "In Regards to Myself" [...] and [...] "Writing on the Walls"; the latter {{was chosen as the}} lead single for the album and was later nominated for the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video.

2500|$|The term [...] "colitas" [...] in {{the first}} stanza ("warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air") has been {{interpreted}} as a sexual slang or a reference to marijuana. [...] "Colitas" [...] means [...] "little tails" [...] in Spanish; in Mexican slang it refers to buds of the cannabis (marijuana) plant. According to Glenn Frey, the [...] "warm smell" [...] is [...] "colitas...it means little tails, {{the very top of}} the plant." [...] The Eagles' manager Irving Azoff appears to lend support to the marijuana hypothesis, however, Felder said: [...] "The colitas is a plant that grows in the desert that blooms at night, and it has this kind of pungent, almost funky smell.

[...] However, he said they still occasionally wear makeup, just not as much. Toshiya explained [...] "To be honest, when we first started and we were wearing a lot of makeup on stage and stuff, {{there were a lot of}} bands doing that at the time in Japan, and people thought it was cool. But not anymore, ha ha." [...] Die said [...] "They saw us as idols but we aren't idols. We are a band, we play music and want to be known for it. So we decided to change our style slowly."

2500|$|Sebastian {{said in an}} {{interview}} in late 2009 that the songs for the album originally had a much more organic old school sound, as his US record company had wanted the album to have a similar sound to The Memphis Album. He said he didn't feel that was right for the Australian market, [...] "I ended up with a new record of original songs that didn't have quite the right production, like it all sounded quite old school, it didn't really have a modern edge to it. I ended up going back and reproducing everything which was quite a nightmare. I mean [...] "Like It Like That" [...] for example was really old school, like real drums, real organic, so we reproduced that and we got it to sound a little more modern, in your face I guess, the way it is now and we did that <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tracks so yeah, it was a bit of a nightmare getting to the final product". Sebastian said he felt he was exactly where he wanted to be creatively with this album: [...] "I'm in a really happy place musically, because this is exactly the style of music I want to do and that I've wanted to do for so long. It's not about me changing the world; it's just about fun music - pure and simple. Music is so powerful. It's powerful enough on a personal level, without me trying to change the world." ...|$|E

60|$|Ricker {{leaned out}} of the doorway and {{followed}} him {{down the street with}} a troubled eye. He had taken stock in Bartley, as the saying is, and his heart misgave him that he should lose on the investment; he could not have sold out to any of their friends for twenty cents on the dollar. Nothing that any one could lay his finger on had happened, and yet there had been a general loss of confidence in that particular stock. Ricker himself had lost confidence in it, and when he lightly mentioned that talk at the club, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fellows, he had a serious wish to get at Bartley some time, and see what it was that was beginning to make people mistrust him. The fellows who liked him at first and wished him well, and believed in his talent, had mostly dropped him. Bartley's associates were now the most raffish set on the press, or the green hands; and something had brought this to pass in less than two years. Ricker had believed that it was Witherby; at the club he had contended that it was Bartley's association with Witherby that made people doubtful of him. As for those ideas that Bartley had advanced in their discussion of journalism, he had considered it all mere young man's nonsense that Bartley would outgrow. But now, as he looked at Bartley's back, he had his misgivings; it struck him as the back of a degenerate man, and that increasing bulk seemed not to represent an increase of wholesome substance, but a corky, buoyant tissue, materially responsive to some sort of moral dry-rot.|$|E
