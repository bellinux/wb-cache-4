5|$|Because I {{always try}} {{so hard to}} win and had my {{troubles}} in Boston, I was suspended. At playoff time it hurts {{not be in the}} game with the boys. However, I want to do what is good for the people of Montreal and the team. So that no further harm will be done, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> everyone to get behind the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. I will take my punishment and come back next year to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E
25|$|Many {{tasks that}} we would like to {{automate}} by using a computer are of question–answer type: we <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a question and the computer should produce an answer. In theoretical computer science, such tasks are called computational problems. Formally, a computational problem consists of instances together with a solution for each instance. Instances are questions that we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.|$|E

She <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her father if Corey was sick; she <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> him <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her why Corey did not come any more.

2500|$|Health {{insurance}} costs have risen over 36 {{percent over the}} last four years according to the Washington Post. We're paying more. We're getting less. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you: Who bears responsibility for this? Is it the government? Is it the insurance companies? Is it the lawyers? Is it the doctors? Is it the administration? ...|$|E
2500|$|Channel 4 {{television}} in the UK present an annual Christmas message {{as an alternative to}} the Christmas Message of Queen Elizabeth II. In 2015 their speaker was Abdullah Kurdi, who said: [...] "If a person shuts a door in someone's face, this is very difficult. When a door is opened they no longer feel humiliated. At this time of year I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you all to think about the pain of fathers, mothers and children who are seeking peace and security. We ask just for a little bit of sympathy from you. Hopefully next year the war will end in Syria and peace will reign all over the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Raeder's last speech {{occurred}} as Commander-in-Chief occurred on 30 January 1943 before the Reichstag, where {{he asserted that}} he had brought the Navy [...] "smoothly and completely" [...] into {{the service of the}} Führer in 1933. Raeder argued that: [...] "This was possible only because, despite all outside efforts to influence it, the training of the Navy [...] derived from an inner attitude that was itself truly National Socialist. For this reason, we did not have to change, but could become followers of the Führer with open hearts. I find it particularly satisfying that the Führer has always attributed this to me, and I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> all of you {{to see to it that}} the Navy remains a strong and reliable support of the Führer in this regard". Though Hitler had cordial relations with Raeder, the two had never been close, and there was nothing like the mutual admiration that Hitler and Dönitz shared.|$|E
6000|$|SHE. Well, that answers your question. You {{know the}} other man's name. Am I {{sufficiently}} humbled, or <b>would</b> you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me {{if there is any}} one else? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{the officer}} of the deck tells me," [...] {{answered}} the captain, dryly. He looked at {{the commander of the}} squadron. [...] "Commodore Schley, <b>would</b> you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Russell any questions?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you <b>would</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Verena <b>to</b> spend a {{month with}} me--it {{might be a}} way of {{attracting}} you to the house," [...] Adeline went on, in the tone of exuberant provocation.|$|R
2500|$|Government {{efforts to}} lower {{subsidies}} to unprofitable enterprises and {{to shrink the}} money supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the Cuban peso to move {{from a peak of}} 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president Fidel Castro later admitted that many mistakes had been made, [...] "The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> why we hadn’t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible. The Soviet Union had collapsed, oil was costing $40 a barrel, sugar prices were at basement levels, so why did we not rationalize the industry?" [...] Living conditions in 1999 remained well below the 1989 level.|$|E

60|$|Brooke <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> several questions, {{but between}} the clanging of the {{locomotive}} bell and {{the roar of}} steam conversation was difficult, and when they stopped a moment {{at the foot of}} the gangway Devine's voice only reached him in broken snatches.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned away}} without {{speaking}} further; and his mother's eyes followed him wistfully to the door.

50|$|When {{attempting}} {{to look for}} 'good' nonlinear differential equations it is this property of linear equations that one <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see: <b>asking</b> for no movable singularities is often too stringent, instead one often asks for the so-called Painlevé property: 'any movable singularity should be a pole', first used by Sofia Kovalevskaya.|$|R

60|$|But {{they had}} not a very joyous afternoon, and the evening was no gayer.

60|$|But Tournefort {{felt that}} this calmness was only on the surface; {{something}} strange had stirred {{the depths of his}} chief's keen, masterful mind.

So after a moment or two he turned back obediently to his task.|$|R
