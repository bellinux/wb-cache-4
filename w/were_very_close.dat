5|$|After {{arriving}} in Reykjavík, Fischer gave a press conference. He lived a reclusive life in Iceland, avoiding entrepreneurs {{and others who}} approached him with various proposals. Fischer moved into {{an apartment in the}} same building as his close friend and spokesman, Garðar Sverrisson. Garðar's wife, Kristín Þórarinsdóttir, was a nurse and later looked after Fischer as a terminally ill patient. Garðar's two children, especially his son, <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to Fischer. Fischer also developed a friendship with Magnús Skúlason, a psychiatrist and chess player who later recalled long discussions with him {{on a wide variety of}} subjects.|$|E
5|$|During {{the postwar}} era, Indiana became a {{critical}} swing state that often helped decide which party controlled the presidency. Elections <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>close,</b> {{and became the}} center of frenzied attention with many parades, speeches and rallies as election day approached; voter turnout ranging over 90% to near 100% in such elections as 1888 and 1896. In remote areas, both sides paid their supporters to vote, and occasionally paid supporters of the opposition not to vote. Despite allegations, historians have found very little fraud in national elections.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2006–07 season, Panthers general manager Mike Keenan traded Luongo to the Vancouver Canucks on June 23, 2006. He was {{packaged}} with defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth round draft pick (Sergei Shirokov) in exchange for forward Todd Bertuzzi, defenceman Bryan Allen and goaltender Alex Auld. Immediately following the deal, Vancouver signed Luongo to a four-year, $27 million deal. He expressed surprise, claiming that he and the Panthers <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to a deal the day before the trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{new line}} was planned as a through route {{and was not}} {{intended}} to have any stations of its own, but in 1904 it was decided to build two stations on it. A new station, also named Wotton, was built immediately to the south of the existing Wotton station. On 2 April 1906 the new route opened to passengers. The two Wotton stations <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> together, and the same stationmaster was responsible for both.|$|E

In the last few years of Wiggins' life, he enjoyed a closer relationship with his father, Albert, and he often took his children on visits to see their grandfather. Wiggins had a very difficult time with his father's death in May 1990.|$|E

5|$|Ambrose and Robert Dudley <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>close,</b> {{in matters}} of {{business}} and personally. Through their paternal grandmother they descended from the Hundred Years War heroes, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Robert Dudley was especially fascinated by the Beauchamp descent and, with his brother, adopted the ancient heraldic device of the earls of Warwick, the bear and ragged staff. Due to such genealogical aspects the West Midlands held a special significance for him. The town of Warwick felt this during a magnificent visit by the Earl in 1571 to celebrate {{the feast of the}} Order of Saint Michael, with which Leicester had been invested by the French king in 1566. He shortly afterwards founded Lord Leycester's Hospital, a charity for aged and injured soldiers still functioning today.|$|E
5|$|Of all the North Korean attacks {{along the}} Pusan Perimeter, the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge {{is seen by}} historians as the most serious threat. It was the battle in which the North Koreans made the most {{substantial}} gains, splitting the US 2nd Infantry Division in half and briefly capturing Yongsan, where they <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to breaching through to the US forces' supply lines and threatening other divisions' rear areas. However, once again the fatal weakness of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success—its communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack {{in the face of}} massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. By September 8, the North Korean attacks in the area had been repulsed.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2006 Canadian census, {{there were}} 10,994 {{people living in}} 4,650 {{households}} within the city (the official provincial estimate was 11,093 people). Of the federally surveyed households, 33% were one-person households, slightly above the 28% average provincewide; households consisting of couples with children, at 26%, <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to the provincial average; and households of couples without children, at 24%, were below the provincial average of 30%. Among its 3,000 census families, Dawson Creek had a smaller proportion of married couples than the province, 62% compared to 73%, but the same average number of persons per family, 2.9. With 92% of Dawson Creek residents being Canadian-born, and 93% speaking only English, the city has few visible minorities. Only 17% of residents aged 35–64 had a university certificate or diploma, compared to the provincewide rate of 29%. Among those aged 25–64, 20% {{did not have a}} high school certificate or equivalent, much higher than the 12% provincewide rate.|$|E

5|$|Hesketh was educated, {{along with}} his younger brother Charles, at Trinity College, Oxford. Although Charles was a studious young man, who planned to enter the church on graduation, Peter had an active social life in both Oxford and London. He holidayed in {{southern}} resorts including St Leonards-on-Sea, a new development in Sussex, where he admired the work of architect James Burton. He became close friends with Burton's son Decimus, who was also an architect. The two men {{were involved in the}} formation of London's Athenaeum Club and Burton designed the club's building in Pall Mall. Hesketh received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1823 and his Master of Arts degree in 1826. That same year, he married Eliza Debonnaire Metcalfe, the daughter of Sir Theophilus Metcalfe, 2nd Baronet, commonly known by her middle name. Debonnaire's father gave the couple a house in Dover, but they also spent time at the Rossall estate. The couple <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to Charles and his new wife Anna, and their sister Anna, and her husband Thomas Knowlys. Charles was ordained in 1828 and as patron of St Chad's Church in Poulton-le-Fylde, Peter presented his brother with that curacy.|$|E
