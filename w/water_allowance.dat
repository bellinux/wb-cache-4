40|$|South Africa's {{water law}} {{dispensation}} changed dramatically with the promulgation of the National Water Act 36 of 1998. The previous distinction {{between public and}} private water was abolished and the public trust doctrine was statutorily incorporated. Due to the working of the public trust doctrine existing water use rights which were in force before 1998, were replaced by <b>water</b> <b>allowances</b> granted in the discretion of the relevant authority. Three key issues are investigated in this work. First the history and development of water rights in South Africa are discussed. Secondly the system of <b>water</b> <b>allowances</b> is analysed to determine the socio-economic effects of these measures. Thirdly the question whether the state expropriated vested rights in property through the transition brought about by the incorporation of the public trust doctrine is discussed. The new concept of property and the distinction between deprivation and expropriation as dealt with in section 25 of the Constitution are examined. It is indicated that the concept of property in South African law has been extended to include pre-existing water use rights and it is argued that it also enfolds water allocations made in terms of the Act. Due to the application of the public trust doctrine it is doubtful whether any legitimate deprivation of a water use allocation can be defined as an expropriation. This issue is considered with reference to the requirements set for deprivation and expropriation in South African law...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the fairness in distribution {{of water in}} a tertiary canal within the Indus Basin Irrigation System. Two methodologies are proposed: canal rating equations, and outlet discharge equations. The methodology is applied to a tertiary canal located in the Punjab, Province of Pakistan. Fairness/equity is expressed quantitatively using the Gini index. There is {{a difference in the}} estimated discharge depending on the methodology employed, however as we move along the canal the <b>water</b> <b>allowance</b> does not vary significantly with the distance along the canal. Hence for this particular canal the head-middle-tail inequity often reported and generalized in the literature is not observed. The advantage of a quantitative measure of inequity such as the Gini is exemplified by comparing the Gini with that at the secondary canal and also against itself if the tertiary canal could be operated “as designed”. We introduce two new concepts: systematic and operational inequity. Provided the costs of data acquisition can be reduced this technology {{has the potential to be}} scaled up and included in future development investments in large scale irrigation systems.

40|$|NWFP {{is a rich}} {{province}} in water resources and therefore irrigation canals have <b>water</b> <b>allowances</b> higher than any other {{province in}} Pakistan.

40|$|Water {{availability}} in semiarid regions usually exhibits {{patterns of}} extreme variability. Even in intensively controlled basins, some users {{are subject to}} low levels of water reliability, and more vulnerable to periods of extreme scarcity. To reduce their risk exposure more flexible instruments, such as voluntary exchanges of water among users, are required. Recent changes in the Spanish water Law have given an initial impulse to allow for leases of water use rights. Properly designed and monitored, this instrument provides some flexibility to water management, and may increase the economic use efficiency as well as mitigate the adverse economic effects of droughts. This paper looks at the risks and uncertainty dimensions of water markets, which have not been paid much attention in the literature. It analyses, from theoretical and empirical standpoints, the role that uncertainty plays in market participants' decisions {{and its impact on}} gains from trade. Two models have been developed to carry out the empirical application. One is a stochastic and two-stage discreet programming model which simulates irrigators behaviour and the other is a spatial equilibrium model to compute market exchange and equilibrium. Water market price endogeneity is solved by an iterative process, which characterise price uncertainty from the results obtained from the spatial equilibrium model. Hydrological risk is characterised at the irrigation farm level through the variation of the <b>water</b> <b>allowances</b> served for irrigation. The application is performed on eleven irrigated farms in a district of the Guadalquivir Valley (Southern Spain. It is shown how water availability uncertainty reduces farmers' benefits {{because of the fact that}} they must take ex-ante decisions. However, if market participation is allowed once <b>water</b> <b>allowances</b> become known, even at an uncertain price, the benefit losses are partly mitigated. From a methodological standpoint, these results suggest that the agricultural water market benefits estimates found in the literature may be undervalued as a result of omitting the option to participate in the market in the mix of possible strategies. Exchanging water in annual spot markets allows for the reduction of farmers' economic vulnerability caused by the variability and uncertainty of water supply within an irrigation season. uncertainty, farm modelling, water markets, water supply, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the distributive impact of water tariff subsidies provided through non linear tariff structures in Casablanca, using the national households consumption survey ENCDM 2000 / 2001. We first analyze the distributive {{consequences of the}} water network expansion, as about one fifth of the households in Casablanca {{is expected to be}} connected under the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) programs. Then we conduct micro-simulation estimations using alternative water tariff structures in order to assess their distributional effects. Due to the selection pattern of the water connection itself, the water demand of unconnected households must be estimated as a preliminary step using a standard Heckman procedure. Water consumption has then been adjusted using standard elasticity assumptions for alternative water pricing. The analysis shows that every tariff structure simulated becomes progressive once the water network is expanded and that the reduction of the first block provides no improvement at constant subsidy level. The most progressive tariff structure are the ones providing a free <b>water</b> <b>allowance,</b> especially when it takes into account the household size. Finally, simulated targeted subsidies do not improve the distribution while the exclusion issue is a rising concern, with more than 50 % of the poorest households excluded from such consumption subsidies...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{challenge}} of providing a clean and secure water supply now and into the future, TASC recommends the introduction of an equality-proofed water charges regime based on metering to promote conservation at the household level and to provide increased funding for the sector. In a previous submission on water charging made by TASC (2012), we argued that charging for good quality water and recognising it as a basic human right are not mutually exclusive. Any such charging regime must be based on the ‘polluter pays ’ principle and the use of flat charges or proxies for water use (e. g. square footage), will not promote conservation and will likely be regressive. TASC’s analysis is that the use of a free <b>water</b> <b>allowance</b> or a similar mechanism would neither satisfy the ‘polluter pays ’ principle nor provide equality: such a universal free allowance would be a subsidy for all households regardless of means and circumstances. Access to good quality, clean and affordable water is a human right. Water and waste water services are also vital for farms and businesses throughout the state.

40|$|Water {{resources}} 			development {{and management}} acquired new dimensions in Pakistan. 			Recently, the Government of Pakistan has taken strategic initiatives 			and primarily focused on governance, decentralization and 			participation {{of the farmers}} by transforming the Provincial 			Irrigation Department (PID) to the Frontier Irrigation and Drainage 			Authority (FIDA). Management responsibilities are decentralized at 			canal command level to Area Water Boards (AWBs) {{and most of the}} 			existing functions at distributary level are performed by the 			farmer organizations (FOs). Recently six distributaries have been 			handed over to the farmer organizations under the irrigation 			management transfer (IMT) programme in Swat Canal Area Water Board (SCAWB). 			The study was conducted to analyse the operational performance using 			hydraulic simulation modeling. To assess the impact of IMT on the 			performance of the irrigation system a database oriented irrigation 			management information system (IMIS) technique has been developed 			and utilized. The Simulation of Irrigation Canal (SIC) hydrodynamic 			model was used to analyse the improved operational scenarios for the 			irrigation systems operation at distributary level, to provide the 			system managers and farmers organizations to update the managerial 			control and plan operational activities through improved 			understanding of the system. Results of the study revealed that 			irrigation supplies are in excess of the crop water requirements. 			The relative water supply (RWS) index varies from 1. 66 to 2. 02 			during summer, whereas in winter it varies from 2. 22 to 2. 55. The 			delivery performance ratio (DPR) during summer varies from 0. 78 to 			 0. 83 and in 			winter from 0. 63 to 0. 73. Irrigation supplies were reliable over the 			whole growing season. Due to modernization of the irrigation systems 			and enhanced <b>water</b> <b>allowance,</b> the annual cropping intensity and 			yield have increased significantly. There is a prominent increase in 			yield of maize (40 percent), sugarcane (55 percent) and wheat (43 			percent) while the cropping intensity has increased by 25 percent. 			The Irrigation service fee (ISF) collection analysis indicated that 			all the FOs performed well during the first year (2004 - 05) of IMT 			and recovered 60 percent of the assessed ISF; whereas during the 			 2005 - 06 and 2006 - 07, ISF collected was very low. From these results 			it is evident that chances of successful cost recovery do not seem 			to be high. 			Operational and regulation aspects of the main system also play a 			pivotal role in overall irrigation water management aspects. The SIC 			model was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} physical 			infrastructures of the Chowki Distributary. Open flume outlets along 			the distributary behave as hyper-proportional irrespective of their 			position. The head bifurcator outlets are behaving 			hyper-proportional, whereas middle ones as perfect proportional and 			tail end as sub-proportional. The trifurcator outlets are behaving 			as hyper-proportional. The major causes are construction 			inaccuracies in setting the crest level, which lead the outlets to 			draw more or less than the design discharge. 			To improve the manual operation of the Chowki Distributary 			irrigation system, different operational strategies were 			investigated and quantified. From the results of this study, it is 			suggested to operate the distributary head regulator manually based 			on fixed frequency operation. It is recommended that from May to 			July, the distributary should be operated at 90 - 80 percent of design 			discharge, 90 - 75 percent of design discharge from August to October 			and 75 - 85 percent of design discharge from December to April to 			adjust the over delivery due to high <b>water</b> <b>allowance.</b> Hydraulic 			committees at each of the distributary should be established to 			operate the distributary according to crop demand.

No significant differences were observed for body weights {{between the two groups}} at 60 weeks of age irrespective of the sex (P < 0. 05 in both cases). A comparison of laying rates observed during the entire laying period (May to October) indicated a significant difference between T 2 and T 1 (19 vs 13 %, respectively; P < 0. 05).

Our results confirm observations by farmers that the overall reproductive performances of guinea fowl in Burkina Faso is generally very low.

40|$|Like in many {{emerging}} {{and least}} developed countries, agriculture {{is vital for}} Pakistan’s national economy. It contributes 21 % to the annual gross domestic product (GDP), engages 44 % of total labour force and contributes 60 % to the national export. Pakistan has a total area of 80 Mha (million hectares) with 22 Mha arable land, out of which 17 Mha is under irrigation, mostly under canal irrigation. Due to the arid to semi-arid climate, the irrigation is predominantly necessary for successful crop husbandry in Pakistan. The development of modern irrigation in Indo-Pakistan started in 1859 {{with the construction of}} the Upper Bari Doab Canal on Ravi River and {{with the passage of time}} the irrigation system of Pakistan grew up to the world’s largest contiguous gravity flow irrigation system, known as the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS). In the IBIS almost all irrigation canals are directly fed from rivers, while river flows carry heavy sediment loads. Irrigation canals receiving such flows get massive amounts of sediments, which are then deposited in the irrigation canals depending upon the hydrodynamic conditions of the canals. Sediment deposition in irrigation canals causes serious operation and maintenance problems. Studies reveal that silt reduces up to 40 % of the available discharge in irrigation canals. Researchers have been striving since long to manage this problem in a sustainable way and a number of approaches have been introduced in this connection. As a first step sediments are controlled at river intakes by silt excluders and ejectors. Then a canal design approach is adopted for keeping sediments in suspension and to distribute them as much as possible on the irrigated fields. Even then sediments tend to deposit in irrigation canals and become a serious problem in canal operation and maintenance, which then requires frequent desilting campaigns to keep water in the canals running. It causes a continuous burden on the national economy. In emerging and least developed countries, adequate and timely availability of funds for operation and maintenance is generally a problem. It causes delays in canal maintenance, which affects their hydraulic performance. Water is then delivered inadequately and inequitably to the water users. The story becomes further complicated when it comes to downstream controlled demand based irrigation canals under flexible operation. In fixed supply based operation, canals always run at full supply discharge and such operation, generally, does not allow sediment deposition in the canal prism due to sufficient velocities. Whereas in demand based flexible operation the canals cannot run always at full supply discharge but instead the discharge is changing depending upon the crop water requirement in the canal command area. Such type of canal operation is not always favourable to sediment transport as under low discharges, flow velocities fall quite low and hence sediment deposition may occur in the canal prism. The questions arise here what sort of hydrodynamic relationships prevent sediment deposition in downstream controlled irrigation canals and how these relationships can be adopted, while catering crop water requirements of the command area? How the maintenance needs can be minimized by managing sediment transport through better canal operation? This study has been designed to investigate such type of relationships and practices in order to manage sediment transport in downstream controlled demand based irrigation canals and to attain maximum hydraulic efficiency with minimum maintenance needs. The hypothesis of the study states that in demand based irrigation canals the volume of silt deposition can be minimized and even the sediments which deposit during low crop water requirement periods can be re-entrained during peak water requirement periods. In this way a balance can be maintained in sediment deposition and re-entrainment by adequate canal operation. Two computer models have been used in this study, namely, Simulation of Irrigation Canals (SIC) and SEdiment TRansport in Irrigation Canals (SETRIC). Both models are one-dimensional and are capable of simulating steady and unsteady state flows (SETRIC only steady state flows) and non equilibrium sediment transport in irrigation canals. The SIC model has the capability to simulate sediment transport under unsteady flow conditions and can assess the effect of sediment deposition on hydraulic performance of irrigation canals. Whereas the SETRIC model has the advantage of taking into account the development of bed forms and their effect on resistance to flow, which is the critical factor in irrigation canal design and management. In the SETRIC model, a new module regarding sediment transport simulations in downstream controlled irrigation canals has been incorporated. The study has been conducted on the Upper Swat Canal – Pehure High Level Canal (USC-PHLC) Irrigation System, which consists of three canals, Machai Branch Canal, PHLC and Maira Branch Canal. The Machai Branch Canal has upstream controlled supply based operation and the two other canals have downstream controlled demand based operation respectively. These canals are interconnected. The PHLC and Machai Branch canals feed Maira Branch Canal as well having their own irrigation systems. PHLC receives water from Tarbela Reservoir and Machai Branch Canal from the Swat River through USC. Water from Tarbela Reservoir, at present, is sediment free, whereas the water from Swat River is sediment laden. However, various studies have indicated that soon Tarbela Reservoir will be filled with sediments and will behave as run of the river system. Then PHLC will also receive sediment laden flows. The design discharges of Machai, PHLC and Maira Branch canals are 65, 28 and 27 m 3 /s respectively. The command area of the USC-PHLC Irrigation System is 115, 800 ha. The USC-PHLC Irrigation System has been remodelled recently and <b>water</b> <b>allowance</b> has been increased from 0. 34 l/s/h to 0. 67 l/s/h. The upper USC system, from Machai Branch head to RD 242 (a control structure from where the downstream control system starts), was remodelled in 1995, whereas the system downstream of RD 242 was remodelled in 2003. The upper part of Machai Branch Canal up to an abscissa of about 74, 000 m is under fixed supply based operation, whereas the lower part of Machai Branch Canal, Maira Branch Canal and the PHLC are under semi-demand based flexible operation. The semi-demand based system is operated according to crop water requirements and follows a Crop Based Irrigation Operations (CBIO) schedule. When the crop water demand falls below 80 % of the full supply discharge, a rotation system is introduced among the secondary offtakes. During very low crop water requirement periods the supplies are not reduced beyond a minimum limit of 50 % of the full supply discharge because of the canal operation rule. The study consisted of fieldwork of two years in which daily canal operation data, monthly sediment inflow data in low sediment periods and weekly sediment data in peak concentration periods were collected. Three mass balance studies were conducted in which all the water and sediment inflows and outflows were measured with suspended sediment sampling at selected locations along the canal and boil sampling at the offtaking canals, immediately downstream of the head regulators. Further in the four months during the peak sediment season June, July, August and September, mass balance studies were conducted by boil sediment sampling in order to estimate water and sediment inflow to and outflow from the system. To determine the effect of sediment transport on the canals’ morphology, five cross-sectional surveys were conducted and changes in bed levels were measured. On the basis of these field data the two computer models, used in this study, were calibrated and validated for flow and sediment transport simulations. The downstream control component of the system is controlled automatically and the PHLC has been equipped with the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system at the headworks. Any discharge withdrawal or refusal by Water Users Associations (WUA) through offtaking secondary canals, or any discharge variation in the inflow from Machai Branch Canal is automatically adjusted by the SCADA system at Gandaf Outlet, the PHLC headworks. The SCADA system has Proportional Integral (PI) discharge controllers. The study found that the existing PI coefficients led to delay in discharge releases and resulted in a long time to achieve flow stability. The discharge releases showed an oscillatory behaviour which affected the functioning of hydro-mechanically operated downstream control “Aval Orifice” (AVIO) and “Aval Surface” (AVIS) gates. After calibration and validation of the model the PI controllers were fine-tuned and proposed for improved canal operation, which would help in system sustainability and in improved operational efficiency of the canals. Field data show that during the study period sedimentation in the studied irrigation canals remained within control limits. The incoming sediment loads were, generally, lower than the sediment transport capacities of the studied irrigation canals. Hence this incoming sediment load was transported by the main canals and distributed to the offtaking canals. The sediment transport capacities of the studied irrigation canals were computed at steady and unsteady state conditions. The canal operation data showed that the system was operated on Supply Based Operation (SBO) approach rather than CBIO. The morphological data revealed that there was no significant deposition in the studied canals. Therefore there was no particular effect on the canal operation and the hydraulic efficiencies, attributed to sediment transport. As mentioned earlier, the Tarbela Reservoir will soon be filled with sediments and consequently PHLC will get sediment laden flows from the reservoir. Various studies have been taken into account to project the time when sediment laden flows will flow into the PHLC and what will be the characteristics and concentrations of the incoming sediments to the PHLC from the reservoir. The studies project that the sediment inflow from the Tarbela Reservoir will be much higher than the sediment transport capacities of the PHLC and Maira Branch Canal under full supply discharge conditions. This scenario will create sediment transport problems in downstream controlled canals, particularly when they will be operated under CBIO. Various management options have been simulated and are presented in order to better manage sediments in the studied canals under the scenario of sediment inflow from Tarbela Reservoir. The hydraulic performance of downstream controlled canals will be affected under this scenario and frequent maintenance and repair will be required to maintain the canals. Various options have been analysed to deal with the problem. The study presents a sediment management plan for downstream controlled irrigation canals by improvements in canal design and operation in combination with the need of settling ponds at the canal headworks. Currently sedimentation in the irrigation canals under study is not a big issue for canal operation and maintenance (O&M). However, it would emerge as a major problem when sediment discharge from the Tarbela Reservoir starts. The canals’ maintenance costs will soar and the hydrodynamic performance of these canals will also be affected. In this study, a number of ways have been evaluated and proposed to deal with the approaching problem of sediment transport in these irrigation canals in order to keep their hydraulic performance at desired levels and to minimize the maintenance costs. The first and the foremost effect of sediment deposition will be reduction in canals’ flow conveyance capacities, which will result in raise of water levels. The raise of water levels will cause a reduction in water supply to the canals due to automatic flow releases. It can be dealt with by a temporary and limited raise in target water levels depending upon the maximum headloss at the downstream AVIS/AVIO cross regulator. Further, to minimize the effect of water level raise on discharge through the AVIS/AVIO gates, the decrement in such canals can be kept relatively small, in order to make the gates less sensitive to water level changes. Further, for efficient withdrawal of sediment to the secondary canals, it is needed to locate the secondary offtakes close to AVIS/AVIO cross regulators on the downstream side. More sediment will be discharged because the turbulent mixing of sediment at the downstream side of the control structures keeps more sediment in suspension. In addition, during the peak sediment concentration periods, the canals need to be operated at supply based operations, in order to minimize the deposition. Sediment transport in general and in irrigation canals in particular, is one of the most studied and discussed topic in the field of fluid mechanics all over the world. It also has been studied extensively in Indus Basin in order to design and manage irrigation canals receiving sediment laden flows. The outcome of Lacey’s regime theory and the subsequent work are the result of these studies. In addition to regime method various other methods like permissible velocity method, tractive force method and the rational methods, etc., have been developed for stable canal design. Anyhow, as a matter of fact, the management of sediment transport in irrigation canals is still a challenging task even after all these investigations and studies. Because most of the knowledge on sediment transport is empirical in nature, most sediment transport formulae have inbuilt randomness, which makes predictions difficult, when conditions are changed. It needs a lot of care while applying a sediment transport formula, developed under one set of conditions, to other situations. Therefore, it becomes extremely important to understand the origin of the development of the formulae and the limitations associated with them before applying some sediment transport formulae to different conditions and circumstances. The introduction of numerical modelling made it comparatively easy to test and shape the sediment transport relationships to some local conditions by running a variety of simulations and calibrating the formula in light of the field measurements. The sediment transport predictions can be made reliable in this way and can be used for further analysis...|$|E

40|$|Summer in the Persian Gulf region {{presents}} physiological {{challenges for}} Australian sheep {{that are part}} of the live export supply chain coming from the Australian winter. Many feedlots throughout the Gulf have very high numbers of animals during June to August in order to cater for the increased demand for religious festivals. From an animal welfare perspective it is important to understand the necessary requirements of feed and <b>water</b> trough <b>allowances,</b> and the amount of pen space required, to cope with exposure to these types of climatic conditions. This study addresses parameters that are pertinent to the wellbeing of animals arriving in the Persian Gulf all year round. Three experiments were conducted in a feedlot in the Persian Gulf between March 2010 and February 2012, totalling 44 replicate pens each with 60 or 100 sheep. The applied treatments covered animal densities, feed-bunk lengths and water trough lengths. Weights, carcass attributes and health status were the key recorded variables. Weight change results showed superior performance for animal densities of ≥ 1. 2 m 2 /head during hot conditions (24 -h average temperatures greater than 33 °C, or a diurnal range of around 29 – 37 °C). However the space allowance for animals can be decreased, with no demonstrated detrimental effect, to 0. 6 m 2 /head under milder conditions. A feed-bunk length of ≥ 5 cm/head is needed, as 2 cm/head showed significantly poorer animal performance. When feeding at 90 % ad libitum 10 cm/head was optimal, however under a maintenance feeding regime (1 kg/head/day) 5 cm/head was adequate. A minimum <b>water</b> trough <b>allowance</b> of 1 cm/head is required. However, this experiment was conducted during milder conditions, and it may well be expected that larger water trough lengths would be needed in hotter conditions. Carcass weights were determined mainly by weights at feedlot entry and subsequent weight gains, while dressing percentage was not significantly affected by any of the applied treatments. There was no demonstrated effect of any of the treatments on the number of animals that died, or were classified as unwell. However, across all the treatments, these animals lost significantly more weight than the healthy animals, so the above recommendations, which are aimed at maintaining weight, should also be applicable for good animal health and welfare. Therefore, best practice guidelines for managing Australian sheep in Persian Gulf feedlots in the hottest months (June–August) which present the greatest environmental and physical challenge is to allow feed-bunk length 5 cm/head on a maintenance-feeding program and 10 cm/head for 90 % ad libitum feeding, and the space allowance per animal should be ≥ 1. 2 m 2 /head. Water trough allocation should be at least 1 cm/head with provision for more in the summer when water intake potentially doubles...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. South Africa's {{water law}} {{dispensation}} {{has changed dramatically}} with the promulgation of the National Water Act 36 of 1998. The previous distinction {{between public and private}} water has been abolished and the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry has been appointed to act as trustee of the nation's water resources. Through the working of section 4 (4), exclusive rights of water use, which were in force before 1998, were replaced by <b>water</b> <b>allowances,</b> granted in the discretion of the relevant authority. The key issue, which is investigated in this article, is whether the state, through the provisions of the National Water Act, expropriated vested rights in property or whether such infringement merely constituted a deprivation. The new concept of property in terms of section 25 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa and the distinction between deprivation and expropriation are examined. It is indicated that the concept of property in South African law has been extended to include not only ownership but also rights in property. Although no definition of property has been formulated in the Constitution, it appears from applicable authority, that this development in the law of property is supported by the Constitution and that the protection granted by the property clause will stretch as far as the inclusion of rights in property. It {{is for this reason that}} the existing water use rights, which were available to certain individuals in terms of the 1956 Water Act, can be classified as property. Section 25 (1) authorises the infringement of private property in certain defined instances. Despite the many academic works which define the difference between deprivation and expropriation as described in section 25 (2), the Constitutional Court clarified this matter in First National Bank of SA Ltd Va Wesbank v Commissioner for the South African Revenue Services 2002 7 BCLR 702 (CC). Expropriation is described as a sub-category of deprivation. Section 25 (1) must thus be used as the starting point in all cases in which an investigation is conducted into the constitutional validity of an infringement of property. Only when it has been established that the requirements of section 25 (1) have been complied with, is the question of whether deprivation constitutes expropriation, asked. The requirements for deprivation, expropriation and inverse condemnation are discussed with reference to applicable case law. After the aim of the National Water Act was weighed up against the disadvantages which individuals suffer through the infringement of their vested rights, the conclusion was reached that the nation's need for sustainable water resources carries more weight than the individual's exclusive right of use of water. A constitutionally valid deprivation has thus occurred. Due to the fact that the state did not appropriate any rights in this process, the conclusion was reached that this provision does not amount to an expropriation. It does however appear that the provisions of the National Water Act can give rise to inverse condemnation or constructive expropriation in specific circumstances. Master...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{valuation}} of irrigation water is done {{through the use}} of production functions for the case of the olive grove. In order to do so the integration of an agronomic model (based on the production function) and an economic model linked to the profitability of the crop (the ratio of revenue and operating costs) in the area under study is proposed. The study case encompasses the Guadalbullon River Sub-basin area, belonging to the Guadalquivir River Hydrologic Demarcation (Southern Spain). Within the overall deficit of the Guadalquivir River basin, the Guadalbullon River poses a special problem as it is unregulated and there are important irrigated fields on its banks, most of them olive groves. Net marginal value of water obtained (having deducted the variable costs of production including harvesting and irrigation) is € 0. 60 m- 3 for the allocation of 1, 000 m 3 ha- 1 and € 0. 53 m- 3 for the <b>water</b> right <b>allowance</b> of 1, 500 m 3 ha 3 (average for period 2005 / 2008).
