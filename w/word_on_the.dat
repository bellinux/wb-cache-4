5|$|At 09:35, a Catalina {{made the}} first {{sighting}} of the Ryūjō force. Later that morning, several more sightings of Ryūjō and ships of Kondo's and Mikawa's forces by carrier and other U.S. reconnaissance aircraft followed. Throughout the morning and early afternoon, U.S. aircraft also sighted several Japanese scout aircraft and submarines, leading Fletcher {{to believe that the}} Japanese knew where his carriers were, which actually was not yet the case. Still, Fletcher hesitated to order a strike against the Ryūjō group until he was sure there were no other Japanese carriers in the area. Finally, with no firm <b>word</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> presence or location of other Japanese carriers, at 13:40 Fletcher launched a strike of 38 aircraft from Saratoga to attack Ryūjō. However, he kept aircraft in reserve from both U.S. carriers potentially ready should any Japanese fleet carriers be sighted.|$|E
5|$|Groves did {{not intend}} the Smyth Report {{to be the last}} <b>word</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> project. It formed an {{addendum}} to the Manhattan District History, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified. Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for some technical details on the construction of the bombs.|$|E

5|$|The Origin of Birds is {{an early}} {{synopsis}} of bird evolution written in 1926 by Gerhard Heilmann, a Danish artist and amateur zoologist. The book was born {{from a series of}} articles published between 1913 and 1916 in Danish, and although republished as a book it received mainly criticism from established scientists and got little attention within Denmark. The English edition of 1926, however, became highly influential at the time due to the breadth of evidence synthesized as well as the artwork used to support its arguments. It was considered the last <b>word</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject of bird evolution for several decades after its publication.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Sacrifice was a Three Way {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and challengers Kurt Angle and Scott Steiner. At TNA's {{previous}} PPV event Lockdown on April13, Joe defeated Angle in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Prior to Lockdown on the April3 episode of Impact!, Steiner {{announced that he would}} use his Feast or Fired TNA World Heavyweight Title shot at Sacrifice. Staying true to his <b>word,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> April17 episode of Impact!, Steiner challenged Joe to a title defense at Sacrifice. Angle and Joe fought in a rematch for the title on the April24 episode of Impact!; Joe won after Steiner interfered. In response to Steiner's interference, Management Director Jim Cornette scheduled a Three Way match between Angle, Joe, and Steiner for the title at Sacrifice.|$|E

The ROK 1st Division, which would be following Task Force Growdon, was to relieve the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team upon reaching Munsan-ni, and the airborne unit then was to prepare to move south and revert to Eighth United States Army reserve.|$|E
25|$|For speech perception, {{the model}} starts with an {{external}} acoustic signal (e.g. produced by an external speaker). This signal is preprocessed, passes the auditory map, {{and leads to}} an activation pattern for each syllable or <b>word</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> level of the auditory-phonetic processing module (ES: external signal, see Fig. 5). The ventral path of speech perception (see Hickok and Poeppel 2007) would directly activate a lexical item, but is not implemented in ACT. Rather, in ACT the activation of a phonemic state occurs via the phonemic map and thus {{may lead to a}} coactivation of motor representations for that speech item (i.e. dorsal pathway of speech perception; ibid.).|$|E
25|$|Words {{were not}} scored by length. Instead, the {{position}} of the word's first letter was added to the number of the line it was on to determine a team's score. For instance, a word that started in the first position of the first line (line one, position one) would be worth two points, whereas a <b>word</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same line but with the first letter in the eighth position (line one, position eight) would be worth nine points. Halfway through the round, a bell would ring and the teammates would switch seats. This occurred after six questions had been asked; after another six were asked, the bell rang again and the team that was in the lead when it rang the second time won the Elimination Round.|$|E

25|$|Though the feud raised many {{concerns}} {{as to its}} effect on the league, and the Russian national team at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, it apparently dissipated as mysteriously as it started. On 24 January 2009, at the SuperSkills Competition, Malkin assisted Ovechkin in his stunt during the Breakaway Challenge. Malkin handed Ovechkin his props for the stunt as well as handing him his stick and pouring some sports drink down Ovechkin's throat. Though there is no final <b>word</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nature and status of the feud, considering their past interactions, this incident appears to show that the feud has effectively ended. It has been reported that Ilya Kovalchuk, who was then the Atlanta Thrashers' captain and is also teammate of Ovechkin and Malkin on the Russian national team, brokered the peace between the two.|$|E
25|$|The Tory was {{the first}} of three New Zealand Company {{surveyor}} ships sent off in haste to prepare for settlers in New Zealand. In August the Cuba, with a surveyors' team headed by Captain William Mein Smith, R.A., set sail, and a month later—still with no <b>word</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> success of the Tory and Cuba—on 15 September 1839 it was followed from Gravesend, London, by the Oriental, the first of five 500-ton immigrant ships hired by the company. Following the Oriental were the Aurora, Adelaide, Duke of Roxburgh and Bengal Merchant, plus a freight vessel, the Glenbervie, which all sailed with instructions to rendezvous on 10 January 1840 at Port Hardy on D'Urville Island where they would be told of their final destination. It was expected that by that time William Wakefield would have bought land for the first settlement and had it surveyed, and also inspected the company's land claims at Kaipara and Hokianga.|$|E
25|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Castro had decided to retaliate for the attempts on his life, and that perhaps he was behind the assassination of JFK. According to the Church Committee: Book V, Drew Pearson, {{a writer for the}} Washington Post, met with Chief Justice Earl Warren in January 1967. The columnist passed along information to Warren that a client of one of his Washington lawyer friends had told his friend that Castro had plans to retaliate. Pearson asked Warren to meet with the lawyer, but Warren never did. However, Warren did inform the director of the Secret Service, James Rowley. Rowley passed the information on to Hoover, who in turn sent six secret letters to senior Bureau officials. There are no records of these conversations, and officials have adamantly denied that conversations about Castro's revenge plans ever took place. The FBI's final <b>word</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> matter was that they had not found evidence suggesting that Lee Harvey Oswald had links to the Cuban government. They never informed the new administration of these talks.|$|E

25|$|As {{the public}} awaited <b>word</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fate of Zhou Yongkang amid intense rumours {{circulating}} {{inside the country}} and in international media, on June 30, an explosive announcement came from Beijing that General Xu Caihou, former member of the Politburo and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission from 2004 to 2013, was being expelled from the party for taking bribes in exchange for promotions, and facing criminal prosecution. The CMC Vice-Chairman position is the highest position held by a military officer in China, as the Chairmanship (commander-in-chief) is customarily occupied by a civilian. Xu was the highest ranked PLA military officer ever to be implicated in corruption and the first Politburo member investigated for corruption since the sensational sacking of former Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai. Unlike the steady build-up of speculation surrounding the Zhou case, the announcement of Xu's expulsion from the party came without any apparent warning. Reports later surfaced that the 71-year-old general, who was going through medical treatment for bladder cancer at 301 Military Hospital in Beijing, was taken from his sick bed in March 2014 to be investigated.|$|E
