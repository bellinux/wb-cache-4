She claimed that she had no role in the killing other than helping her brother, under duress, load the body into his car. She told investigators, [...] "I did not want him to die. I just wanted my brother to intimidate him so that he would continue to pay me my allowance.

500|$|Madonna was {{released}} in hardback in the United States in November 2001. It debuted at position 15 on The New York Times Best Seller list, and reached eight the next week, but was present there for only two weeks. Madonna was still livid that Morton wrote the book without her permission, even saying [...] "It's not a well-written book. We all know he wrote it for financial gain and the truth {{had little to do}} with it", after the book {{was released}}. With Jo Whiley from BBC Radio 1, she added that [...] " [...] really went through my Rolodex and that part was really annoying, and I ended up writing him a letter saying, 'I'm not interested in you writing this book, I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> to do with it – and please leave my friends alone'." [...] The singer said that she had even sent Morton a book of philosophy—The Power of Kabbalah—to try to dissuade him from continuing. [...] "It's a beginner's crash course in what it's all about – that eventually in some way shape or form it would come back round to him, but he either didn't read it or didn't care," [...] Madonna added.|$|E

2500|$|ACT UP had {{an early}} {{debate about whether}} to {{register}} the organization as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit {{in order to allow}} contributors tax exemptions. Eventually they decided against it, because as Maria Maggenti said, [...] "they didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> to do with the government." [...] This kind of uncompromising ethos characterized the group in its early stages; eventually it led to a split between those in the group who wanted to remain wholly independent and those who saw opportunities for compromise and progress by [...] "going inside [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2013 interview, Manson {{stated that}} he had [...] "resurrected" [...] the project, and that Roger Avary would direct it. In a {{separate}} interview during the previous year, he said a small crew similar to what he used for his Slo-Mo-Tion" [...] music video would be used, and would rather film the movie on an iPhone than not film it at all. In a reddit AMA with Billy Corgan on April 4, 2015, Marilyn Manson commented that he had withdrawn from the project because the writing process for the film was [...] "so... damaging to my psyche, I've decided I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> to do with it."

2500|$|In 2002, she {{appeared}} {{at a dinner}} in London to accept the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal. She gave an interview to The Guardian in which she lamented the lack of technique in young opera singers and the dearth of good teachers. By this time {{she was no longer}} giving master classes herself; when asked by Italian journalists in May 2007 why this was, she replied: [...] "Because I'm 80 years old and I really don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> to do with opera any more, although I do sit on the juries of singing competitions." [...] The Cardiff Singer of the World competition was the one that Sutherland was most closely associated with after her retirement.

5000|$|Initially {{none of the}} {{publishers}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the poem. Finally published in September 1915 by Osip Brik (who also financed the publication) it came out severely cut. [...] "The Cloud turned to be a cirrus one, censors blew it through. Some six pages amounted to mere dots," [...] Mayakovsky wrote in I, Myself autobiography. As with the Vladimir Mayakovsky, most targeted were the religion-related images.|$|R
5000|$|The Death of the Gods (according to critic D.M.Magomedova) was [...] "the {{first in}} {{a long series of}} Merezhkovsky's books rejected, {{violated}} by censors or confiscated by the police."

In 1895 Severny Vestnik published it, but not in its original form and under another title, editor Akim Volynsky having subjected the text to severe editing.|$|R
2500|$|In the December 6 joint NPR interview, Seigenthaler {{said that}} he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> to do with Wikipedia because he disapproved of its basic assumptions. In an article Seigenthaler wrote for USA Today in late 2005, he said, [...] "I am {{interested}} in letting many people know that Wikipedia is a flawed and irresponsible research tool." [...] He also pointed out that the false information had been online for over four months before he was aware of it, and that he {{had not been able to}} edit the article to correct it. After speaking with Wikipedia co-founder, Jimmy Wales, Seigenthaler said: [...] "My 'biography' was posted May 26. On May 29, one of Wales' volunteers 'edited' it only by correcting the misspelling of the word 'early.' For four months, Wikipedia depicted me as a suspected assassin before I erased it from the website's history Oct. 5. The falsehoods remained on Answers.com and Reference.com for three more weeks." [...] Editing Wikipedia, he suggested, would lend it his sanction or approval, and he stated his belief that editing the article was not enough and instead he wanted to expose [...] "incurable flaws" [...] in the Wikipedia process and ethos.|$|E
2500|$|Mary {{gets ready}} for a party {{organized}} by Kike and it appears she has nothing to wear, so she decided to sew the cloth Alexis gave her to work on. Unfortunately, she meets {{the owner of the}} dress at the party; in her anxiety to escape, she falls into the swimming pool. She eventually promises the client to make another dress for the client under her own clothing line. Akin and Mary start to call each other often. During a call, Mary tells Akin about Gina calling her and accusing her of snatching her boyfriend. Akin replies by saying [...] "Would you like to be?" [...] and they both get very close from that moment. On {{the second day of the}} retreat, Mary got to know the new Chairman is Kike. She tells Mary she acquired the shares to get Akin's attention. She used to drink a lot and that ruined her home, that's the main reason Akin doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> to do with her again. Mary tells her that the moment Akin finds out that she's now the Chairman, he will resign, she advises her to call him instead and talk to him. Akin's mother listened to the advice and calls Akin. Akin thought it was Mary and tells her not to give the information to the Chairman anymore - He heard his mother's voice and tries to hang up, but his mother starts to apologize for everything she did and he calms down as his mother starts to eulogise him. Mary calls Alexis to tell her the dress got ruined and she informs her that she is resigning.|$|E

25|$|On 27 August 1803, Durutte {{received}} {{promotion to}} general of division {{in spite of}} Napoleon Bonaparte's dislike of officers from Moreau's army. He {{became a member of}} the Légion d'Honneur on 11 December 1803 and a commander of the Légion on 9 June 1804. His former relationship with Moreau, who was exiled from France, then caused trouble. When asked to put his signature on a document agreeing with Napoleon's appointment as emperor of France, Durutte remained true to his republican beliefs and refused to sign. When his officers also offered to join him in defiance, he dissuaded them so their careers would not be ruined. After this incident, apparently no one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with him except Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout, who gave him command of the island of Elba.

40|$|Manufacturing is {{the heart}} of a {{manufacturing}} company. A troubled manufacturing company invariably requires significant improvements in the management of this activity.

50|$|In 1268, {{the vast}} {{holdings}} {{owned by the}} Lords of Bolanden between the Donnersberg and the Rhine were shared out among offspring, among whom an open feud later broke out, which claimed some participants’ lives. At the battlefield near Ottenheim, as Gau-Odernheim was then known, at the boundary of the divided land, a so-called stone Sühnekreuz (“atonement cross”) was put up. In the Middle Ages, though, nobody <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with an atonement cross; such a place was shunned and was eerie. Thus, the Ottenkreuz was eventually forgotten. Under the earth, bushes and thorny hedges it lay until those seeking it unearthed it at last. Until 2008, it could {{be seen on the}} right side of the road from Gau-Odernheim to Hillesheim; however, after a number of attempts <b>had</b> been made <b>to</b> steal the Ottenkreuz, it was secured, and beginning in 2010, those wishing to see it will be able to do so at the Gau-Odernheim town hall.|$|R
