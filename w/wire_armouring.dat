When cable has only one core, aluminium <b>wire</b> <b>armour</b> (AWA) is used instead of steel wire. This is because the aluminium is non-magnetic. A magnetic field is produced by the current in a single core cable. This would induce an electric current in the steel wire, which could cause overheating.|$|R

Recent research involving the determination of the fracture strength of cracked wires employed laboratory testing and classical fracture mechanics approach using non-standardised fracture mechanics specimens because standard test specimens could not be manufactured from the wires owing to their sizes. In this work, the effect of miniature cracks on the fracture properties of tensile <b>armour</b> <b>wires</b> was investigated using laboratory and finite element tensile testing simulations with the phenomenological shear fracture model.

40|$|Continual {{advances}} {{are being}} made in the control and monitoring of subsea oil wells by the application of new technology for sensors, subsea processing and communications devices. With these advances, the demands on the subsea umbilical are constantly increasing with deployment lengths and depths growing and the quantity of controlled functions now greater than ever. The need for {{a good understanding of}} the effects of deployment subsea is essential, as communications frequencies and data throughput constantly increase. This research aims to address some of the issues regarding umbilical modelling and sets up a series of tests to measure the effects of pressure and cable flooding within the umbilical and assesses the effect of steel tubes, hydraulic hoses and cable armouring on the operating parameters of the cables. In addition, the cables are modelled using electromagnetic field solver tools and the results compared with those measured. Once prediction losses have been established, these are compared with measurements taken on the full lengths of umbilical and the reasons for any discrepancies examined. It is shown that, in a typical subsea umbilical, the proximity of conducting cores to adjacent components, such as hydraulic hoses or steel <b>wire</b> <b>armour,</b> the flooding with sea water and the pressure due to the depth of deployment all {{have a significant impact on}} the impedance parameters of the cables. The effect of cable screening on attenuation is also examined and it is shown that, as well as affecting capacitance and conductance, the screen has a significant impact on the cable resistance and inductance, with the resistance rising to a maximum at a certain screen thickness before a subsequent reduction. This effect was investigated further by modelling with an electromagnetic field solver and a possible explanation for this effect is proposed. Comparison of the modelled data and measurement of cables under the various operating conditions investigated show good correlation with the results, allowing very accurate prediction of the effects on electrical performance of cables when deployed subsea in Subsea Control System umbilicals...|$|R

50|$|A {{series of}} dimension-hopping adventures by Amy and Tekno {{resulted}} in Mobius being briefly invaded by Earth military forces, after which Sonic pursued Grimer and Nack the Weasel {{in their quest}} to recover Robotnik. Trapped on the sub-atomic world of Shanazar, Sonic found it hard to adapt to the local culture, and when Amys adventures led her to join him on the planet, the two explored the worlds numerous vastly different zones, combating myriad threats. Robotnik had his own plans, however, using the dimensional technology that brought Sonic, Grimer and Nack to Shanazar to enlarge the world, fusing it with Mobius in a Crisis on Infinite Earths-style event. Shanazars zones could now be accessed from portals on Mobius, and various doorways had also opened to various points in Earths history. Infuriated with yet another failure, however, Robotnik decided to bring his long war with Sonic to an end by destroying Mobius once and for all. Entering into a partnership with the living plastic alien hive-mind, The Plax, Robotnik used their technology to absorb elemental energy from both Mobius and Earth, forcing both worlds into total ecological collapse. His scheme was again foiled, however, by Shortfuse, who <b>wired</b> his <b>armour</b> into Robotniks machine, undoing the damage and draining the energy from the villain, with the added bonus of the feedback finally liberating him from his armour.|$|R

40|$|First, {{the focus}} of a {{literature}} review was on industry visions and fatigue life assessments. Hence fatigue analysis methodology —with a special focus on local modelling— was thoroughly investigated because this is the Shell and industry accepted method to define and assess fatigue life. Secondly, a new strategy was developed to stretch the fatigue life after identifying a significant in-field changed condition. This guideline incorporates in-house analysis activities to enhance the collaboration with specialist consultants. Changed environmental and operational conditions should be incorporated in the fatigue analysis within the limits of fixed geometry parameters.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{intended}} as a tutorial on electromagnetic modeling to measure and estimate the complex valued relative permeability of magnetic steel.

This is achieved by using a simple transformer coil built on the magnetic steel to be tested and by efficient numerical modeling based on waveguide theory and complex analysis.

40|$|Applications of {{flexible}} pipe {{have been growing}} because of its characteristic features (i. e. low bending stiffness and high axial strength) which are because of various composite and steel layers {{have been used in}} the structure of this pipe. These characteristics make flexible pipeline capable to transfer oil and gas from wellhead to the fixed and floating platforms, or to inject water into the wells. There are a number of technical and economic advantages for the use {{of flexible}} pipe with respect to conventional rigid line pipe. Rapid installation, typically 5 to 10 km per day, and special polymer material (i. e. elimination of needs for cathodic protection) suggest it may be used as a suitable option for installation in harsh environment fields. Furthermore, the pipe exhibits advantageous mechanical performance characteristics with respect to strength, collapse resistance, thermal expansion and vibration response, and fatigue and abrasion resistance. Flexible pipe comprises of carcass and pressure armours which are interlocked layer wrapped with angle close to 90 degree and stand toward radial pressures; extruded polymer layers which prevents leakage of fluids to the other layers; high strength tape which are considered to prevent radial expansion of tensile armours; tensile armours which are rectangular cross section helical wires with pitch angle close to 35 degrees made by high strength steel to stand for axial and bending and torsional loads. For deepwater flexible pipe systems, in response to local damage and loss of constraint, the tensile <b>armour</b> <b>wires</b> may exhibit two forms of local instability that includes radial buckling (i. e., birdcaging) and lateral buckling. These two failure modes may occur during installation or operational conditions due to pure axial compression and bending curvature. Due to the complex mechanics for integrating the mechanical response of each layer and the corresponding interactions between adjacent layers, there are few analytical and numerical modelling studies addressing the mechanical performance of composite flexible pipe. These investigations are constrained by the underlying idealizations and assumptions used, and the available hardware and software technology. As the technology development and fabrication of flexible pipe is company-specific proprietary, intellectual property, there are few experimental studies available in the public domain. To improve knowledge, and potentially advance current engineering design and practice, it is important to develop a thorough understanding of the pipe mechanical response, strength performance limits and deformation mechanisms. The main goals and major contributions in this thesis are the development and advancement of three-dimensional finite element modelling procedures investigating the local radial and lateral buckling of the tensile <b>armour</b> <b>wires</b> in flexible pipe. This investigation has provided new knowledge and insight, which is either incremental or unique, on these local instability mechanisms for tensile <b>armour</b> <b>wires.</b> The importance of using an implicit solver rather than the traditional use of an explicit solver has also been established. The simplifying assumptions of existing finite element and analytical models mostly have been improved and built sufficient reliability to be used for the different industrial practices. The significance of pipe model characteristics (e. g., element type, topology, segment length), interlayer contact formulations, boundary conditions (i. e., natural, essential), interface friction, hydrostatic loads, damage condition, and curvature on the local instability mechanisms have been examined which is another unique step for consolidating the design standards...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation into the}} effects of contact conformity, contact pressure and displacement amplitude on the gross-slip fretting behaviour grease-lubricated cylinder-on-flat contacts {{in the context of}} flexible marine riser pressure <b>armour</b> <b>wire,</b> and compares behaviour with that observed in unlubricated conditions. Characterisation of friction and wear is critical to fretting fatigue life prediction in flexible risers since friction directly controls trailing-edge fretting stresses and hence fatigue crack initiation, on the one hand, and on the other hand, directly affects wear via relative tangential slip (displacement). Wear can have a beneficial or detrimental effect on fatigue crack initiation and propagation, depending on relative slip and slip regime. It is shown that friction and wear are higher for dry conditions than for grease-lubricated conditions. For grease-lubricated conditions, behaviour is determined by whether grease can be retained in the contact (as opposed to being extruded out). Retention (or replenishment) of grease in the contact results in low rates of wear and low coefficients of friction; these conditions are favoured by fretting displacements above a critical value, by low contact conformity, and by low applied loads...|$|R
40|$|When single {{armoured}} cables {{are under}} tension they {{will start to}} twist in direction depending on the lay angle of the <b>armour</b> <b>wires</b> on the cable. The cables start to twist due to the induced torque that appear within the cable and this induced torque can in the worst-case cause loops and kinks on the cable. These negative consequences are the subject to exploration by implementing a known analytical solution developed by Lanteigne (1985), into an external function in OrcaFlex which is a finite element software program capable of solving 3 D non-linear arbitrarily deflections. It is specifically designed {{to be used for}} doing static and dynamic analysis on marine and offshore structures. Different cable installation scenarios cases have been created and some of these are validated through experimental testing at the testing facility at ABB, Karlskrona. The results from the different cases shows a good representation of the real twist and rotation of the cable. However, results also conclude that the induced torque that appear within the cable was not possible to be correctly represented by applying external torque from an external function. These results are important for further research within the area and they help creating a greater understanding of torque related problems with single armoured cable under tension...|$|R

The cuttings are sucked from the bits into storage chambers in the drill, and brought to the surface with each core increment (typically 2. 4 m in length). Because the actual drilling time is {{a fraction of the}} total run time, with most of the time spent going {{up and down in the}} drill hole, much emphasis has been placed on reducing the friction in the hole and in reducing the time consumed on the surface. In order to simplify the drilling operation, the steel drill cable uses only one <b>wire</b> with the <b>armour</b> acting as power return. Also, to enhance the reliability of the drilling, most drill control tasks are taken care of by a down borehole processor.
