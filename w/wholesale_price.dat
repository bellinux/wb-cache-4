Approximately 2,700tonnes (3,000tons) were sold in France, Italy and Germany in 1988, according to official figures. The true amount consumed far exceeds this, as it {{does not account for}} informal sales or consumption by collectors. They are widely exported and sold in dried form, reaching countries where they do not occur naturally, such as Australia and New Zealand. The autonomous community of Castile and León in Spain produces 7,700tonnes (8,500tons) annually. In autumn, the price of porcini in the Northern Hemisphere typically ranges between $20 and $80dollars per kilogram, although in New York in 1997, the scarcity of fruit bodies elevated the <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> to over $200 per kilogram.|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{mechanism}} of <b>wholesale</b> <b>pricing</b> in the Ukrainian oil market. Structure and main components of the Ukrainian oil market are considered. Factors and main stages of <b>wholesale</b> <b>pricing</b> are identified. Application of cointegration approach for <b>wholesale</b> fuel <b>prices</b> behaviour modelling with asymmetric adjustment relative to world prices is considered. A mathematical model that permits a correct description of the small <b>wholesale</b> petroleum <b>prices</b> dynamics is developed. Asymmetric behaviour of oil <b>wholesale</b> <b>prices</b> is revealed. The time of market response to disturbances and sluggishness of price adjustments relative to average amplitude of producer prices fluctuations are estimated. The possibility of model implementation for short-term <b>wholesale</b> <b>prices</b> forecasting is showed. ? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ???????????? ??????? ??? ?? ????? ?????????????? ???????. ??????????? ????????? ???????? ????? ? ???????? ???????? ??? ????????????. ???????? ???????, ???????? ?? ??????? ????, ? ????? ???????? ???????? ????? ?? ????????????. ??????????? ?????????? ????????????????? ??????? ? ????????????? ????????? ??????? ??? ?? ??????? ? ???????? ?? ?????????? ?? ????????? ? ??????? ?????. ?????????? ?????????????? ??????, ??????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ????????? ?????? ? ????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ??? ?? ????????????? ? ?????? ???? ? ??????? ???????? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ?????? ??????. ???????? ??????? ?????????? ??? ? ??????? ???????? ????? ??????????????, ? ?????????? ????? ??????? ????? ? ????????????? ??? ?? ????????? ? ?????????? ??? ?????????????? ??????? ?????????. ??????? ??????????? ????????????? ?????? ??? ?????????????? ??????????????? ??????? ???...|$|R

40|$|We examine an {{industry}} in which manufacturers set their <b>wholesale</b> <b>prices</b> (i. e., {{they engage in}} price competition) and retailers select order sizes (i. e., they engage in quantity competition). We consider the simplest example of such price-quantity competition, in which each of two manufacturers of a homogenous product sells through a different retailer, and the two retailers together face a non-linear demand function. We show that under this price-quantity competition, manufacturers vertically separate from their retailers and equilibrium <b>wholesale</b> <b>prices</b> are set below the marginal cost of production. The manufacturers' profi ts are lower than under vertical integration (i. e., a prisoner's dilemma occurs) and economic welfare is greater.

5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a <b>wholesale</b> <b>price</b> of EUR 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (Prionace glauca). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|E

40|$|An {{upstream}} supplier that is constrained both by downstream {{competition and}} the threat of demand-side substitution faces a tradeoff between maximizing joint-profit and extracting surplus. Although joint-profit maximization calls for relatively high marginal <b>wholesale</b> <b>prices</b> in order to dampen intra-brand competition, surplus extraction will be higher when the supplier instead charges relatively low marginal <b>wholesale</b> <b>prices.</b> The reason is that by inducing more intra-brand competition through lower <b>wholesale</b> <b>prices,</b> the supplier makes it less attractive for downstream firms to switch to alternative sources of supply. We show how this can make it optimal for the supplier to disadvantage more efficient and thus ultimately larger buyers, thereby smoothing out differences in their market shares. We further show that despite the use of non-linear supply contracts, marginal <b>wholesale</b> <b>prices</b> and thus final goods’ prices will decrease when either downstream competition intensifies or the supplier becomes more constrained by the threat of demand-side substitution. ...|$|R

40|$|Cross-brand {{pass-through}} {{implies that}} a retailer responds to wholesale promotional {{support from a}} target brand by changing the retail prices of competitive brands. Besanko et al. (2005) model a target brand's retail price {{as a function of}} its own and other brands' <b>wholesale</b> <b>prices</b> using 780 observations (15 price zones × 52 weeks) and take the many significant coefficients for other brands' <b>wholesale</b> <b>prices</b> that they find as evidence of cross-brand pass-through. Because price zones do not react independently to <b>wholesale</b> <b>prices</b> when they set a brand's retail price, Besanko et al.
