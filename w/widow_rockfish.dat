50|$|Sebastes entomelas, the <b>widow</b> <b>{{rockfish}},</b> {{is a type}} of rockfish (Sebastidae) {{that lives}} mainly off the coast of western North America from Alaska to Baja California. This fish is also commonly called widowfish and red snapper.|$|E
50|$|The {{body of the}} <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> is {{elongate}} and compressed. The head {{is relatively}} short, and the upper profile is slightly curved. The mouth is relatively small, the lower jaw projects slightly. The color is brassy brown {{over most of the}} body with the belly generally lighter in color, often with a reddish cast. The fin membranes, particularly in the anal and pectoral fins, are black. Specimens smaller than 10 in are lighter in color and are tinged with vague streaks of orange.|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, I address {{fundamental}} ecological {{issues concerning}} <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> (Sebastes entomelas) habitat use and distribution, {{which can be}} used as the foundation for appropriate marine reserve design. Although <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> {{is one of the most}} commercially important rockfish species on the US West Coast, no previous work has specifically addressed the habitat requirements of this species. In Chapter One, I identify significant habitat associations between <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> and three habitat variables; bottom depth. vertical depth of fish in the water column, and temperature. My results indicate that the average significant habitat association for <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> includes bottom depths between 136 - 298 m. vertical depths between 101 - 197 m. and temperatures between 7. 1 - 8. 1 °C. These results provide useful insights towards the definition of essential fish habitat (EFH) for this species. In Chapter Two. I address fluctuations in habitat use through time. I detected no significant interannual, seasonal. or intraannual variation in the range of bottom depths preferred by <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish,</b> but I did detect a significant correlation between bottom depth and vertical depth. Fish are further off the bottom at deeper bottom depths, and this relationship varies significantly by season. Understanding the ecological phenomenon affecting this behavior could provide us with additional insight into the ecology and habitat requirements of this species. Finally, in Chapter Three, I investigated <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> distribution, and changes through time. I detected three significant annual shifts in the spatial distribution within an 11 -year time series (1988 - 1998), corresponding to the two major El Niño events that occurred within this time frame. My results have the following implications for marine reserves design. First, the habitat encompassed in any marine reserve(s) designed for <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> conservation must include the range of bottom depths and temperatures significantly associated with its distribution. Second, the marine reserve(s) should encompass both the inshore and offshore components of <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> habitat. Finally, a single reserve may not afford equal protection to this species, particularly with regard to El Niño versus non-El Niño years. Therefore, in addition to seasonal habitat use, one must consider interannual shifts in distribution...|$|E
40|$|The STAR panel {{reviewed}} a new full {{assessment of}} <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> (Sebastes entomelas) off {{the west coast}} of the United States during a five-day meeting in Newport, OR. The stock assessment team (STAT), with remote assistance from STAT member Ms Chantel Wetzel (NWFSC) prepared a new benchmark assessment using the most recent Stock Synthesis 3 software, with a thorough reconsideration of the data and model structure, and including investigations of historical and recent landings and discards, length and age data and fleet structures. The last assessment was conducted in 2011. The STAR Panel recommends that the new coastwide assessment for <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> constitutes the best available scientific information on the current status of the stock and that it provides a suitable basis for management decisions...|$|E
40|$|This {{workshop}} {{was organized}} {{because of the}} increase between 1978 and 1980 in coastwide landings of <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish,</b> from less than 1, 000 mt to more than 20, 000 mt, and because of scientists' concern {{with the lack of}} knowledge both of the fishery and biology of the species. Most scientists active in research on Pacific groundfish, as well as some members of the fishing industry and fishery managers, attended the workshop. These proceedings contain the report of the workshop discussion panel, status reports on California, Oregon, and Washington fisheries through 1980, and a collection of seven papers presented at the workshop. The status reports provide an historical perspective of the development of an important fishery. The papers present a fairly complete survey of biological knowledge of <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish,</b> economic status of the fishery, and fishery-independent methods for estimation of abundance. The papers also contain some information developed after the workshop. Since the workshop, the fishery has matured. Largest landings were made in 1981, when more than 28, 000 mt were landed. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is estimated to be slightly less than 10, 000 mt, and the stock appeared to be at about the MSY level in 1985. The Pacific Fishery Management Council and National Marine Fisheries Service have implemented regulations that have maintained landings since 1983 at approximately the maximum sustainable yield level. Fishery-dependent stock assessments are being made on an annual basis for the Pacific Fishery Management Council. While these assessments are considered to be the best possible with available data, scientists responsible for the assessment have chosen to delay their publication in the formal scientific literature until more data are obtained. However, the stock assessment reports are available from the Pacific Fishery Management Council. In addition to the papers in this collection, three papers have been published on <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> since 1980. BoehIert, Barss, and Lamberson (1982) estimate fecundity of the species off Oregon; Gunderson (1984) describes the fishery and management actions; and Laroche and Richardson (1981) describe the morphology and distribution of juvenile <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> off Oregon. During the past decade, the fishery for <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> has developed from a minor fishery to one of the more important on the Pacific Coast. Our knowledge of the biology and dynamics of the species has progressed from minimal to relatively extensive for a groundfish species. It is our intention in preparing this collection of papers to make this knowledge readily available to the scientific community. (PDF file contains 63 pages. ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Marine {{fish are}} subject to direct and {{indirect}} oceanographic variations operating at short and long time scales. In this study feeding habits and long-term growth condition of several groundfish species of the Pacific Northwest are examined to {{understand the relationship between}} variations in the fish's biological and life history components and the ocean environment. Stomach samples of three rockfish species, yellowtail rockfish (Sebastes flavidus), <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> (S. entomelas), and canary rockfish (S. pinniger), which were collected seasonally off the Pacific Northwest in 1998 and 1999, provided quantitative information on the food habits of the species during and directly after the 1997 - 98 El Nino event. The diets of these co-occurring species were markedly different from each other. Unusual southern zooplankton species were found in the diets of all three species possibly due to the influence of the El Niflo event. The diet of S. flavidus in 1998 summer (El Nino) was contrasted with results from a previous study based on 1980 summer samples (non-El Nino), and found to be different. An assessment of long-term changes in fish growth condition was conducted using data from Oregon market samples, in which the fish weights are generally measured for aggregations of fish rather than individuals. Non-linear regression can be applied to this type of data to estimate the length-weight parameters and to detect long-term changes in growth condition. The reliability of the estimation method was tested using Monte Carlo simulation. The results demonstrate that the estimation method provides reasonably accurate estimates and is sufficiently powerful to detect small changes in the length-weight relationship. Using Oregon market sample data collected over several decades and the non-linear regression method, growth condition indices were developed and examined for five fish species: Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus), petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani), canary rockfish, yellowtail rockfish, and <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish.</b> No particular trend or close association with environmental variables was evident in the long-term growth condition indices for any of the species, but interannual and seasonal variations in condition were clearly evident. Possible reasons for the lack of long-term trends in condition and the lack of any close association with the environmental variables are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. -We {{developed}} optimal harvesting {{policies for}} the <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> Sebastes entornelas fishery using a microcomputer-based age-structured model. We compared traditional constant effort policies to more complex escapement policies (control of spawning stock size) using three criteria: {{the difficulty of}} estimating policy parameters, the average harvest obtained, and the variability in harvest. Substantial computational effort was required to obtain optimal estimates for the two-parameter escapement policies, and a single run usually required 24 h or more to complete on a microcomputer. Conservative escapement policies were similar in form and in performance to constant effort policies. Mean harvest under the least-conservative escapement policy was only about 2 % greater than mean harvest under a constant effort policy, yet variability in harvest increased by 4 %. For stocks where density dependence is not strong, we suggest that only minor improvement will be gained {{through the use of}} two-parameter escapement policies. Harvest guidelines for multiaged fish stocks tra-ditionally have been based on either constant catch or constant effort policies. Both of these policies can be viewed as special cases of a more general har...|$|E

40|$|Overview A draft {{assessment}} of <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> (Sebastes entomelas) off the United States West Coast was {{reviewed by the}} STAR panel during July 13 - 17, 2009. The assessment assumes a single coastwide stock given that there is currently no biological or genetic information to suggest the presence of multiple stocks. Northern and southern areas are modeled with different growth in each area. Recruits are produced from a common pool of spawners, and are assigned to each area according to year-invariant proportion (estimated by the model). No mixing is assumed to occur post recruitment. This assessment uses the Stock Synthesis platform (version 3. 03 a) and incorporates a variety of data sources into the base model. Catch and age-frequency data from four fisheries {{are used in the}} assessment, including Washington and California fisheries (all gears combined), and Oregon midwater and bottom trawl fisheries. A fishery-dependent relative abundance (CPUE) index calculated from Oregon trawl fishery data was used in the model, and three bycatch indices were estimated from foreign, joint-venture and domestic Pacific whiting fisheries. Fishery-independent data included the midwater trawl pelagic juvenile survey, the triennial trawl surve...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{characterized}} habitat {{requirements of}} juvenile cowcod, Sebastes levis, using information from surveys conducted aboard the manned research submersible Delta. We conducted 303 dive surveys on rocky banks and outcrops in water depths between 28 and 365 m in southern and central California, covering 483 km (963, 940 m 2) of seafloor. We counted 549, 263 fishes {{from at least}} 134 species; 216 individuals were juvenile cowcod, S. levis, of 45 cm or less in total length (TL). Juvenile cowcod occupied depths between 52 and 330 m and demonstrated ontogenetic shifts in their habitat associations. Small fish (5 – 20 cm TL) lived primarily among cobbles or cobbles and small boulders. As fish grew, they moved into high-relief rock habitats, including boulder fields and rock ridges. Small cowcods were found with pygmy, Sebastes wilsoni, and swordspine, Sebastes ensifer, rockfishes. Larger juveniles often associated with juvenile bocac-cio, Sebastes paucispinis, juvenile <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish,</b> Sebastes entomelas, and squarespot rockfish, Sebastes hopkinsi.

40|$|Management of West Coast {{groundfish}} {{resources by}} the Pacific Fishery Management Council involves Federal government and academic scientists conducting stock assessments, generally using the stock synthesis framework, applying the 40 - 10 rule to determine harvest guidelines for {{resources that are}} not overfished and conducting rebuilding analyses to determine harvest guidelines for resources that have been designated as overfished. However, this management system has not been evaluated {{in terms of its}} ability to satisfy the National Standard 1 goals of the Sustainable Fisheries Act. A Monte Carlo simulation framework is therefore outlined {{that can be used to}} make such evaluations. Based on simulations tailored to a situation similar to that of managing the <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> (Sebastes entomelas) resource, it is shown that catches during recovery and thereafter are likely to be highly variable (up to ± 30 % from one year to the next). Such variability is far greater than has been presented to the decision makers to date. Reductions in interannual variability in catches through additional data collection are, however, unlikely. Rather, improved performance will probably arise from better methods for predicting future recruitment. Rebuilding analyses include quantities such as the year to which the desired probability of recovery applies. The estimates of such quantities are, however, very poorly determined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —In this paper, I {{explore how}} {{patterns}} of compensatory mortality, as assessed through stock–recruitment relationships, may influence optimal harvest rates and relative yields for several West Coast groundfish stocks. To do this, I revisited Clark’s (1991) groundfish life history model and maximin (i. e., maximize the minimum) yield approach to evaluate target harvest rates for five stocks (Dover sole Microstomus pacificus, lingcod Ophiodon elongatus, sablefish Anoplopoma fim-bria, Pacific hake Merluccius productus, and <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> Sebastes entomelas) using recent estimates of fishery and life history parameters and stock–recruitment data. I {{found that a}} spawning-stock-per-recruit target of roughly 35 % of its unfished amount would be reasonable for these stocks if Clark’s assumed stock–recruitment parameters are representative and the policy goal is a maximin yield. In contrast, use of estimated stock–recruitment parameters suggested more conservative percentages of the unfished spawning stock per recruit and more conservative harvest rate targets for most stocks. A key implication of this work is that Clark’s groundfish life history model is sensitive to the stock–recruitment shape parameters. As a result, these parameters should be es-timated where possible or imputed using results from meta-analyses. Overall, a conservation target of roughly 35 % of the unfished spawning stock per recruit is very likely too low for lingcod...|$|E
40|$|Situation: The {{groundfish}} {{fishery management}} plan (FMP) requires the Council to establish reference points for each major species or species complex: an acceptable biological catch (ABC), a total catch optimum yield (OY), and an overfishing threshold. Additionally, OYs for some species are allocated between the open access, limited entry, tribal, and recreational fisheries. The Council adopted a preliminary range of groundfish harvest levels (OYs) for consideration and analysis at the November 2003 meeting. However, the Groundfish Management Team (GMT) recommends a new range of lingcod and cabezon harvest levels for 2005 - 06 {{based on the}} revised assessments adopted at the March 2004 Council meeting (Exhibit C. 8. b, Attachment 1). These harvest levels will determine the types of management measures available for Council consideration in 2005 and 2006.

No black rockfish were collected from our nearshore sampling sites in either 2004 or 2005, although this habitat is listed as common for juveniles of this species. Blue rockfish settlement was detected from April thru July in 2004, and from May thru June in 2005. Peak settlement timing was in June of both years. Settlement for black rockfish ranged from March thru July both years, with peak settlement timing occurring in mid-May. Yellowtail and <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> juveniles were rarely encountered, with settlement occurring in April and July respectively. Abundance, as estimated from catch per unit effort (CPUE) calculations, varied among years and habitats. Black rockfish were more abundant in 2004 than in 2005. Some of the highest densities were found around pilings, docks and other anthropogenic structures: CPUE decreased within rock, eelgrass, and sand habitats respectively. Growth was not significantly different among habitats for either black or blue rockfish. Growth rate differences were not significant among years for either black or blue rockfish. However, growth differences were significant between species (black 0. 50 mm d- 1 and blue. 54 mm d- 1 (two sample-t test, T stat = - 3. 19, df = 133 P-value <. 002). Additionally, this thesis presents a tank validation experiment that investigated the validity of traps as a quantitative measure of habitat quality. This trap validation study showed that as habitat complexity increases, trap efficiency decreases. Trap attractiveness is an important source of bias when used for juvenile rockfish abundance estimation. This study demonstrates abundance estimates may be inflated in areas of low habitat complexity in the natural environment, or under-estimate the relative abundance of rockfishes within complex habitats. This study identifies estuaries as Essential Fish Habitat for black rockfish juveniles along the central Oregon coast, and nearshore reef as EFH for blue rockfish juveniles. Results of this study also provide specific information on spatial and temporal patterns of recruitment, habitat selection and growth, previously unknown for Oregon's nearshore Sebastes species...|$|E
40|$|West Coast fishery {{management}} {{is a product}} of its context, incentives, and history. The context is both regional and national. Incentives have encouraged investment and growth. The history is a progression of enclosure, expansion, and eventual contraction. A major West Coast fishery – groundfish – illustrates how {{fishery management}} has evolved in the past halfcentury. We can bracket the understanding of this evolution with two time periods – groundfish management in 1999 and its postwar origins. Context Fisheries are embedded in larger contexts. The West Coast groundfish fishery is the subject of current attention as the industry struggles through a crisis of biology and economics. The biological expression of this crisis is seven overfished species of groundfish: Pacific ocean perch, <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish,</b> darkblotched rockfish, canary rockfish, shortspine thorneyhead, cowcod, and lingcod. Because rockfish (six of the seven overfished species) are longlived, some living over 100 years, the rebuilding plans required by the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) are correspondingly long. For example, rebuilding plans recently approved for canary rockfish and cowcod will last 57 years and 95 years, respectively (Pacific Fishery Management Council 2000 b). Over these long rebuilding times fishing effort will be reduced not only on overfished species but also on species that are caught with them. The economic expression of the crisis derives from reduced fishing opportunities. Comparing 1999 to the peak of th...|$|E

For the three species, the average exploitable biomass from the 2003, 2005, and 2007 surveys was 9, 682 mt (8, 576 mt for dark rockfish, 132 mt for <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish,</b> and 974 mt for yellowtail rockfish). The 2008 recommended ABC for dark, widow, and yellowtail rockfish combined is 508 mt based on tier 5 calculations (F= 0. 75 M). The 2008 OFL (F=M= 0. 07) for dark, widow, and yellowtail rockfish is 678 mt. Recommended area apportionments of ABC dark, widow, and yellowtail rockfish are 98 mt for the Western area, 353 mt for the Central area, 24 mt for the West Yakutat area, and 34 mt for the Southeast/Outside area.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of full participation by fishers in stock assessment research are demonstrated through two {{examples from the}} groundfish fishery in British Columbia, Canada. The first example summarizes a joint acoustic study to estimate the biomass of a shoal of <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish</b> (Sebastes entomelas) in BC waters. In this example, the fishers posed the initial experimental hypothesis, provided the essential background information needed to plan the study, and were full participants in the conduct, analysis, and documentation. The second example describes {{the impact of a}} fisher critique of a stock assessment of silvergray rockfish (S. brevispinis). They argued that the observed trends in size and age could have been caused by the introduction of Individual Quota Management, because IVQ’s had led to subtle shifts in the spatial distribution of catches. In response to their criticism, a preliminary study was jointly conducted; the results of which partially supported their concern. These results are now being used to improve the sampling and assessment techniques. We suggest that {{it is a mistake to}} focus on fishers simply as data collectors or knowledge sources, thereby ignoring their skills in hypothesis formulation, research design, and interpretation. Phrases such as “incorporating fisher (local, or traditional) knowledge ” are not only incorrect but are pejorative in implying that fishers are limited in what they can contribute to the scientific process. We suggest that Participatory Research represents a more effective intuitive framework for incorporating their full expertise into fisheries research.

Such knowledge has been lacking for the principal species comprising commercial rockfish catches from California waters. Recent studies have furnished details on annual growth, size and age at maturity, weight-length relationship, season of spawning, fecundity, and feeding habits for 10 species of rockfish (genus Sebastodes) that are commonly taken off California. These are bocaccio, S. paucispinis, chilipepper, S. goodei, yellowtail rockfish, S. flavidus, canary rockfish, S. pinniger, vermilion rockfish, S. miniatus, <b>widow</b> <b>rockfish,</b> S. entomelas, dark-blotched rockfish, S. crameri, splitnose rockfish (rosefish), S. diploproa, stripetail rockfish, S. saxicola, and shortbelly rockfish, S. jordani. Although 57 varieties of scorpaenids (family Scorpaenidae) exist {{off the coast of}} western North America, only two had been studied in any detail prior to this time. Wales (1952) published a partial life history of the blue rockfish, Sebastodes mystinus, and Westrheim (1958), and Alverson and Westrheim (1961) published data on the biology of the Pacific ocean perch, S. alutus. The blue rockfish is a shallow water form, caught mainly by sportfishermen in California. Although poorly represented off California, Pacific ocean perch are abundant in offshore waters of the Pacific Northwest, where they are the primary rockfish sought by otter trawl fishermen. In California waters, the rockfish family is now represented by 50 species of Sebastodes (rockfish or "rock cod"), 2 species of Sebastolobus (channel rockfish), and 1 of Scorpaena (sculpin). This fish family {{is one of the most}} important and colorful in our waters. Most of the species are highly desirable for food and are subjected to both commercial and sportfishing pressure. Only a few are too small to be of direct value for human consumption. Even these are utilized as food by other fishes, often by larger forms of rockfish. Nine of the species in the present study are of considerable commercial value; the tenth, the shortbelly rockfish, is a small form whose greatest value probably is as food for salmon (Merkel, 1957) and similar predators. As time permits and based upon future catch composition evaluations, other prominent species will be studied in similar detail. The most important of these at present seem to be the shortspine channel rockfish, Sebastolobus alascanus, and flag rockfish, Sebastodes rubrivinctus, in northern California; the speckled rockfish, S. ovalis, in central California; and the bronzespotted rockfish, S. gilli and cow rockfish, S. levis, in southern California...|$|E
