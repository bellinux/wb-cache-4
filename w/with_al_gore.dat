25|$|The South's {{transition}} to a Republican stronghold took decades and manifested an incremental seepage downward from national to state to local levels. First the states started voting Republican in presidential elections—the Democrats countered that by nominating Southerners who could carry some states in the region, such as Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. However, the strategy narrowly failed <b>with</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> in 2000. Then the states began electing Republican senators to fill open seats caused by retirements and finally governors and state legislatures changed sides.|$|E
2500|$|As the publisher, Seigenthaler worked <b>with</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore,</b> then a reporter, on investigative {{stories about}} Nashville city council {{corruption}} in the early 1970s. In February 1976, Seigenthaler contacted Gore at home to tip him off {{that he had heard}} that U.S. Representative Joe L. Evins was retiring, telling Gore [...] "You know what I think." [...] Seiganthaler previously had been encouraging Gore to consider entering public life. Gore decided to resign from the paper and drop out of Vanderbilt University Law School, beginning his political career by entering the race for Tennessee's 4th congressional district, a seat previously held by Albert Gore Sr., his father.|$|E

2500|$|After [...] "I'm Yours" [...] {{remained}} at the Billboard Hot 100 chart for a record 76 weeks ending in October 2009 (peaking at number 6), Mraz headed to the Gulf of Mexico {{during the summer of}} 2010 to help with efforts to clean the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Later, he went to a trip to Ghana to fight child slavery alongside the nonprofit organization Free the Slaves. Later, Mraz was in Antarctica, spending time <b>with</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> and learning about climate change aboard the National Geographic Explorer. During his activist outings, Mraz wrote and recorded his fourth album, Love Is a Four Letter Word, with producer Joe Chiccarelli. In an interview for Billboard, he confessed that he was less interested in following up his biggest hit than using the power that [...] "I'm Yours" [...] gave him to fuel positive change. He further elaborated: [...] "The pressure I put on myself, or what I hope my 'I Won't Give Up' does, is {{to make a difference in}} people's lives [...] [...] [...] With 'I'm Yours,' I got to go out and set my feet on different continents, and expose myself to different cultures and causes. I wanted to see who I was, outside of music." ...|$|E

5000|$|Another example: [...] "The President of the USA in 2001 {{could not}} have been Al Gore". This claim seems false on a de dicto reading.

After all, we might skeptically wonder of George W. Bush whether he could have been <b>Al</b> <b>Gore.</b> Indeed, assuming that being George Bush is an essential feature of George Bush and that this feature is incompatible <b>with</b> being <b>Al</b> <b>Gore,</b> a de re reading of the statement is true.|$|R
