In these monologues Mitchell has criticised a variety of subjects, including the BBC show Doctor Who and 3D television. Matt Warman of the Daily Telegraph suggested that the series could {{be a sign that}} new comedy <b>will</b> <b>increasingly</b> become available online, rather than on television. The series has been released on DVD.|$|E

Also in 2010, the university's dining hall, Ellicott Dining Hall, installed solar panels which would provide up to 30 percent of the energy for water heating in the dining hall. To do this the university installed 20 panels with 3 solar storage tanks, pumps, temperature sensors, and controls. The system <b>will</b> <b>increasingly</b> provide more of the dining hall's water needs due to the storage tanks.|$|E

Based on Article 84 of the Fifth Five-year Socio Economic Development Plan (2011-2015), the National Development Fund {{was established to}} transform oil and gas revenues to productive investment for future generation. The money <b>will</b> <b>increasingly</b> be deposited in domestic banks. Accordingly, 20% of oil income is {{to be transferred to}} the National Development Fund. The new fund is to extend 50% of its financial facilities to private, cooperative and non-governmental sectors and 20% to promote foreign investment. It is foreseen that the Development Fund will reach $30 billion by March 2012.|$|E
500|$|Record {{executives}} {{in the music industry}} believe that music charts <b>will</b> <b>increasingly</b> be filled with YouTube-driven globalised acts from foreign countries. Sean Carey, a research fellow in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Roehampton, wrote that the flow of popular music will no longer be a single traffic route from North America and Europe {{to other parts of the}} globe, but will also move the other way as well. According to Adam Sherwin from The Independent, the global web demand for Gangnam Style had short-circuited the [...] "traditional reluctance" [...] of radio stations to play foreign-language songs. The song is also underlining a shift in how money is being made in the music business. Although Psy earned more than US$60,000 from music sales of [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] in South Korea alone, he and his music label YG Entertainment have raked in almost US$1 million from advertisements which appear on YouTube videos identified for using [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] in its content. The Harvard Business Review published an article written by Kevin Evers, who explained how [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] had changed Billboard's ranking methodology of its music charts. Instead of relying solely on radio plays and paid purchases, Billboard started to place a heavier emphasis on digital sales and YouTube views. As a result of the change, Gangnam Style moved up to the top position of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs music chart. According to the British Phonographic Industry's report based on Official Charts Company sales data, thanks to Psy's song and Carly Rae Jepsen's [...] "Call Me Maybe", pop became the UK's favourite musical genre of the year, taking the lion's share of the singles market (38.5%) in 2012.|$|E
500|$|In the 1940s, {{radio was}} the {{electronic}} medium for family entertainment and information. In the 1950s, it was television {{that was the}} new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world. By the 1970s, games could be played electronically, then hand-held devices provided mobile entertainment, and by {{the last decade of}} the 20th century, via networked play. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The [...] "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" [...] together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films. One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid obsolescence of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded. One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a Wii console, [...] "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953". Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called [...] "digital revolution" [...] has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up. Even the sports stadium of the future <b>will</b> <b>increasingly</b> compete with television viewing [...] "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available." [...] Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as [...] "professional engagers" [...] shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} erred, Sotomayor argued, by [...] "imposing {{a wholly}} unprecedented obligation on the condemned inmate to identify an available means {{for his or}} her own execution." [...] Calling the Court's holding [...] "legally indefensible," [...] she argued the Court had failed to distinguish Hill v. McDonough (2006), and went on to criticize the Court for treating the plurality opinion in Baze v. Rees (2008) as precedent, noting that the Court was ignoring the concurring opinions necessary to achieve that judgment. Condemned prisoners should not be required to meet an additional burden of proof, in Sotomayor's view, simply because they face executions that [...] "States hurriedly devise as they scramble to locate new and untested drugs." [...] Finally, Sotomayor anticipated that, due to the prevalence of botched executions, those condemned to die <b>will</b> <b>increasingly</b> choose execution by firing squad.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing Katz's book, The Battle for Rome, István Deák, on {{the other}} hand, {{cautions}} that although [...] "armed resistance during World War II was romanticized because the Nazis were such an appalling enemy, and because in that war the guerrillas' targets were still mainly soldiers", it is increasingly hard {{to draw the line}} between freedom fighting and terrorism. In his opinion, Hague Conventions regulating irregular warfare has been [...] "more a failure than success." [...] "What is needed," [...] Deák stresses, [...] "is a recognition of reality, namely that future wars <b>will</b> <b>increasingly</b> consist of civilians shooting at soldiers from hiding and frightened soldiers killing innocent civilians. And what is needed, in the aftermath of such a sobering recognition, is an attempt to create a new international law for the more efficient regulation of this type of horrible warfare." [...] Robert Katz's book, [...] The Battle for Rome, Deák concludes, [...] "provides fine arguments for this necessary debate".|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Churchill's second {{proposition}} is the correlative of the first. How shall this imposing {{fabric of}} industrial security be reared and made safe? The answer is, by modifying, without vitally changing, {{the basis of}} taxation. The workman cannot be asked to pay for everything, as under Protection he must pay. In any case, he must pay for something. But if he is asked for too much, the sources of physical efficiency are drained, and {{the main purpose of}} the new Liberalism--the ideal of an educated, hopeful, and vigorous people--is destroyed. Now Liberalism, in ceasing to rely on indirect taxation as its main source of revenue, has opened up for contribution not merely the superfluities of society, the [...] "accumulations of profit," [...] as Mr. Churchill calls them, but those special forms of wealth which are [...] "social" [...] in origin, which depend on some monopoly of material agents, on means not of helping the community but of hindering it, not of enriching its powers and resources, but of depleting them for private advantage. In other words, the State in future <b>will</b> <b>increasingly</b> ask the taxpayer not only [...] "What have you got?" [...] but [...] "How did you get it?" [...] No one contends that such an analysis can be perfect; but, on the other hand, can a community desirous of realising what Goethe calls [...] "practical Christianity," [...] ignore it? And if in this process it enters the sphere of morals, as Ruskin long ago urged it to do, as well as the path of economic justice, is the step a wrong one? Has it not already been taken not only in this Budget, but in its predecessor, in which the Prime Minister made the memorable distinction between earned and unearned income? Those who answer these questions in the Liberal sense will find in these speeches a body of vigorous and persuasive reasoning on their side.|$|E

60|$|But I {{think there}} is another explanation, {{feminine}} rather than feminist, and proceeding from normal women and not from abnormal idiots. It is something that involves an old controversy, but one upon which I have not, like so many politicians, changed my opinion. It concerns the particular fashion in which women tend to regard, or rather to disregard, the formal and legal rights of the citizen. In so far as this is a bias, it is a bias in the directly opposite direction from that now lightly alleged. There {{is a sort of}} underbred history going about, according to which women in the past have always been in the position of slaves. It is much more to the point to note that women have always been in the position of despots. They have been despotic because they ruled in an area where they had too much common sense to attempt to be constitutional. You cannot grant a constitution to a nursery; nor can babies assemble like barons and extort a Great Charter. Tommy cannot plead a Habeas Corpus against going to bed; and an infant cannot be tried by twelve other infants before he is put in the corner. And as there can be no laws or liberties in a nursery, the extension of feminism means that there shall be no more laws or liberties in a state than there are in a nursery. The woman does not really regard men as citizens but as children. She may, if she is a humanitarian, love all mankind; but she does not respect it. Still less does she respect its votes. Now a man must be very blind nowadays not to see that there is a danger of a sort of amateur science or pseudo-science being made the excuse for every trick of tyranny and interference. Anybody who is not an anarchist agrees with having a policeman {{at the corner of the}} street; but the danger at present is that of finding the policeman half-way down the chimney or even under the bed. In other words, it is a danger of turning the policeman into a sort of benevolent burglar. Against this protests are already being made, and <b>will</b> <b>increasingly</b> be made, if men retain any instinct of independence or dignity at all. But to complain of the woman interfering in the home will always sound like complaining of the oyster intruding into the oyster-shell. To object that she has too much power over education will seem like objecting to a hen having too much to do with eggs. She has already been given an almost irresponsible power over a limited region in these things; and if that power is made infinite it will be even more irresponsible. If she adds to her own power in the family all these alien fads external to the family, her power will not only be irresponsible but insane. She will be something which may well be called a nightmare of the nursery; a mad mother. But the point is that she will be mad about other nurseries as well as her own, or possibly instead of her own. The results will be interesting; but at least it is certain that under this softening influence government of the people, by the people, for the people, will most assuredly perish from the earth.|$|E
