5|$|Bristol notably {{does not}} award by title any bachelor's degrees in music, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>{{available}}</b> for study but awarded B.A. (although it does award MMus and DMus), nor any degree in divinity, since divinity {{is not available}} for study (students of theology are awarded a B.A.). Similarly, the university does not award BLitt (Bachelor of Letters), although it does award both MLitt and DLitt. In regulations, the university does not name MD or DDS as higher doctorates, although they are in many universities as these degrees are normally accredited professional doctorates.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{budget cuts}} by Gateshead Council {{have seen the}} local {{authority}} transfer {{the management of the}} park to the community, despite a local petition raised in protest. The reserve remains popular with residents; in May 2012 dozens of volunteers cleared rubbish and engaged in a 'Windy Nook Wildlife Festival' with face-painting and other traditional activities. Local police continue to make 'targeted patrols' of the reserve to maintain the downward trend of anti-social behaviour in the area. In November 2012 a 'green gym' was opened at the reserve. This saw fitness equipment installed in clusters of three and four machines <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> for use by the public free of charge. This is one of only two such outdoor public gyms in Gateshead, the other being opened simultaneously at Saltwell Park.|$|E
5|$|The Sopranos {{was a major}} ratings success, {{despite being}} aired on premium cable network HBO <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> in {{significantly}} fewer American homes than regular networks. The show frequently attracted equal or larger audiences than most popular network shows of the time. Nielsen ratings {{for the first four}} seasons are not entirely accurate, however, as Nielsen reported aggregate numbers for cable networks prior to January 2004, meaning that people who were included in the ratings estimates were actually watching HBO channels other than the main one on which The Sopranos aired.|$|E
5|$|The above {{cascade of}} (n,γ) {{reactions}} produces {{a mixture of}} different curium isotopes. Their post-synthesis separation is cumbersome, and therefore a selective synthesis is desired. Curium-248 is favored for research purposes because of its long half-life. The most efficient preparation method of this isotope is via α-decay of the californium isotope 252Cf, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> in relatively large quantities due to its long half-life (2.65 years). About 35–50mg of 248Cm is being produced by this method every year. The associated reaction produces 248Cm with isotopic purity of 97%.|$|E

5|$|The {{early success}} of Dungeons & Dragons {{led to a}} {{proliferation}} of similar game systems. Despite the competition, D has remained as the market leader in the role-playing game industry. In 1977, the game was split into two branches: the relatively rules-light game system of basic Dungeons & Dragons and the more structured, rules-heavy game system of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (abbreviated as AD). AD 2nd Edition was published in 1989. In 2000, a new system was released as Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition. These rules {{formed the basis of}} the d20 System <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> under the Open Game License (OGL) for use by other publishers. Dungeons & Dragons version 3.5 was released in June 2003, with a (non-OGL) 4th edition in June 2008. A 5th edition was released {{during the second half of}} 2014.|$|E
5|$|Terminal 1 {{opened on}} March 15, 1963, and was {{expanded}} between 1970 and 1974 {{with the current}} A and B Gates buildings. Currently, Terminal 1 has four concourses, {{each of which is}} connected to a central pre-security area. Ticketing and baggage claim are located on Level 1 of this area. Level 2 houses the three security checkpoints, an esplanade with several retail outlets, and a USO lounge for military service members. West of the pre-security area are the A Gates and the B Gates, two Y-shaped concourses with circular ends. To the south are the C Gates, which can be accessed by the Green Line of the tram system. The satellite D Gates concourse, which opened in 1998, lies to the east and contains three lounges: the Centurion lounge for American Express card holders; the Club at LAS, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> to all passengers at a fee; and the United Club. The Blue Line of the tram system links the D Gates with the pre-security area.|$|E
5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles {{are useful for}} many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|E
