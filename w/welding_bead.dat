40|$|The {{continuous}} CO 2 {{laser beam}} welding of two aluminum metal matrix composites (6061 and 2618 reinforced with 20 % of Al 2 O 3) has been investigated with {{special attention to the}} influence of the base alloys, the filler material and the process parameters on the microstructure of the <b>welding</b> <b>bead.</b> In this work square butt welding has been obtained with different CO 2 laser power, feed rate and shielding gases. The microstructure of the welding beads has been examined by optical and electronic microscopy.

The hardness of welding beads has been higher than the unaffected composites. A reduction of both the beads hardness and the Al 2 O 3 migration and agglomeration has been obtained by the use of magnesium-rich filler material in the welding process, probably because magnesium is able to increase the reinforcement wettability, and to reduce the rate of formation of spinel phase MgAl 2 O 4.

40|$|AbstractA {{generalised}} view on {{the causes}} leading to humping during high-speed seam welding is proposed. It {{is based on the}} fact that, whenever the melt velocity in a <b>welding</b> <b>bead</b> exceeds considerably the welding speed, the weld groove cannot be completely filled by melt at any location and any instant. As a consequence of solidification from the walls of the weld groove, the shape of the free cross section for the melt flow is changed {{in such a way that}} the rest melt stream experiences an upwards deflection which initiates the formation of a hump. Conservation of volume in an incompressible fluid requires that in the solidified seam regions of smaller and larger cross sections compared to that of the groove must exist. The initiation of humping is discussed for different situations in laser beam welding characterized by the aspect ratio welding depth over spot diameter. As this figure is typical for the geometry of the melt pool/ weld groove, it appears as a meaningful parameter for correlating the onset of humping...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: <b>Bead</b> on plate <b>welding</b> experiments was carried out setting different process parameters. Every welding parameter group was set aiming to reach a high stability level what guarantee a geometrical uniformity in the <b>weld</b> <b>beads.</b> In each experiment was simultaneously acquired arc voltage, welding current, infrared and acoustic emissions; from them were computed parameters as arc power, acoustic peaks rate and infrared radiation rate. It was used a tri-dimensional LASER scanner for to acquire geometrical information from the <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> surface as width and height of the bead. Depth penetration was measured from sectional cross cutting of <b>weld</b> <b>beads.</b> Findings: Previous analysis showed that the arc emission parameters reach a stationary state with different characteristic for each experiment group which {{means that there is}} some correlation level between them. Posterior analysis showed that from infrared parameter is possible to monitoring external <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry and principally its penetration depth. From acoustic parameter is possible to monitoring principally the external <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry. Therefore is concluded that there is a close relation between the arc emissions and the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry and that them could be used to measuring the welding geometrical parameters. Research limitations/implications: After analysis it was noticed that the infrared sensing has a better performance than acoustic sensing in the depth penetration monitoring. Infrared sensing also sources some information about external geometric parameters that in conjunction with the acoustic sensing is possible to have reliable information about <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry. This method of sensing geometric parameters could be applied in other welding processes, but is necessary to have visibility of the arc, it means that for example this method cannot be used in the submerged arc welding - SAW process.

In such an inspection, {{the application of}} an automatic inspection system is desirable, because a manual inspection is difficult to accomplish perfectly and exactly due to its enormity, a so-called nondestructive inspection robot is then preferable. However, an ultrasonic nondestructive inspection robot with a piezoelectric oscillator needs to directly touch the material surface to be inspected using the coupling medium. Therefore, a mechanism where the coupling medium is spread thoroughly between the sensor and the material surface and where the sensor is always held at a constant pressure {{in the same direction}} on the material side to be inspected, are performances requested for the inspection robot. Actually, it is difficult to overcome this problem and the ultrasonic inspection robot could not be applied widely.

Accordingly control parameters have been adjusted to find the optimal bead geometry. Initially the equations involving control parameters and bead geometry were developed by multiple regression analysis method. These equations are then simulated in computer to find the effects of the control parameters on <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry. Finally optimization of <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> parameters is done by obtaining a single set of control parameters from its four different best sets through computer simulation...|$|R

In this paper, an investigation is reported on factors affecting <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry and feasibility of achieving net shape welding for bead-on-plate welding of mild steel sheets with a 1 kW single mode fibre laser. Design of Experiments (DoE) and statistical modelling {{were used in the}} experimental study to understand parameter interactions. The selected independent process variables explored in this study are laser power and welding speed. The <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry characteristics were analysed and the conditions to achieve net-shape welding were determined...|$|R
