5|$|Edgardo {{was visited}} {{by his father}} several times under the {{supervision}} of the rector of the Catechumens, Enrico Sarra, from mid-August to mid-September 1858. The wildly divergent accounts of what happened during these encounters grew into two rival narratives of the entire case. Momolo's version of events, favoured by the Jewish community and other backers, was that a family had been destroyed by the government's religious fanaticism, that helpless Edgardo had spent the journey to Rome crying for his parents, and that the boy <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than to return home. The narrative favoured by the Church and its supporters, and propagated in the Catholic press throughout Europe, was one of divinely ordained, soul-stirring redemption, and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years—the neophyte Edgardo had faced a life of error followed by eternal damnation but now stood to share in Christian salvation, and was distraught that his parents would not convert with him.|$|E

In time, however, good sense prevailed and the two rival bodies joined hands to form the Madras Cricket Association. (The romance of Tamil Nadu cricket-V.Ramanarayanan 2006).|$|E

But within a few generations, the progeny of the pioneers have turned into dolts who can’t take responsibility for anything[...] [...]So long as Americans look to other people for the solution of their problems, they will invariably be disappointed. The American people need to stop whining like spoiled children and take charge of their lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cortés had to {{put down}} {{internal}} struggles among the Spanish troops as well. [...] The remaining Spanish soldiers were somewhat divided; many <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than to go home, {{or at the very}} least to return to Vera Cruz and wait for reinforcements. [...] Cortés hurriedly quashed this faction, determined to finish what he had started. [...] Not only had he staked everything he had or could borrow on this enterprise, he had completely compromised himself by defying his superior Velázquez. He knew that in defeat he would be considered a traitor to Spain, but that in success he would be its hero. So he argued, cajoled, bullied and coerced his troops, and they began preparing for the siege of Mexico. In this Cortés showed skill at exploiting the divisions within and between the Aztec states while hiding those of his own troops.|$|E
2500|$|The season {{would prove}} to be the NHA's last. The owners of the Canadiens, Wanderers, Senators and Bulldogs <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> to do with Livingstone, but {{discovered}} the NHA constitution did not allow them to simply expel him from the league. [...] Instead, they met in November 1917 to suspend the NHA's operations and then formed the National Hockey League so that they could continue the business of pro hockey without Livingstone. Every owner except Livingstone was granted a franchise in the NHL and the NHA contracts transferred. The NHL also continued to used the same rules and season format as the NHA, with the NHL champion now moving on to face the PCHA champion in the Stanley Cup final. Wanderers owner Sam Lichtenhein was quoted as saying, [...] "We didn't throw Livingstone out; he's still got his franchise in the old National Hockey Association. [...] He has his team, and we wish him well. [...] The only problem is he's playing in a one-team league." ...|$|E
