5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E

25|$|A random {{variable}} {{is defined as}} a function that maps outcomes to numerical quantities (labels), typically real numbers. In this sense, it is a procedure for assigning a numerical quantity to each physical outcome, and, contrary to its name, this procedure itself is neither random nor variable. What is random is the unstable physics that describes how the coin lands, and the uncertainty of which outcome <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> observed.|$|E

25|$|A special {{situation}} called pin risk {{can arise}} when the underlying closes at or {{very close to}} the option's strike value on the last day the option is traded prior to expiration. The option writer (seller) may not know with certainty whether or not the option <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> exercised or be allowed to expire. Therefore, the option writer may end up with a large, unwanted residual position in the underlying when the markets open on the next trading day after expiration, regardless of his or her best efforts to avoid such a residual.|$|E

Although, Skade claims that the weapons and ships will be used to defend humanity against the Inhibitors, Clavain is convinced that they <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> used simply to evacuate the Conjoiners and abandon the rest of humanity. Clavain defects to the Demarchists at Yellowstone and spread the news of the Inhibitors, enlisting Antoinette Bax's help to escape the pursuing Conjoiners under Skade.|$|E
500|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day {{received}} critical acclaim, with {{an aggregate}} review score of 92 out of 100 at Metacritic. Many publications and websites declared the graphics {{were the best}} on the Nintendo 64. Critics noted that the game featured a number of technical effects that were uncommon at the time, especially for a Nintendo 64 game, such as dynamic shadowing, coloured lighting, large areas with a long draw distance, no distance fog, detailed facial animations, lip syncing, and individually rendered fingers on some characters. Shane Satterfield of GameSpot {{went so far as}} to say that the game [...] "makes other Nintendo 64 games look like 16-bit software." [...] IGN's Matt Casamassina praised the detailed 3D worlds, [...] "fantastic" [...] texture work, and cute character designs. He remarked that [...] "Conker himself is equipped with an in-game facial animation system that realistically portrays his different moods as he travels the lands. When he's scared, he looks it, and when he's pissed off players <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> able to see his teeth showing in a frown." [...] Reviewers noted occasional drops in the frame rate, but most agreed it did not interfere with the gameplay.|$|E
500|$|The team {{breaks into}} TweenLit Inc.'s headquarters, {{planning}} {{to replace the}} new novel with their old version before the mass printing begins. However, when they reach the printing room, the book publishing executive shows up {{with a group of}} armed men. He reveals that someone tipped him off about their plan, just as Lisa appears letting them know it was her because she wants her name on a book that <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> popular. The executive types in the password in the printing machine and gives Lisa the honor of inserting the USB flash drive with the novel on it. Later, when the saddened members of the group-writing team are walking away from the headquarters, they pass a book store and discover that The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy is being put on the stands. Lisa shows up again, letting them know that she only pretended to betray them so that the publisher would type in the password. When Lisa gave Bart a hug, she replaced the executive's flash drive with Bart's flash drive that contained the troll novel. As a result, she was able to put the original version into print. Lisa is happy to know that her name is finally on a book; however, when she opens a copy, she discovers that Gaiman is listed as the author, not her. It turns out that there were three flash drives and that Gaiman heisted his way to the best-seller list [...] "once again" [...] despite being illiterate. During the credits, it is revealed that Moe was aware of Gaiman's scheme, and was in fact allied with him from the start. The two celebrate with a toast at Shelbyville Beach, but Gaiman double-crosses Moe and poisons his drink.|$|E
