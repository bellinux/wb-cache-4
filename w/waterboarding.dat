5|$|With {{regard to}} the show's notorious habit of killing off major characters, Armitage {{said he had no}} {{preference}} as to Lucas' possible exit. He has performed his own stunts on the series, which have included a <b>waterboarding</b> scene, although the character becomes less physical in the ninth series.

5|$|The comedian {{has said}} that he likes playing weak characters, and {{particularly}} revealing weaknesses in high status figures. During the course of the show, he will frequently peel back the Colbert character's apparent bravado to expose a very weak inner core. In one instance, Colbert demands one of his staff members subject him to simulated <b>waterboarding,</b> only to break down into pleas for mercy upon hearing a water bottle cap popped. In another episode, he criticizes The Today Show cohost Matt Lauer for saying that it's unacceptable for men to cry, only to sob hysterically upon learning that Katie Couric has left the show. These status shifts occur commonly, and constitute a central component of the show's comedy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this article, we {{look into}} the {{question}} whether the Dutch <b>waterboards</b> can still be considered resilient institutions, effectively adapting to changing circumstances as often described in literature. We argue that current <b>waterboards</b> resemble the CPR management form of old only in name. Their institutional nature has changed considerably, thus providing {{a challenge to the}} future of CPR water management in the Netherlands. We examine not only the implications for the institutional performance and future of the <b>waterboard</b> system but also discuss possible ways to regenerate the system. With respect to the latter (changes in), the system of governance and community base character of <b>waterboards</b> are examined. 1...|$|R
