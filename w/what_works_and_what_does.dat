It contains information about <b>what</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> not work when managing a project, {{which can be used}} to assist anyone in managing a more successful project. This book provided a project management framework illustrating twenty-four project management rules. The general thesis in this book was that using just the best project management tools while forgetting everything else about running the project would doom the project to failure.|$|E
50|$|Searching for {{themes and}} {{considering}} <b>what</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> not work within themes enables {{the researcher to}} begin the analysis of potential codes. In this phase, {{it is important to}} begin by examining how codes combine to form over-reaching themes in the data. At this point, researchers have a list of themes and begin to focus on broader patterns in the data, combining coded data with proposed themes. Researchers also begin considering how relationships are formed between codes and themes and between different levels of existing themes. It may be helpful to use visual models to sort codes into the potential themes.|$|E

As CEO of California-based cognitive computing firm Apixio, Darren Schutle, explains that the care can be better fitted to the patient if the data could be collected from various medical records, merged, and analyzed. Further, the combination of similar profiles can serve as a basis for personalized medicine pointing to <b>what</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> not for certain condition (Marr, 2016).|$|E

Internationally, he focuses on microfinance, and domestically he focuses on voting, charitable giving, and commitment contracts. In microfinance, Karlan has studied the following topics: interest rate policy, credit evaluation and scoring policies, entrepreneurship training, group versus individual liability, savings product design, credit with education, and impact from increased access to credit and savings. His work on savings and health typically uses insights from psychology and behavioral economics to design and test specialized products.|$|E

40|$|A fungating tumour of {{the breast}} causes {{distress}} to those living with the illness and createss many challenges to the nurses who care for them. Control of malodour. exudate, haemorrhage and cosmetic acceptability creates complex wound care problems. Managing to live and maintain a sense of normality must {{take account of the}} palliative and chronic nature of this illness. This study utilises the grounded theory research method to discover the main concerns of nurses who care for this group of clients and how they continually resolve them. Three women who have this condition have provided information that adds and lends support to how the nurses provide care. This thesis argues that finding <b>what</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> doesn't <b>work</b> is the core process that resolves the main concern of striving to maintain a sense of normality in life activities. Problem-solving, wound care and wider psychosocial problems initiate the process of finding <b>what</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> doesn't <b>work.</b> Through making sense of the situation by gaining an understanding of the women's situations, being non-judgemental and building trusting relationships, the ability to find <b>what</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> doesn't <b>work</b> {{is more likely to be}} achieved. This must take account of the physical, cultural and professional considerations that impact on the nurse's ability to provide appropriate care. The consequence of finding <b>what</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> doesn't <b>work</b> is that the nurses' practice has the capacity to be transformed. This study provides insight into the creativity and complexity that characterises expert community nursing practice in caring for this particularly challenging group of clients...|$|R

The document appears as if it will be updated {{on a regular basis}} as more questions are answered over time.On December 1, 2011, Carrier IQ issued a [...] "clarification" [...] to its November 23 statements: [...] "While a few individuals have identified that {{there is a great deal}} of information available to the Carrier IQ software inside the handset, our software does not record, store or transmit the contents of SMS messages, email, photographs, audio or video. For example, we understand whether an SMS was sent accurately, but do not record or transmit the content of the SMS. We know which applications are draining your battery, but do not capture the screen... As a condition of its contracts with operators, Carrier IQ operates exclusively within that framework and under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. The data we gather is transmitted over an encrypted channel and secured within our customers’ networks or in our audited and customer-approved facilities... Carrier IQ acts as an agent for the operators. Each implementation is different and the diagnostic information actually gathered is determined by our customers - the mobile operators. Carrier IQ does not gather any other data from devices.Carrier IQ is the consumer advocate to the mobile operator, explaining <b>what</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> not work. Three of the main complaints we hear from mobile device users are (1) dropped calls, (2) poor customer service, and (3) having to constantly recharge the device. Our software allows operators to figure out why problems are occurring, why calls are dropped, and how to extend the life of the battery. When a user calls to complain about a problem, our software helps operators’ customer service to more quickly identify the specific issue with the phone." ...|$|E
