25|$|Golf, {{known in}} Japan as , is a golf video game that was {{released}} {{within months of}} the Virtual Boy console's launch. Golf was developed and published by T Soft in Japan and published by Nintendo in North America. It was directed by Tadashi Nakatsuji and its sound specialist was Ken Kojima. The game uses standard golf rules and {{is set in the}} fictional 18-hole Papillion Golf & Country Club. Hazards include water, sand traps, trees, and deep rough grass, and players can choose their club and various aspects of the club's swing, including speed, direction, stance, swing power, and the ball impact point. The direction the ball <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> is determined by these things as well as the speed and direction of the wind. It is displayed in the Virtual Boy's standard red and black color scheme with 3D effects by use of a 3D processor. It was met with critical praise for its controls and physics and mixed reviews for its graphics. Nintendo Power called it the third best Virtual Boy release of its year.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} strategies for a team is their forecheck. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking {{is an important part of}} the dump and chase strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: 2–1–2, 1–2–2, and 1–4. The 2–1–2 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1–2–2 is a bit more conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1–4 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one forward will apply pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. Another strategy is the left wing lock, which has two forwards pressure the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.|$|E

Matsui mixed his creation with real things to make his style original. To create the atmosphere of the series, Matsui used as reference paintings by Rei Kamoi, a Japanese artist he saw on television, and Gōjin Ishihara, the illustrator of Edogawa Ranpo's Shōnen Tantei Dan. Matsui's creative process of art is to begin drawing erotic and grotesque images, {{and at the same time}} humorous and cute scenes. Matsui did not wish to create [...] "terrifying characters" [...] but [...] "funny-terrifying" [...] and [...] "terrifying-cute". He also tried to avoid men's idealized image of heroines and women's idealized images of heroes. Matsui decided to create characters that could exist in the real world and to make their acts and reactions realistic. As such, elaborating on [...] "why people would create such complex tricks in order to murder someone, [...] wanted to convey the extent to which humans <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> pursuit of a goal".|$|E

500|$|An Independence from Europe fielded 60 {{candidates}} in the 2014 European Parliament election, proposing representatives for each of England's nine constituencies. The most notable of whom were Nattrass, who sought re-election in the West Midlands, and Laurence Stassen, a Dutch MEP who had recently left the Party for Freedom (PVV) and was vying for election in the South East England region. Stassen's unusual standing for the party [...] "demonstrate {{the extent to which}} MEPs whose true ambition is to remain in the European Parliament <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> order to remain in their seat" [...] according to political scientist William T. Daniel. The party did not stand {{candidates in}} the Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland constituencies. Campaigning for the election included a nationwide party political broadcast through the BBC on 8 May and Nattrass' appearance on Daily Politics, where he was interviewed by Andrew Neil on 14 May. Despite claiming it would receive more than 10% of the national vote and elect up to four MEPs, the party only collected 1.49% and all candidates were defeated. Finishing seventh, it was the highest placed party not to elect an MEP; it polled more votes than the British National Party (BNP), which was defending two seats.|$|E
500|$|When the House of Commons {{defeated}} the First Reform Bill in 1831, Grey's ministry urged William to dissolve Parliament, which {{would lead to}} a new general election. At first, William hesitated to exercise his prerogative to dissolve Parliament because elections had just been held the year before and the country {{was in a state of}} high excitement which might boil over into violence. He was, however, irritated by the conduct of the Opposition, which announced its intention to move the passage of an Address, or resolution, in the House of Lords, against dissolution. Regarding the Opposition's motion as an attack on his prerogative, and at the urgent request of Lord Grey and his ministers, William IV prepared to go in person to the House of Lords and prorogue Parliament. The monarch's arrival would stop all debate and prevent passage of the Address. When initially told that his horses could not be ready at such short notice, William is supposed to have said, [...] "Then I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> a hackney cab!" [...] Coach and horses were assembled quickly and William immediately proceeded to Parliament. Said The Times of the scene before William's arrival, [...] "It is utterly impossible to describe the scene... The violent tones and gestures of noble Lords... astonished the spectators, and affected the ladies who were present with visible alarm." [...] Lord Londonderry brandished a whip, threatening to thrash the Government supporters, and was held back by four of his colleagues. William hastily put on the crown, entered the Chamber, and dissolved Parliament. This forced new elections for the House of Commons, which yielded a great victory for the reformers. But although the House of Commons was clearly in favour of parliamentary reform, the House of Lords remained implacably opposed to it.|$|E

In response the Unionists had a meeting on 27 July at Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Winston Churchill, one of Asquith's ministers. More than 13,000 people attended, including over 40 peers. In Law's speech he said [...] "I said so to [...] and I say so now, with the full sense of the responsibility which attaches to my position, that if the attempt be made under present conditions, I can imagine no length of resistance to which Ulster <b>will</b> <b>go,</b> <b>in</b> which I shall not be ready to support them, and in which they will not be supported by {{the overwhelming majority of the}} British people".

2500|$|It {{will begin}} early – before {{some of us}} are up, no doubt, and it will {{continue}} late. [...] The sidewalks will be worse obstructed in every street than Wall-street is where the brokers are in full blast. Old beds and ricketty bedstands, handsome pianos and kitchen furniture, will be chaotically huddled together. [...] Everything will be in a muddle. Everybody in a hurry, smashing mirrors in his haste, and carefully guarding boot boxes from harm. Sofas that go out sound <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> maimed, tables that enjoyed castors will scratch along and [...] "tip" [...] on one less than its complement. [...] Bed-screws will be lost in the confusion, and many a good piece of furniture badly bruised in consequence. [...] Family pictures will be sadly marred, and the china will be a broken set before night, in many a house. All houses will be dirty – never so dirty – into which people move, and the dirt of the old will seem enviable beside the cleanliness of the new. [...] The old people will in their hearts murmur at these moving dispensations. The younger people, though aching in every bone, and [...] "tired to death," [...] will relish the change, and think the new closets more roomy and more nice, and delight themselves fancying how this piece of furniture will look here and that piece in the other corner. The still [...] "younger ones" [...] will still more enjoy it.

Don't growl at the carmen nor haggle over the price charged. When the scratched furniture comes in don't believe it is utterly ruined, – a few nails, a little glue, a piece of putty, and a pint of varnish will rejuvenate many articles that will grow very old 'twixt morning and night, and undo much of the mischief that comes of moving, and which at first sight seems irreparable.|$|E
