5|$|In December 2016, when World Rugby was {{considering}} {{a change in}} the eligibility rules for international selection, FFR president Bernard Laporte announced that the body <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> all France national team members hold French passports. This requirement is in addition to then-current WR rules mandating three years' residency for international selection, a period which WR increased to five years effective from 31 December 2020. Players who represented France prior to Laporte's announcement remain eligible for selection even if they do not hold French passports.|$|E
5|$|In early November, about 50 players renewed {{talks of}} union {{decertification}} if the union went lower than 52.5% of BRI or agreed to additional restrictions on contracts, salary-cap exceptions, or free agency. Decertifying <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> 30% of the union—about 130 players—sign a petition, allowing an election {{under the auspices}} of the NLRB by all NBPA members to decertify with a simple majority. The NLRB traditionally does not consider a decertification petition while a charge is pending, such as the NBPA's unfair labor practice charges filed in August.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1843, the {{infantry}} led by Colonel Dimitris Kallergis and the respected Revolutionary captain and former President of the Athens City Council General Yiannis Makriyiannis assembled in Palace Square {{in front of}} the Palace in Athens. Eventually joined by much {{of the population of the}} small capital, the rebellion refused to disperse until the King agreed to grant a Constitution, which <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> there be Greeks in the Council, that he convene a permanent National Assembly and that Otto personally thank the leaders of the uprising.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} granted a {{production}} budget of $60 million, with $30 million funded by New Regency. Brett Ratner's RatPac-Dune Entertainment, {{a joint venture between}} Ratner's RatPac Entertainment and 20th Century Fox's former financing partner, Dune Entertainment, also funded the film. Worldview Entertainment, who also co-financed Birdman, was originally set to fund the film but backed out in July 2014 due to the departure of its CEO, Christopher Woodrow. New Regency approached 20th Century Fox for additional funding, but the company declined, citing the pay-or-play contracts made for both DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, which <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> the actors be paid regardless of whether the film is completed. Annapurna Pictures' Megan Ellison entered negotiations to finance the film shortly after. The Chinese company Guangdong Alpha Animation and Culture Company partially financed the film.|$|E
5|$|In early 2000, Croatia and Serbia {{set up a}} {{commission}} tasked with determining the border, but in its first ten years it convened only once or twice. Since 2010, the issue has gained increasing prominence in the disputing countries. Plans for construction of a port in Apatin, {{on a piece of}} territory claimed by Croatia, added fuel to the dispute. After years of inactivity the inter-governmental commission established to identify and determine the border between Croatia and Serbia met in Zagreb in April 2010, only to conclude that there was a difference of opinions on the matter. Later that month, the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) proposed a National Assembly resolution which <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> Serbian officials resolve the dispute in compliance with the Serbian claim. Months later, Radoslav Stojanović, a former legal representative of Serbia and Montenegro in the Bosnian Genocide Case and former ambassador to the Netherlands, likened the dispute to the Croatia–Slovenia border dispute in the Gulf of Piran. Stojanović said that the position held by Croatia in its dispute with Slovenia was favourable for Serbia and warned that Serbia might be in a disadvantageous position if Croatia joined the European Union (EU) before Serbia—which would allow it to impose its conditions to the process of accession of Serbia to the EU.|$|E

25|$|However, as of 2016, the {{conflict}} between these two theories still {{plays a role in}} internal Taiwanese politics.

25|$|Pierce Butler and Charles Pinckney, {{both from}} South Carolina, {{submitted}} this clause to the Constitutional Convention.

This clause was added to the clause that provided extradition for fugitives from justice.|$|E
25|$|Because {{it would}} take a very large amount of heavy water to replace 25% to 50% of a human being's body water (water being in turn 50–75% of body weight) with heavy water, {{accidental}} or intentional poisoning with heavy water is unlikely to the point of practical disregard. Poisoning <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> the victim ingest large amounts of heavy water without significant normal water intake for many days to produce any noticeable toxic effects.|$|E
25|$|It is {{very hard}} to come up with another process that would produce {{deuterium}} other than by nuclear fusion.

25|$|The BP {{oil spill}} in the Gulf of Mexico {{affected}} Florida's number one industry, which is tourism. The lack of a relief well prevented company officials from shutting down the leak immediately.

25|$|A rebel {{during the}} reign of Kamose, Teti son of Pepi, has been {{identified}} by Vandersleyen as the same person as Teti son of Minhotep, by arguing that Pepi is a diminutive of Minhotep. If these two persons were the same person, it <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> the reign of Nubkheperre Intef and Kamose could not be separated by too many years. However, Wolfgang Helck has argued that the frequency of these names is due instead to a large family in the area of Coptos with ties to the Sixth Dynasty, since Teti and Pepy were names of important Sixth Dynasty Pharaohs.|$|E
25|$|The {{shortage}} of the lowest-eccentricity objects predicted in the Nice model {{may indicate that}} the cold population formed in situ. In addition to their differing orbits the hot and cold populations have but differing colors. The cold population is markedly redder than the hot, suggesting it has a different composition and formed in a different region. The cold population also includes {{a large number of}} binary objects with loosely bound orbits that would be unlikely to survive close encounter with Neptune. If the cold population formed at its current location, preserving it <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> Neptune's eccentricity remained small, or that its perihelion precessed rapidly due to a strong interaction between it and Uranus.|$|E
25|$|These output {{energies}} {{are still}} {{less than the}} 422MJ of input energy required to charge the system's capacitors that power the laser amplifiers. The net wall-plug efficiency of NIF (UV laser energy out divided by the energy required to pump the lasers from an external source) is less than one percent, and the total wall-to-fusion efficiency is under 10% at its maximum performance. An economical fusion reactor <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>that</b> the fusion output be at least {{an order of magnitude}} more than this input. Commercial laser fusion systems would use the much more efficient diode-pumped solid state lasers, where wall-plug efficiencies of 10 percent have been demonstrated, and efficiencies 16-18 percent are expected with advanced concepts under development.|$|E
