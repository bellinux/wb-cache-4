5|$|Cylinder <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{specified}} at {{a reference}} temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum safe working temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|E

40|$|Recently compressed-air {{engineering}} work mostly employs pneumatic caisson method {{and tends to}} use higher <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> in accordance with mechanization of shield works. Under the circumstances, the present author totaled results of five years' surveys on development of decompression sickness (DCS) and compared the results with former research findings. For this comparison, the control data was chosen among those which had been comprised by the same procedures as ours (Mano & Shibayama, 1987). It is commonly said that DCS could not be developed under a condition of <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> less than 1. 0 kg/cm^ 2. Although we experienced seven patients with DCS development under 1. 0 kg/cm^ 2 of the pressure, no case was observed in the present survey conducted {{with a total of}} 12, 503 exposures of compressed-air works. Total number of compressed-air works with over 1. 0 kg/cm^ 2 pressures include: 3, 822 more exposures found in 1986 or later than before 1986; 9, 649 more exposures observed in 1985 or former with <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> of 1. 0 - 2. 0 kg/cm^ 2; and, with higher pressures over 2. 0 kg/cm^ 2, the number of the works showed rapid increase in 1986 or later (Table 1). This means that deep excavation works, which need higher <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> than before, are becoming popular for today's compressed-air works. In other words, working circumstances became more strict in these years, therefore, more precise safety supervision should be required. When decompression control is carried out basing on the current decompression table, development rate of DCS increases in line with enlargement of <b>working</b> <b>pressures.</b> This was also observed in the present study. Comparing onset rates of DCS during these five years with those observed before the years, the results of these five years show lower rates, based on the <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> divided by each 1. 0 kg/cm^ 2 group, than those seen before the five years (Table 1). This supposedly indicates that more strict decompression control is carrying out today than before...|$|R
5|$|The {{nominal volume}} of gas stored is {{commonly}} quoted as the cylinder {{capacity in the}} USA. It {{is a measure of}} the volume of gas that can be released from the full cylinder at atmospheric pressure. Terms used for the capacity include 'free gas volume' or 'free gas equivalent'. It depends on the internal volume and the <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> of a cylinder. If the <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> is higher, the cylinder will store more gas for the same volume.|$|E

5|$|A {{hydrostatic}} test involves pressurising the cylinder to its test pressure (usually 5/3 or 3/2 of the <b>working</b> <b>pressure)</b> and measuring its volume {{before and after}} the test.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals that TiO 2 films deposited on unbiased as well as biased substrates are all amorphous.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the resting and <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> associated to a restrain mechanism, in patients suffering from lymphedema of the upper limbs, postbreast cancer treatment, whilst performing occupational and day-to-day self-care activities. Six female patients under treatment of lymphedema due to surgical, radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic treatment of breast cancer, in the age group between 32 and 76 years (mean 54 years old, ± 31. 11) were selected. A compression sleeve of “gorgurão” (cotton-polyester material) was applied as a restrain mechanism. The occupational and daily personal care activities evaluated were those common to all participants. These activities included washingup, cooking in a small pan, sweeping the floor using the affected arm, brushing the teeth, brushing the hair, washing small items of clothes, ironing clothes and making the bed. For statistical analysis, mean and standard deviation between resting pressures and minimum and maximum <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> were determined. The two-tailed student t-test and variance analysis were used for repeated measurements. The Bonferroni limit was used in the analysis of the variables to calculate the alpha error, with a value of 5 %, considered statistically significant. All of the analyzed activities associated to the “gorgurão” compression sleeve generated both resting and <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> (p < 0. 005). In conclusion, the occupational daily life tasks used in the present study generate resting and <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> and can be used as a form of treatment of the lymphedema...|$|R

5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a temperature rise as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but {{the temperature of the}} gas in the cylinder then increases to above ambient as the cylinder fills to the <b>working</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
