500|$|The {{village of}} Abergynolwyn {{was built to}} house the quarrymen of Bryn Eglwys and their families, and to serve the village an incline with winding house was laid three {{quarters}} of the way along the mineral extension. The winding house for the incline stood on the narrow ledge, with the mineral line passing through it. The two-track incline dropped [...] over a distance of [...] At its foot, the line crossed the Nant Gwernol on a girder bridge. Immediately after the bridge, short lines branched off to the east from a wagon turntable to the coal yard and smithy of Pandy Farm and west to a <b>writing</b> <b>slate</b> factory (later a carpenter's yard). The main branch then split to form a storage loop, with a further wagon turntable and a longer branch serving the houses and school to the north east. The main branch continued north, crossing the main road then passing between the two main terraces in the village before ending in a turntable and a final short line connecting to the Capel Jerusalem chapel. The village incline was lifted {{during the early years of}} preservation, to provide much needed rail to replace the existing track. The winding house was demolished in 1968 to allow realignment of the railway to form the extension to Nant Gwernol.|$|E

50|$|There is {{evidence}} of slaves practicing {{how to read and}} write in secrecy. There have been identified slates discovered near George Washington’s estate in Mount Vernon with writings carved in them. Bly noted that on the slave sites owned by Thomas Jefferson there have been “237 unidentified slates, 27 pencil leads, 2 pencil <b>slates,</b> and 18 <b>writing</b> <b>slates</b> were uncovered in houses once occupied by Jefferson's black bond servants.” That shows that slaves were secretly practicing their reading and writing skills when they had time alone, most likely at night. They also believe slaves practiced their letters in the dirt because it was much easier to hide than <b>writing</b> on <b>slates.</b> Slaves then passed on their newly learned skills to others.|$|R

50|$|The exact {{origins of}} the <b>writing</b> <b>slate</b> remain unclear. References to its use {{can be found in}} the fourteenth century and {{evidence}} suggests that it was used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The central time period for the <b>writing</b> <b>slate,</b> however, “appears to begin in the later eighteenth century, when developments in sea and land transport permitted the gradual expansion of slate quarrying in Wales and the growth of a substantial slate workshop industry.” By the nineteenth century, writing slates were used around the world in nearly every school and were a central part of the slate industry. At the dawn of the twentieth century, writing slates were the primary tool in the classroom for students. In the 1930s (or later) writing slates began to be replaced by more modern methods. However, writing slates did not become obsolete. They are still made in the twenty-first century, though in small quantities.|$|E

5000|$|The word [...] "slate" [...] is {{also used}} for certain types of object made from slate rock.

The boy is barefoot, wears a straw hat and is carrying a <b>writing</b> <b>slate</b> and lunch pail. Adams gave the statue to the town to honor and encourage young country boys, like he was at one point was, to value education so they could take their love of nature, community spirit and creative thinking learned in the Ashburnham pioneering woods out into the world.|$|E
50|$|Zainal Abidin {{was born}} on 16 September 1895 in Kampung Bukit Kerdas, Batu Kikir, Jempol {{in the state of}} Negeri Sembilan; the eldest of three children. His mother, Intan Awaluddin (1877-1907) was of Minangkabau descent, while his father Ahmad Ibrahim (1862-1927) was a Buginese from a well-off family in the Riau Islands - the latter being the only literate person in the village. Zainal Abidin however learned to write and read by himself from the age of five, practising his writing on young banana leaves with a twig as the stylus. This caught the {{interest}} of his father, who decided to buy him a <b>writing</b> <b>slate</b> and some chalk. This further motivated Zainal's affinity for writing and helped tuned his writing skills later on.|$|E
50|$|Dixon {{has also}} done {{extensive}} {{work on the}} Donner Party site, continuing the work done by Hardesty in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 2003, in conjunction with researchers from the University of Oregon, a production company affiliated with the Discovery Channel sponsored work there. This resulted in the show Unsolved History: The Donner Party. Her team found numerous artifacts including ceramics, pieces of a lantern, <b>writing</b> <b>slate,</b> mirror fragments, glass from a medicine bottle, and musket balls. She returned {{in the summer of}} 2004 for five weeks to carry an excavation with her colleagues that was funded by various universities, a local foundation, and eventually, for part of the lab analysis, a production company affiliated with the History Channel. Dixon and colleagues were not just concerned with the topic of cannibalism and whether it may have occurred at the Donner Party's Alder Creek camp, but what the individuals living in that camp endured and what, in general, humans do, or how they adapt, when faced desperate circumstances. The combined historical and archaeological evidence indicated that cannibalism did take place but not until the last few weeks. The History Channel aired the thirty-minute segment on the Donner Party in the spring of 2006 as part of a documentary on cannibalism.|$|E
