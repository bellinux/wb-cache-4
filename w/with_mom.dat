Studies investigating mother-infant interaction suggest that infants are exposed to these [...] "display rules" [...] first during face-to-face play <b>with</b> <b>mom.</b> In a study performed by Malatesta and Haviland (1982) researchers found evidence that changes in emotional expression during infancy are greatly influenced by this type of interaction {{and that there were}} differences among infants under 6 months of age based on both gender and family background. This suggests that during infancy these [...] "display rules" [...] are already taking effect.|$|E

2500|$|Stating that [...] "children {{need two}} parents" [...] and that [...] "children have a {{fundamental}} human {{right to an}} opportunity and relationship with both their mother and father", members of the fathers' rights movement call for greater equality in parental responsibility following separation and divorce. They call for laws creating a rebuttable presumption of 50/50 shared custody after divorce or separation, so that children would spend equal time with each parent unless there were reasons against it. They point to studies showing that children in shared custody settings are better adjusted and have fewer social problems such as low academic achievement, crime, pregnancy, substance abuse, depression and suicide, and state that shared parenting is in fact {{in the best interests}} of the child. Warren Farrell states that for children, equally shared parenting with three conditions (the child has about equal time <b>with</b> <b>mom</b> and dad, the parents live close enough to each other that the child does not need to forfeit friends or activities when visiting the other parent, and there is no bad-mouthing) is the second best family arrangement to the intact two-parent family, followed by primary father custody and then primary mother custody, and he adds that if shared parenting cannot be agreed upon, children on average are better off psychologically, socially, academically, and physically, have higher levels of empathy and assertiveness, and lower levels of ADHD, if their father is their primary custodial parent rather than their mother.|$|E
