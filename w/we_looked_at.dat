People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E

500|$|Furst {{and the art}} {{department}} deliberately mixed clashing architectural {{styles to}} [...] "make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable". Furst continued, [...] "e imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going". The 1985 film Brazil by Terry Gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film's production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference. Derek Meddings served as the visual effects supervisor, while Keith Short helped construct the newly created 1989 Batmobile, adding two Browning machine guns. On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, [...] "We looked at jet aircraft components, <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> war machines, <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> all sorts of things. In the end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the Salt Flat Racers of the 30s and the Sting Ray macho machines of the 50s". The car was built upon a Chevrolet Impala when previous development with a Jaguar and Ford Mustang failed.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Los Angeles, California, which doubled for scenes set in a 1950s-era New York City. The Palladium Ballroom, a former New York City concert hall, was recreated {{to serve as a}} centrepiece in the film. [...] In {{describing}} the look of the film, production designer Stuart Wurtzel stated, [...] "There are lots of photographs and some film from that period. ... There's a film called Mambo Madness from 1955 with some footage of Tito Puente and Desi Arnaz <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at,</b> and we got pictures from the Cuban Society in New York and from libraries. The Cuban community has been enormously supportive of the film, so we've also been privy to the private archives of many people." [...] Ann Roth served as the film's costume designer, using vintage textiles to create the custom-made wardrobe. [...] The I Love Lucy segment of the film was filmed at Ren-Mar Studios, the former site of Desilu Productions. The set of the Ricardos' living room was re-created, with film editors intercutting footage with Banderas, Assante and Arnaz, Jr. with an actual episode featuring Lucille Ball." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{designed}} Two-Face's {{appearance in}} the film {{as one of the}} least disturbing, explaining, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> less extreme versions of it, they were too real and more horrifying. When you look at a film like Pirates of the Caribbean– something like that, there's something about a very fanciful, very detailed visual effect, that I think is more powerful and less repulsive." [...] Framestore created 120 computer-generated shots of Two-Face's scarred visage. Nolan felt using make-up would look unrealistic, as it adds to the face, unlike real burn victims. Framestore acknowledged they rearranged the positions of bones, muscles and joints to make the character look more dramatic. For each shot, three 720-pixel HD cameras were set up at different angles on set to fully capture Aaron Eckhart's performance. Eckhart wore markers on his face and a prosthetic skullcap, which acted as a lighting reference. A few shots of the skullcap were kept in the film. Framestore also integrated shots of Bale and Eckhart into that of the exploding building where Dent is burned. It was difficult simulating fire on Eckhart because it is inherently unrealistic for only half of something to burn.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} create the effect of Mulder and Scully [...] "melting", special effects {{producer}} Bill Millar captured video of Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny in three-dimensional high-definition video—the two actors were scanned with a special laser at Glendale, California {{and the results were}} manipulated by a computer. Millar noted that, [...] "when <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> our first test, we realized we couldn't melt Mulder and Scully without some degree of difficulty [...] They had to melt like movie stars [...] without turning Gillian into Margaret Thatcher and David into John Hurt as The Elephant Man". In order to compensate for the difficulties, Millar used a [...] "leading edge" [...] melting effect that melted parts of the actors' faces, keeping their facial features intact until the [...] "goop" [...] overtook them. For other shots, Anderson and Duchovny had to endure hours of being covered by a vegetable-derived food thickener with yellow food coloring that stood in for the fungal secretion. In addition, Anderson and Duchovny were literally buried under the earth for the final scene: large pits were dug and scaffolding was constructed inside of them. The two actors then wore wet suits and were covered in the vegetable fluid and soil.|$|E

500|$|After two weeks, Worsley {{began to}} worry about the lack of {{sightings}} and advised Shackleton he could not calculate their position to less than [...] accuracy. As a result, Shackleton opted to aim for the western side of South Georgia which meant, given the prevailing winds, that if they missed their target they would be carried onto the east coast of the island. The following day, they began to observe drifting seaweed and seabirds circulating overhead, indicating the presence of land ahead. On 8 May, through mists and squalls, the crew sighted South Georgia's Cape Demidov, precisely in line with the course calculated by Worsley. He saw a [...] "...towering black crag, with a lacework of snow around its flanks. One glimpse, and it was hidden again. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> each other with cheerful, foolish grins." [...] Sea and wind conditions were such that they were unable to {{make their way to the}} Norwegian whaling stations, some [...] away, on the east coast; instead they made for King Haakon Bay. Now out of drinking water, they were forced by the high seas to approach the rocky coast with care and heave to for the night. A gale blew strongly the following day and despite their best efforts, they stayed offshore for a further night. Conditions were much better on 10 May and after adverse winds caused failure of his first few attempts, Worsley carefully sailed the James Caird through a rocky reef guarding King Haakon Bay and onto the beach.|$|E
500|$|As {{reported}} by The Korea Times, {{the thought of}} Gothel being a villain who is both a [...] "greedy, selfish woman and a mother figure to Rapunzel" [...] was initially [...] "perplexing" [...] for animator Jin Kim, and it wasn't until after Kim heard Gothel's [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] {{for the first time}} that he [...] "came up with the 1940s Hollywood screen siren motif" [...] for the character. The directors also strived to make it obvious that Mother Gothel and Rapunzel are not related. Greno told Animation World Network, [...] "When they're standing together, it is very clear that this is not a mother and daughter, just by the frames of their bodies, their hair, the pigments of their skin," [...] as opposed to when Rapunzel is in close proximity with her true parents, the King and Queen. Howard added that, in comparison to Rapunzel, [...] "Gothel is very tall and curvy, she’s very voluptuous, she’s got this very exotic look to her. Even down to that curly hair, we’re trying to say visually that this is not this girl’s mother." [...] The animators studied footage of Murphy in order to get [...] "ideas about facial expressions" [...] and [...] "gestures." [...] After much speculation, the directors finally admitted that, in addition to Murphy, Gothel's physical appearance was in fact influenced by American singer Cher. Howard explained that this was [...] "because Cher is very exotic and Gothic looking," [...] continuing that the singer [...] "definitely was one of the people <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> visually, as far as what gives you a striking character." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{moved to}} the United Kingdom and shot in a converted airship hangar in Cardington, Bedfordshire, north of London. There, the hotel bar set which tilted 30 degrees was built. A hotel corridor was also constructed by Guy Hendrix Dyas, the production designer, Chris Corbould, the special effects supervisor, and Wally Pfister, the director of photography; it rotated a full 360degrees to create the effect of alternate directions of gravity for scenes set during the second level of dreaming, where dream-sector physics become chaotic. The idea {{was inspired by a}} technique used in Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968). Nolan said, [...] "I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario". The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40ft (12m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length grew to 100ft (30m). The corridor was suspended along eight large concentric rings that were spaced equidistantly outside its walls and powered by two massive electric motors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Arthur, spent several weeks learning to fight in a corridor that spun like [...] "a giant hamster wheel". Nolan said of the device, [...] "It was like some incredible torture device; we thrashed Joseph for weeks, but in the end <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the footage, and it looks unlike anything any of us has seen before. The rhythm of it is unique, and when you watch it, even if you know how it was done, it confuses your perceptions. It's unsettling in a wonderful way". Gordon-Levitt remembered, [...] "it was six-day weeks of just, like, coming home at night battered ... The light fixtures on the ceiling are coming around on the floor, and you have to choose the right time to cross through them, and if you don't, you're going to fall." [...] On July15,2009, filming took place at University College London for the sequences occurring inside a Paris college of architecture in the story, including the library, Flaxman Gallery and Gustav Tuck Theatre.|$|E

500|$|The Herald Tribune began {{a decline}} shortly after World War II that had several causes. [...] The Reid family was long {{accustomed}} to resolve shortfalls {{at the newspaper}} with subsidies from their fortune, rather than improved business practices, seeing the paper [...] "as a hereditary possession to be sustained as a public duty rather than developed as a profit-making opportunity". [...] With its generally marginal profitability, the Herald Tribune had few opportunities to reinvest in its operations as the Times did, and the Reids' mortgage on the newspaper {{made it difficult to}} raise outside cash for needed capital improvements. After another profitable year in 1946, Bill Robinson, the Herald Tribunes business manager, decided to reinvest the profits to make needed upgrades to the newspaper's pressroom. [...] The investment squeezed the paper's resources, and Robinson decided {{to make up the difference}} at the end of the year by raising the Tribunes price from three cents to a nickel, expecting the Times, which also needed to upgrade its facilities, to do the same. [...] However, the Times, concerned by the Tribunes performance during the war, refused to go along. [...] "We didn't want to give them any quarter," [...] Times circulation manager Nathan Goldstein said. [...] "Our numbers were on the rise, and we didn't want to do anything to jeopardize them. 'No free rides for the competition' was the way <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it." [...] The move proved disastrous: In 1947, the Tribunes daily circulation fell nine percent, from 348,626 to 319,867. [...] Its Sunday circulation fell four percent, from 708,754 to 680,691. [...] Although the overall percentage of advertising for the paper was higher than it was in 1947, the Times was still higher: 58 percent of the average space in the New York Times in 1947 was devoted to advertising, versus a little over 50 percent of the Tribune.
