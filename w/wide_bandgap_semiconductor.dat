40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} non-contact spectroscopic methods and apparatus for performing chemical analysis and the ideal wavelengths and sources needed for this analysis. It employs deep ultraviolet (200 - to 300 -nm spectral range) electron-beam-pumped <b>wide</b> <b>bandgap</b> <b>semiconductor</b> lasers, incoherent <b>wide</b> <b>bandgap</b> <b>semiconductor</b> lightemitting devices, and hollow cathode metal ion lasers. Three achieved goals for this innovation are {{to reduce the}} size (under 20 L), reduce the weight [under 100 lb (. 45 kg) ], and reduce the power consumption (under 100 W). This method can be used in microscope or macroscope to provide measurement of Raman and/or native fluorescence emission spectra either by point-by-point measurement, or by global imaging of emissions within specific ultraviolet spectral bands. In other embodiments, the method can be used in analytical instruments such as capillary electrophoresis, capillary electro-chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, flow cytometry, and related instruments for detection and identification of unknown analytes using a combination of native fluorescence and/or Raman spectroscopic methods. This design provides an electron-beampumped semiconductor radiation-producing method, or source, that can emit at a wavelength (or wavelengths) below 300 nm, e. g. in the deep ultraviolet between about 200 and 300 nm, and more preferably less than 260 nm. In some variations, the method is to produce incoherent radiation, while in other implementations it produces laser radiation. In some variations, this object is achieved by using an AlGaN emission medium, while in other implementations a diamond emission medium may be used. This instrument irradiates a sample with deep UV radiation, and then uses an improved filter for separating wavelengths to be detected. This provides a multi-stage analysis of the sample. To avoid the difficulties related to producing deep UV semiconductor sources, a pumping approach has been developed that uses ballistic electron beam injection directly into the active region of a <b>wide</b> <b>bandgap</b> <b>semiconductor</b> material...|$|E

50|$|High {{effective}} {{masses of}} charge carriers {{are a result}} of low band curvatures, which correspond to low mobility.

50|$|At high {{electric}} fields, drift velocity saturates due to scattering from optical phonons. A higher optical phonon energy results in fewer optical phonons {{at a particular}} temperature, and there are therefore fewer scattering centers, and electrons in <b>wide</b> <b>bandgap</b> <b>semiconductors</b> can achieve high peak velocities.|$|R
