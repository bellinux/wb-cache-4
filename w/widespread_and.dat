5|$|American crows are common, <b>widespread,</b> <b>and</b> {{susceptible}} to the West Nile virus, making them useful as a bioindicator to track the virus's spread. Direct transmission of the virus from American crows to humans is unheard of and unlikely.|$|E

5|$|Active {{during the}} night, Transandinomys talamancae {{lives on the}} ground and eats plants and insects. Males move more and have larger home ranges than females. It breeds {{throughout}} the year, but few individuals survive for more than a year. After a gestation period of about 28 days, two to five young are born, which reach sexual maturity within two months. A variety of parasites occur on this species. <b>Widespread</b> <b>and</b> common, it is of no conservation concern.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} and parasitism, and changes in agricultural practices have caused local population declines, this <b>widespread</b> <b>and</b> abundant species is not threatened globally. Climate change may present a long-term threat, by shifting the necessary Alpine habitat to higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|American crows are {{protected}} internationally by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Despite attempts by humans {{in some areas}} to drive away or eliminate these birds, they remain <b>widespread</b> <b>and</b> very common. The number of individual American crows is estimated by BirdLife International to be around 31,000,000. The large population, {{as well as its}} vast range, are the reasons why the American crow is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not threatened.|$|E

50|$|The IUCN Red List {{lists the}} species as Least Concern. Because of their dense <b>and</b> <b>widespread</b> {{population}} <b>and</b> their adaptability to pasturelands and rural gardens, their prognosis {{is a positive}} one.|$|R
5|$|Another <b>widespread</b> <b>and</b> popular dish is moussaka, a baked dish of {{aubergine}} or potato {{with various}} other ingredients: often minced meat and tomatoes, sometimes {{a layer of}} egg custard or béchamel sauce on top. In its Greek variant, well-known outside the region, it includes layers of aubergine and minced meat with custard or béchamel sauce on top, but that version is a relatively recent innovation, introduced by the chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|C. b. macrorhynchus, {{given the}} name great-billed {{cockatoo}} by Mathews, is found across northern Australia. Although {{thought to be}} <b>widespread</b> <b>and</b> abundant, this subspecies has been little studied. It is also large and has a large beak, as its subspecific name implies. Females lack red colouration in their tails.|$|E
5|$|Cambodia has no proven {{fossil fuel}} reserves, and is almost {{completely}} dependent on imported diesel fuel for electricity production. Consequently, Cambodians face an insecure supply and pay {{some of the}} highest energy prices in the world. The impacts of this are <b>widespread</b> <b>and</b> may hinder economic development.|$|E

5|$|Handkea utriformis is <b>widespread,</b> <b>and</b> {{frequent}} {{in northern}} temperate zones. It {{is found in}} Europe, continental Asia, Japan, eastern atlantic North America, Mexico, and South Africa. It has also been collected in Chile, and New Zealand. Growing alone or in small groups, it favors sandy open pastures, or heaths, and is often found in coastal regions. It typically fruits in summer through late autumn (July - November in the UK).|$|E

5|$|In Singapore, {{ensuring}} <b>widespread</b> <b>and</b> {{equal access}} to justice for Singapore citizens is a constant goal. In this respect, the judiciary takes effort to ensure that both procedural and substantive elements {{of the rule of}} law are fulfilled – firstly, by continually increasing the efficiency of the courts and legal processes, and secondly, by regularly improving the skills, knowledge and values of and judges.|$|E

5|$|In the mid 16th-century Russians adopted {{printing}} from Central Europe, with Ivan Fyodorov {{being the}} first known Russian printer. In the 17th century printing became <b>widespread,</b> <b>and</b> woodcuts became especially popular.

5|$|Initially, Ma-on posed {{a slight}} {{threat to the}} Mariana Islands and {{prompted}} the issuance of tropical storm warnings. However, the system remained {{far away from the}} area and only produced scattered rainfall. In Japan, hundreds of people evacuated from mudslide-prone areas. Torrential rains produced by the storm, estimated at more than 1,200mm (48in), led to <b>widespread</b> <b>and</b> damaging floods. Five people perished as a result of Ma-on, and damage reached ¥3.9billion (2011JPY, $50million 2011USD).|$|E
5|$|Many {{tropical}} {{tree species}} have seeds that are dispersed by ants. Seed dispersal by ants or myrmecochory is <b>widespread</b> <b>and</b> new estimates suggest that nearly 9% of all plant species may have such ant associations. Some plants in fire-prone grassland systems are particularly dependent on ants for their survival and dispersal as the seeds are transported to safety below the ground. Many ant-dispersed seeds have special external structures, elaiosomes, that are sought after by ants as food.|$|E

5|$|The fungus is <b>widespread</b> <b>and</b> {{common in}} its {{preferred}} habitats in North America, Europe, and northern Asia.

5|$|The oceans {{may have}} become more hospitable to life over the last 500million years and less {{vulnerable}} to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen became more <b>widespread</b> <b>and</b> penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events; marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains {{were less likely to}} be disrupted.|$|E
