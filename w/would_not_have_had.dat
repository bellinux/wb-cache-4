5|$|In 1987, after Laliberté re-privatized Cirque du Soleil, it {{was invited}} to perform at the Los Angeles Arts Festival. Although they {{continued}} to be plagued by financial difficulties, Normand Latourelle took the gamble and went to Los Angeles, despite only having enough money to make a one-way trip. Had the show been a failure, the company <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> enough money to get their performers and equipment back to Montreal.|$|E
5|$|This {{decision}} {{may cause}} regret in some men and women. Of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation, about 5% regret their decision, {{as compared with}} 20% of women aged under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage. In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> children if {{they were able to}} do it over again.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 was {{initially}} expected to work {{only through the}} Saturn encounter. When the spacecraft passed the planet in 1980, Sagan proposed {{the idea of the}} space probe taking one last picture of Earth. He pointed out that such a picture <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for Voyagers cameras to make out any detail, {{but it could have been}} meaningful nevertheless as a perspective on our place in the universe.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to hockey, Iginla played baseball {{as a young}} man and was the catcher on the Canadian national junior team. He credits his grandfather for his hockey career, as with his mother working and father attending law school, he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the opportunity to play sports at a high level if not for his grandfather's support. Iginla grew up admiring other black hockey players, including Edmonton Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr. Emulating Fuhr, Iginla played goaltender in his first two years of organized hockey before switching to the right wing. He played his entire minor hockey career in St. Albert, leading the Alberta Midget Hockey League in scoring as a 15-year-old with 87points for the St. Albert Midget Raiders in 1992–93.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} final {{contract}} with delle Croci was in 1516 whereas Cairano was definitively dead in 1517: if Cairano indeed worked on the monument, it can be deduced from the documents that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> sufficient time to finish it completely within the period, and consequently {{a large part of}} it must have been done before this date. This means admitting Cairano's involvement prior to 1516, which is not attested in the documents. Indeed, the same contract of 1516 asserts that the work was incomplete when installed in the church; it is unknown what its condition was at the time; and the remains of Bernardino Martinengo were already housed in it from the previous year. The implication is that the progress on the monument may have been near completion, at least in the structure and architectural components. The incompleteness alluded to in the documents of 1516 likely refer to the decorative inserts of various types, including the bronzes definitively due to della Croci.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore Sun runs {{a front-page}} story accusing the {{homicide}} unit of fumbling the investigation and protecting the Wilsons based on their race. Under pressure form his superiors, Gee demands they solve the murder immediately. Pembleton admits privately to his wife Mary (Ami Brabson) that he let his personal feelings of respect for Felix Wilson {{get in the way}} of the investigation; he agrees to make them a central part of the investigation. After searching the Wilson house, the detectives find love letters written by Hal Wilson to Brierre. Pembleton questions Felix and Hal, who agree to talk only if their statements are not admissible in court. Pembleton confronts the Wilsons with the love letters, which Hal said he never had the courage to give to Brierre. Felix said he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> sex with Brierre if he had known, which Hal said he does not believe. Felix demands the truth from Hal, who admits to killing Brierre in a jealous rage upon learning of her affair with his father.|$|E

5|$|The main armour {{used was}} chainmail hauberks, usually knee-length, with slits to allow riding, some with sleeves to the elbows. Some hauberks {{may have been}} made of scales {{attached}} to a tunic, with the scales made of metal, horn or hardened leather. Headgear was usually a conical metal helmet with a band of metal extending down to protect the nose. Horsemen and infantry carried shields. The infantryman's shield was usually round and made of wood, with reinforcement of metal. Horsemen had changed to a kite-shaped shield and were usually armed with a lance. The couched lance, carried tucked against the body under the right arm, was a relatively new refinement and was probably not used at Hastings; the terrain was unfavourable for long cavalry charges. Both the infantry and cavalry usually fought with a straight sword, long and double-edged. The infantry could also use javelins and long spears. Some of the cavalry may have used a mace instead of a sword. Archers would have used a self bow or a crossbow, and most <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> armour.|$|E

25|$|In Grenville's opinion, had Beneš {{held his}} line, the Communists {{would not have}} been able to form a government.

The non-Communists saw this as a moment of opportunity, needing to act quickly before the Communists had total control over the police and threatened the electoral process.|$|E

25|$|In August 1950, Sir Arthur Young, Unionist MP for the Scotstoun {{division}} in the north-west of Glasgow, died. Hutchison was selected to follow him in defending a majority of 239. After a close contest, Hutchison held the seat with an increased majority of 1,319. He pitched back into partisan debate, arguing at the 1951 budget that the Government <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to increase income tax {{if it had been}} able to collect all the taxes which were due. He later insisted that enterprise and commercial courage were threatened by the budget.|$|E
25|$|MMT proponents such as Warren Mosler {{argue that}} trade deficits {{need not be}} {{unsustainable}} and are beneficial to {{the standard of living}} in the short run. Imports are an economic benefit to the importing nation because they provide the nation with real goods it can consume, that it otherwise <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had.</b> Exports, on the other hand, are an economic cost to the exporting nation because it is losing real goods that it could have consumed. Currency transferred to foreign ownership, however represents a future claim over goods of that nation.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the current}} Laws, a captain may forfeit either of his side's innings. A {{forfeited}} innings shall {{be considered as}} a completed innings. Usually this happens in shorter competitive two-innings matches, where captains need to agree with each other how to set up the match so that there is a reasonable chance of a result. Winning a game gains a team considerably more points than drawing it, so captains are often willing to risk giving the opposition an opportunity to win that they otherwise <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{as long as they are}} getting a similar opportunity in return.|$|E

25|$|Beeching's {{secondment}} from ICI ended {{early in}} June 1965 after Harold Wilson's {{attempt to get}} him to produce a transport plan failed. It is a matter of debate whether Beeching left by mutual arrangement with the government or if he was sacked. Frank Cousins, the Labour Minister of Technology, told the House of Commons in November 1965 that Beeching had been dismissed by Tom Fraser. Beeching denied this, pointing out that he had returned early to ICI as he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> enough time to undertake an in-depth transport study before the formal end of his secondment.|$|E
25|$|The inquisition put {{to death}} many of the New Christians, and expropriated the {{property}} and wealth of many others. The riches of even some Old Christian merchants were expropriated after false anonymous complaints were made that the inquisitors accepted as valid, since {{the property of the}} condemned reverted to themselves. On the other hand, few merchants <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> some New Christian ancestry, as marriages between the children of Christian and Jewish partners in the major firms were commonplace. The Inquisition thus became an instrument of social control {{in the hands of the}} Old Christians against almost all the Lisbon merchants, and finally restored their long lost supremacy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} Roman Empire, the Roman {{infantry}} came {{to use a}} differently-shaped javelin from the earlier pilum. This javelin was lighter and had a greater range. Called a plumbata, it resembled a thick stocky arrow, fletched with leather vanes to provide stability and rotation in flight (which increased accuracy). To overcome its comparatively small mass, the plumbata was fitted with an oval-shaped lead weight socketed around the shaft just forward {{of the center of}} balance, giving the weapon its name. Even so, plumbatae were much lighter than pila, and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the armour penetration or shield transfixing capabilities of their earlier counterparts.|$|E
