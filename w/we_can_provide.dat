The two Indian nanosatellites, {{designated}} INS-1A and INS-1B, each carried two payloads from ISRO's Space Applications Centre and the Laboratory for Electro-Optics Systems. INS-1A carried a Surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function Radiometer (SBR) and a Single Event Upset Monitor (SEUM). INS-1B carried an Earth Exosphere Lyman-Alpha Analyzer (EELA) and Origami Camera as payloads. They weigh [...] and [...] respectively {{and have been}} designed with a mission life of six months. An ISRO official said: [...] "The nano satellites are an experimental class of satellites introduced by ISRO because there are requests from academic institutions to use them for data collection. The universities {{do not have the}} knowledge to build satellites and tend to take a long time… We want them to focus on the instruments as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> the nano satellite bus." ...|$|E

[...] "The US is in touch with the Government of India to discuss ways that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> any assistance at this difficult time. Certainly, India is a very developed government with its own domestic services or capabilities to provide emergency assistance. That said, it’s something we normally do especially in the cases of strong partners like India, where we offer whatever assistance we can in the aftermath of natural disasters."

An apology for slavery would be appropriate but not particularly helpful in improving the lives of African Americans, he said. Reparations could also be a distraction, Obama said.
