25|$|Often, Vysotsky would {{neglect to}} check the tuning of his guitar, which is {{particularly}} noticeable on earlier recordings. According to some accounts, Vysotsky would get upset when friends would attempt to tune his guitar, leading some {{to believe that he}} preferred to play slightly out of tune as a stylistic choice. Much of this is also attributable to the fact that a guitar that is tuned down more than 1 <b>whole</b> <b>step</b> (Vysotsky would sometimes tune as much as 2 and a half steps down) is prone to intonation problems.|$|E
25|$|Another memory aid {{notes that}} {{intervals}} {{of the major}} scale follow the same pattern as do Jewish leap years, with do corresponding to year 19 (or 0): a <b>whole</b> <b>step</b> in the scale corresponds to two common years between consecutive leap years, and a half step to one common year between two leap years. This connection with the major scale is more plain {{in the context of}} 19 equal temperament: counting the tonic as 0, the notes of the major scale in 19 equal temperament are numbers 0 (or 19), 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, the same numbers as the leap years in the Hebrew calendar.|$|E
25|$|However, {{beginning}} in the 13th century cadences begin to require motion in one voice by half step {{and the other a}} <b>whole</b> <b>step</b> in contrary motion. These cadences would become a fundamental part of the musical language, even {{to the point where the}} usual accidental accompanying the minor second in a cadence was often omitted from the written score (a practice known as musica ficta). By the 16th century, the semitone had become a more versatile interval, sometimes even appearing as an augmented unison in very chromatic passages. Semantically, in the 16th century the repeated melodic semitone became associated with weeping, see: passus duriusculus, lament bass, and pianto.|$|E
5000|$|In {{western music}} theory, a {{diatonic}} scale is a heptatonic scale that includes five <b>whole</b> <b>steps</b> (<b>whole</b> tones) and two half steps (semitones) in each octave, {{in which the}} two half steps are separated from each other by either two or three <b>whole</b> <b>steps,</b> depending on their position in the scale. This pattern ensures that, in a diatonic scale spanning more than one octave, all the half steps are maximally separated from each other (i.e. separated by at least two <b>whole</b> <b>steps).</b> The word [...] "diatonic" [...] comes from the Greek , meaning progressing through tones.|$|R

25|$|Native American {{music in}} North America {{is almost entirely}} monophonic, but there are notable exceptions. Traditional Native American music often centers around drumming. Rattles, clappersticks, and rasps were also popular percussive instruments. Flutes were made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends {{on the length of}} the wood used and the hand span of the {{intended}} player, but the finger holes are most often around a <b>whole</b> <b>step</b> apart and, at least in Northern California, a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step. The Apache fiddle is a single stringed instrument.|$|E
25|$|The tonic key of {{the song}} is F major (although, since McCartney tuned his guitar down a <b>whole</b> <b>step,</b> he was playing the chords {{as if it were}} in G), where the song begins before veering off into the key of D minor. It is this {{frequent}} use of the minor, and the ii-V7 chord progression (Em and A7 chords in this case) leading into it, that gives the song its melancholy aura. The A7 chord {{is an example of a}} secondary dominant, specifically a V/vi chord. The G7 chord in the bridge is another secondary dominant, in this case a V/V chord, but rather than resolve it to the expected chord, as with the A7 to Dm in the verse, McCartney instead follows it with the IV chord, a B. This motion creates a descending chromatic line of C–B–B–A to accompany the title lyric.|$|E
25|$|The South Court {{is a large}} court {{between the}} South Tomb and the pyramid. Within the court are curved stones thought to be {{territorial}} markers associated with the Heb-sed festival, an important ritual completed by Egyptian kings (typically after 30 years on the throne) to renew their powers. These would have allowed Djoser to claim control over all of Egypt, while its presence in the funerary complex would allow Djoser to continue {{to benefit from the}} ritual in the afterlife. At {{the southern end of the}} court was a platform approached by steps. It has been suggested that this was a platform for the double throne. This fits into the theory proposed by Barry Kemp, and generally accepted by many, that suggests the <b>whole</b> <b>step</b> pyramid complex symbolizes the royal palace enclosure and allows the king to eternally perform the rituals associated with kingship. At the very south of the South Court lay the South Tomb.|$|E
5000|$|The shorter tines sound {{higher in}} pitch. This means that any {{ascending}} scale travels {{away from the}} player {{toward the back of}} the instrument. An ascending major scale is played by playing a [...] "three-four" [...] pattern: do-re-mi, fa-sol-la-ti, do-re-mi, etc., going higher and higher until you run out of notes. The visual/tactile sensation of playing a group of three notes followed by a group of four notes results from the nature of the major scale: two <b>whole</b> <b>steps,</b> followed by a half step, followed by three more <b>whole</b> <b>steps,</b> and ending with one more half step to get back to [...] "do". The minor scale and the five other musical modes work much the same way, as does the major pentatonic scale and its [...] "modes".|$|R
5000|$|C tuning {{is a type}} of guitar tuning. The {{strings of}} the guitar are tuned two <b>whole</b> <b>steps</b> lower than {{standard}} tuning.

50|$|A tritone {{substitution}} is {{the substitution}} of one dominant seventh chord (possibly altered or extended) with another that is three <b>whole</b> <b>steps</b> (a tritone) from the original chord. In other words, tritone substitution involves replacing V7 with II7 (which could also be called V7/V, subV7, or V7/V). For example, D7 is the tritone substitution for G7.|$|R
25|$|The tuning chiefly {{employed}} on the Portuguese guitar was historically called afinação do fado or afinação do fado corrido. It {{was probably}} {{developed in the}} early 19th century, as it was already largely adopted by Lisbon's fadistas by the mid-century. With the diminishing use of the natural tuning (see below) by players, this tuning came to simply be called either afinação de Lisboa, when tuned high, in D, or afinação de Coimbra, when tuned low, in C; this {{stems from the fact}} that while most Lisbon fado players tuned their guitars in D, in Coimbra the students came to tune theirs in C as standard practice, mainly through the influence of Artur Paredes. It is important to note, however, that regardless of the difference in pitch between the two variations of the tuning, in practice, the latter still makes use of the former's aural conventions, as such a C is called D, a D is called E, etc., by the players (essentially making a Coimbra-tuned Portuguese guitar a transposing instrument similar to a B-flat trumpet in that a given note is referred to by the note name a <b>whole</b> <b>step</b> higher than the note name that concert-pitch conventions would use).|$|E
500|$|Townsend mainly uses Open C tuning {{for both}} six and seven string guitar. He now also uses Open B tuning and Open B flat tuning (Open C tuning tuned {{a half and}} a <b>whole</b> <b>step</b> down respectively) on his six string guitars. Townsend's {{technique}} varies from fingerpicking, power chords and polychords to sweep-picked arpeggios and tapping techniques. He is also known for his heavy use of reverb and delay effects. He has expressed {{that he has no}} taste for shred guitar, saying that [...] "Musically it doesn't do anything for me" [...] and that he only solos when he thinks that he can {{within the context of the}} song.|$|E
500|$|Much of the album's {{sound was}} {{conceived}} by John Cale, who stressed the experimental {{qualities of the}} band. Cale, who was influenced greatly by his work with La Monte Young, John Cage and the early Fluxus movement, encouraged the use of alternative ways of producing sound in music. Cale thought his sensibilities meshed well with Lou Reed's, who was already experimenting with alternative tunings. For instance, Reed had [...] "invented" [...] the ostrich guitar tuning for a song he wrote called [...] "The Ostrich" [...] for the short-lived band the Primitives. Ostrich guitar tuning consists of all strings being tuned to the same note. The method was utilized on songs [...] "Venus in Furs" [...] and [...] "All Tomorrow's Parties". Often, the guitars were also tuned down a <b>whole</b> <b>step,</b> which produced a lower, fuller sound that Cale considered [...] "sexy".|$|E

500|$|All guitars on {{the album}} were tuned down a {{half-step}} in order to [...] "make the music a little lower", according to Corgan. On some songs, like [...] "Jellybelly", the first string was tuned down an additional <b>whole</b> <b>step</b> to C (referred to by Corgan as [...] "the 'grunge tuning'"). There was a greater variety {{to the number of}} guitar overdubs utilized than on previous albums. Iha said, [...] "n the past, everything had to be overdubbed and layered—guitar overkill. That wasn't really the train of thought this time, although we did that too." [...] "To Forgive" [...] consists of only one live guitar take, while [...] "Thru the Eyes of Ruby" [...] contains approximately 70guitar tracks. The various sections of [...] "Porcelina of the Vast Oceans" [...] were recorded at various times, with different instruments and recording setups, and were digitally composited in Pro Tools.

500|$|The {{recording}} {{took place}} in Hollywood, California, and was produced by Black & White's Ralph Bass. [...] "Stormy Monday" [...] was performed in a [...] "club combo" [...] or West Coast-blues style with a small back-up band.

[...] A key feature of the song's instrumentation is Walker's prominent guitar parts, including the extensive use of ninth chords, which gives the song its distinctive sound. [...] Author Aaron Stang explained: [...] "The real sound of this riff is based on starting each 9th chord a <b>whole</b> <b>step</b> (2 frets) above and sliding down.

500|$|The refrain (0:25) {{begins in}} the newly tonicized {{relative}} major G, which suggests III. Providing a backdrop to the Electro-Theremin is a cello and string bass playing a bowed tremolo triplet, a feature that was an exceedingly rare effect in pop music. The Fender bass is steady at one note per beat while tom drums and tambourine provide a backbeat. This time, the rhythm is stable, and is split into four 4-bar sections which gradually build its vocals. The first section consists of only the couplet [...] "I'm picking up good vibrations/she's giving me the excitation" [...] sung by Mike Love in his bass register; the second repeats the lines and adds an [...] "ooo bop bop" [...] figure, sung in multiple-part harmony; the third time also adds a [...] "good, good, good, good vibrations" [...] in yet a higher harmony. This type of polyphony (counterpoint) is also rare in contemporary popular styles. [...] Each repeat of the vocal lines also transposes up by a <b>whole</b> <b>step,</b> ascending from G to A and then B. It then returns to the verse, thus making a perfect cadence back into E minor. [...] The verse and chorus then repeat without any changes to the patterns of its instrumentation and harmony. This is unusual, in that normally, a song's arrangement adds something once it reaches the second verse.|$|E

2500|$|A dropped tuning {{starts with}} {{standard}} tuning and typically lowers the pitch ("drops") {{of only a}} single string, or (rarely) two strings. [...] This is almost always the lowest pitched (E) string on the guitar, although occasionally the A string may be lowered. [...] The Drop D tuning, for example, is common in classical guitar [...] and heavy metal music. [...] For it, the low E string is tuned down one <b>whole</b> <b>step,</b> to a low D, {{and the rest of}} the guitar remains in standard tuning. This creates an 'open power chord' (three-note fifth) with the low three strings (DAD). Many heavy rock guitarists have adopted a [...] "Low C" [...] tuning by either dropping the low string 2 whole steps to a C, or a Drop D tuning another <b>whole</b> <b>step</b> down across all strings.

2500|$|Valves {{are used}} to change the length of tubing of a brass {{instrument}} allowing the player to reach the notes of various harmonic series. Each valve pressed diverts the air stream through additional tubing, individually or {{in conjunction with other}} valves. This lengthens the vibrating air column thus lowering the fundamental tone and associated harmonic series produced by the instrument. Designs exist, although rare, in which this behaviour is reversed, i.e., pressing a valve removes a length of tubing rather than adding one. [...] One modern example of such an ascending valve is the Yamaha YSL-350C trombone, in which the extra valve tubing is normally engaged to pitch the instrument in , and pressing the thumb lever removes a <b>whole</b> <b>step</b> to pitch the instrument in C.

2500|$|In Indian {{classical}} music and Indian light music, the violin {{is likely to}} be tuned to D–A–D–A in the South Indian style. As there is no concept of absolute pitch in Indian {{classical music}}, any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used. Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is B–F–B–F, which corresponds to Sa–Pa–Sa–Pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style. In the North Indian Hindustani style, the tuning is usually Pa-Sa-Pa-Sa instead of Sa–Pa–Sa–Pa. This could correspond to F–B–F–B, for instance.
