5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, while much has improved, many would argue that there is still much to be done. From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, <b>women</b> <b>now</b> have a stronger voice, but are only too aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|O'Leary was {{referring}} to the Lavender Menace, a description by second wave feminist Betty Friedan for attempts by members of the National Organization for <b>Women</b> (<b>NOW)</b> to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, Rita Mae Brown and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Susan {{encourages}} her elderly neighbor Roy (Orson Bean) {{to propose}} {{to his girlfriend}} Karen (Kathryn Joosten), and he does so after Karen indicates {{she wants to get}} married. Later, however, Roy laments to Susan about being put in the situation, and fears he will start lusting after other <b>women</b> <b>now</b> that he is engaged. Later, Karen learns she may have lung cancer. Roy tells Susan he is marrying Karen because he now realizes {{he does not want to}} lose Karen, and is sure she will beat the cancer.|$|E

5|$|In the U.S., the National Organization for <b>Women</b> (<b>NOW)</b> {{began in}} 1966 to seek women's equality, {{including}} through the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), {{which did not}} pass, although some states enacted their own. Reproductive rights in the U.S. centred on the court decision in Roe v. Wade enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable birth control, allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under Margaret Sanger and elsewhere under Marie Stopes. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through birth control, which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Washington {{endorsed}} 18 incumbent aldermen and 5 challengers, including Shiller. Washington {{appeared at}} a joint rally with Shiller at which she announced her candidacy. Kaszak {{was endorsed by}} the Chicago Sun-Times, the Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization (IVI-IPO), the National Organization for <b>Women</b> (<b>NOW),</b> the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), and former aldermen William Singer and Dick Simpson. The Chicago Tribune endorsed Orbach. Shiller charged that Orbach catered to developers, displacing people {{in the wake of}} rehabilitation that priced housing {{out of the reach of}} many, and said she wanted community zoning boards, with their decisions binding on the alderman. Shiller charged that most of Orbach's campaign war chest was from developers and regular Democrats outside the ward.|$|E
5|$|This {{concept of}} the double burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after {{a full day of}} work. Latin American <b>women,</b> <b>now</b> entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E

There also are all-women rodeos where women compete in bronc riding, bull riding and all other traditional rodeo events. However, in open rodeos, cowgirls primarily compete in the timed riding events such as barrel racing, and most professional rodeos do not offer as many women's events as men's events.|$|E

In 1974, Goltz was expelled from the Columbus, Ohio, chapter of the National Organization for <b>Women</b> (<b>NOW)</b> for arguing that abortion violated feminist principles, although she and Callaghan were not expelled from national NOW membership.|$|E

25|$|The Hindu {{personal}} laws of 1956 (applying to Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains) gave women {{rights to}} inheritances. However, sons had an independent {{share in the}} ancestral property, while the daughters' shares {{were based on the}} share received by their father. Hence, a father could effectively disinherit a daughter by renouncing his share of the ancestral property, but a son would continue to have a share in his own right. Additionally, married daughters, even those facing marital harassment, had no residential rights in the ancestral home. Thanks to amendment of the Hindu laws in 2005, <b>women</b> <b>now</b> have the same status as men.|$|E
25|$|Society in Willow Bunch {{has changed}} {{dramatically}} over time. The school is closed down so children have to attend school in Coronach and Assiniboia. Graduation rates are higher because girls have fewer duties at home and attending school is free. Most <b>women</b> <b>now</b> have employment outside of their homes. Fewer families make a living by farming and people in Willow Bunch often find work in neighbouring towns. Since most of their day is spent outside of Willow Bunch they tend to buy necessary items, such as groceries, elsewhere. This has affected the town greatly and businesses in Willow Bunch have suffered and even shut down because of this change.|$|E

Although Kobach's office was in the building adjacent to the courthouse, he failed to appear for the rule change hearing and to answer questions. Instead his request was supported by Andrew Howell, a Shawnee county elections official whom Kobach also had appointed.|$|E

25|$|Kisses! is a {{controversial}} urinal {{designed by the}} female Dutch designer Meike van Schijndel. It is shaped like an open pair of red lips. In early March 2004, the National Organization for <b>Women</b> (<b>NOW)</b> took offense to the new urinals that Virgin Atlantic Airways decided to install in the Virgin Atlantic clubhouse at JFK Airport in New York City. After receiving many angry phone calls from female customers, Virgin Atlantic Vice President John Riordan called NOW to apologize. Protestors surmised a connection to oral sex or urolagnia, and based their complaints on the urinals being sexist. A McDonald's restaurant in the Netherlands removed them after a customer complained to the head office in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The WACs {{received}} the same pay, allowances, and benefits as regular army units, though time spent as a WAC did not count toward time served and the allowance for dependents was heavily restricted. The WACs were now disciplined, promoted, and given the same legal protections as regular Army units, and the 150,000 ceiling was lifted. While the legislators {{made it very clear}} they expected the WACs to be noncombatants, the bill contained no specific restrictions. Existing Army regulations still prohibited them from combat training with weapons, tactical exercises, duty assignments requiring weapons, supervising men, and jobs requiring great physical strength, unless waived by the United States Secretary of War; but of the 628 Army specialties, <b>women</b> <b>now</b> qualified for 406. Additional Army regulations were adopted to cover pregnancy, marriage, and maternity care.|$|E
25|$|Educational {{progress}} happened {{more rapidly}} {{in the city of}} Salisbury than {{in the rest of the}} county. While Salisbury's schools grew, schools in the rest of Rowan County lagged far behind. After the city school system split off, the difference became more noticeable as a report from John H. Cook from the North Carolina College for <b>Women</b> (<b>now,</b> University of North Carolina at Greensboro) around 1924 called the county's schools the worst in North Carolina. At the time, the county only had 36 schools many of which were only one or two room buildings. Cook devised a plan for school improvement and new school construction which the county commissioners and the citizens promptly adopted in 1924. Soon thereafter, a school construction boom created 18 schools with at least eight rooms each.|$|E
