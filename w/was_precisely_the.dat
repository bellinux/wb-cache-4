5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. He kept a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E

This institution began before the reign of Edward III but, by 1350, the justices {{had been given the}} power not only to investigate crimes and make arrests, but also to try cases, including those of felony. With this, an enduring fixture in the administration of local English justice had been created.|$|E

25|$|In May 1535, {{the newly}} elected Pope Paul III created Fisher Cardinal Priest of San Vitale, {{apparently}} {{in the hope of}} inducing Henry to ease Fisher's treatment. The effect <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> reverse: Henry forbade the cardinal's hat to be brought into England, declaring that he would send the head to Rome instead. In June a special commission for Fisher's trial was issued, and on Thursday, 17 June, he was arraigned in Westminster Hall before a court of seventeen, including Thomas Cromwell, Anne Boleyn's father, and ten justices. The charge was treason, in that he denied that the King was the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Since he had been deprived of his position of Bishop of Rochester by the Act of Attainder, he was treated as a commoner, and tried by jury. The only testimony was that of Richard Rich. John Fisher was found guilty and condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn.|$|E
25|$|He often {{referred}} to Le Sage's theory in his lectures on physics at the University of Göttingen. However, around 1796 Lichtenberg changed his views after being persuaded by the arguments of Immanuel Kant, who criticized any kind of theory that attempted to replace attraction with impulsion. Kant {{pointed out that the}} very existence of spatially extended configurations of matter, such as particles of non-zero radius, implies the existence of some sort of binding force to hold the extended parts of the particle together. Now, that force cannot be explained by the push from the gravitational particles, because those particles too must hold together in the same way. To avoid this circular reasoning, Kant asserted that there must exist a fundamental attractive force. This <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> same objection that had always been raised against the impulse doctrine of Descartes in the previous century, and had led even the followers of Descartes to abandon that aspect of his philosophy.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{where the}} film was locally known as Fantasy Forest, {{expectations}} were high, with projections going as high $154–200 million or more. Ultimately, it was unable to hit these marks. Before {{the release of the}} film in the state, Disney had a very successful run at the box office with Zootopia the previous month, in which anthropomorphic animals were the central figure. Forbes noted that The Jungle Book <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> sort of film that Chinese audiences love with its 3D visuals, heartwarming story, and talking animal cast. It earned around $12 million on its opening day, including $300,000 worth of previews from 65,000 screenings. Buoyed by good word of mouth and positive reception (albeit mostly from audiences with polarized reception from Chinese critics), it rose 72% on its second day to $20 million. Through its opening weekend it grossed $48.5 million, including $5.1 million from 279 IMAX screens, a new record for April release. Its opening marked the biggest Walt Disney Pictures film opening ever, the second biggest for a family film (behind Kung Fu Panda 3), the second biggest April debut (behind Furious 7), and the fourth biggest Disney opening (behind Avengers: Age of Ultron, Iron Man 3, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens). It topped the daily box office through the whole opening week and went on to remain {{at the top of the}} box office for a second weekend, after dropping by a mere 20% to $29.8 million, despite facing some competitions. It ended its run there with a total of $150.1 million after thirty days of playing in theaters, adding $1.2 million on its last day. Albeit falling just below expectations, it nevertheless emerged as a huge financial success and becoming the fourth biggest Disney release there.|$|E

2500|$|One of Ali's {{greatest}} tricks {{was to make}} opponents overcommit {{by pulling}} straight backward from punches.

2500|$|In Shakespeare's histories, the Grand Mechanism is {{manifested}} nowhere {{more clearly than}} in {{the rise and fall}} of Richard III.

Psychology does not apply to him. He is just history, one of its ever-repeating characters. He has no face."

2500|$|Esuno's art and its {{adequacy}} to {{a horror}} series received very discrepant opinions.

However, [...] "horrific" [...] <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> word use by Gaffney to describe it, and Davisson wrote he has not [...] "seen anyone draw horror as well as Esuno".

Scott Green of Ain't It Cool News, who said Esuno [...] "isn't great at horror", praised the same scene and pondered that large-scale panels like those [...] "manage [...] some creepy spectacles". More consensual was that Esuno's monsters were better drawn his human characters. For example, Zoth praised backgrounds and monsters but called human designs [...] "generic and unmemorable" [...] and that [...] "looks to be a half-finished state." [...] Henderson said, [...] "It's fairly average in the portrayal of the humans, but the monsters are ... creepy and sometimes downright disturbing". Santos commended Esuno's [...] "striking supernatural imagery" [...] as exemplified by how [...] "classic creatures ... take on new levels of terrifying". He also praised its [...] "straightforward paneling [...] brings the story to the forefront and minimizes distractions", but he said [...] "some of the character designs look like {{the work of a}} rookie". Zimmerman asserted that [...] "though not quite as polished as fans have come to expect, [...] is fitting with his otherworldy designs and outlandish characters." [...] More negative was Wildsmith who called the art [...] "ordinary: cute character types clash with uninspired horror images". More positive was Sizemore, saying mood and emotions are well conveyed, and monsters are well crafted.|$|E
