25|$|On Sunday afternoons <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> {{calling on}} the older {{generation}} of relatives, {{those who had been}} active in the Sixties, I sat on the bony knees of veterans and the fat slippery laps of great aunts and heard them talk.|$|E
25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E

500|$|Atkinson {{has said}} that in the buildup to the final episode, he began to psychologically {{experience}} something of his character's apprehension. Speaking to Michael Parkinson in 2003, he recalled [...] "I remember...in {{the weeks leading up to}} the one day recording of that final episode <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> over the top, for the first time in my acting career...knowing that even though the rest of the episode was its usual standard funny sitcom self, there was this deep twist in my stomach throughout that week thinking along with your character that you were doomed. It was most peculiar. I'm sure serious character actors feel this all the time... Obviously if you're trying to feel the character and his dilemma then you're going to experience some of the fictional feelings for real. You felt swept along by it." ...|$|E
500|$|Delany {{auditioned for}} the role of Bree for the series' pilot episode in 2004. Cherry offered her the role three times, but she {{rejected}} it, and Marcia Cross was hired soon after. Delany turned down the role because she believed the Bree character was too similar to her character on Pasadena. Cherry acknowledged that while Delany captured the slyness he had originally intended for the character, Cross ultimately became the better choice: [...] "Marcia, who {{will be the first to}} tell you, 'I'm not funny, I never get the joke,' her Bree was kind of oblivious to her own Breeness. Interestingly enough, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> forward with the show, it became a much funnier character than I envisioned." [...] While developing the Katherine character, Cherry immediately offered the role to Delany. [...] "That's unusual in Hollywood," [...] Delany commented. [...] "Usually when you say 'no,' they hold it against you for the rest of your career. I've experienced that." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{left the}} Beatles in September 1969, and {{agreed not to}} inform the media while the group renegotiated their {{recording}} contract, but he was outraged that McCartney publicised his own departure on releasing his debut solo album in April 1970. Lennon's reaction was, [...] "Jesus Christ! He gets all the credit for it!" [...] He later wrote, [...] "I started the band. I disbanded it. It's as simple as that." [...] In later interviews with Rolling Stone magazine, he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney, saying, [...] "I was a fool not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record." [...] Lennon also spoke of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono, and of how he, Harrison, and Starr [...] "got fed up with being sidemen for Paul... After Brian Epstein died we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> round in circles?" ...|$|E

The lyric [...] "We never, never fail <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> to make a sale, we simply cheat a little if we must" [...] was changed to [...] "We never, never fail <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> to make a sale, we work a little harder if we must." [...] The reason for these edits is not known; but it {{may have to do}} with the merchants being [...] "Jewish" [...] stereotypes.|$|R
500|$|The full album {{versions}} continued, {{as well as}} a localized {{rendition of}} [...] "Wrecking Ball", at Springsteen's four shows to close out the Philadelphia Spectrum as well; some 43 different songs were playing during the stand. [...] Apart from the album playings, Springsteen kept setlists flexible during the third leg; sign requests continued, as in Springsteen's words they allowed [...] "the fans to have input into the show in a way that just pumps the blood into everything and enlivens the evening." [...] Born to Run remained the standard full album choice {{for the rest of the}} tour, but the two shows at New York's Madison Square Garden saw The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle and The River, with the latter's 20-song length dominating the setlist. [...] Springsteen felt The River show succeeded, saying [...] "I sequenced [...] to feel like a live show, so you have four fast songs and a couple of ballads. It played real well <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> to play it." ...|$|E
500|$|Around this period, the Ravens {{decided on}} a new, {{permanent}} name: the Kinks. Numerous explanations of the name's genesis have been offered. In Jon Savage's analysis, they [...] "needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'—something newsy, naughty but just on the borderline of acceptability. In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual—fame through outrage." [...] Manager Robert Wace related {{his side of the}} story: [...] "I had a friend... He thought the group was rather fun. If my memory is correct, he came up with the name just as an idea, as a good way of getting publicity... <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> to [...] with the name, they were... absolutely horrified. They said, 'We're not going to be called kinky! Ray Davies' account conflicts with Wace's—he recalled that the name was coined by Larry Page, and referenced their [...] "kinky" [...] fashion sense. Davies quoted him as saying, [...] "The way you look, and the clothes you wear, you ought to be called the Kinks." [...] "I've never really liked the name", Ray stated.|$|E
500|$|Milan were {{regarded}} as favourites and their team included many players who had experienced success in the competition. The most notable was captain Paolo Maldini, who had won the competition four times previously, all with Milan, and Clarence Seedorf who had won the competition three times with three different clubs. Liverpool had been considered underdogs throughout the competition, but had beaten more favoured opposition, including Juventus and Chelsea, to reach the final. Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez acknowledged this: [...] "Maybe Milan are favourites, but we have confidence, and we can win". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger felt Liverpool would win the match: [...] "I fancy Liverpool as Milan look jaded physically and certainly mentally, by losing the [...] title, I think they {{have never had a}} better chance than now to beat Milan." [...] Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was not so optimistic, stating that the Liverpool side were not as good as the one that had won the 2001 UEFA Cup Final: [...] "No disrespect to the squad we have got now but it is obvious we are not as strong as we were when we won the UEFA Cup in 2001. Back then we had a settled team and that season <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> into games against Barcelona and Roma, we always felt we were as good as them." ...|$|E

500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions for Achtung Baby, the Edge {{separated from his}} wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. Reflecting on the impact it had on U2, Bono said, [...] "We're a really tight community. This is not like somebody's, you know, girlfriend's left. We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there." [...] Audio engineer Flood said the [...] "bold, unadulterated, naked [...] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic. Edge just got an idea, tried it, and it worked straightaway." ...|$|E

2500|$|Big Black's music {{challenged}} convention, pursuing an abrasive {{sound that}} was more aggressive than contemporary punk rock. Albini explained that the band strove for intensity, stating that their goal was to make [...] "something that felt intense <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> through it, rather than something that had little coded indicators of intensity. Heavy metal {{and stuff like that}} didn't really seem intense to me, it seemed comical to me. Hardcore punk didn't really seem intense most of the time — {{most of the time it}} just seemed childish. I guess that's how I would differentiate what we were doing from what other people were doing." [...] Both Albini and Riley described Big Black as a punk rock band. Other sources have classified the band as post-punk, indie rock, noise rock, alternative rock, and post-hardcore.|$|E

[...] The bank was about this high [...] and steep, and they got off their horses and tried to climb out of the water on their hands and knees, but we killed nearly all of them when they were running through the woods and in the water. [...] The ones that got across the river and up the hill dug holes and stayed in them." ...|$|E
