5|$|Bruce led the Australian {{delegation}} to the 1932 Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa. He redoubled his efforts to improve Australian economic prospects with the empire, and the conference agreed to a limited form of his long-sought imperial preference scheme that would give Australia greater access and competitiveness in imperial markets over five years, an achievement for which Bruce received much praise from the Lyons government. The closer trading arrangements of the Ottawa Agreements <b>would</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> pattern for Australian-British trade relations until Britain's entry in the European Common Market in 1973.|$|E

It may also be that {{in the mind of}} their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were meant to be a force that <b>would</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E

5|$|Maintenance problems. The chain driven {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} {{expensive}} to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging in service. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided a combustible material, {{and as a result}} of the heavy braking of the locomotives, sparks <b>would</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would invariably be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming into contact with the hot boiler, causing stress to the casing. Many photographs show an unmodified with 'buckled' (warped) casing, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E

5|$|The Han Chinese used astronomical studies {{mainly to}} {{construct}} and revise their calendar. In contrast to the Julian calendar (46 BCE) and Gregorian calendar (1582 CE) of the West (but like the Hellenic calendars of Classical Greece), the Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning that it uses the precise movements of the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year. In the 5th century BCE during the Spring and Autumn period, the Chinese established the Sifen calendar (古四分历), which measured the tropical year at 3651⁄4 days (like the Julian calendar of Rome). Emperor Wu replaced this with the new Taichu calendar (太初历) in 104 BCE which measured the tropical year at 365385⁄1539 days and the lunar month at 2943⁄81 days. Since the Taichu calendar had become inaccurate over two centuries, Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75–88 CE) halted its use and revived use of the Sifen calendar. Later, astronomer Guo Shoujing (1233–1316 CE) <b>would</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> tropical year at 365.2425 days for his Shoushi calendar (授時曆), the same value used in the Gregorian calendar. Besides {{the use of the}} calendar for regulating agricultural practices throughout the seasons, it was also used to mark important dates in the Sexagenary cycle—constructed by celestial stems (gan 干) and Earthly Branches (zhi 支), each of the latter associated with an animal of the Chinese zodiac.|$|E

This reading is based on a connection between Y.T., a major character in Snow Crash, and the aged neo-Victorian Miss Matheson in The Diamond Age, who drops oblique references to her past as a hard-edged skateboarder. This <b>would</b> <b>set</b> <b>The</b> Diamond Age some 80–100 years after Snow Crash.|$|E
25|$|By late 1975, {{after years}} of intense {{construction}} the necessary infrastructure was in place. In Aberdeen, at BP's (British Petroleum) headquarters, the Queen pressed the button that <b>would</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> whole thing moving. Oil flowed from the rig directly to the refinery at far-away Grangemouth. While many ports have suffered decline, Aberdeen remains busy because of the oil trade and the influx of people connected with the industry, a subsequent rise in property prices have brought prosperity to the area.|$|E
25|$|During the period, {{a segment}} of the {{population}} began to demonstrate an increasingly less conciliatory policy towards the Jews. The Jewish population reacted by siding with the Greek monarchists during the Greek National Schism (opposing Eleftherios Venizelos, who had the overwhelming support of refugees and the lower income classes). This <b>would</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> stage for a 20-year period during which the relationship of the Jews with the Greek state and people would oscillate as Greek politics changed.|$|E

25|$|By 1500 AD, most of {{southern}} Africa had established states. In northwestern Namibia, the Ovambo engaged in farming and the Herero engaged in herding. As cattle numbers increased, the Herero moved southward to central Namibia for grazing land. A related group, the Ovambanderu, expanded to Ghanzi in northwestern Botswana. The Nama, a Khoi-speaking, sheep-raising group, moved northward and {{came into contact}} with the Herero; this <b>would</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> stage for much conflict between the two groups. The expanding Lozi states pushed the Mbukushu, Subiya, and Yei to Botei, Okavango, and Chobe in northern Botswana.|$|E

In order to ensure that the First Foundation would be created, Seldon and the Psychohistorians of Trantor placed the Commissioner Linge Chen (then actual if not crowned Emperor) under intense scrutiny, as well as Mentalic influence in order to achieve their aims. This was a clear but vital breach in the limits of psychohistorical theory, as psychostatistics is meaningful only with planetary numbers, and not with individuals.|$|E

In 1979, the CNT held its first congress since 1936 as well as several mass meetings, the most remarkable one in Montjuïc.

25|$|Leeds made an {{immediate}} impact; they began {{the season with}} a scintillating 4–2 victory over defending league champions Liverpool, which <b>would</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> tone {{for the rest of the}} season. Revie's young side chased an improbable league and cup double finishing the 1964–65 season as runners up only to Busby's Manchester United, losing the title on goal difference. They turned the tables on Manchester United in the FA cup semi-final replay, reaching the FA Cup Final where they were beaten 2–1 by Liverpool in a dour game, best remembered for the appearance of Albert Johanneson, the first black player to play in an FA Cup final.|$|E
25|$|Both teams {{started off}} with drives that <b>would</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> tone {{for the rest of}} the game. New York got the ball first and drove to midfield before losing it when Glenn Blackwood intercepted Todd's pass. On the first play after the turnover, Miami gave the ball right back with a pass that was picked off by Jets safety Ken Schroy. In the second quarter, Dolphins quarterback David Woodley broke free for a 17-yard run to his 39-yard line, which turned out to be the longest run of the day for either team. However, running back Tony Nathan lost a fumble on the next play, though the Jets still failed to get any points with a {{possession}} starting at the Miami 41.|$|E
