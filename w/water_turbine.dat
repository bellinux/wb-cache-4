5|$|Lord Rosebery had {{purchased}} Craigiehall {{as a home}} for his second son Neil Primrose MP, {{who was killed in}} Gaza during the First World War. In 1926 Rosebery therefore decided to lease the house and policies, although the agricultural lands continue to be farmed as part of Lord Rosebery's neighbouring Dalmeny estate. The lease was taken by Mr James Morton, an Edinburgh textile manufacturer, who commissioned Robert Lorimer to make various alterations, the property having stood empty for ten years. Lorimer added the oriel window on the south front, and modernised many of Bruce's remaining interiors. A <b>water</b> <b>turbine</b> was constructed in the bath house to provide electricity.|$|E
5|$|A leat runs to {{the east}} of the town's main street but it is {{uncertain}} when it was first constructed. By the early seventeenth century, {{the southern end of the}} leat and one mill are shown on a map. There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to have always been a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted to housing but a <b>water</b> <b>turbine</b> remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie's bell foundry (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had a boiler delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map. The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and a chimney base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in residential use but the sluices (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the water wheel and gearing.|$|E

25|$|The {{numerous}} {{rivers and}} streams of the region saw hundreds of water-powered timber and grist mills. Mills were important centers of culture and commerce; dispersed widely throughout the region, mills served local needs, often thriving within {{a few miles of}} another facility.

25|$|Water is used {{in power}} generation. Hydro{{electricity}} is electricity obtained from hydropower. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a <b>water</b> <b>turbine</b> connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.|$|E
25|$|Coldharbour Mill {{also had}} a small <b>water</b> <b>turbine</b> for {{electricity}} generation, which used the 14 foot head of water between the upper leat and the tail race.

25|$|The Éolienne Bollée is {{an unusual}} wind turbine, unique for having a stator and a rotor, as a <b>water</b> <b>turbine</b> has. The eponymous {{invention}} was first patented in 1868 by Ernest Sylvain Bollée in France. A further patent dated 1885 differed mainly in two ways: First, in how the turbine was {{turned to face the}} wind and second, in an improvement which increased the flow of wind through the turbine was added. The turbines built according to the 1885 patent were commercially successful.|$|E
25|$|A {{hydraulic}} power network {{is a system}} of interconnected pipes carrying pressurized liquid used to transmit mechanical power from a power source, like a pump, to hydraulic equipment like lifts or motors. The system is analogous to an electrical grid transmitting power from a generating station to end-users. Only a few {{hydraulic power}} transmission networks are still in use; modern hydraulic equipment has a pump built into the machine. In the late 19th century, a hydraulic network might {{have been used in}} a factory, with a central steam engine or <b>water</b> <b>turbine</b> driving a pump and a system of high-pressure pipes transmitting power to various machines.|$|E
25|$|Tidal energy can be {{extracted}} by two means: inserting a <b>water</b> <b>turbine</b> into a tidal current, or building ponds that release/admit water through a turbine. In the first case, the energy amount is entirely {{determined by the}} timing and tidal current magnitude. However, the best currents may be unavailable because the turbines would obstruct ships. In the second, the impoundment dams are expensive to construct, natural water cycles are completely disrupted, ship navigation is disrupted. However, with multiple ponds, power can be generated at chosen times. So far, there are few installed systems for tidal power generation (most famously, La Rance at Saint Malo, France) which face many difficulties. Aside from environmental issues, simply withstanding corrosion and biological fouling pose engineering challenges.|$|E

25|$|When the Lucy Tongue Level was {{completed}} in 1869, its entrance was below the ore hoppers {{at the foot of}} the incline from the Low Horse Level. A water-powered incline was built to take the ore up to those hoppers, though this involved a considerable amount of reorganisation in the area. Labour shortages in 1870 led to further mechanisation of the labour-intensive ore washing. A new oscillating jaw crusher eliminated the need for initial hand-knocking of the ore, and was powered by a high-pressure <b>water</b> <b>turbine.</b> Hotching tubs, even when mechanised, still needed constant supervision, and were replaced by newly-available automated fixed-sieve jigging machines. These still involved forcing water up and down through the bed of ore, but the sieves, covered with a three-inch (76mm) layer of galena, were stationary; material of the same density passed through the bed but lighter material was washed into the next sieve down the line. They were very effective and enabled a complete separation of galena and gangue.|$|E
25|$|After passing {{under the}} Robin Hood Line, which runs from Worksop to Nottingham, the county border leaves the river, which {{continues}} in a north-easterly direction. Beyond the B6407 Sookholme Road bridge, it is joined by The Bottoms, which rises in Mansfield Woodhouse and flows northwards to the junction. The freight line to Shirebrook crosses the river, and also crosses Sookholme Brook, which has two sources near Shirebrook, and after they have joined, flows parallel to the Meden to its junction near Warsop Vale. The river passes between Church Warsop and Market Warsop, where it is crossed by the A60 road. Just below the bridge is Warsop watermill, much of which dates from 1767. The building is grade II listed, and internally, the machinery and rolling mill date from the nineteenth century. There is also an early twentieth century <b>water</b> <b>turbine.</b> The mill bridge and weir are also listed structures. Turning eastwards, the river passes through Budby and into Thoresby Park, {{where it has been}} dammed to form a large ornamental lake called Thoresby Lake. The difference in height between the lake and the river below it at the eastern end was sufficient for Earl Manvers, the owner of Thoresby Hall, to install two water turbines in 1941. They were supplied by Newtons of Derby and were of 22 kVA and 5 kVA capacity. The electricity generated supplied the hall. The generator house was demolished in the late 20th century.|$|E
500|$|The {{navigation}} has {{a number}} of structures which, because of their age, have historic value and are listed on the Listed Building register. At Vale Royal, the lock built in 1860 was retained as a sluice channel when a new lock was built in the 1890s. A swing bridge crosses the chamber. [...] The sluice at the upstream end is supported by two cast iron arches on rusticated piers. A swing bridge, made of wood and iron, crosses the small lock, which was the large lock until the construction of the new large lock in the 1890s. This has three sets of gates, and could accommodate a train of four barges when the outer gates were used. Again, a swing bridge crosses the lock. The gates are opened by a Pelton <b>water</b> <b>turbine</b> mechanism, and other features include a water levelling mechanism and a system for removing rubbish from behind the gates using jets of water which are controlled mechanically. [...] The lock keeper's cottage is also grade II listed. It was built in the 1850s, but was moved northwards by [...] during the 1890 reconstruction.|$|E

2500|$|A {{free jet}} <b>water</b> <b>turbine</b> or impulse <b>water</b> <b>turbine,</b> also {{commonly}} known as a Pelton's wheel, is a wheel that uses cups, or buckets, that are split down the middle by a metal divider, so that in effect two cups are mounted side-by-side at each [...] "spoke" [...] in the wheel. A high-pressure water jet aimed {{at the center of}} each bucket is split by the divider to hit each of cup, one on the left, the other on the right. The design of this <b>water</b> <b>turbine</b> takes advantage of a mechanics principle known as impulse, a force defined as the product of the force and the time during which it acts. In 1878, Lester Pelton invented his prototype known as the Pelton's wheel, first demonstrating it to miners in the Sierra Nevada. In 1880, Lester Pelton received a patent for his invention.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{hydroelectric}} power {{comes from the}} potential energy of dammed water driving a <b>water</b> <b>turbine</b> and generator. The power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water's outflow. This height difference is called the head. A large pipe (the [...] "penstock") delivers water from the reservoir to the turbine.|$|E
2500|$|Hydroelectricity uses a <b>water</b> <b>turbine</b> to {{generate}} power. [...] In 1878 the world's first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at Cragside in Northumberland, England by William George Armstrong.
