5|$|A <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> is a {{group of}} wind {{turbines}} in the same location used for production of electric power. A large <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines distributed over an extended area, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. For example, Gansu <b>Wind</b> <b>Farm,</b> the largest <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> in the world, has several thousand turbines. A <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> may also be located offshore.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{planners}} have shifted their attention towards {{offshore wind power}} generation and the decision {{is supported by the}} public in general, which in the literature has a positive attitude towards offshore wind generation. However, globally only a few offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> are operating. As more <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> start operating and more people become experienced with especially the visual impacts from offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms,</b> the public positive attitude could change if the experienced impacts are different from the initially perceived visual interference. Using a binary logit model, the present paper investigates the relation between different levels of prior experience with visual disamenities from offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> and perception of visual impacts from offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms.</b> The differences in prior experience are systematically controlled for sampling respondents living in the areas close to the large scale offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> Nysted and Horns Rev and by sampling the a group of respondents representing the Danish population, which has little experience with offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms.</b> Compared to previous results in the literature, the present paper finds that perception of wind power generation is influenced by prior experience. More specifically, the results show that people with experience from offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> located far from the coast have a significant more positive perception of the visual impacts from offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> than people with experience from <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> located closer to the coast. These results are noteworthy on two levels. First of all, the results show that perceptions of offshore wind generation are systematically significantly influenced by prior experience with offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms.</b> Secondly, and in a policy context, the results indicate that the future acceptance of future offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> is not independent of the location of existing and new offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms.</b> This poses for caution in relation to locating offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> too close to the coast.

40|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>farms</b> {{are often}} planned {{offshore}} where wind conditions are favourable {{and the visual}} impact is less important. <b>Wind</b> <b>farms</b> have {{both positive and negative}} effects on the marine environment. Negative effects include bird collisions, underwater sounds and electromagnetic fields, whilst positive effects constitute functioning as artificial reef and acting as no-take zones for fish, with possible spill-over effects. This paper presents a spatially explicit framework to analyze effects of <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> on the marine environment and aims to evaluate how <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> can contribute to protection of the marine environment through strategic and economically viable location choices. The functioning and the applicability of the model are demonstrated in a numerical example for the Dutch exclusive economic zone. We find that the careful spatial planning of <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> is a key factor for profitability and environmental protection, and that, if carefully planned, the environment can benefit from offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms.</b> <b>Wind</b> energy Offshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> Marine environmental protection...|$|R
5|$|The Waterloo <b>Wind</b> <b>Farm</b> is a 111 MW <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> {{which was}} {{completed}} in 2010 at an estimated cost of $300 million. Thirty-seven Vestas V90 3 MW turbines stretch over the 18km <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> site and are connected through a 33 kilovolt (kV) internal reticulation network to the <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> substation. The <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> is approximately 30 kilometres south-east of the township of Clare and 100km north of Adelaide.

40|$|Nowadays <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> do {{not provide}} {{frequency}} control in Germany. Because of the increasing wind energy generation, <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> will have to provide this ancillary service in the future. Even though the provision of frequency control by <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> has become a big research field, no work has yet been done concerning the proof of the provision. Thus in this paper a new concept is presented how <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> can prove the provision of frequency control. Moreover a method for calculating the available amount of frequency control power based on probabilistic forecasts is described. An economic analysis is conducted for three different <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> and a virtual power plant, consisting of these <b>wind</b> <b>farms,</b> participating at the market for negative tertiary control power in Germany...|$|R
