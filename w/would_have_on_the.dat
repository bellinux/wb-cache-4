Touring vehicles were powered by low-emissions renewable biodiesel, a fuel made partly from vegetable oil. Non-profit organizations Love Hope Strength and HeadCount joined the tour for select dates.|$|E

In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes. In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> youth market.|$|E

5|$|For the 1958 season, the {{durations}} of timeouts {{was extended}} from 60 to 90 seconds and Bell mandated officials call a few TV timeouts during each game — a change which triggered criticism from sportswriters. The 1958 championship game {{became the first}} NFL championship game decided in overtime and it {{was considered to be}} the greatest football game ever played. The game further increased football's marketability to television advertising, and the drama associated with overtime was the catalyst. Years later, after witnessing Bell openly crying after the game, Raymond Berry attributed it to Bell's realization of the impact the game <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> prevalence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Author Jeremy Rifkin had {{previously}} written several books that, like The Empathic Civilization, {{have attempted to}} extrapolate trends in the economy, technology, and society. For example, his 1995 book The End of Work concerns the changes that tele-commuting <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> workplace, his 1998 book The Biotech Century concerns the expected impacts of genetic engineering, and his 2002 book The Hydrogen Economy concerns {{the economic and social}} effects that will result from the expected replacement of fossil fuels with hydrogen as an energy storage medium. His last book before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream, published in 2004, comparing the American Dream with the values expressed by Europeans in the post-industrial economy. At the time of publication, the 64-year-old Rifkin was working as an advisor to the European Union concerning issues relating to the economy, climate change, and energy security, as well as president of the American non-profit organization the Foundation on Economic Trends.|$|E
5|$|By 1968, {{the wild}} herd were {{concentrated}} mostly on BLM lands owing to previous roundups {{and construction of}} boundary fences. That year, the BLM again stated its intention to remove the herds, {{this time with the}} possibility of returning a small number (either 15 or 35) to the range. In response to the new announcement, the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Association (PMWHA) was formed with the goal of preventing the roundup, and began working in concert with larger organizations such as the International Society for the Protection of Animals. The BLM argued that the horses were being removed because they were likely to starve, as they had overgrazed their environment, while the PMWHA argued the degradation of the range was not due to the horses and that in fact they were in no danger of starving. The organization further charged that the BLM was acting at the behest of other state and federal organizations who wished to see the horses removed, rather than acting in line with public opinion. The PMWHA was also concerned with the effect that the penning <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> feral horses.|$|E

5|$|Minas Geraes was christened by Senhora Regis de Oliveira, {{the wife}} of the Brazilian {{minister}} to Great Britain, and launched at Newcastle-on-Tyne on 10 September 1908. During fitting-out, it was moved to Vickers' Walker Yard, and thousands turned out to see the incomplete ship squeeze barely underneath and through overhead and swing bridges. After completion, Minas Geraes was handed over by Armstrong on 5 January to the Brazilian Commission on behalf of the Brazilian government, while the ship's company was mustered on deck. The British Royal Navy carried out its gunnery trials at the request of Armstrong's and with the agreement of the Brazilian government. Although the idea of having superfiring turrets was not new—the American s were also designed and built in this fashion around the same time—the trials attracted interest from a few nations, who sent representatives to observe. They wanted to resolve two major questions: the effect that firing the upper superfiring turrets <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crewmen in the lower guns, and whether smoke from the discharge of the lower guns would hinder the targeting capabilities of the upper turret. The tests resolved both questions satisfactorily.|$|E
5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were {{concerned}} {{at the impact}} the cemetery scheme <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised {{about the impact of}} funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} the Salon d'Automne was not, however, due to such controversy.

Each successive exhibition denoted a significant phase in the development of modern art: Beginning with retrospectives of Gauguin, Cézanne and others; the influence such <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> art that would follow; the Fauves (André Derain, Henri Matisse); followed by the proto-Cubists (Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger and Robert Delaunay); the Cubists, the Orphists, and Futurists.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, Deborah Gardner {{was found}} murdered {{in her home}} in Tonga, where she was serving in the Peace Corps. Dennis Priven, a fellow Peace Corps worker, was later charged with the murder by the Tonga government. He {{was found not guilty}} by reason of insanity, and was sentenced to serve time in a mental {{institution}} in Washington D.C. Privan was never admitted to any institution, and the handling of the case has been heavily criticized. The main criticism has been that the Peace Corps seemingly worked to keep one of its volunteers from being found guilty of murder, due to the reflection it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> organization.|$|E
25|$|Harrison, Peebles, Yu and Zel'dovich {{realized}} that the early universe {{would have to have}} inhomogeneities at the level of 10−4 or 10−5. Rashid Sunyaev later calculated the observable imprint that these inhomogeneities <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cosmic microwave background. Increasingly stringent limits on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background were set by ground based experiments during the 1980s. RELIKT-1, a Soviet cosmic microwave background anisotropy experiment on board the Prognoz 9 satellite (launched 1 July 1983) gave upper limits on the large-scale anisotropy. The NASA COBE mission clearly confirmed the primary anisotropy with the Differential Microwave Radiometer instrument, publishing their findings in 1992. The team received the Nobel Prize in physics for 2006 for this discovery.|$|E
