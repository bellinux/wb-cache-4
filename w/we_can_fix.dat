25|$|From Pedanius Dioscorides and Pliny the Elder, who {{mention his}} work, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>fix</b> his time of writing to a period after Juba II, {{the king of}} Mauretania, had written his {{treatise}} on euphorbia, which Dioscorides and Pliny knew from Niger, and before Pliny himself wrote his Natural History, in other words from {{late in the first}} century B.C. to {{the first half of the}} first century A.D. Caelius Aurelianus (acut. 3, 16, 134) allows us to narrow the possible date further, by naming him as a friend of Tullius Bassus, who is cited by Scribonius Largus (121); since Scribonius wrote in the early to mid 40s, this should narrow his period to before 40 A.D.|$|E

30|$|In some cases, {{when the}} contractive {{condition}} is of nonlinear type, the above strategy cannot be used.
