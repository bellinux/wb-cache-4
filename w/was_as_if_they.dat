500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, so in a sense everybody could have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just see myself as a film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this was a very big influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E
500|$|Vancouver won {{the first}} game of the series in Chicago 2–1 in double overtime, but fell behind in game two 3–1. During the game the Canucks felt that referee Bob Myers was making {{questionable}} calls against them. A series of events in the third period ignited tempers. First, Vancouver had a goal disallowed. Soon after, there was a perceived non-call against Chicago, followed by a fourth consecutive penalty called against the Canucks. Denis Savard scored on the power play to put the Black Hawks up 4–1. This enraged the Canucks' bench. Assistant coach Ron Smith yelled out [...] "We give up, we surrender, we give up." [...] Williams suggested to Neilson that he throw sticks onto the ice in protest. Neilson noted that he had done that before, and he had a better idea. He proceeded to take a white towel and place it on the end of a hockey stick holding it up in a mock surrender; some of the Canucks' players followed suit.Neilson was ejected from the game along with two players. Vancouver goaltender, Richard Brodeur later noted that although they lost the game the atmosphere in the dressing room was so positive it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had won.|$|E
500|$|As {{they began}} to play, bassist Adam Clayton {{developed}} a bassline. The part was originally based on the Grandmaster Melle Mel song [...] "White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)" [...] before Clayton changed to a more trance-like bassline. Vocalist Bono created some melodies and sang over the music. During the album's recording, Bono had become tired of writing in the first-person and he began writing lyrics and singing {{from the perspective of}} different characters. During the writing of [...] "Moment of Surrender", Bono assumed the character of a drug addict having a crisis of faith. The song title was borrowed from the Alcoholics Anonymous term for when an addict admits being [...] "powerless over alcohol" [...] and needs help. Bono had attempted to use the phrase [...] "vision over visibility" [...] in the lyrics of earlier songs; however, [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] was the first song where he felt it was appropriate to be used. Eno called Bono's singing in this character as [...] "so heartbreaking agonized and vulnerable", creating a feeling like [...] "a knife to the heart". Lanois contributed by developing the gospel-like chorus. The uneven hi-hat from the drum part stems from Mullen's electronic drum kit malfunctioning during the song's recording. Eno was amazed by each performer's ability to develop and play their part without any instructions or cues. After the song's recording completed, everyone in the studio, including a gathering of production personnel and visitors, was completely silent, and Eno suggested it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had gone on an [...] "emotional adventure of some kind". He called the song's recording [...] "the most amazing studio experience I've ever had", and he believes the [...] "emotional crescendo" [...] heard in the song properly captures how they felt as they improvised the piece. Bono stated [...] "it was a spell and we were in it".|$|E

2500|$|Finally, Justice Marshall {{points out}} that [...] "Even where the power of two sovereigns to pursue {{separate}} prosecutions for the same crime has been undisputed, this Court has barred both governments from combining to do what each could not constitutionally do on its own." [...] In this case, the prosecutions in Alabama and Georgia were so inextricably linked that it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were acting together as a single governmental entity. Furthermore, the interests of justice, according to Marshall, were frustrated by having the defendant plead guilty to a crime in Georgia to avoid the death penalty, {{only to have the}} guilty plea prevent him from mounting a meaningful defense to capital charges in Alabama. For these reasons, in the interests [...] "of fundamental fairness," [...] Justice Marshall voted against the majority decision.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable ways was {{demonstrated}} in the 1992 Olympics, when the Dream Team, including Jordan and Pippen, took on Croatia for the gold medal. The Croatia team featured Toni Kukoč, a young star whom Krause had discovered through European contacts and was courting {{to a degree that}} some of the Bulls found annoying. Jordan biographer David Halberstam said that Jordan and Pippen [...] "seemed to play against Kukoc as if they had a vendetta", and that [...] "in the end, it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had been playing not against Kukoc but against Krause." [...] Jordan would later be quoted as saying: [...] "The trade of Oakley was good, and the best thing he did was to get Pippen and Grant. That's it. His claim to fame is that he drafted Earl Monroe for the Bullets. And I say to him, 'What pick was that?' He says, 'Two.' And I say, 'Hell! Earl Monroe was a real secret, huh? A real secret? If you hadn't taken him, he'd have gone third!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Father Mancuso was a lawyer, {{judge of}} the Catholic Court and {{psychotherapist}} who lived at the local Sacred Heart Rectory. He arrived to perform the blessing while George and Kathy were unpacking their belongings {{on the afternoon of}} December 18, 1975, and went into the building to carry out the rites. When he flicked the first holy water and began to pray, he heard a masculine voice demand that he [...] "get out." [...] When leaving the house, Father Mancuso did not mention this incident to either George or Kathy. On December 24, 1975, Father Mancuso called George Lutz and advised him {{to stay out of the}} second floor room where he had heard the mysterious voice, the former bedroom of Marc and John Matthew DeFeo that Kathy planned to use as a sewing room, but the call was cut short by static. Following his visit to the house, Father Mancuso allegedly developed a high fever and blisters on his hands similar to stigmata. At first George and Kathy experienced nothing unusual in the house. Talking about their experiences subsequently, they reported that it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> [...] "were each living in a different house." ...|$|E
