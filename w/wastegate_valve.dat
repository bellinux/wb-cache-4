50|$|The {{simplest}} {{control for}} a wastegate is a mechanical linkage {{that allows the}} operator to directly control the <b>wastegate</b> <b>valve</b> position. This manual control is used in some turbo-charged light aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Even with an {{electronic}} controller, actuator springs that are too soft can cause the wastegate to open before desired. Exhaust gas backpressure is still pushing against the <b>wastegate</b> <b>valve</b> itself. This backpressure can overcome the spring pressure {{without the aid of}} the actuator at all. Electronic control may still enable control of boost to over double gauge pressure of the spring's rated pressure.|$|E
25|$|The {{control of}} {{turbocharger}} boost {{has changed dramatically}} over the 100-plus years of their use. Modern turbochargers can use <b>wastegates,</b> blow-off <b>valves</b> and variable geometry, as discussed in later sections.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>wastegate</b> is a <b>valve</b> that diverts {{exhaust gases}} {{away from the}} turbine wheel in a {{turbocharged}} engine system.|$|R
50|$|In {{automotive}} applications, 'boost' {{refers to}} the amount by which intake manifold pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure. This {{is representative of the}} extra air pressure that is achieved over what would be achieved without the forced induction. The level of boost may be shown on a pressure gauge, usually in bar, psi or possibly kPa.The control of turbocharger boost has changed dramatically over the 100-plus years of their use. Modern turbochargers can use <b>wastegates,</b> blow-off <b>valves</b> and variable geometry, as discussed in later sections.|$|R
50|$|About a year later, in May 1985, the Prisma {{turbo diesel}} {{was added to}} the range. The 1.9-litre engine from the Prisma diesel {{received}} a KKK turbocharger with <b>wastegate</b> <b>valve,</b> an intercooler and an oil cooler; its gearbox was the same ZF 5-speed unit used on the Delta HF turbo. Power was 80 PS and torque 17.5 kgm Nm. The turbo diesel Prisma adopted disk brakes, wheels and tyres from the top-of-the-range 1600 as well as similarly rich equipment, and added standard power steering.|$|E
5000|$|The 208's {{engine was}} given a single KKK {{turbocharger}} with <b>wastegate</b> <b>valve,</b> Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and Marelli electronic ignition.Forced induction increased power to [...] at 7000 rpm. A GTS version was introduced a year later, in 1983.Both outside and inside the 208 Turbo was almost identical to the contemporary 308 Quattrovalvole. It could be recognized by NACA ducts {{in front of the}} rear wheel well openings and [...] "turbo" [...] badging on the tail and shrouded exhaust pipes; the normally optional deep front spoiler, black roof aileron were standard.|$|E
50|$|An {{internal}} wastegate is {{a built-in}} bypass valve and passage within the turbocharger housing which allows excess exhaust pressure {{to bypass the}} turbine into the downstream exhaust. Control of the internal <b>wastegate</b> <b>valve</b> by a pressure signal from the intake manifold is identical to that of an external wastegate. Advantages include simpler and more compact installation, with no external wastegate piping. Additionally, all waste exhaust gases are automatically routed back into the catalytic converter and exhaust system. Many OEM turbochargers are of this type. Disadvantages in comparison to an external wastegate include a limited ability to bleed off exhaust pressure due to the relatively small diameter of the internal bypass valve, and less efficient performance under boost conditions.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIncreasing {{the degrees}} of freedom in the air path has become a popular {{way to reduce the}} fuel {{consumption}} and pollutant emissions of modern combustion engines. That is why technical definitions will usually contain components such as multi or single-stage turbocharger, throttle, exhaust gas recirculation loops, <b>wastegate,</b> variable <b>valve</b> timing or phasing, etc. One of the biggest challenges is to precisely quantify the gas flows through the engine. They include fresh and burnt gases, with trapping and scavenging phenomena. An accurate prediction of these values leads to an efficient control of the engine air fuel ratio and torque. Fuel consumption and pollutant emissions are then minimized. In this paper, we propose to use an artificial neural networkbased model as a prediction tool for the engine volumetric efficiency. Results are presented for a downsized turbocharged spark-ignited engine, equipped with inlet and outlet variable valve timing. The calibration process that is used in this study only requires steady-state operating points. The validation stage was conducted on both steady-state and vehicle transients. Model prediction is in very good agreement with experimental results while keeping a very low calibration effort and matching embedded computational requirements. The conclusion stresses that thanks to their generic structure, neural models offer an interesting potential for generalization to even more complex technical definitions...|$|R
40|$|The {{engine and}} vehicle design in Formula SAE {{competition}} has {{to accomplish a}} strict regulation. In order to limit the maximum power, an air restrictor of 20 mm of diameter is imposed in the intake line. To overcome the limitations caused by the restrictor, Firenze Race Team equipped its one-cylinder engine with a turbocharger, which is conventionally provided with a <b>wastegate</b> (WG) <b>valve</b> to limit the maximum boost pressure and avoid knocking phenomena. Typically, the WG valve is controlled by a pneumatic actuator, which opens the valve according to a defined and constant maximum boost pressure downstream the compressor in the whole engine operating range. Therefore, the boost pressure at high engine speed, in which knocking problems are less intense and the volumetric efficiency is lower, {{is limited by the}} threshold value defined at medium-low engine speeds, i. e. the pneumatic WG limits the maximum power that the engine can supply. In this study, the implementation of an electronic control system for the WG valve is described together with a dedicated control strategy aimed at providing the desired boost pressure at full load for each engine speed, {{in order to get the}} maximum power avoiding knocking phenomena. The electronic WG provided higher power values and a more extended torque curve in comparison to the conventional pneumatic one...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a frequency-domain methodology for robust systemcontrol design, and its application in airpath {{control of a}} real turbocharged Diesel engine with intake throttle and exhaust gas re-circulation system. The objective {{is to find a}} robust control-system which reduces pollutant emission. The three inputs (throttle, <b>wastegate</b> and EGR <b>valves)</b> and two outputs (airflow and boost pressure) of the airpath make the system complex. AMulti InputMulti Output (MIMO) fractional order approach called CRONE (French abbreviation which means robust control of a non integer order) is used to design a non-square control-system for this non-linear plant. Firstly, a multisine signal is used for the system-identification, the airpath inputs are excited around all operating points in order to find a linear model of the plant. Then, the frequency responses of a defined nominal plant and experimental plant are taken into account to design the MIMO control-system using the CRONE shaping approach which permits to maintain performance and robust stability around a wide set of operating points. Finally, pollutant emission results from a driving cycle in test-bench show the relevance of the proposed approach...|$|R
5000|$|The {{turbocharger}} was {{a reverse}} rotation Mitsubishi TD04LR-15Gk with a 6 cm2 turbine inlet. Tight packaging forced some creative {{thinking on the}} turbocharger. The TD04 compressor has a compressor bypass valve built right into the compressor housing. The exhaust manifold and turbine housing were cast in one piece by Mitsubishi from high-nickel Ni-Resist steel. The one-piece design improved flow, reduced size and reduced thermal mass for quicker cat light-off. The turbine discharge was {{also part of the}} manifold/turbine housing casting, and it looped back around and hit the manifold again {{on its way to the}} catalytic converter. Where they met, there was a wastegate valve; keeping the <b>wastegate</b> <b>valve</b> away from the turbine housing improved flow where it mattered most. Maximum boost in stock form was around [...] Piston velocities and valve-train components force a rev limit of 6240 rpm although MOPAR upped the ante with their Stage 2 and 3 kits which have a rev limit of 6500 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{performance}} Delta was the Delta HF, {{which was}} introduced in July 1983 and went on sale in September after a first appearance at the Frankfurt Motor Show. the HF acronym—last used on the Stratos—stood for [...] "High Fidelity", and had been used on performance version of Lancia cars since 1966. It was front-wheel drive and powered by a turbocharged version of the 1.6-litre engine from the Delta GT; the system used a Garrett TBO- 225 turbocharger with <b>wastegate</b> <b>valve,</b> an air-to-air heat exchanger, a blow-through twin-choke Weber carburetor and Marelli Microplex ignition with pre-ignition control. To withstand the additional stress deriving from turbocharging upgrades {{were made to the}} oil system, with increased capacity and an oil cooler, and to the heads with sodium-filled valves. The gearbox was a ZF 5-speed unit. Dampers, springs and steering were retuned, and the tyres were wide 175/65 Michelin TRX on R 340 alloy wheels. In true Lancia tradition the exterior of the HF was relatively understated: changes were limited to silver [...] "HF" [...] badging on the grille, a deeper chin spoiler, black trim as on the GT, black roof drip rail mouldings, black side skirts with small silver [...] "turbo" [...] badges in front of the rear wheels, the 1982 roof spoiler painted in black, air intake cowls on the bonnet grilles, bronze-tinted athermic glass and 8-spoke alloy wheels.The cabin featured a leather-covered steering wheel and supplementary digital instrumentation with bar indicators; the upholstery material was the usual Zegna fabric, and Recaro sport seats covered in the same cloth optional. About ten thousand Delta HF were made, in a two-year production period.|$|E
50|$|The HF turbo soon {{lost its}} crown as {{top-of-the-range}} Delta, as the turbocharged 2.0-litre and four-wheel drive Delta HF 4WD was unveiled at the April 1986 Turin Motor Show.Some {{of the features}} of the HF 4WD previewed a major mid-cycle refresh for the entire Delta range, announced in May 1986 and put on sale in June.New enveloping bumpers—the front one with provisions for integrated fog lights—gave the car a more modern look; the entire front end was changed with a new grille and new headlight covers, which were slanted forward and protruded from the bodywork {{in an effort to make}} the car more aerodynamic. The roof spoiler introduced in 1982 was removed.Seven models composed the 1986 range: 1.3, LX 1.3, 1.5 Automatica, GT i.e., HF turbo, HF 4WD and turbo ds.Entry-level model was the 1.3; the 1,301 cc engine had revised intake and exhaust system, fuel cut-off, a new carburettor and breakerless ignition. It was also available on the more upscale LX 1.3. Similar changes were made to the powertrain of the Delta 1.5 Automatica.The Delta GT and HF turbo were given Weber IAW integrated electronic ignition and fuel injection system to become the Delta GT i.e. and the Delta HF turbo i.e., with 108 PS and 140 PS respectively. Deeper changes had been made to the GT i.e. engine: the cylinder head had been rotated 180°, bringing the exhaust side to the front for better cooling, and the whole engine was canted forward 18° to lower its centre of gravity. Delta HF turbo was updated to HF 4WD looks and interior, from which it differed mainly for the square headlights and single exhaust.Delta turbo ds marked the introduction of the first diesel engine on the Delta. This was a 1,929 cc 8-valve four-cylinder from the Prisma, with an output of 80 PS; it used a KKK turbocharger with <b>wastegate</b> <b>valve,</b> an intercooler and an oil cooler. The turbo ds was positioned on the market like the GT i.e., and given similarly complete standard equipment comprising such features as an oil pressure gauge, boost pressure gauge and power steering.|$|E
40|$|The aim of master’s thesis was to {{put forward}} {{calculation}} methodology of wastegate turbocharger bypass channel discharge coefficient. Designed methodology was based on discharge coefficient analysis conducted utilizing CFD simulations of turbocharger turbine-side parametric model. It was achieved to propose a calculation, which differentiates relatively in average 1, 4 % from CFD data. New methodology improves the accuracy bypass channel design and helps to choose appropriate <b>wastegate</b> <b>valve</b> actuator...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{downsized}} {{internal combustion}} engines benefit from high-efficiency turbocharging systems for increasing their volumetric efficiency. However, despite the efficiency increase, turbochargers often lack of fast transient response {{due to the}} nature of the energy exchange with the engine which deteriorates the vehicle’s drivability. An electrically-assisted turbocharger can be used for improving the transient response without any parasitic losses to the engine while providing energy recovery to increase overall system efficiency. The present study provides a detailed numerical investigation on the potential of e-turbocharging to control load and if possible replace <b>wastegate</b> <b>valve.</b> A parametric study of the optimum compressor/turbine sizing and wastegate area was performed for maximum torque, fast response time and energy regeneration across the real driving conditions speed/load area of the engine. The results showed that the implementation of a motor-generator can contribute to reducing the response time of the engine by up to 90 % while improving its thermal efficiency and generating up to 1 kWh of energy. Suppressing the wastegate can only be achieved when a larger turbine is implemented which as a result deteriorates the engine’s response and leads to energy provision demands at low engine speeds...|$|E
40|$|In some turbochargers, boost {{pressure}} {{is reduced by}} opening the <b>wastegate</b> <b>valve.</b> In a modern turbo charged car, the most common way for opening the wastegate is with a pneumatic actuator and an air control solenoid, controlled by the ECU. In the control systems studied the ECU utilizes a static feedforward and a PID controller, {{for the purpose of}} making the {{boost pressure}} follow its reference value. With no systematic method for tuning the controller, this can be time consuming, and a set of well defined experiments to determine PID parameters are desired. When test time in a real engine is limited or expensive, it is advantageousto work in a simulation environment before doing live tests. A model for thewastegate actuator and air control solenoid is developed in the thesis. This is used to simulate controller performance before any tests in a real car is performed. In the thesis a tuning method for the PID controller based on step responsesis proposed. The tuning method evaluated is the IMC-choice of controller fora second order system, and it has a single design parameter not given by theexperiments. The controller is shown to give desired behavior when the staticfeedforward is correct or has small error...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} engine system {{simulation}} using thermodynamics and chemical kinetic models {{to investigate the}} performance and efficiency of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines for stationary applications. It includes the development of software as well as models for engine, turbocharger, intercooler, inlet and exhaust manifolds, <b>wastegate</b> <b>valve,</b> inlet air humidifier, inlet air heater and more. The engine model can be classified as a one-zone, zero-dimensional and includes sub-models for in-cylinder heat transfer, exhaust port heat transfer, heat release and the valve flow process. The turbocharger model is developed in steps {{and is based on}} a polynomial fit to experimental compressor and turbine performance data. Inlet and exhaust manifolds are treated as well-mixed volumes. A simplified model for the humidifier is adopted in order to simulate a humid air motor (HAM) concept. The whole engine system is zero dimensional and the different system components are linked by means of mean values for mass flow, temperatures, pressures and gas composition. The NASA-polynomials are used for calculating thermal and transport properties. The extended Zeldovich mechanism is used as an indicator of significant NO formation. The models are validated through comparisons with experiments on mainly diesel and HCCI engines, both cycle and system results. HCCI engine cycle simulations are made, showing the influence of various engine parameters e. g. compression ratio, engine speed, air-fuel ratio, exhaust gas recycling, inlet pressure and valve timing. Mainly natural gas and landfill gas are studied. The self-stabilizing feature of HCCI ignition timing is investigated using chemical kinetics. HCCI engine system simulations are made, both with (to find ignition timing) and without chemical kinetics, investigating turbocharging and the influence of turbine size. The HCCI - HAM concept is investigated and compared to simpler systems...|$|E
40|$|The high {{demands on}} low fuel {{consumption}} and low emissions on the combustion engines of both today, and the future, is {{highly dependent on}} advanced control systems {{in order to fulfill}} these demands. The control systems and strategies are based on models which describe the physical system. The more accuratly the models describe the real world system, the more accurate the control will be, leading to better fuel economy and lower emissions. This master's thesis investigates and improves the mass flow model used for a compressible restriction, such as over the throttle valve, EGR valve, or the <b>wastegate</b> <b>valve,</b> for example. The standard model is evaluated and an improvement is proposed which does not assume isentropic flow. This seems to explain the deviation from the isentropic Psi-function shown in earlier research such as (Andersson: 2005). Furthermore a throttle valve is analyzed in ANSYS in order to show the generation of entropy. The presence of pressure pulsations in a combustion engine is also evaluated, especially how they effect the otherwise assumed steady flow model. It is tested if a mean value pressure is sufficient or if one needs to take the pulsations in to account, and the result shows that a mean pressure is sufficient, at least for the throttle when typical intake manifold pulsations is present. A dynamic flow model is also derived which can be useful for pressure ratios close to one. The dynamic flow model is based on the standard equation but with an extra dynamic term, however it is not implemented and tested due to complexity and time limitation. The proposed new non-isentropic flow model has proven promising and can hopefully lead to lower emissions and better fuel economy...|$|E
