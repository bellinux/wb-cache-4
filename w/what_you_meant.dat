500|$|Gay {{references}} {{have been}} made to {{the relationship between the two}} characters of the show. House has made a comment about the relationship ("I'm gay!...Oh that's not <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>meant.</b> It would explain a lot, though: no girlfriend, always with Wilson, the obsession with sneakers..."). [...] Barbara Barnett said that [...] "House is the needy one in the relationship, and Wilson the doormat" [...] Verne Gay of Newsday described House's love for Wilson as [...] "touching and genuine". However, Robert Sean Leonard compared the relationship between the two to that of Cesar Millan and his Pit Bull, while Hugh Laurie said that it's [...] "not just buddydom". The two characters appeared on the October 13, 2008, cover of TV Guide.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{continued}} making crank {{calls as}} MacPhisto, but the targets {{changed with the}} location of each concert. Many of them were local politicians that Bono wished to mock by engaging them in character as the devil. He enjoyed making these calls, saying, [...] "When you're dressed as the Devil, your conversation is immediately loaded, so if you tell somebody you really like what they're doing, you know it's not a compliment." [...] The band intended for MacPhisto to add humour while making a point. Said the Edge, [...] "That character was a great device for saying the opposite of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>meant.</b> It made the point so easily and with real humor." [...] A female Cardiff fan who was pulled on-stage questioned Bono's motives for dressing as the devil, prompting the singer to compare his act to {{the plot of the}} C. S. Lewis novel The Screwtape Letters.|$|E

5000|$|Winnie {{comments}} sourly, [...] "Usual drivel". But Mrs Shower {{provides an}} oblique answer: [...] "What’s {{the idea of}} <b>you,</b> she says, <b>what</b> are <b>you</b> <b>meant</b> to mean?".|$|R
6000|$|The pause {{of which}} she paid it the {{deference}} was charged like a brimming cup. [...] "Is that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> really <b>meant</b> by your condition just now--that when I do see him I shall not speak to him?" ...|$|R
500|$|Caxias {{tried to}} secure {{support from the}} {{traditional}} saquarema leadership. They attempted, however, to use him as a figurehead and to further their own agendas. He commented to Paranhos: [...] "I see <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>meant,</b> {{with respect to the}} bizarre behavior of these gentlemen, who do not wish to govern the country, when they are invited to do so, because they prefer to govern the Government. They are completely mistaken about me, since I am not disposed to serve them as a hobbyhorse." [...] Lacking support in parliament, Caxias' cabinet resigned on 24 May 1862 after losing its majority in the Chamber of Deputies (the national legislature's lower house). PedroII asked members of the Liga Progressista (Progressive League)—a new party consisting of moderate Conservatives and Liberals—to form a new cabinet. Barely a month later, Caxias' only son died at age 14 of unknown causes. There was a small consolation at the end of 1862 when, on 2 December, he was made brevet marechal de exército (army marshal), the highest rank in the Brazilian army.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} is a transcript provided by [...] from a [...] in which John Mueller of Google speaks about the Title tag {{and its relation to}} SEO:DANIEL PICKEN: I had a quick question. And John, it was about something you said a few weeks ago, actually. You said the title tag is a ranking signal, but you said that you use a part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And I was just wondering <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>meant</b> by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search. Help says pretty much the same things, as does Matt Cutts, in one of this [...]|$|E

6000|$|She was {{instantly}} all there. [...] "Of course I know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> allude to. I asked <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> had <b>meant</b> by saying, {{the day you}} came to see me, just before you left me, that you'd save me. And you then said--at our friend's--that you'd have really to wait to see, for yourself, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly {{you ought}} not, Ciceley. If <b>you</b> heard <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were not <b>meant</b> to hear, <b>you</b> ought never {{to say a}} word about it to anyone." ...|$|R

60|$|Aur. Kill me not quite, {{with this}} indifference! When you are guiltless, boast not an offence. I know you better than {{yourself}} you know: Your heart was true, but did some frailty shew: You promised him your love, that I might live; But promised <b>what</b> <b>you</b> never <b>meant</b> to give.

60|$|L (seeing {{objections}} {{begin to}} express themselves in the eyes). Now you needn't say you can't; for you can: and it's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were <b>meant</b> to do, always; and to dress your houses, and your gardens, too; and to do very little else, I believe, except singing; and dancing, as we said, of course; and--one thing more.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry, Leonard," [...] she said, [...] "but I think I must go and fetch father now. You {{can walk}} with me there, if you will. It {{has been very good}} to see you again.
