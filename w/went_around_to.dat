25|$|On November 6, 1986 Eastern Air Lines Captain George Baines {{was flying}} {{in his private}} aircraft, a Piper PA-23 (N2185P), from his home to Tampa International to catch a flight. As he {{approached}} Tampa International's runway 36L (now 1L) in heavy fog, he declared a missed approach and <b>went</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> try it again. On the second attempt, he touched down on a parallel taxiway and ultimately collided with a Pan Am 727–200 that was taxiing on this taxiway. Baines lost {{his life in the}} accident. He was the only fatality. No other injuries were reported.|$|E
500|$|Tricky {{eventually}} grew {{frustrated with}} {{his role in}} Massive Attack, finding it limiting, and wanted to record an album with a female vocalist whose singing would offer another dimension to his lyrics and their meaning. In 1993, he discovered Martina Topley-Bird, then a teenager at Clifton College, {{when he saw her}} sitting against a wall near his house, singing to herself. [...] "That's really how it happened," [...] she recalled. [...] "A few weeks later, I <b>went</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> his house with some friends. We'd been drinking cider after our GCSEs. We were banging on his door, but he wasn't in. Then Mark Stewart, who lived there, came up to us and said: 'Yeah, this is Tricky's house, jump in through the window.'" [...] Tricky, whose lyrics had matured from raps about street violence and sex to more personal and introspective writing, said Topley-Bird found his songs [...] "quite depressing", which he believed was because of her more privileged background: [...] "It's just reality. She's been a student all her life, grew up in Somerset, and I don't think she's ever faced the real world. She finds it all a bit weird. But she's my best mate." [...] They would form a musical and romantic partnership over subsequent years, and their first recording together, [...] "Aftermath", later appeared on Maxinquaye. After offering the song to Massive Attack, who were not interested in including it on their 1991 album Blue Lines, Tricky released [...] "Aftermath" [...] independently to local record stores in September 1993 before he signed a record deal with 4th & B'way.|$|E
2500|$|Ament was {{subsequently}} released {{at the direction}} of the German military commander, Count Alfred von Waldersee. Wilbur Chamberlin, a reporter for the New York Sun, sent to China, reported in a letter dated 9 February 1901 to his wife:My missionary friend, the Rev. A., is out of limbo....Quite a long time ago he had a scheme for collecting damages for all his native Christians and his church from the Chinese themselves. He <b>went</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> some forty villages and collected 80,000 taels. A few days ago he went back there and was promptly arrested at the instigation of some Roman Catholics. It appears they had the same sort of scheme, but A. got there first, and when they <b>went</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> these same villages to make their collections, they found out that he had all the money there was. Naturally, they were enraged, so they made complaint against A., and declared that he had been blackmailing the villages....I really think, myself, that A. might have left a little for the Catholics. I don't like to see a man take it all, even if he is a missionary." [...] Chamberlin indicated that the French and Germans, under pressure from the Americans, released him, insisting that he was never under arrest.|$|E

2500|$|Netanyahu defines {{capitalism}} as [...] "the {{ability to}} have individual initiative and competition to produce goods and services with profit, but not to shut out somebody else from {{trying to do the}} same." [...] He says that his views developed while he was working as an economic consult for Boston Consulting Group: [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the Boston Consulting Group looked at governments and worked for governments. They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I <b>went</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could see that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth... And I said, well, if I ever have a chance, I'll change that." ...|$|E
