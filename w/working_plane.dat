5000|$|Multiple purpose designs {{incorporate}} improved tripod and H-frame features {{with extra}} multiple adjustment capabilities that include finite rotational, {{horizontal and vertical}} adjustment of the <b>working</b> <b>plane.</b> Four extendable armatures securely lock a canvas or drawing board to the easel, thus allowing any part of a painting to be instantly re-positioned at any height or angle whilst painting. This includes bringing the working area directly underneath the brush or pen hand. The front and all four sides of a canvas are untouched by the easel. The easel folds down to a compact size. While painting, it can be moved without the canvas falling off. The ergonomic design aims to remove the physical pain and discomfort experienced when using traditional A- or H-frame easels and offer improved brush control. Consequently, an artist can work faster with no loss of quality and can experiment with different mediums and techniques while achieving noticeable improvement in their paintings. This easel design allows {{for it to be}} used in a studio, outdoors or for display, and was invented and designed by Australian artist and author Tony Barber.|$|E

40|$|Daylight {{illuminance}} uniformity is {{a common}} criterion when assessing the performance of fenestration and solar control. To evaluate a design according to this requirement, a grid of horizontal illuminance readings for a given time is required. In simulation based assessments, this can be calculated by defining sensor points at <b>working</b> <b>plane</b> level and running a simulation for a single time step, or an annual simulation to assess the uniformity for a typical year. Backing such predicted assessments with measured data has been a task involving installation and calibration of sensors, cabling and data acquisition systems, which typically render the assessed space unusable for the time of assessment. Using sequential readings from handheld devices as a convenient alternative ignores the dynamics of daylight, as the sky conditions cannot be assumed constant during {{the time required to}} record the illuminance at the required amount of locations. We propose instantaneous image-based measurements of horizontal illuminance for assessments of daylight uniformity. Instead of cabled sensors, near-Lambertian reflectors are placed at <b>working</b> <b>plane</b> level in the assessed space. High Dynamic Range (HDR) images of the <b>working</b> <b>plane</b> with markers are taken and the luminance of the marker surfaces is extracted from the corresponding pixel values. These luminance values can be used to calculate horizontal illuminance for each marker location, assuming Lambertian reflection.

The paper has analyzed a cross-sectional shape of the obtained dimple with due account of the solidified metal flows formed along its edges.

According to cutting theory provisions the paper considers solidified metal flow shapes in a longitudinal section and indicates angles which have been formed by the flows, <b>working</b> <b>planes</b> and edges which can be involved in the cutting process. It has been shown that cutting elements on the dimple surface are arranged symmetrically that makes it possible to carry out cutting process while moving a tool in both directions of reciprocating motion.

It has been demonstrated that due to changes in energy of electric discharge through voltage or capacity of a power supply storage capacitor it is possible purposefully to influence on the shape and size of metal flows and, respectively, on values of cutting wedge parameters that characterize a tool cutting ability.

Using their model, this study intends to investigate indoor ventilation performance by examining mass flow rate and average velocity on the <b>working</b> <b>plane</b> using computational fluid dynamics.

The numerical results indicate that, for single-sided ventilation, the provision of balconies increases mass flow rate and reduces average velocity on the <b>working</b> <b>plane</b> in most rooms, but for cross ventilation, this provision has no significant effect under normally or obliquely incident wind conditions.
