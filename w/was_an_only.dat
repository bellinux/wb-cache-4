5|$|Born on January 16, 1980, Pujols {{was raised}} in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, mostly by his grandmother, America Pujols, and 10 of his uncles and aunts. He <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>only</b> child. His father, Bienvenido Pujols, was a {{softball}} pitcher, {{but he was also}} an alcoholic. Albert often had to take his father home when his father got drunk following the games. Growing up, Pujols practiced baseball using limes for balls and a milk carton for a glove. Pujols, his father, and his grandmother immigrated in 1996 to New York City, where Albert witnessed a shooting at a grocery store. Partly because of the shooting, they moved to Independence, Missouri, two months later to join some relatives.|$|E
5|$|Merrick {{settled into}} {{his new life}} at the London Hospital. Treves visited him daily and {{spent a couple of}} hours with him every Sunday. Now that Merrick had found someone who {{understood}} his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor. Treves and Merrick built a friendly relationship, although Merrick never completely confided in him. He told Treves that he <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>only</b> child, and Treves had the impression that Merrick's mother, whose picture Merrick always carried with him, had abandoned him as a baby. Merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers. It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.|$|E

25|$|Derksen {{was born}} in Heteren, Gelderland into a right-wing Protestant family. He {{describes}} his father as being a very strict policeman, both professionally and at home. Ever {{since he was a}} child, he wanted to become a drummer.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1900, King Alexander {{suddenly}} announced his engagement to the widowed Madame Draga Mašin, formerly a lady-in-waiting {{to his mother and}} 12 years older than him. The proposed union aroused great opposition: not only was Draga of unequal birth and obscure family, but at 36 years of age, the chances of her bearing an heir were slim. Alexander <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>only</b> child, and it was imperative to secure the succession.|$|E
25|$|Born at Bourg-en-Bresse, in the département of Ain.

25|$|Stone {{attended}} Trinity School in New York City {{before his}} parents sent him away to The Hill School, a college-preparatory school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. His parents were divorced abruptly {{while he was}} away at school (1962) and this, because he <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>only</b> child, marked him deeply. Stone's mother was often absent and his father made {{a big impact on}} his life; father-son relationships were to feature heavily in Stone's films perhaps because of this.|$|E

Divorce was uncommon in the 1940s, and this contributed to Entwistle becoming reserved and socialising little.|$|E
25|$|As for her birthplace, Saigon and British Hong Kong {{appear to}} be most {{credible}} versions, but places like Singapore, Switzerland or even Transylvania have also been rumoured as the singer's birthplace by different sources. She <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>only</b> child to her parents who later divorced. Most sources, including Lear's 1965 wedding certificate, confirm that {{her father was a}} French army officer, possibly of British origin. Her mother appears to have had a Russo-Asiatic background. In a 1976 interview with Carmen Thomas for a German television show, Lear confirmed that her father was British and mother was Russian, and that they had already both died. However, she would later claim her mother had a French background.|$|E

On his father's side, Rashi has been {{claimed to be}} a 33rd generation descendant of Yochanan Hasandlar, who was a fourth-generation descendant of Gamaliel the Elder, who was reputedly descended from the royal line of King David. In his voluminous writings, Rashi himself made no such claim at all. The main early rabbinical source about his ancestry, Responsum No. 29 by Solomon Luria, makes no such claim either.|$|E
