5|$|Christian {{returned}} from his injury on February 19, 2012 at Elimination Chamber to show support for John Laurinaitis. Christian returned on the March 16 episode of SmackDown, hosting an episode of the 'Peep Show' and given a spot on Laurinaitis' team in a 12-man tag match at WrestleMania XXVIII. On the March 26 episode of Raw, {{as part of a}} storyline, Christian was injured once again after (kayfabe) re-aggravating his neck and shoulder in a match with CM Punk. This was to <b>write</b> <b>him</b> off at WrestleMania as it was later reported that Christian has not yet been fully medically cleared to compete due to a history of shoulder injuries. Despite the injury, Christian still appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony to induct long-time friend Edge.|$|E
5|$|The {{night after}} WrestleMania, Orton demanded a rematch, {{threatening}} Linda McMahon (Vince's wife) {{as well as}} their grandchildren. McMahon did not grant him the rematch but scheduled a six-man tag team match for the pay-per-view Backlash between Triple H and Shane and Vince McMahon and The Legacy, with a preview that evening between Vince and Orton. However, Raw's general manager at that time, Vickie Guerrero, made their six-man tag team match a WWE Championship match. The stipulation was that if Triple H's team won, he retained the championship, while if The Legacy won, Orton would win the title. As the singles match progressed, Shane and Triple H came to Vince's aid, causing both Rhodes and DiBiase to interfere until a returning Batista appeared and cleared the ring; McMahon then announced that Batista was to replace him in the match at Backlash. At the event, Orton won by pinning Triple H after an RKO and a running punt, leaving Triple H hospitalized according to the storyline. In spite of Triple H's absence, Shane McMahon continued his feud with the group, leading to another match between him and Orton on Raw. After the original match ended in a no contest due to interference, Rhodes and DiBiase won singles matches to be entered into a handicap match with all of The Legacy facing Shane later that night. This match was used to <b>write</b> <b>him</b> out of the storyline, as The Legacy members used the steel ring steps to shatter his ankle.|$|E
5|$|On the December 3 Raw, Orton began a {{feud with}} The Shield, {{after he was}} {{attacked}} by them following a victory over Brad Maddox. On the December 14 SmackDown, Orton was once again assaulted backstage by The Shield. This was used to <b>write</b> <b>him</b> off television due to a shoulder injury. Orton returned on the New Year’s Eve Raw, helping Ryback and Sheamus fend off The Shield. On the January 4 SmackDown, Orton declared his entry in the 2013 Royal Rumble match. On the January 11 SmackDown and the January 16 Main Event, Orton was again attacked by The Shield during his matches with Antonio Cesaro. On the February 1 SmackDown, Orton defeated longtime rival Wade Barrett to earn {{a spot in the}} Elimination Chamber match. On February 17 at Elimination Chamber, Orton eliminated Mark Henry and Chris Jericho before being the last man eliminated by Jack Swagger. In late February, Orton aligned himself with Sheamus to feud with the Shield. Over the next weeks, Orton and Sheamus saved each other from attacks by The Shield and Big Show. On the March 15 SmackDown, Orton and Sheamus were then allowed to pick a third partner to face the Shield in a six-man tag team match at Wrestlemania 29 an chose Ryback. Three days later on Raw, however, Ryback was booked in another match for the event, leaving the spot open. Later that night, Big Show saved the two from an attack by The Shield and was immediately recruited as their partner. On April 7 at WrestleMania 29, Orton, Sheamus and Show were defeated by The Shield, after which, both men were knocked out by Show. The following night on Raw, Orton and Sheamus faced off in a match to earn a match with Big Show, however, the match ended in a no contest after Show interfered. Orton and Sheamus then teamed up to defeat Show in two handicap matches, first on the April 12 SmackDown via count-out, and second on the April 15 Raw via pinfall. On the April 19 SmackDown, Orton and Sheamus were defeated by Big Show and Mark Henry in a tag team match. The feud between Big Show and Orton led to an Extreme Rules match at Extreme Rules, which Orton won.|$|E

25|$|A second {{invasion}} {{was planned}} {{in the winter}} of 55–54 for the summer of 54 BC. Cicero wrote letters to his friend Gaius Trebatius Testa and his brother Quintus, both of whom were serving in Caesar's army, expressing his excitement at the prospect. He urged Trebatius to capture him a war chariot, and asked Quintus to <b>write</b> <b>him</b> a description of the island. Trebatius, as it turned out, did not go to Britain, but Quintus did, and wrote him several letters from there – as did Caesar himself.|$|E
25|$|The creators found {{themselves}} with {{a problem with the}} character of Lt. Aiden Ford (Rainbow Sun Francks) in season two, a first season regular that the producers, and the actor himself, felt had not worked as intended and was highly underused as a result. Unwilling to <b>write</b> <b>him</b> out, the writers came up with an idea to make the character more important, but that downgraded him to recurring. To replace him, they created Ronon Dex as a sidekick for Lt. Col. John Sheppard, but finding an actor with the physical presence and the acting ability necessary was not easy until they saw Jason Momoa's tape. X-files veteran Mitch Pileggi and Kavan Smith were added to the cast in the recurring roles of Col. Steven Caldwell and Maj. Evan Lorne. Paul McGillion's character, Dr. Carson Beckett, became a regular in season two.|$|E

25|$|Shane {{returned}} on the March 30 {{episode of}} Raw, alongside Triple H {{and his father}} Vince McMahon, to confront and attack The Legacy (Randy Orton, Ted DiBiase, and Cody Rhodes). On the April 6 episode of Raw, {{it was announced that}} Shane would compete in a six-man tag team match against The Legacy at Backlash alongside Triple H and Batista, the latter of whom had returned from injury, where the stipulation was that if any member of Orton's team pinned any member of Triple H's team, Orton would win Triple H's WWE Championship; however, if any member of Orton's team was counted out or disqualified, Triple H would retain the title. On the May 4 episode of Raw, Shane's character suffered a broken leg and ankle at the hands of Orton and Legacy as a way to <b>write</b> <b>him</b> out of the story. In October 2009, Shane announced his resignation from WWE which went into effect {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|On May 24 at a WWE live {{event in}} Brazil, Jericho {{wrestled}} a match against CM Punk, during which Jericho crumpled up and kicked a Brazilian flag, causing local police {{to intervene and}} threaten Jericho with arrest. Jericho issued an apology to the audience, enabling the event to resume. The following day, WWE suspended Jericho for 30 days while apologizing {{to the people and}} government of Brazil. Jericho returned on the June 25 episode of Raw, and his absence was explained by a European tour with his band Fozzy which happened to coincide with his suspension. At Money in the Bank, Jericho participated in the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match, but failed to win. The following night on Raw, Jericho confronted newly crowned Mr. Money in the Bank, Dolph Ziggler, who claimed that Jericho had lost his touch. Jericho attacked Ziggler with a Codebreaker, thus turning into a fan favorite in the process {{for the first time since}} 2008. At SummerSlam, Jericho defeated Ziggler. The following night on Raw, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch and, as a result, Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated as per a pre match stipulation put in place by Raw General Manager, AJ Lee. This was used to <b>write</b> <b>him</b> off so he could tour with Fozzy for the remainder of the year.|$|E

It was co-written by Cyrus (credited {{under her}} birth name Destiny Hope Cyrus), Brian Green, Wendy Foy Green, and produced by Brian Green. [...] "I Miss You" [...] is a homage to Cyrus' late grandfather, Ron Cyrus, who died in February 28, 2006. He was diagnosed with mesothelioma, and, seeing her grandfather nearing death, Cyrus wanted to <b>write</b> <b>him</b> a song prior to his death. It was released to Radio Disney mid-year 2007 as promotion for the dual disc [...] The song is a ballad with rock and country influences.|$|E
500|$|He {{helped the}} Tangerines {{to record a}} sixth-place finish in 1953–54, though hopes of {{retaining}} their FA Cup title were ended with a defeat to Port Vale at Vale Park in the Fifth Round. Matthews missed just eight league games in 1954–55, though journalists were keen to <b>write</b> <b>him</b> off with every occasional off-performance and missed game – [...] "it was all balderdash", he replied. Despite his age, and more pertinently the media's constant references to his age, Arsenal manager Tom Whittaker tried, unsuccessfully, to lure Matthews to Highbury with a lucrative, if somewhat illegal approach.|$|E
500|$|After the end {{of season}} 1, the series producers, and the actor himself, felt that Ford had not worked as {{intended}} and was highly underused as a result.

Producer Joseph Mallozzi said in 2009 that [...] "We can assume [...] went down [...] with the ship" [...] in [...] "The Hive". Rainbow Sun Francks was disappointed about the evolution of his character, saying Ford did not evolve a backstory which the other characters did. Although Francks called the situation [...] "tough", he reacted positively towards the development of character during the second season.|$|E

500|$|Rasheed is {{an ethnic}} Pashtun, a shoemaker, and the {{antagonist}} of the novel. He marries Mariam through an arrangement with Jalil, and later marries Laila as well. After suffering years of domestic abuse at his hands, Mariam bludgeons Rasheed {{to death with}} a shovel during a violent struggle. Hosseini stated that he hoped to create a multi-layered character in Rasheed, saying, [...] "Rasheed's the embodiment of the patriarchal, tribal character. In writing him, I didn't want to <b>write</b> <b>him</b> as an irredeemable villain. He is a reprehensible person, but there are moments of humanity, such as his love for his son." [...] He identified an encounter with an Afghan man four years earlier as the foundation for this character; the man [...] "had a very sweet, subservient wife" [...] and had not yet informed her that he was planning to marry again.|$|E
500|$|After {{initially}} being {{a successful}} police officer, Marge becomes unenthusiastic about {{her job as}} everyone seems to be breaking the law, including Homer, whom she arrests for taking her hat and taunting her when she tries to <b>write</b> <b>him</b> a parking ticket. After being released, Homer hosts a poker game and finds Herman running a jean-counterfeiting operation in the Simpsons' garage. As Herman and his henchmen are about to beat him up, Marge bursts in. As she is cuffing {{the rest of the}} minions, Herman takes Homer hostage and runs to Bart's treehouse, with Marge in pursuit. Herman tries to escape using a pair of counterfeit jeans as a rope, but they rip and he falls to the ground. Wiggum informs Marge that they cannot hold Herman due to the evidence [...] "mysteriously disappearing", with him and the other cops openly stealing the jeans for themselves. Upset at the corruption on the force, Marge resigns.|$|E
500|$|Having {{appeared}} in six episodes {{of the third}} season and the first two of the fourth season, Blake Bashoff auditioned for and won the part of Moritz Stiefel in the Broadway musical Spring Awakening. He warned Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse {{that he would be}} unable to shoot Lost for at least six months beginning in December 2007, as he rehearsed for and performed in the production. Being [...] "big fans" [...] of the musical and congratulating Bashoff on what they thought was an [...] "amazing opportunity," [...] they brainstormed ideas with the other writers to <b>write</b> <b>him</b> out of the story while they still had him at their disposal. Having decided some time ago that Karl would eventually die, they pinpointed the episode. The cliffhanger of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] sees Karl shot dead by unseen killers in the jungle. Two episodes later, the character Miles Straume (Ken Leung) finds Karl partially buried in the jungle dirt, but this corpse is portrayed by a body double and not Bashoff. According to Bashoff, the writers hope that he can return to Lost at some point to [...] "serve a cool purpose like [...]" [...] In regard to his experience with Lost, Bashoff recounted that [...] "I love the show. 's a great group … and … you get to shoot in paradise"; however, he wished that he had learned more about Karl's backstory.|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} the second {{version of the}} song, Lennon {{wanted to do something}} different with it, as Martin remembered: [...] "He'd wanted it as a gentle dreaming song, but he said it had come out too raucous. He asked me if I could <b>write</b> <b>him</b> a new line-up with the strings. So I wrote a new score (with four trumpets and three cellos) and we recorded that, but he didn't like it." [...] Meanwhile, on 8 and 9 December, another basic track was recorded, using Mellotron, electric guitar, piano, backwards-recorded cymbals, and swarmandel, an Indian version of the zither. After reviewing the tapes of Martin's version and the original, Lennon told Martin that he liked both versions, although Martin had to tell Lennon that the orchestral score was at a faster tempo and in a higher key (B major) than the first version (A major). Lennon said, [...] "You can fix it, George", giving Martin and Geoff Emerick, the band's recording engineer, the difficult task of joining the two takes together. With only a pair of editing scissors, two tape machines and a vari-speed control, Emerick compensated for the differences in key and speed by increasing the speed of the first version and decreasing the speed of the second. He then spliced the versions together, starting the orchestral score {{in the middle of the}} second chorus. (Since the first version did not include a chorus after the first verse, he also spliced in the first seven words of the chorus from elsewhere in the first version.) The pitch-shifting in joining the versions gave Lennon's lead vocal a slightly other-worldly [...] "swimming" [...] quality.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. It was the second script Daniels wrote for the show. He thought the staff had previously done many episodes where Homer [...] "wasn't good at anything", so he {{tried to figure out}} something Homer was really good at, and he {{came up with the idea}} of Homer being a good husband. While Bart had been the star of the show during the early years, by Season 5, the focus had clearly shifted to Homer. Writer/showrunner Al Jean stated that because Homer is an adult character, he has more depth to him and thus storyline possibilities. Showrunner David Mirkin commented: [...] "Bart, to <b>write</b> <b>him</b> accurately as a child, he can only have so much depth at a certain age. With Homer, we try to explore all levels of adulthood. There are just more places to go. Writing Homer properly is the trick, he's our main rock of the whole series. Homer's IQ is fairly flexible, he won't necessarily understand how to open a door at some point, but he can name the Supreme Court justices. Finding that balance is key to making the show work and making it surprising and making it believable and emotionally grounded." [...] Mirkin was very fond of the fact that Homer and Marge have the biggest fight they have ever had on the show in the episode, and he thought it was a [...] "really great" [...] exploration of their marriage. He noticed that because Homer is thrown out of the house, the audience really worry about their relationship. Mirkin had been asked many times why Marge and Homer are still together, to which he replied that all people stay together even if they argue, [...] "there's some sort of connection".|$|E
