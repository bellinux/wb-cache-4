5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that <b>whatever</b> <b>happens,</b> happens by fate.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Spirit Fruit Society lived {{according}} to the following basic principles: seek happiness through selflessness; follow one's conscience; take responsibility for one's actions—and develop {{an awareness of the}} consequences of one's actions on others; and accept <b>whatever</b> <b>happens.</b> Beilhart believed very strongly in the individual's right to guide his own actions, and not be dictated to by others. While {{there was no mention of}} any kind of organization or hierarchy in any documents, as the leader, Beilhart likely made important decisions concerning the group. There is no record of any kind of internal conflict between members.|$|E

Practice is aimed at the removal of ignorance, not at the attainment of realisation.|$|E

The poem often refers to England as “mother” and America as “Daughter”, which emphasizes the bond Bradstreet feels herself to her home country.|$|E

She sings of how she is willing to sacrifice her immortality and pay the price, however hard it is, necessary to win Arindal (Wie muss ich doch beklagen). Arindal awakens and declares his joy at seeing Ada again, but she announces that he will abandon her the next day. Gernot, Gunther and Morald arrive with companions to fetch Arindal. Those who have not seen her before are struck by Ada's beauty and fear Arindal will not come. A procession of fairies {{comes out of the}} palace and Zemina and Farzana tell Ada that her father has died and she is now queen. Ada tells Arindal that they must part now but she will see him tomorrow. She asks him to swear that <b>whatever</b> <b>happens</b> he will not curse her. He swears it even though she takes back her request. She expresses her fear that they will both go under {{as a result of his}} breaking the oath.|$|E
25|$|The first track, «Babilla» (Puerto Rican jargon for Courage), {{serves as}} the album's intro, and its concept {{is similar to the}} one in his {{previous}} studio album, Desahogo, being a relief to all that annoys him, mentioning Donald Trump's xenophobia, sexual video games, religion and people who want to take advantage with his music. «Sentimiento» (Spanish for Feeling) talks about a beautiful and attractive woman who wants a sincere romantic relationship and getting married instead of money and luxury. «Se Escapa» (Spanish for She Escapes) is about respecting and taking care of one's girlfriend in order to not lose her. «Moriré» (Spanish for I Will Die) is a romantic ballad about dying for a woman if she is no longer interesed in one's feelings after a long relationship, using a lot of analogies centered in animals and nature. «El Silencio Mata» (Spanish for Silence Kills) talks about a woman who suffers of domestic violence but needs to talk to someone about that, although she's too scared to denounce his own spouse. «El Corazón Se Pone Bruto» (Spanish for The Heart Gets Stupid) is a moralizing reggaeton about thinking before acting and encouraging the use of preservative, telling two stories about girls that are attracted to men they recently know, both with terrible endings (one girl ends pregnant and the other contracting AIDS). «La Prueba de Farmacia» (Spanish for Pharmacy Test) tells the story about a pregnant teenager who tries to convince her mother that her boyfriend will take care of her <b>whatever</b> <b>happens.</b> «Angelina» tells the story about a low class single mother who have to work as a stripper in order to earn enough money to feed her baby after being abandoned by her boyfriend. «Agua» is about Vico's detention in late 2002 because of porting heroin in his car, complaining about the police and Puerto Rican justice. The term agua (literally water in Spanish) is used in the song as a Puerto Rican jargon referring to the police.|$|E

500|$|... "We Remain" [...] {{was written}} by Ryan Tedder and Brent Kutzle of OneRepublic, and Mikky Ekko. The song is a midtempo arena pop power ballad. It lasts for a {{duration}} of [...] (four minutes). Aguilera sings with [...] "enormous" [...] and [...] "soaring" [...] vocals on a [...] "propulsive Ryan Tedder-ish beat" [...] background. [...] "We Remain" [...] incorporates a smooth piano and drum machine in its instrumentation. According to Billboard magazine, the ballad [...] "finds [...] tamping down [...] for a natural and forceful message of perseverance". At the chorus, Aguilera sings [...] "So burn me with fire/ Drown me with rain/ I'm gonna wake up screaming your name/ Yes I'm a sinner, yes I'm a saint/ <b>whatever</b> <b>happens</b> here, <b>whatever</b> <b>happens</b> here, we remain". Several critics compared [...] "We Remain" [...] to Aguilera's previous hit [...] "Beautiful" [...] (2002) and Alicia Keys' [...] "Girl on Fire" [...] (2012) for musical similarities.|$|E

500|$|Sargent's {{marriage}} was unhappy {{and ended in}} divorce in 1946. Before, during and after his marriage, Sargent was a continual womaniser, a {{fact that he did}} not deny. His liaisons with powerful women began early, in Stamford, when he was still conducting the Gilbert and Sullivan shows attended by the London gentry who came to join the Melton Mowbray hunt. Among his affairs were long-standing ones with Diana Bowes-Lyon, Princess Marina and Edwina Mountbatten. More casual encounters are typified by the young woman who said, [...] "Promise me that <b>whatever</b> <b>happens</b> I shan't have to go home alone in a taxi with Malcolm Sargent." ...|$|E
500|$|While in Europe, Spears {{met with}} William Orbit and Daft Punk about {{possible}} collaborations, and originally confirmed Darkchild and The Neptunes as producers. When asked by The Hollywood Reporter {{about the direction}} of the record, Spears responded it was an organic evolution, adding, [...] "It should just happen naturally from the way you feel. [...] <b>Whatever</b> <b>happens,</b> happens". Additionally, Spears scheduled meet-and-greets with Timbaland and Missy Elliott in an effort to help evolve her sound. Elliott would also enlist in further production work with Nisan Stewart for Spears' project, however none of the initial material saw the light of day. Fred Durst was asked by Spears' management to submit material, and he wrote and produced three trip hop tracks that were recorded by Spears in January 2003. However, after news of an affair between them broke, Durst told Jive Records {{he was not going to}} let them use the songs for the album. In March 2003, Lauren Christy from The Matrix spoke about the development of the album with MTV News, and likened their work with Spears to Madonna's 1998 album Ray of Light.

500|$|Donna {{was raised}} by her {{grandmother}} Shirley (Lynda Baron), who appears in the series eight episode [...] "Bad Blood". Clarke Peters, star of American drama series The Wire, was cast as her estranged father in 2009. He appeared from 14 July to 11 August 2009, suffering from cancer of the splenic flexure, pancreas and abdominal wall. Jacobs was [...] "thrilled" [...] by Peters' casting, and reported that his first appearance rendered the programme's crew [...] "star-struck" [...] {{for the first time}} in her five years on the show. His appearance allowed Donna to confront her father over his abandonment of her as a child, and rendered her devastated upon learning that he had accepted his impending death. Peters assessed that his appearance had an [...] "enormous impact" [...] on Donna, explaining that his role allowed the audience to discover more about her life, as: [...] "This is a way to get into these characters rather than just seeing them as one-dimensional characters, dealing with <b>whatever</b> <b>happens</b> at Holby."

[...] A reviewer for Instinct wrote [...] "this hits collection is loaded with songs best described as massive... you'll find something to love here". Jaime Gill, in a review for BBC Music, felt that [...] "Absolute Garbage is a fine legacy, the sound of a briefly brilliant and always interesting band" [...] and that overall the album [...] "sounds like no other greatest hits you own." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine wrote, [...] "By wrapping their nut-grabbing hooks and transcendent melodies in layers of gutsy guitars, Garbage managed to make pop music for people who thought they didn't like pop music. For that reason, <b>whatever</b> <b>happens</b> next, they deserve to be remembered fondly." [...] A reviewer for the Daily Mail described it as [...] "a slick blend of grunge-rock power and sultry girl-group harmonies" [...] and added, [...] " [...] already sounds dated, but the songs stand up well." ...|$|E
