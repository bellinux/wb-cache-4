40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that RNA viruses should be genetically diverse, due to the high error rate of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases {{and the lack of}} proof-reading capabilities. Plant RNA viruses are not as genetically diverse as expected. Evolutionary factors, such as purifying selection and bottlenecks that favor genetic stability, might be affecting plant viral populations. Otherwise RNA virus populations, with their potential for extreme diversity, might acquire a lethal number of mutations leading to the collapse of the population. ^ Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV) populations maintained in a controlled greenhouse environment displayed genetic stability. The mutation frequency per nucleotide of TriMV protein 1 (P 1) and coat protein (CP) cistrons was discovered to be half that of similar plant viruses. Variations within serial passaged TriMV populations were dominated by singletons within both cistrons examined. Thus, stochastic processes such as bottlenecking are impacting the populations observed. The founding inoculum type sequence was preserved throughout the serial passages therefore some level of genetic stability was being maintained. ^ The mutation frequencies observed within the CP cistron of two TriMV isolates within wheat, rye, barley, and triticale, were not significantly different, suggesting that the level of TriMV population diversity is maintained across these hosts. The lack of preference for any particular host examined suggests that both TriMV isolates are equally adapted. The variation of the P 1 and CP regions of TriMV populations, horizontally transmitted by <b>wheat</b> <b>curl</b> <b>mites,</b> were determined. The alternative host, jointed goatgrass, caused no shift from the founding haplotype of the P 1 or CP within the TriMV populations observed, indicating that the bottlenecks occurring within this host are similar to those within wheat. TriMV populations maintain genetic stability, even with the constraints of genetic bottlenecking by horizontal transfer by <b>wheat</b> <b>curl</b> <b>mites.</b> ^ The TriMV populations observed maintained genetic stability by the evolutionary forces of selection and genetic bottlenecking. This leads us to conclude that selection and drift are not exclusive, and may occur concurrently within a virus population. This research shows that the combined effect of both forces acting simultaneously on different regions of the genome ultimately regulates the degree of sequence variation within virus populations. ...|$|R

Molecular markers were used to monitor establishment and resolution of mixed infections with genetically defined strains of wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV). Two closely related WSMV strains from the U. S. (Type and Sidney 81) exhibited reciprocal cross-protection in wheat, confirming this classic phenomenon as a mechanism of genetic isolation. In contrast, cross-protection between either U. S. strain and the divergent El Batán 3 strain from Mexico was unilateral, erratic, and only partially effective. Distribution of WSMV strains within individual leaves of plants supporting a mixed infection of Type and Sidney 81 was spatially nonuniform. Strain distribution among individual tillers of coinfected plants also was heterogeneous, with some containing either Type or Sidney 81 alone and some containing both. Transmission by <b>wheat</b> <b>curl</b> <b>mites,</b> acquiring virus from source plants simultaneously infected with both Type and Sidney 81, often resulted in test plants bearing only a single WSMV strain.

Samples of wheat curl mites were collected from arbitrarily chosen sites from commercial wheat plantings in 1995 and 1996 and used to infest caged wheat plants. After 3 weeks, leaf samples were harvested and assayed. Both Western blot analysis and PAS-ELISA were effective at identifying samples positive for WSMV and HPV, both alone and in mixed infections. Western blot results showed that over the 2 years, 65 % of the samples were positive for WSMV, 46 % were positive for HPV, and mixed infections were found in 40 % of the samples. HPV presence was verified with similar results from field collected plant samples. These levels of virus indicate an unexpectedly high incidence of HPV in <b>wheat</b> <b>curl</b> <b>mite</b> populations in Nebraska...|$|E

Immunofluorescent and dot-immunobinding assays {{were developed to}} detect the presence of WSMV in single WCM. Virus-specific immunofluorescent microscopy detected WSMV near the anterior end of viruliferous WCM. With dot-immunobinding assay, WSMV was detected in WCM fed on WSMV-infected wheat (Triticum aestivum) but not in WCM maintained on healthy plants. Both immunofluorescent and dot-immunobinding assays were sufficiently sensitive to detect WSMV in individual WCM, providing a means to determine the percentage of viruliferous WCM in field collections...|$|E
50|$|After {{playing for}} Martin, Park formed his own team, which {{had some success}} on the World Curling Tour, and {{involved}} trips to the 1997 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, and 2001 Olympic Trials. He placed second on the World Curling Tour money list in 1996 and placed third in 1997 http://www.worldcurlingtour.com/index.php?task=Money&et=21&eventyear=1997. The 1995-96 season included victories at the Merchant Cash Spiel and the Canadian North Arctic Briar. As a skip, Park wouldn't win another major bonspiel until the Pointoptical Curling Classic in 2000. In 2002 he won the <b>Wheat</b> City <b>Curling</b> Classic and the Norris Bros. Roaming Buffalo Classic. In 2003 he won the Whites Drug Store Classic, playing third for Doran Johnson. In 2007, he won the John Shea Insurance Canada Cup Qualifier, subbing in for Blake MacDonald as third for Kevin Koe's rink. http://www.worldcurlingtour.com/player.php?playerid=572&view=Events Park played at the subsequent 2008 Canada Cup of Curling, playing third for Kevin Martin instead (subbing for an injured John Morris).|$|R

40|$|This is a {{study of}} {{transcriptional}} gene regulation in wheat (Triticum aestivum, L.) in response to Russian wheat aphid (RWA) (Diuraphis noxia, Kurdjumov) infestation. The Russian wheat aphid feeds on the phloem sap in the leaves of wheat plants, and causes the leaves of susceptible <b>wheat</b> plants to <b>curl.</b> This forms a protective barrier for the RWA from insecticides and natural enemies. Chlorosis also results from the RWA feeding. In cases of high infestation, death of susceptible plants can also occur. Eleven wheat genes that confer resistance to the Russian wheat aphid have been identified, but their mechanism at molecular level is still not clearly understood. Wheat near-isogenic lines (NILs) were used in a genome-wide, transcriptome analysis using cDNA-AFLP technology. RWA-resistant cultivar ‘Tugela DN’ and RWA-susceptible cultivar ‘Tugela’ were infested with the RWA and leaves were collected from the infested plants at different (0 -, 1 -, 2 -, 6 -, 12 -, 24 -, 48 - and 120 -) hours post infestation. cDNA samples derived from these leaves was then analyzed by cDNA-AFLP which revealed 18 clusters of differential gene regulation between the two NILs. The results of this experiment show that differential regulation of transcripts occur even within the first hour of infestation. All types of regulation were observed within the clusters. Differentially expressed transcript derived fragments (TDFs) that were randomly isolated from PAGE gels and sequenced (41 TDFs) included sequences in the functional groups similar to those observed in the microarray analysis. The functional categories are cell structure and maintenance [protein synthesis (14 %), chaperone (2 %), protein degradation (2 %), transcription factor (5 %) ]; photosynthesis [sugar metabolism (5 %), carbohydrate metabolism (2 %), energy related (7 %) ]; defenserelated [signaling (7 %), defense-related (10 %) ] while the rest {{did not have any}} significant homology to any known or characterized proteins. Previous suppressive subtractive hybridization experiments identified transcripts that are differentially expressed in wheat in response to RWA feeding. More transcripts were identified by PCR from cDNA pools derived from RWA-infested plants as having conserved motifs common in pathenogenesis related proteins. The isolated transcripts were used to generate a defense response-biased microarray chip that was used to investigate the regulation of these transcripts during infestation of RWA resistant wheat plants (‘Tugela DN’) in a time trial. Dual hybridization of CyDye labeled probes derived from the induced ‘Tugela DN’ plants to the microarray chips revealed differential regulation of the immobilized transcripts in wheat, at different time points post infestation with the RWA. Statistical analysis of the CyDye intensities on the 380 spots mounted on the cDNA microarray slides showed 29 transcripts to be significantly regulated (P≤ 0. 05) {{during the time of the}} experiment. These included ESTs that were grouped into four functional categories, namely cell structure and maintenance (9 ESTs); photosynthesis (8 ESTs); defense-related (4 ESTs) and those with no significant homology found or proteins with unknown function (8 ESTs). Patterns of regulation of these transcripts in all of the functional categories included all types of regulation e. g. mainly down-regulation, mainly up-regulation, and a combination of up-/up-/down-regulation in response to RWA feeding. In conclusion, data obtained utilizing cDNA microarray and cDNA-AFLP analyses in infested wheat suggest that the ability to maintain structures involved in photosynthesis by regulating the relevant transcripts through-out infestation is an important determinant in plant survival during RWA feeding. The timing of regulation is also important as some of the transcripts are also regulated in RWA susceptible ‘Tugela’ plants but not in a timely manner which leads to loss of energy and subsequent death of susceptible plants.
