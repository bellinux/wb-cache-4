25|$|The {{more closely}} we look into history, the more clearly shall we {{perceive}} {{that the system}} of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries {{in which it is}} said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The Romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by Francis I. At the present day , we imagine we can still see chivalry flourishing in the persons of Du Guesclin and Bayard, under Charles V and Francis I. But <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> examine either the one period or the other, although we find in each some heroic spirits, we are forced to confess {{that it is necessary to}} antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of the single-shot sequences was a challenging, time-consuming process that sparked concerns from the studio. It took fourteen days {{to prepare for the}} single shot in which Clive Owen's character searches a building under attack, and five hours for every time they wanted to reshoot it. In the middle of one shot, blood splattered onto the lens, and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki convinced the director to leave it in. According to Owen, [...] "Right in the thick of it are me and the camera operator because we're doing this very complicated, very specific dance which, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> shoot, we have to make feel completely random." ...|$|E

2500|$|People {{living on}} their own are certain to be selected, so we simply add their income to our {{estimate}} of the total. But a person living in a household of two adults has only a one-in-two chance of selection. To reflect this, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> such a household, we would count the selected person's income twice towards the total. (The person who is selected from that household can be loosely viewed as also representing the person who isn't selected.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} statement expresses Wilcox's unique blending of New Thought, Spiritualism, and a Theosophical belief in reincarnation: [...] "As we think, act, and live here today, we build {{the structures of}} our homes in spirit realms after we leave earth, and we build karma for future lives, thousands of years to come, on this earth or other planets. Life will assume new dignity, and labor new interest for us, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the knowledge that death is but a continuation of life and labor, in higher planes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Damon Albarn got {{the idea}} for Plastic Beach while on a beach next to his house: [...] "I was just looking for all the plastic within the sand", he said. On 17 September 2008, Albarn and Jamie Hewlett {{announced}} that they would be doing another Gorillaz album in an interview with CBC News. Hewlett said that from their work on Monkey, [...] "we just learned more about what we do, musically and artistically. That's a great place to come at <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> another Gorillaz album. It doesn't have to be animation and music". Hewlett also expressed annoyance at having to draw the band members again: [...] "I'm so f--king bored of drawing those characters. But then we had a moment where we had a new angle on it... I'm gonna adapt them". In a later interview Hewlett said: [...] "they'll be the same characters, but a little bit older and told in a different way".|$|E

2500|$|Venizelos, at that time, was in {{an electoral}} tour of the island. Once, he [...] "saw Canea in flames", he hurried to Malaxa, near Chania, {{where a group of}} about 2,000 rebels had assembled, and {{established}} himself as their header. He proposed an attack, along with other rebels, on the Turkish forces at Akrotiri in order to displace them from the plains (Malaxa is in a higher altitude). Venizelos' subsequent actions at Akrotiri form a central set-piece in his myth. People composed poems on Akrotiri and his role there; editorials and articles spoke about his bravery, his visions and his diplomatic genius as inevitable accompaniment of later greatness. Venizelos spent the night in Akrotiri and a Greek flag was raised. The Ottoman forces requested help from the foreign admirals and attacked the rebels, with the ships of the Great Powers bombarding the rebel positions at Akrotiri. A shell threw down the flag, which was raised up again immediately. The mythologizing became more pronounced <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> his actions in that February, as the following quotes display: ...|$|E
2500|$|Of Christianity, he said: [...] "it is not now true for me.... Every believing Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother... but if systemically I called {{myself a}} Christian I feel that to most men I should imply {{too much and}} so tell a lie". Of other world {{religions}}, he writes: [...] "All these religions are true for me as Canterbury Cathedral is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them.... They do not work for me". In The Fate of Homo Sapiens, published in 1939, Wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies, stating [...] "there is no creed, no way of living {{left in the world}} at all, that really meets the needs of the time… <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> look at them coolly and dispassionately, all the main religions, patriotic, moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today, appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement, like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast, sprawling city overtaken by a landslide.|$|E
