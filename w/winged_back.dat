What Peggotty had told me now, was so far from bringing me back to the later period, that it rooted the earlier image in my mind. It may be curious, but it is true.

By May, some winged forms are beginning to appear and these fly to secondary hosts, such as Asteraceae, Chrysanthemum and Trifolium, where they found new colonies. The colonies on the primary host gradually die out. Further generations develop on the secondary hosts and in the autumn, <b>winged</b> forms fly <b>back</b> to the primary host. Here sexual forms develop, mating takes place and eggs are laid on twigs and spurs of the plum and damson trees. Natural enemies include ladybirds, lacewings, soldier beetles and hoverflies.|$|R

25|$|During this time, many of {{the species}} from the Carboniferous diversified, and many new orders developed, including: Protelytroptera, {{primitive}} relatives of Plecoptera (Paraplecoptera), Psocoptera, Mecoptera, Coleoptera, Raphidioptera, and Neuroptera.

40|$|The soybean aphid can be {{a serious}} pest of soybeans. This insect reached high numbers {{during the summer of}} 2001 in extreme {{northeast}} Iowa. Populations during 2002 were too low to cause economic damage; however, in 2003 infestations reached historically high populations and were above economic thresholds throughout most of Iowa. The soybean aphid has up to 15 to 18 generations annually. Overwintering eggs survive on buckthorn (Rhamnus). The nymphs hatch in the spring, and after winged female generations are born, they fly in search of soybeans. Throughout the summer, winged and wingless individuals are born. They feed on soybeans, and once crowded, the winged aphids fly in search of non-colonized soybeans. During the later stages of maturity, increased aphid mortality occurs due to the depletion of their food source, and surviving <b>winged</b> aphids migrate <b>back</b> to buckthorn. Aphid infestations that peak at the R 1 -R 2 soybean growth stages may cause stunted plant growth with possible yellowing of leaves with reduced pod and seed counts. A black residue, sooty mold, grows on honeydew, a by-product excreted by aphids found on leaves, stems, and pods. Ants are usually present when ample honeydew is present. The objective of this experiment was to measure the performance of several insecticides for control of the soybean aphid...|$|R
50|$|In the {{southern}} {{half of the}} USA, {{as far north as}} Arkansas, sexual reproduction of the cotton aphid is not important. Females continue to produce offspring without mating so long as the weather is favourable for feeding and growth. Further north, the cotton aphid can be holocyclic and involve two host species, with a broadleaved tree such as Catalpa, Rhamnus or Hibiscus acting as the primary host. In Europe it reproduces exclusively by asexual reproduction and can produce nearly fifty generations a year under favourable conditions. In Russia various wild plants are hosts to the overwintering eggs. Winged forms then migrate to secondary host species in the families Rosaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Malvaceae, Cruciferae, Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Compositae and others. Parthenogenesis on these hosts allows large populations of aphids to build up quickly. The life span of a parthenogenic female is about twenty days in which time it can produce up to 85 nymphs. These mature in about twenty days at 10 ¬∞C and in about four days at 30 ¬∞C. As autumn approaches, the <b>winged</b> forms migrate <b>back</b> to the primary hosts. Here, both males and sexual females are produced, mating takes place and the females lay eggs which overwinter, ready to repeat the life cycle the following year.|$|R
