Upon completion of the closing arguments, Gillen asked Jones, [...] "By my reckoning, this is the 40th day since the trial began and tonight will be the 40th night, and I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> you did that on purpose." [...] (40 days and nights was {{the length of the}} Biblical Great Flood.) Jones responded, [...] "Mr. Gillen, that is an interesting coincidence, but it was not by design." [...] This humorous exchange provided the title for Matthew Chapman's book about the trial, 40 Days and 40 Nights.|$|E

60|$|Arthur Jukes relapsed into a moody silence.

6000|$|... "Line!" [...] said Mr. Archibald. [...] "It {{is absurd}} {{to think of}} lines {{in a place like}} this.

6000|$|... "Gillard {{has been}} called away south on {{business}} and has sent me word he can let me have the places at the opera-house for both nights," [...] he said. [...] "No doubt you have seen the great man in England with his regular company, but a treat of the kind is appreciated here, and Gillard bought up a row of places, {{the best in the}} house.

[...] "Horses are good and abundant in Navarre, and when I said I did not like to take advantage of his strait, he only laughed and said he had three or four others as good at home. He did say, though, that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> it was to be in good hands.

6000|$|We enter a small public-house by the {{roadside}} to get a draught of beer. In the kitchen, we behold the landlord and a tall man who is a customer. Both stare {{as a matter of}} course; the tall man especially, after taking one look at our knapsacks, fixes his eyes firmly on us and sits bolt upright on the bench without saying a word--he is evidently prepared for the worst we can do. We get into conversation with the landlord, a jovial, talkative fellow, who desires greatly to know what we are, if we have no objection. We ask him, what he thinks we are?--"Well," [...] says the landlord, pointing to my friend's knapsack, which has a square ruler strapped to it, for architectural drawing--"well, I think you are both of you mappers--mappers who come here to make new roads--you may be coming to make a railroad, I dare say--we've had mappers in the country before this--I know a mapper myself--here's both your good healths!" [...] We drink the landlord's good health in return, and disclaim the honour of being [...] "mappers;" [...] we walk through the country (we tell him) for pleasure alone, and take any roads we can get, without wanting to make new ones. The landlord <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>if</b> that is the case, why we carry those weights at our backs?--Because we want to take our luggage about with us. Couldn't we pay to ride?--Yes, we could. And yet we like walking better?--Yes we do. This last answer utterly confounds the tall customer, who has been hitherto listening intently to the dialogue. It is evidently too much for his credulity--he pays his reckoning, and walks out in a hurry without uttering a word. The landlord appears to be convinced, but it is only in appearance. We leave him standing at his door, keeping his eye on us as long as we are in sight, still evidently persuaded that we are [...] "mappers," [...] but [...] "mappers" [...] of a bad order whose presence is fraught with some unknown peril to the security of the Queen's highway.|$|E
