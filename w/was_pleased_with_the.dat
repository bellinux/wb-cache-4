5|$|Daphne du Maurier <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{adaptation}} of her story, and wrote to Nicolas Roeg to congratulate him for capturing {{the essence of}} John and Laura's relationship.

5|$|Author John Green, {{though an}} Indianapolis native, <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{selection}} of Pittsburgh for filming. He commented that Pittsburgh has an amazing community of really talented film professionals that’s been {{built up over}} the last 20 years. I’ve been blown away by their professionalism, their confidence, their dedication. There aren’t a lot of cities like that. You {{kind of have to}} find the city that can be Indianapolis. And Pittsburgh, even though {{it has a lot of}} hills, it can be Indianapolis. We just have to find a couple of flat streets.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's {{time in the}} West was brief. President Johnson, {{unhappy with}} the way Republican generals were {{governing}} the South under Reconstruction, sought replacements for them. The general who offended Johnson the most was Philip Sheridan, and Johnson soon ordered General Grant to switch the assignments of Hancock and Sheridan, believing that Hancock, a Democrat, would govern in a style more to Johnson's liking. Although neither man <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> change, Sheridan reported to Fort Leavenworth and Hancock to New Orleans.|$|E

5|$|Heidfeld {{was finally}} {{announced}} as Webber's 2005 teammate at the Williams season launch on 31 January, with Webber admitting he <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> eventual decision. Webber's move to Williams brought about comparisons to Alan Jones, Australia's last F1 World Champion, {{also in a}} Williams. Expectations were high as Webber's former team boss Paul Stoddart predicted Webber would take his first victory in 2005 while Williams technical director Sam Michael said Webber would eventually win the World Championship with Williams.|$|E
5|$|In another storyline {{her sister}} Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) reveals {{she is in}} fact her mother. The reveal episode {{centered}} around Ruby interrogating Charlie about the identity of her secret child, with Charlie breaking down whilst she admits the truth. Whilst filming the episodic block, both Breeds and Anderson found the storyline challenging; furthermore they felt a responsibility to get the narrative flow and emotions perfect. Breeds {{said she had to}} let it affect her own emotions in order to affect the viewing public. Although she was nervous, Breeds <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> end result.|$|E
5|$|Kheradpir became CEO of Juniper Networks in January 2014. He {{developed}} and executed a restructuring and cost-cutting plan that Juniper called its Integrated Operating Plan (IOP), {{in response to}} pressure from activist investors at Elliot Management.

5|$|Nilo Rodis, who {{had worked}} on two {{previous}} Star Trek features, was appointed the role of art director, and worked with Shatner to establish the film's visual design. Shatner sought a grittier and more realistic feel to the Star Trek universe, and so the two worked together to visualize the film from start to finish. After Shatner explained the entire story in a day-long session, Rodis went home and sketched out each scene from the script. Shatner <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> results, especially with Rodis' designs for Shatner's most expansive or dramatic shots.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{included}} {{the scene in}} which Logan attacks Piz on his list of highlights from the third season. When Thomas first viewed the scene with his wife, she emitted an audible groan when she saw Logan walking through the cafeteria towards Piz, anticipating the fight {{that was about to}} come. Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not well-done, as they are filmed quickly and without a second unit. However, he <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> final cut, stating that there was only one punch that he thought looked fake.|$|E
5|$|Terry Pratchett <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 1986 {{interactive}} fiction game The Colour of Magic, but criticised its poor marketing. He {{was reluctant}} to grant Discworld licences due to concern for the series, and wanted a reputable company who cared about the property. Other video game companies had previously approached Pratchett seeking a licence. One such company was AdventureSoft, and their failure to obtain a Discworld licence {{led to the creation}} of Simon the Sorcerer, which took inspiration from the Discworld series of books.|$|E

5|$|Tim Webber of VFX house Framestore CFC was {{responsible}} for the three-and-a-half minute single take of Kee giving birth, helping to choreograph and create the CG effects of the childbirth. Cuarón had originally intended to use an animatronic baby as Kee's child {{with the exception of the}} childbirth scene. In the end, two takes were shot, with the second take concealing Clare-Hope Ashitey's legs, replacing them with prosthetic legs. Cuarón <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> results of the effect, and returned to previous shots of the baby in animatronic form, replacing them with Framestore's computer-generated baby.|$|E
5|$|Tittle led the NFL in {{touchdown}} passes {{for the first}} time in 1955, with 17, while also leading the league with 28 interceptions thrown. When the 49ers hired Frankie Albert as head coach in 1956, Tittle <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> choice at first, figuring Albert would be a good mentor. However, the team lost four of its first five games, and Albert replaced Tittle with rookie Earl Morrall. After a loss to the Los Angeles Rams brought San Francisco's record to 1–6, Tittle regained the starting role and the team finished undefeated with one tie through the season's final five games.|$|E
5|$|All {{repair work}} on the New Orleans Arena was {{finished}} by March 2006, and a new scoreboard and video displays were added during the process. In June 2006, Shinn stated he <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ongoing recovery process in New Orleans and again reaffirmed his desire to permanently return for the 2007–08 season. However, the Hornets also announced {{that they were in}} the process of negotiating with Oklahoma City to play the 2007–08 season at the Ford Center as a contingency plan. The Hornets opened the 200607 season at New Orleans with a win over the Boston Celtics. They improved their final record from the previous season by one game, and again finished tenth in the Western Conference, three games out of the playoffs. Their attendance declined slightly compared to the previous season, and they finished 15th overall in attendance.|$|E

5|$|Djajakusuma's next production, Terimalah Laguku (Take My Song; 1952), was {{a musical}} about an old, impoverished {{musician}} who sells his saxophone {{to help his}} former student's career. Though the film's technical quality was poor, {{when he returned to}} Indonesia in 1953 Ismail <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> work, stating that the editing had been done well. Over the next year Ismail conveyed information he learned at UCLA to the Perfini staff; Djajakusuma followed these lessons closely. This was followed by Harimau Tjampa (Tiger from Tjampa) in 1953, a film about a man who attempts to avenge his father's death. Set amidst Minang culture, the film featured some of the first nudity in a domestic production and was a considerable critical success.|$|E
5|$|Duke of Marmalade raced {{against his}} stable {{companion}} Dylan Thomas {{again in the}} Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in September. He led into the straight before being overtaken by Dylan Thomas, and although he had no chance with the winner he stayed on to take second ahead of notable winners such as Red Rocks (Breeders' Cup Turf), Maraahel (Hardwicke Stakes) and Finsceal Beo (1000 Guineas). O'Brien <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> run and said that Duke of Marmalade was still improving. On his final {{start of the year}} he was brought back to one mile for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in which he led until the last quarter mile, setting a strong pace, before finishing third to Ramonti and Excellent Art.|$|E

5|$|The {{start of}} his 2011 season saw him take a fourth {{consecutive}} national title over 60m with a European-leading time. At the 2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships the following month he was beaten to the line by Obikwelu, although he <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> silver medal as he had changed his training to focus towards the 100m for that season. Four straight wins on the Brazilian Athletics Tour came {{at the beginning of}} his outdoor season in May, including a season's best of 10.01seconds, and he took his fifth national title at the British trials. At the 2011 World Championships he reached the 100m semi-finals but fell foul of the IAAF's new false start rule: he twitched in his blocks and was immediately disqualified.|$|E
5|$|When Harry Dean Stanton {{auditioned for}} Brett, he told Ridley Scott {{he was not}} a fan of science-fiction or horror films; Scott replied that he was not either, but {{expected}} Alien to do well. According to Stanton, he <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> film and said it and Pretty in Pink are the films for which he is best recognized. Several of Brett's scenes were deleted from the original cut, including Ripley and Parker seeing his death and his cocooned corpse in the Alien's lair; they were included in the 2003 director's cut. According to writer Dan O'Bannon, the latter scene hinted that Brett's body was becoming an Alien incubator.|$|E
5|$|Casting {{began in}} October 2007, when Priyanka Chopra signed {{to play the}} lead role in the film. Chopra {{initially}} refused the role, feeling {{she would not be}} able to do it justice. Six months later, she agreed to appear in the film because of Bhandarkar's confidence in her. The media reported that Chopra was unhappy with the first draft of the film and wanted script changes before signing the film. Bhandarkar was also unhappy with the first draft and agreed to rewrite the script. Kangana Ranaut was cast as the film's second lead; she <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> script and found it challenging, interesting and exciting. In December 2007, Arbaaz Khan and Arjan Bajwa were cast opposite Chopra. After confirming the principal cast, the media reported that Bhandarkar was having difficulty casting the male roles, including that of a homosexual clothing designer. Samir Soni and Harsh Chhaya were cast as the homosexual designers, and model Mugdha Godse was cast in a supporting role. According to Godse, Bhandarkar offered her a part when they were shooting a jewellery advertisement; a year later, she agreed to appear in the film. The Hindustan Times said that several models and designers played themselves, giving the film the appearance of a documentary.|$|E
