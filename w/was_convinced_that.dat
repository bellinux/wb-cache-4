5|$|In mid-1975, Ochs {{took on the}} {{identity}} of John Butler Train. He told people that Train had murdered Ochs, and that he, John Butler Train, had replaced him. Train <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> someone {{was trying to kill}} him, so he carried a weapon at all times: a hammer, a knife, or a lead pipe.|$|E
5|$|By 1799, the {{fortress}} of Mantua {{on the river}} Mincio in northern Italy was in poor shape. It was commanded by viscount lieutenant general François-Philippe de Foissac-Latour (1750-1804) and garrisoned by a diverse force of 10,000, including French, Polish (Polish Legionnaires under general Józef Wielhorski), Italian (Republic of Alba and Cisalpine Republic), Swiss and German units. From {{the beginning of his}} assignment, Foissac-Latour, an engineer, <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> {{the fortress}} would be indefensible in any serious siege.|$|E
5|$|Darwaza <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> {{interpretations of}} the Quran were the only {{possible}} basis for any renewal and development of Islamic religious, political and social thought, and that the Quran was the only resource for Muslim reinterpretation of traditional norms in Islam and Islamic thinking. Since it was quite uncommon to follow a chronological order for a whole tafsir—which Darwaza did—he had to justify his position by seeking a fatwa from the muftis of Aleppo and Damascus.|$|E

5|$|Diego López de Salcedo sailed from Santo Domingo {{with two}} ships, {{carrying}} {{a large number}} of soldiers, as well as provisions and clothing he intended to sell to the colonists. Contrary winds delayed López de Salcedo off Jamaica for a month; he eventually disembarked in Trujillo on 26 October 1526, after a lengthy standoff with Saavedra that almost came to violence. At last Saavedra <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> López de Salcedo had been authorised directly by the crown, and allowed him to come ashore.|$|E
5|$|Gautham is a {{schizophrenic}} Indian rock {{musician who}} is missing 25 {{percent of his}} grey matter. He hallucinates a mysterious person he believes {{is one of the}} three murderers of his parents. As a child, Gautham <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> he was an orphan and assumes that his parents are dead; he does not remember their names or what they looked like.|$|E
5|$|Gracy Singh as Gauri. Several actresses {{had offered}} {{to act in the}} film, but Aamir needed someone who matched the {{description}} of the character given in the script. After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das and Ameesha Patel for the role, Ashutosh selected Gracy Singh for the female lead because he <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> she was a good actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala. Singh, a newcomer, devoted all her time to the film.|$|E

5|$|Hoover was {{defeated}} for re-election by Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Roosevelt <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> federal activism {{was needed to}} reverse the country's economic decline. In his first hundred days in office, the Congress enacted at Roosevelt's request a series of bills designed to strengthen the banking system, including the Emergency Banking Act, the Glass–Steagall Act (which created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), and the 1933 Banking Act. The Congress also passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act to stabilize the nation's agricultural industry.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{month after}} this victory, Adolf Hitler issued a {{directive}} stating that Germany must be ready for an offensive through France and the Low Countries. However, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German high command; OKW) <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> preparations would take at least until the following year. After furious arguments, Hitler reluctantly agreed to wait. In May 1940, three massive German army groups overran France and the Low Countries in little more than six weeks.|$|E

5|$|Other factors {{contributed to}} the rising {{tensions}} as well. On his way to Egypt in 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and forcibly removed the Hospitallers from their possessions. This angered Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. The French Directory, furthermore, <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians and the English actually discussed this possibility.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Old School and New School factions {{merged with the}} slavery controversy. The New School's enthusiasm for moral reform and voluntary societies was evident in its increasing identification with the abolitionist movement. The Old School, however, <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the General Assembly and the larger church should not legislate on moral issues that were not explicitly addressed in the Bible. This effectively drove the majority of Southern Presbyterians to support the Old School faction.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{idea for}} a video game that {{presented}} the Metroid series in a pinball setting came to Kensuke Tanabe after he learned that Fuse Games had previously worked on Mario Pinball Land, another pinball video game. Recalling that the series' protagonist, Samus, can morph into a ball, Tanabe <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the Metroid universe could be adapted to a pinball setting. The game was sold with a Rumble Pak accessory for the Nintendo DS, marking {{the first time the}} accessory was available for the Nintendo DS.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hans-Joachim Marseille, {{who was a}} {{marksman}} {{and expert}} {{in the art of}} deflection shooting, Hartmann was a master of stalk-and-ambush tactics. By his own account, he <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> 80% of the pilots he downed did not even realise what hit them. He relied on the powerful engine of his Bf109 for high-power sweeps and quick approaches, occasionally diving through entire enemy formations {{to take advantage of the}} confusion that followed in order to disengage.|$|E
5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> {{the company had}} been treated wrongly and insisted in {{bringing}} it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced {{the rest of the}} board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent.|$|E

5|$|After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, {{during which}} Bizet {{served in the}} National Guard, he had little success with his one-act opera Djamileh, though an orchestral suite derived from his {{incidental}} music to Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne was instantly popular. The production of Bizet's final opera, Carmen, was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences. After its premiere on 3 March 1875, Bizet <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the work was a failure; {{he died of a}} heart attack three months later, unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success.|$|E
5|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} radical in his progressivism, Taft was {{hardened}} in his resolve to achieve re-nomination, as he <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the progressives threatened the very {{foundation of the}} government. One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt, {{one of the last}} links between the previous and present presidents, as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt. Ambivalent between his loyalties, Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking, a death Taft found hard to accept as his body was not recovered.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May, David Ben-Gurion <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the Arab Legion {{expected}} {{to take control of}} all Jerusalem. Moreover, after the fighting, the situation there deteriorated: the Jewish community had very small reserves of fuel, bread, sugar and tea, which would last for only 10 days, and water for 3 months. In Glubb's opinion, the aim was still to prevent the Israelis from reinforcing the city and taking control of its Arab part. On 29 May, the UN Security Council announced its intention to impose a ceasefire for 4 weeks, which would prevent further capture of territory and thus prevent resupplying the besieged city.|$|E
