5|$|Numerous {{investigations}} of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (sponging) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction <b>with</b> <b>humans.</b> Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television {{programs such as}} Flipper. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters <b>with</b> <b>humans</b> are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps.|$|E

5|$|Other {{threats to}} {{elephants}} include habitat destruction and fragmentation. The Asian elephant lives {{in areas with}} some of the highest human populations. Because they need larger amounts of land than other sympatric terrestrial mammals, they are the first to be affected by human encroachment. In extreme cases, elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. Elephants cannot coexist <b>with</b> <b>humans</b> in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements. Elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts <b>with</b> <b>humans,</b> and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation. One proposed solution is the provision of ‘urban corridors’ which allow the animals access to key areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is closely {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>humans.</b> They {{are believed to}} have become associated <b>with</b> <b>humans</b> around 10,000 years ago. Subspecies P. d. bactrianus is least associated <b>with</b> <b>humans</b> and considered to be evolutionarily closer to the ancestral noncommensal populations. Usually, it is regarded as a pest, since it consumes agricultural products and spreads disease to humans and their domestic animals. Even birdwatchers often hold it in little regard because of its molestation of other birds. In most of the world, the house sparrow is not protected by law. Attempts to control house sparrows include the trapping, poisoning, or shooting of adults; the destruction of their nests and eggs; or less directly, blocking nest holes and scaring off sparrows with noise, glue, or porcupine wire. However, the house sparrow can be beneficial to humans, as well, especially by eating insect pests, and attempts at the large-scale control of the house sparrow have failed.|$|E

5|$|As a high {{altitude}} species with limited contact <b>with</b> <b>humans</b> until {{the development of}} mountain tourism activities, the Alpine chough has little cultural significance.

40|$|Investigation {{of human}} hematopoietic {{maturation}} has been {{hampered by the}} lack of in vivo models. Although engraftment of irradiated C. B- 17 scid/scid (SCID) mice <b>with</b> <b>human</b> progenitor cells occurred after infusion <b>with</b> <b>human</b> pediatric bone marrow cells, significant engraftment of the mouse bone marrow <b>with</b> <b>human</b> cells was dependent upon continuous treatment <b>with</b> exogenous <b>human</b> cytokines. Furthermore, despite cytokine treatment, only minimal peripheral engraftment of these mice <b>with</b> <b>human</b> cells was observed. In the present study, after infusion of irradiated SCID mice <b>with</b> pre-cultured <b>human</b> fetal bone marrow cells (BM-SCID-hu mice), their bone marrow became significantly engrafted <b>with</b> <b>human</b> precursor cells and their peripheral lymphoid compartment became populated <b>with</b> <b>human</b> B cells and monocytes independently of the administration of extraneous human cytokines. Examination of the bone marrow of the BM-SCID-hu mice for human cytokine mRNA gene expression demonstrated human leukemia inhibitory factor mRNA and interleukin 7 mRNA in nine of nine BM-SCID-hu mice and macrophage-colony-stimulating factor mRNA in seven of eight BM-SCID-hu mice. This was an intriguing observation because these cytokines regulate different stages of human hematopoiesis. Since engraftment occurs in the absence of exogenous cytokine treatment, the BM-SCID-hu mouse model described should provide a useful in vivo system for studying factors important in the maturation of human myeloid and lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and the behavior of the mature human cells after dissemination into the peripheral lymphoid tissue...|$|R
