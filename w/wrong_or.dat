Thus, the acquisition of the temple property had not infringed Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Each episode {{consists}} of three rounds. A team of four contestants starts the game; one player is eliminated after two rounds of play. For each question, the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer; the available money decreases the longer it takes. Each contestant must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must simultaneously lock in an answer and stop the clock. If the team answers the question correctly, they bank whatever money is left on the clock; if they are <b>wrong,</b> <b>or</b> if time runs out, their bank is reduced by half.|$|E
40|$|Relevancy {{is the key}} to {{the entire}} {{analysis}} of the admissibility of evidence of other crimes, <b>wrongs,</b> <b>or</b> acts. Therefore, the proper inquiry is the probative relationship between the evidence and a fact at issue in the case before the court, not the relationship of the evidence to a categorical list of exceptions. The purpose of this article is to carefully analyze the rule and its exceptions so that both lawyers and judges may better determine when evidence of other crimes, <b>wrongs,</b> <b>or</b> acts is admissible and when the introduction of such evidence violates both the rule and its exceptions. To properly make such an analysis, it is necessary to examine the history of the rule in order to determine the true basis for the prohibition against the introduction of evidence of other crimes, <b>wrongs,</b> <b>or</b> acts and the exceptions which permit the introduction of such evidence if relevant to an issue at hand. Also, because courts sometimes fail to distinguish between prior and subsequent acts when considering the introduction of evidence of other crimes, <b>wrongs,</b> <b>or</b> acts, this article outlines the differences between prior and subsequent acts which courts should recognize in determining admissibility. Finally, we formulate a rule which more fully reflects the true purpose and proper application of the rule governing the introduction of evidence of other crimes, <b>wrongs,</b> <b>or</b> acts...|$|R

The episodes were released in eight DVDs and a DVD box set on October 25, 2000 by Digital Site in Japan. The series was released in Northern America by Nozomi Entertainment in two parts; the first was released on March 4, 2014, and the second one is available since May 6, 2014. In November 2015, the series {{was added to the}} Crunchyroll streaming service to be broadcast in the United States and Canada with English substitles.|$|E

25|$|According to Ward and Ogden's {{qualitative}} {{study on the}} experience of vaginismus (1994), the three most common contributing factors to vaginismus are fear of painful sex; the belief that sex is <b>wrong</b> <b>or</b> shameful (often the case with patients who had a strict religious upbringing); and traumatic early childhood experiences (not necessarily sexual in nature).|$|E

Evidence of other crimes, <b>wrongs</b> <b>or</b> acts is available for [...] "non-character purposes," [...] such as motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. In a criminal prosecution, the defendant can request to receive notice of this type of evidence if the prosecution intends to admit it at trial.|$|R

25|$|Proponents of gedoogbeleid {{argue that}} such a policy {{practices}} more consistency in legal protection than without it. Opponents of the Dutch drug policy either call for full legalization, or argue that laws should penalize morally <b>wrong</b> <b>or</b> deviant behavior, whether enforceable or not. In the Dutch courts, however, {{it has long been}} determined that the institutionalized non-enforcement of statutes with well defined limits constitutes de facto decriminalization. The statutes are kept on the books mainly due to international pressure and in adherence with international treaties. A November 2008 poll showed that a 60% majority of the Dutch population support the legalisation of soft drugs. The same poll showed that 85% supported closing of all cannabis coffeeshops within 250 meters walking distance from schools.|$|E
25|$|In October 1938, Straffen was {{referred}} to a child guidance clinic for stealing and truancy. In June 1939, he first came before a juvenile court for stealing a purse from a girl and was given two years probation. His probation officer found that Straffen {{did not understand the}} difference between right and <b>wrong,</b> <b>or</b> the meaning of probation. The family was living in crowded lodgings at the time, and Straffen's mother had no time to help, so the probation officer took the boy to a psychiatrist. As a result, Straffen was certified as a mental defective under the Mental Deficiency Act 1927. A report was compiled on him in 1940 which gave his Intelligence Quotient as 58 and placed his mental age at six. From June 1940, the local council sent him to a residential school for mentally defective children, St Joseph's School in Sambourne.|$|E
25|$|The pre-war {{army was}} an all-volunteer army and {{recruits}} were allotted to {{the corps of}} their wishes. The only pre-conditions placed on candidates were {{an interview with a}} recruiting officer, who could only glean partial information on a recruit, a medical examination, and some educational tests. If these requirements were met, the recruit was posted to the arm of his choice, there was no scientific selection process unlike the rapidly growing German army. This led to men being allocated to the <b>wrong</b> <b>or</b> unsuitable corps. The Secretary of State for War, Leslie Hore-Belisha attempted to address these problems, and the wider problems of the British army. The process of allocating men would remain ad hoc {{at the start of the}} war. The army would be without the quotas of men required from skilled professions and trades, which modern warfare demanded.

25|$|Savil, realizing Vanyel needs special assistance, {{takes him}} to the Tayledras, human beings who live in K'Treva, an {{environment}} immersed in magic. They {{teach him how to}} control his abilities, and convince him that being gay is not <b>wrong</b> <b>or</b> sinful. Vanyel {{does not want to be}} a Herald or a Mage, and suspects the people around him value his powers, not himself. He runs away, but as he thinks things over he realizes that Savil and the others have shown that they care about him. Just when he realizes that and moves to return he discovers a village being terrorized by a colddrake, a type of dragon. Before he can even think to do anything, he witnesses the dragon killing an elderly man. He pulls himself together and kills the dragon, but the unfortunate timing gives Vanyel the impression that he is a coward. The Tayledras later explain that he is not at all cowardly and that his reactions were normal.|$|E
25|$|Heraclitus {{was born}} to an aristocratic family in Ephesus, in the Persian Empire, {{in what is now}} called present-day Efes, Turkey. His father was named either Blosôn or Herakôn. Diogenes says that he abdicated the kingship (basileia) in favor of his brother and Strabo {{confirms}} that there was a ruling family in Ephesus descended from the Ionian founder, Androclus, which still kept the title and could sit in the chief seat at the games, as well as a few other privileges. How much power the king had is another question. Ephesus {{had been part of the}} Persian Empire since 547 and was ruled by a satrap, a more distant figure, as the Great King allowed the Ionians considerable autonomy. Diogenes says that Heraclitus used to play knucklebones with the youths in the temple of Artemis and when asked to start making laws he refused saying that the constitution (politeia) was ponêra, which can mean either that it was fundamentally <b>wrong</b> <b>or</b> that he considered it toilsome. Two extant letters between Heraclitus and Darius I, quoted by Diogenes, are undoubtedly later forgeries.|$|E
25|$|While {{dialogue}} {{can involve}} {{two or more}} people having conversations about opposing view points, it is not dialectical {{because there is no}} thesis or antithesis. In dialetical debates, all parties engaged are trying to prove the other wrong (which is what modern day psychotherapy boils down to). Rather, dialogue is more of a fusion of horizons, to use Gadamer’s term. When Dasein engages in dialogue with others, his horizon effectively fuses with the horizons of others. These horizons are polyphonic (multi-voiced) and fuse {{for the sole purpose of}} achieving higher truth and understanding. Put differently, the horizons of two polyphonic individuals are fused together during dialogue in such a way that both horizons are influenced and edified as opposed to one winning out over the other, and as opposed to one horizon remaining the same while the other that is judged to be <b>wrong,</b> <b>or</b> could be, is changed. Hermeneutics states that fusing horizons with others involves memory and imagination. It is through dialogue that memory and imagination enables therapists to empathically envision (intropathy) the horizon of their clients and further fuse it with their own.|$|E
