Confronting Saren, Shepard can kill him or convince him to rebel, which results in Saren committing suicide. As a human Systems Alliance fleet masses to counterattack, Shepard must either save the Council and risk heavy casualties or abandon them to pursue Sovereign. Sovereign then reanimates Saren's corpse to attack Shepard, while simultaneously fighting off the Alliance. Eventually, humanity prevails, and Saren's corpse is destroyed while Sovereign is dispatched by the Normandy. Humanity <b>will</b> <b>then</b> <b>join</b> the Council, either as a member if it was saved or as its new leader if {{it was left to}} perish. Regardless, Shepard nominates either Anderson or Udina to this new leadership position before turning away from the proceedings, vowing to end the Reaper threat.|$|E

For each character, the player must earn a number of stars on a selection of songs tied to each character that represented the genre the character personifies; for example, the mohawk-wearing Johnny Napalm has songs primarily from the punk genre. After achieving the required number of stars, the character transforms into a more powerful character, and the player must complete one more song (the [...] "encore") to recruit the character. That character <b>will</b> <b>then</b> <b>join</b> {{in the fight against}} the Beast, and the opportunity to recruit other characters become available.

According to Islamic tradition, the Mahdi's tenure will coincide with the Second Coming of Jesus Christ (Isa), who is to assist the Mahdi against the Masih ad-Dajjal (literally, the [...] "false Messiah" [...] or Antichrist).

He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.

50|$|The {{geological}} {{history of}} Kure is generally similar to Midway, but Kure lies {{close to what}} is called the Darwin Point, the latitude at which reef growth just equals reef destruction by various physical forces. As Kure continues to be slowly carried along to the northwest by the motion of the Pacific Plate, it will move into waters too cool for coral and coralline algae growth to keep up with isostatic subsidence of the mountain, so long as global warming does not interfere. Currently the atoll is warmed by the pools of water at the ends of the warm Kuroshio current, keeping it in very comfortable range in winter. Barring unforeseen evolution, it <b>will</b> <b>then</b> begin to <b>join</b> the other volcanic and reef-topped remnants of the Hawaiian-Emperor Chain to the northwest, all of which are now seamounts.|$|R

We must teach the poor to think work a thing fit for heaven, a blessed thing. I'll tell you what we'll do, Dowler. Will you subscribe, and you, and you, and we'll send lecturers about with magic lanterns showing heaven as it should be, the saints with spades and hammers in their hands and everybody working.

5000|$|On 7 July 2006, it was {{confirmed}} by West Bromwich Albion manager Bryan Robson that Manchester United had made a bid of around £2 million for Kuszczak. On 3 August, West Brom rejected a £2.5 million bid for Kuszczak from United, citing that a one-year loan spell for United starlet Giuseppe Rossi {{would also have to}} be included along with the cash to result in a deal. On 10 August 2006, Kuszczak joined Manchester United in a deal involving the transfers of England Under-18 goalkeeper Luke Steele and defender Paul McShane to West Brom. When officially announcing the move, United failed to state the terms of the deal, leading to suggestions that it was a merely a loan deal. Chief executive David Gill clarified the situation, stating, [...] "Tomasz will be a Manchester United player for the next four years, he has come to us on loan for the first year, and <b>then</b> <b>will</b> <b>join</b> us permanently in July 2007." ...|$|R
30|$|To {{configure}} {{the virtual}} links and the IPv 6 network {{on top of}} them, standard IPv 6 stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) is applied. IPv 6 routers broadcast Router Advertisements on their configured GVLs using the corresponding virtual interfaces. This is translated by GN 6 ASL to geo-broadcast ETSI GeoNetworking packets with a destination area equal to the corresponding GVL area. Upon the reception of such an advertisement by other nodes within that area, these nodes will check if they have already configured this GVL. If not, they will create it using the destination area of the GeoBroadcast packet, configure a new corresponding virtual interface, and forward the packet over that interface to the IPv 6 layer for further SLAAC execution. This approach is most suitable in the situation where roadside units (RSUs) provide wireless coverage. In that case, each consecutive RSU is responsible for its own area, and will continuously broadcast Router Advertisements on the corresponding GVL. Vehicles <b>will</b> <b>then</b> continuously <b>join</b> and leave GVLs based on their current position. The overhead on the wireless medium {{is limited to the}} broadcasts of the RSUs. However, on roads where no such RSU coverage is available, vehicles are themselves responsible for creating GVLs that enable them to communicate with the surrounding vehicles. If all vehicles start defining a GVL around its own position, and hence continuously broadcast router advertisements, this will result in a significant load on the wireless medium. However, if too few nodes try to set up a GVL, this could lead to situations where vehicles are within each others’ communication range but fail to actually communicate IPv 6 packets. A suitable protocol that takes these trade-offs into account is required, but not yet available.|$|R
