40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{identifying}} key factors for cereal yield and mineral nitrogen content, 87 fields of <b>wheat,</b> <b>spelt,</b> rye, <b>triticale</b> and barley on 31 organic farms were evaluated from 2009 to 2011. According to multiple linear regression analysis, factors leading to high cereal yields were high mineral nitrogen content, high soil water storage and high cereal coverage in spring; also deep soil, low weed pressure, high available phosphorous content and low growing frequency in previous years. Key factors for high mineral nitrogen content in spring included low cereal coverage in spring, vegetation cover in winters of previous years, high soil organic matter and silt content, low C/N ratio, low plough depth, legume intercropping before sowing and use of manure or slurry nitrogen. An additional survey year with additional parameters will be conducted before the project’s official end...|$|R

It was found that flour fractions (break flour and reduction flour) showed the lower content of primary metabolites than bran fractions (fine bran and coarse bran).

40|$|Some root-associated pseudomonads sustain {{plant growth}} by suppressing root {{diseases}} caused by pathogenic fungi. We investigated to which extent select cereal cultivars influence expression of relevant biocontrol traits (i. e., root colonization efficacy and antifungal activity) in Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA 0. In this representative plant-beneficial bacterium, the antifungal metabolites 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), pyrrolnitrin (PRN), pyoluteorin (PLT), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) {{are required for}} biocontrol. To monitor host plant effects on the expression of biosynthetic genes for these compounds on roots, we developed fluorescent dual-color reporters suited for flow cytometric analysis using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In the dual-label strains, the constitutively expressed red fluorescent protein mCherry served as a cell tag and marker for root colonization, whereas reporter fusions based on the green fluorescent protein allowed simultaneous recording of antifungal gene expression within the same cell. FACS analysis revealed that expression of DAPG and PRN biosynthetic genes was promoted in a cereal rhizosphere, whereas expression of PLT and HCN biosynthetic genes was markedly less sustained. When analyzing {{the response of the}} bacterial reporters on roots of a selection of <b>wheat,</b> <b>spelt,</b> and <b>triticale</b> cultivars, we were able to detect subtle species- and cultivar-dependent differences in colonization and DAPG and HCN gene expression levels. The expression of these biocontrol traits was particularly favored on roots of one spelt cultivar, suggesting that a careful choice of pseudomonad-cereal combinations might be beneficial to biocontrol. Our approach may be useful for selective single-cell level analysis of plant effects in other bacteria-root interactions...|$|R
40|$|Samples of <b>wheat,</b> <b>spelt,</b> rye, and <b>triticale</b> flours {{produced}} by different Polish mills were studied by both classic chemical methods and FT-IR MIR spectroscopy. An {{attempt was made}} to statistically correlate FT-IR spectral data with reference data with regard to content of various components, for example, proteins, fats, ash, and fatty acids as well as properties such as moisture, falling number, and energetic value. This correlation resulted in calibrated and validated statistical models for versatile evaluation of unknown flour samples. The calibration data set was used to construct calibration models with use of the CSR and the PLS with the leave one-out, cross-validation techniques. The calibrated models were validated with a validation data set. The results obtained confirmed that application of statistical models based on MIR spectral data is a robust, accurate, precise, rapid, inexpensive, and convenient methodology for determination of flour characteristics, as well as for detection of content of selected flour ingredients. The obtained models’ characteristics were as follows: R 2 = 0. 97, PRESS = 2. 14; R 2 = 0. 96, PRESS = 0. 69; R 2 = 0. 95, PRESS = 1. 27; R 2 = 0. 94, PRESS = 0. 76, for content of proteins, lipids, ash, and moisture level, respectively.

The goal of this work was to {{contribute}} to better understanding of <b>spelt</b> <b>wheat</b> kernels’ use, which were differently processed in variable agroecological settings. Dynamics of water acquisition is the same for both hulled and dehulled kernels of <b>spelt</b> <b>wheat,</b> but the difference in water content required for germination leads to different times of this process. Negative influence of hulled kernels on germination is amplified in periods of drought and unfavorable temperatures.

40|$|Fusarium {{infestation}} and DON content {{were studied}} in genetic resources of spring wheat (einkorn, emmer <b>wheat,</b> <b>spelt</b> <b>wheat,</b> intermediate forms of bread wheat). The study {{aimed at the}} comparison of grain contamination rates in various wheat species being grown in organic farming systems. The trials were established on certified organic parcels in two different localities in the Czech Republic in 2009 and 2010. The PCR method and specific primers were used to detect Fusarium. The proportion of deoxynivalenol (DON) was indicated and measured by the immuno-affinity chromatography (ROSA® DON Quantitative Test). The grain DON contamination rate (1. 25 mg/kg) {{was set up in}} compliance with the European Commission (EC) Regulation No. 1126 / 2007. This regulation sets up limits that have never been exceeded in any of the varieties. The strongest contamination rate was identified in grains of the control bread wheat varieties, and in the SW Kadrilj cultivar (0. 98 mg/kg) being grown in Ceske Budejovice. On the other hand, quite a low proportion of DON was detected in the hulled wheat varieties (einkorn, emmer <b>wheat,</b> <b>spelt</b> <b>wheat).</b> Hull may serve as a protection of grains there, as it is eliminated just before the processing of grains. The occurence of Fusarium was influenced by a grown wheat species. The occurence of Fusarium poae in grains was influenced (P< 0. 01) by a reduced resistance of the crop stand to lodging (r= 0. 58). The occurence of this Fusarium species was the weakest one. Grains were less contaminated with Fusarium culmorum, whereas the contamination rate was dominantly influenced by the year, einkorn and emmer wheat were the least infested wheat species.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the baking quality of the <b>spelt</b> <b>wheat</b> grain (Triticum spelta L.) {{compared}} with common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Mixed flours were made of different share of <b>spelt</b> <b>wheat</b> and common wheat (in total 11 mixtures). The technological quality of these mixtures was analyzed, focusing on standard evaluation methods (protein content, characteristic of gluten or swellability of protein). The analysis was supplemented by complete rheological analysis made by MIXOLAB II. Bread {{was used as a}} model product. Subsequently, sensory evaluation of baked bread from the previously prepared mixtures was done. Part of the analysis was to estimate the economic basic bread recipe with different proportions of common <b>wheat</b> and <b>spelt</b> <b>wheat.</b> The results were statistically analyzed via STATISTICA 9. 1 (StatSoft, Inc., USA). It was proved that the flour made of spelt can give cereal products with higher nutritional value. From a technological point of view, the results have shown that the spelt grain is much more suitable for baking. Its advantage is the higher protein content and higher resistence of kneading of the dough and starch gelatinization rate, which was statistically confirmed by Tukey HSD test. The other benefits of spelt grain is the higher nutritional value in comparsion to common wheat grain. The main disadvantage is the higher price of spelt. According to the results, the ideal utilization of <b>spelt</b> <b>wheat</b> based on sensory analysis and economic calculations seems to be the mixture of <b>spelt</b> <b>wheat</b> and bread wheat, which results in an undenieble decrease of the product cost, and hence effects the common customer choice and taste preferences...|$|R
