50|$|Cadbury Hill is a {{designated}} Local Nature Reserve. In 2009, a 19th-century agricultural stock pond - previously hidden by undergrowth - was restored by the Yatton & Congresbury Wildlife Action Group (YACWAG). The Local Nature Reserve comprises ancient semi-natural woodland, scrub and unimproved grassland. Species of interest include marsh tit, noctule bat, slow worm, <b>wood</b> anemone, bluebell, <b>betony,</b> small scabious, rock rose, small leaved lime. On the northern limestone slope grow hundreds of common spotted orchids. The hill fort itself has many ant hills, which are visited by green woodpeckers.|$|R

50|$|Stachys officinalis is {{commonly}} known as common hedgenettle, betony, purple betony, <b>wood</b> <b>betony,</b> bishopwort, or bishop's wort. The French common name is betoine, and Betonie in German. It is a perennial grassland herb growing to 1 to 2 feet tall.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} of the genus covers Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia and North America. Common names include hedgenettle, heal-all, self-heal, woundwort, betony, and lamb's ears. <b>Wood</b> <b>betony,</b> Stachys officinalis, {{was the most important}} medicinal herb to the Anglo-Saxons of early medieval Great Britain.|$|E
50|$|Pedicularis furbishiae (Furbish's lousewort) is a {{perennial}} herb found {{only on the}} shores of the upper Saint John River in Maine and New Brunswick. Furbish's lousewort was first recognized as a new species by Maine naturalist and botanical artist Kate Furbish (who named it Furbish's <b>wood</b> <b>betony)</b> in 1880. It is considered an endangered species in the United States and Canada, and is threatened by habitat destruction, as well as riverside development, forestry, littering and recreational use of the riverbank. It was formerly in the Scrophulariaceae family, the same family as snapdragon and figwort. It is now placed in the Orobanchaceae family.|$|E
50|$|Pedicularis canadensis is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} Orobanchaceae family and {{is also known as}} <b>wood</b> <b>betony,</b> beefsteak plant, Canadian lousewort, high heal-all, snaffles and Canada lousewort. It is found in thickets and dry, open wooded areas throughout Canada and the United States. It is a low, hairy plant with a broad whorl of tubular, hooded flowers on top of a segmented stalk. It has long, soft, hairy leaves (many are basal, growing tufted from roots), some 5 to 15 inches long, deeply incised and toothed, often reddish. A favorite of bees, its flowers bloom from April through June. The flowers range in color from a greenish-yellow to purplish-red, clustered on short, dense spikes. The fruit is a long brown seed capsule.|$|E
50|$|Prairie {{remnants}} {{are present}} on the south-facing ridge and have recovered from previous agricultural use due to intensive management that began in 1995. Plant species include big bluestem, little bluestem, Indian grass, side-oats grama, <b>wood</b> <b>betony,</b> bird's-foot violet, purple prairie clover, wood sorrel, and the uncommon prairie turnip (Pediomelum esculentum). Numerous large bur and white oaks are found further up the slope where the land transitions to oak savannas. Plant species found here include numerous grass, sedge, and forb species including the state-endangered purple milkweed (Asclepias purpurascens). Other plants include silky rye, bottlebrush grass, ear-leaved brome, leadplant, large-flowered yellow false foxglove, Canada milk-vetch, Illinois tick-trefoil, alum-root, shooting star, and spiderwort. Other rare plants present are the state-threatened giant yellow hyssop (Agastache nepetoides), and special concern upland boneset (Eupatorium sessilifolium). Over the ridgetop, the cooler north-facing slope is mostly oak woodland with red oak, basswood, hackberry, butternut, yellowbud hickory, and red maple. Spring ephemerals are abundant here, including bloodroot, Jacob's-ladder, large-flowered bellwort, yellow lady's-slipper orchid, large white trillium, and dutchman's breeches. Bird species found at this site include the red-headed woodpecker, blue-gray gnatcatcher, eastern wood pewee, tufted titmouse, eastern bluebird, yellow-throated vireo, scarlet tanager, black-billed cuckoo, and yellow-billed cuckoo. At {{the base of the}} south-facing slope is the spring-fed Pleasant Valley Creek, which travels through a wetland before emptying into East Blue Mounds Creek. Pleasant Valley Conservancy is owned in part by The Prairie Enthusiasts and by Tom Brock and his wife Kathie with management support from the Savanna Oak Foundation.|$|E

Perhaps less common, but equally wonderful, are its green-leaved cousins, big betony (S. macrantha) and <b>wood</b> <b>betony</b> (S. officinalis). Betony is a name commonly applied to Stachys species with green leaves and showy flowers, although lamb’s ears are sometimes called woolly betony. These two types of Stachys are so unalike in floral display and foliar character that, at casual glance, {{it is easy to}} miss their relationship. Stachys is in the mint family (Lamiaceae) and features the distinctive familial traits of bilabiate (two-lipped...|$|E
40|$|Many {{native plants}} in {{traditional}} medicine {{have been used}} for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis and the recent clinical trials have proven the efficacy of some of them. Researches conducted on these plants have shown that garlic, shallots, wormwood, yarrow, walnuts, thyme, henna plant, mimosa, aloe, <b>wood</b> <b>betony,</b> medlar, periwinkle, yeah, savory, black beans, etc. are effective on cutaneous leishmania. Synthetic agents in Iranian market have some disadvantages such as high cost and side effects and are painful in injections. Given the effectiveness of these plants, they can be a source of natural and safe compounds for the treatment of Leishmania. Therefore, more clinical researches should be done to determine the effectiveness and safety of these medicinal plants, their active ingredients and their possible toxic substances which can lead to the production of effective and safe drugs for leishmaniasis. It also might be an effective way to prepare herbal ointment on wound healing...|$|E
40|$|Nectar {{production}} in <b>wood</b> <b>betony</b> (Stachys officinalis L), grown under differ-microclimatic habitat conditions (forest and experimental field), was analyzed. Study of tar {{production in}}cluded determining {{of the total}} daily nectar amount (in 24 hours) per flower, the diurnal dynamics of nectar secretion (nectar amount secreted per flower at two hour intervals during the day), and nectar sugar concentration. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of microclimatic parameters humidity, air temperature and evaporation) on the secretion process and nectar sugar concentration. Comparative analyses of nectar secretion in Stachys officinalis, grown in two environmentally different habitats, confirmed that this process varied as a function of micro-climatic habitat conditions, and did not reveal a close relationship between these conditions and sugar concentration in nectar. A diurnal model of nectar secretion with two secretion peaks was found. A higher amount of nectar per flower, with an increasing tendency during the first half of the day, and a decreasing tendency during the afternoon was measured in forest conditions (lower temperature, higher relative air humidity and lower evaporation) ...|$|E
