She followed this up by explaining: [...] "The definition of pop has become looser, more inclusive. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> pop, you're basically {{talking about a}} hook, a melody that catches your attention." [...] She said {{that she wanted to}} make the material both easily accessible, as well as artistic, clarifying that she never set out to make music as experimental as that of Björk. She experimented with Caribbean music after developing an interest in it while studying African-American dance and music in the Dominican Republic. When asked about how her music is received, Chana responded that various Latin communities responded to it differently as they had different definitions of mainstream and underground music.|$|E

Just days after The New Republic article was published, Linder {{said in an interview that}} he had been acquainted with Paul for 20 years and felt Paul was “a very honorable guy” whose libertarian positions were being misunderstood by a lot of people. “e's got some very good ideas. But I think the problem is, from an African-American perspective, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> state vs. Federal power.... <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> states' rights and the Confederacy, and those kinds of things, sometimes it gets taken out of context.... you attract people sometimes who are still fighting the Civil War.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Having {{graduated}} from Lancashire's Academy, 2005 was Cross' first {{year with the}} senior squad. Lancashire's veteran wicket-keeper Hegg was impressed by Cross, and said [...] "He has a really good work ethic, and he listens <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the game. He's the one in line to take over from me." [...] Cross made hist first-class debut on 25 May 2005, along with Steven Croft and Tom Smith in a match against Oxford University. He batted just once in the match, scoring two runs, although he dismissed five batsmen, one by stumping and four caught. His second opportunity to play first-class cricket came in the last match of the season; with Lancashire's stalwart Warren Hegg injured, Cross was given the responsibility of taking over as wicket-keeper. Playing in the County Championship for the [...] first time, according to The Wisden Cricketer Cross [...] "showed enough pure technique to deserve his chance to develop". Although Hegg retired {{at the end of}} the season, Lancashire quickly signed experienced wicket-keeper Luke Sutton from Derbyshire, hampering Cross' chances to regularly play first-team cricket. In the 2005/06 Australian cricket season, Cross travelled to the southern hemisphere to play for St Kilda Cricket Club in the Victorian Premier Cricket. He spent most of the season playing for the club's second team.|$|E
2500|$|Small in stature, {{he lacked}} the overall power of his larger {{competitors}} such as Don Budge and Kramer but made up for it with brains, ball control, and speed. A master court strategist and tactician, he worked his opponent out of position and scored points with the game's best drop shot and lob as well as punishing ground strokes that let him come to the net for put-away shots. [...] Kramer, {{one of the very}} few players who was undeniably better than Riggs, writes that there is a major [...] "misconception" [...] about Riggs. [...] "He didn't play some rinky-dink Harold Solomon style, pitty-pattying the ball around on dirt. [...] He didn't have the big serve, but he made up for it with some sneaky first serves and as fine a second serve as I had seen at that time. [...] <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> depth and accuracy both, Riggs' second serve ranks with the other three best that I ever saw: von Cramm's, Gonzales's, and Newcombe's." [...] In his own autobiography, Riggs wrote, [...] "In the 1946 match with Budge , I charged the net at every opportunity. [...] Employing what I called my secret weapon, a hard first serve, I attacked constantly during my 6–3, 6–1, 6–1 victory." ...|$|E

And Mrs. Proudie smiled on him graciously, though her daughter would not do so.
