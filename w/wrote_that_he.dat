An Australian lawyer pointed out the case to Diefenbaker; he thought it interesting but noted that he was not a member of the Law Society of British Columbia. Diefenbaker <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> planned to meet Edna in Hawaii on his way back from Australia. Instead she wired him, requesting that he meet her in Vancouver.|$|E

5|$|Altgens was {{featured}} in two AP dispatches issued on November 22, 1963. He initially reported hearing two shots, but thought someone had been setting off fireworks. For a November 25 story, Altgens <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not know the}} origin of the gunshots until later, but he believed they came {{from the other side of}} Elm Street, opposite the presidential limousine from where he was standing.|$|E
5|$|Calvin also <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{prepared}} to follow the Lord's calling. A plan was drawn up in which Viret would be appointed to take temporary charge in Geneva for six months while Bucer and Calvin would visit the city to determine the next steps. The city council pressed for the immediate appointment of Calvin in Geneva. By mid-1541, Strasbourg decided to lend Calvin to Geneva for six months. Calvin returned on 13 September 1541 with an official escort and a wagon for his family.|$|E
5|$|During Roosevelt's fifteen months {{beyond the}} Atlantic, from March 1909 to June 1910, neither man wrote {{much to the}} other. Taft biographer Lurie {{suggested}} that each expected the other {{to make the first}} move to re-establish their relationship on a new footing. Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him to stay at the White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> expected Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912, and did not speak of himself as a candidate.|$|E

5|$|Grissom's {{spacecraft}} {{was recovered}} in 1999, but no further evidence was found which could conclusively {{explain how the}} explosive hatch release had occurred. Later, Guenter Wendt, pad leader for the early American manned space launches, <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed a small cover over the external release actuator was accidentally lost sometime during the flight or splashdown, and the T-handle may have been tugged by a stray parachute suspension line, or was perhaps damaged by the heat of re-entry and, after cooling upon splashdown, contracted and fired.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Antoniu <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought Gibbs-Smith speculated on {{the basis}} of the {{evidence}} of absence that the aircraft was never tested or flown, but that Gibbs-Smith did not find any concrete evidence to support his position. Similarly, Antoniu was unable to find concrete proof of a test flight. Antoniu also wrote that Gibbs-Smith did not check the French patents claimed by Coandă in 1910 and 1911, describing the retractable gear, leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel tank, and that he did not see photographs from private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote.|$|E
5|$|In a {{preface to}} his 1926 drama Korbannja Kong-Ek (The Victim of Kong-Ek), Kwee Tek Hoay <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had drawn {{inspiration}} from the realist Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen in that work, having read and reread the author's plays. Damono finds signs of Ibsen's influence already present in Allah jang Palsoe. He compares the stage directions in Allah jang Palsoe to those in Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and finds them to be similar in their level of detail.|$|E

5|$|In his 1998 {{autobiography}} For the Love of the Game, Jordan <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had been}} preparing for retirement {{as early as the}} summer of 1992.

5|$|Just {{before the}} 2010–11 Seahawks-Saints playoff game, McKay wanted {{to revisit the}} {{previous}} proposal to reseed teams during wild-card weekend. However, sportswriter Peter King <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed league owners were still hesitant on implementing any such changes at this time due to the then-pending 2011 work stoppage, the proposals to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games {{and how it will}} impact the postseason, and the simple fact that not enough teams have been seriously disadvantaged by the current format.|$|E

(Carey <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> prefers Las Vegas, as he sees Atlantic City as being filled with retired people shuffling around, playing nickel slot machines.)

5|$|Mihardja later <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{intended}} the novel {{to deal with}} the question of the existence of God. Mahayana et al. agree, noting that the theme of faith– a theme unknown in modern Indonesian literature at the time– is found throughout the novel. Maier notes that the psychological concepts of guilt, fear, and remorse drive the novel. Teeuw describes the work as taking up the classic theme of modernity versus tradition in a new, more worldly manner. Balfas writes that this approach to the theme was soon followed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, 2009, Eiland-Hall {{wrote to}} Beck, giving him {{control of the}} domain free of charge, and {{providing}} Beck with its username and password. Eiland-Hall <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had made his point, and the act of filing the complaint exacerbated the situation for the complainant. Eiland-Hall explained his rationale for giving away the domain name, citing his desire to protect {{the applicability of the}} First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution had been satisfied.|$|E
5|$|The biographer Montague Haltrecht {{suggests}} that Solti seized the breach of his Los Angeles contract as a convenient pretext {{to abandon the}} Philharmonic in favour of Covent Garden. However, in his memoirs Solti <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted the Los Angeles position very much indeed. He originally considered holding both posts in tandem, but later acknowledged {{that he had had}} a lucky escape, as he could have done justice to neither post had he attempted to hold both simultaneously.|$|E

It was <b>written</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was in danger of [...] "falling from the grace of the faith" [...] which means <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was probably allured by the Ottomans to convert to Islam.

5|$|When {{profiling}} Kane in February 2013, Talksport {{said that}} he was best as a second striker, despite also having ability as a centre forward or in a wide position. They <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> preferred to place his shots, although he could also score from distance. The report also noted that he had good pace, but was weak in the air and had not scored on his loan at Norwich. Initially a back-up to £26million Spanish import Roberto Soldado and frequently loaned out, Kane was eventually made Tottenham's starting forward by manager Mauricio Pochettino.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday {{believed}} that Tom had a revolver {{at the time}} of the gunfight. Wyatt thought Tom fired a revolver under the horse's neck and believed until he died that Tom's revolver had been removed from the scene by Wesley Fuller. Witness Fallehy <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. In his statement, Fallehy wrote that the man still held his pistol in his hand. Although he did not see him shoot, he thought Tom McLaury was armed.|$|E
5|$|Although Stanford had fared poorly {{during the}} {{previous}} seasons, Thornhill had left behind a team with a talented roster, which included 24returning lettermen. Shaughnessy believed the players were good, but unsuited to the single-wing offense that his predecessor had employed. Perhaps most importantly, Shaughnessy inherited back Frankie Albert, whom he considered a prototypical T formation quarterback. In 1943, Shaughnessy <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> considered the 1940 Stanford backfield—quarterback Frankie Albert, fullback Norm Standlee, right halfback Hugh Gallarneau, and left halfback Pete Kmetovic—as the greatest in history. While he believed the Indians backfield was better than any such combination in the single-wing, double-wing, short punt, or box formations, he added the caveat that this held true only in the Stanford players' employment in the T-formation.|$|E
