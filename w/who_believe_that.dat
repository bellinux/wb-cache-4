5|$|Black Hebrew Israelites (also called Black Hebrews, African Hebrew Israelites, and Hebrew Israelites) are {{groups of}} African Americans <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they are {{descendants}} of the ancient Israelites. Black Hebrews adhere in varying degrees to the religious beliefs and practices of both Christianity and Judaism. They are not recognized as Jews by the greater Jewish community. Many choose to identify themselves as Hebrew Israelites or Black Hebrews rather than Jews in order to indicate their claimed historic connections.|$|E

Dexter realizes that he must protect his secrets, so he begins by cleaning his boat that night with a black light to detect any blood. He is unaware that the marina is being videotaped by the Miami-Metro Police, <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Bay Harbor Butcher may be keeping his boat at that marina.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Kemp {{continued}} to be considered along with Reagan as the politician most responsible {{for the implementation of}} supply-side tax cuts and along with Steve Forbes as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in the marketplace of political ideas. He {{has been described as a}} beacon of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.|$|E

5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth {{has been done by}} several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they have parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E
5|$|Special permits {{exist to}} allow for the sale of {{alcoholic}} beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by non-profit organizations (for example, church carnivals). A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell wine from a New Jersey winery by becoming an offsite retail sales outlet of the winery. Since the early 1990s, there have been a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine. Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it would decrease their income, and thus the value of their liquor license.|$|E
5|$|The National Gallery {{has also}} been criticised for misattributing paintings. Kenneth Clark's {{decision}} in 1939 to relabel a group of paintings by anonymous artists of the Venetian school as works by Giorgione (a crowd-pulling artist due to the rarity of his paintings) made him unpopular with his staff. More recently, the attribution of a 17th-century painting of Samson and Delilah (bought in 1980) to Rubens has been contested {{by a group of}} art historians, <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the National Gallery has not admitted the mistake to avoid embarrassing those {{who were involved in the}} purchase, many of whom still work for the Gallery.|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} of soccer (football) {{in the neighborhood}} flourished after the Southwest Houston Soccer Association {{was established in the}} 1990s. Prior to its establishment, a few adult teams existed, but no youth league. In 1995, Silvia Ramirez, a soccer coach, said in a newspaper article that a lack of confidence in English language abilities and long work hours prevented many area residents from creating soccer leagues. The same article quotes citizens <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> playing soccer prevented them from joining gangs. In 2007, Diana De La Rose, principal of Jane Long Middle School, said that soccer was popular among Gulfton-area students. In 2010 the Houston Dynamo soccer team proposed the construction of a stadium near Gulfton. Instead the BBVA Compass Stadium began construction in East Downtown.|$|E

The additional missions feature Shen investigating terror attacks around Hong Kong stemming from a cultist group <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they will achieve spiritual salvation through the cleansing of Hong Kong residents. Shen must sabotage the cult's activities, ultimately ending in the arrest of the cult master. The DLC also adds the ability for Shen to tase and arrest civilians and criminals around Hong Kong, as well as additional collectibles, side missions, ownable police vehicles, and new clothing.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} that playing Magic might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills {{of some of the}} players. The article interviewed players' parents <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that Magic can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's Magic obsession. In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships.|$|E

5|$|High {{school student}} Alex Browning boards Volée Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates for their senior trip to Paris, France. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition {{that the plane}} will suffer a catastrophic engine failure, causing the plane to explode mid-air and kill {{everyone}} on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics and a fight breaks out between Alex and his rival, Carter Horton. This leads to several passengers being removed from the plane, including Alex; Carter; Alex's best friend, Tod Waggner; Carter's girlfriend, Terry Chaney; teacher Valerie Lewton; and students Billy Hitchcock and Clear Rivers. None of the passengers, except for Clear, believe Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take-off, killing the remaining passengers on board. Afterwards, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Alex {{had something to do}} with the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Hiroshi tells Hsing {{that he and}} {{a handful}} of allies, <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the people on the ship should stop at Hsin Ti Chiu, have been keeping news of the {{acceleration}} secret. They believe that hiding the knowledge of the schedule provides them a weapon against the angels, who do not wish the ship to stop at all. Hsing becomes a reluctant party to the conspiracy, but is distressed by its secrecy and what she considers to be dishonesty, and persuades Hiroshi and his allies to go public with the information. Meanwhile, Luis thoroughly investigates the education program for the sixth generation aboard the ship (the generation supposed to land on Hsin Ti Chiu) and finds that large parts of it have been erased or replaced with propaganda by the angels. Luis succeeds in making the ruling council of the ship launch an investigation into religious manipulation of the education program. Persuaded by Hsing, Hiroshi makes a public statement about the ship's new schedule, while concealing {{the fact that he had}} known about it for a while.|$|E
5|$|While various {{religions}} and denominations have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through {{concepts such as}} theistic evolution, there are creationists <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> evolution is contradicted by the creation myths found in their {{religions and}} who raise various objections to evolution. As had been demonstrated by responses to the publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation in 1844, the most controversial aspect of evolutionary biology is the implication of human evolution that humans share common ancestry with apes and that the mental and moral faculties of humanity have {{the same types of}} natural causes as other inherited traits in animals. In some countries, notably the United States, these tensions between science and religion have fuelled the current creation–evolution controversy, a religious conflict focusing on politics and public education. While other scientific fields such as cosmology and Earth science also conflict with literal interpretations of many religious texts, evolutionary biology experiences significantly more opposition from religious literalists.|$|E

5|$|The game's second case, Turnabout Airlines, {{takes place}} in the present, and has Edgeworth {{becoming}} involved with the smuggling ring during a trip aboard an airliner. An Interpol agent investigating the smuggling is murdered during the trip, and Edgeworth and a flight attendant become the main suspects. Another prosecutor, Franziska von Karma, works with Interpol to expose the smuggling ring; she and Edgeworth discover the murderer to be another flight attendant, who is working with the smuggling ring. In the third case, The Kidnapped Turnabout, Edgeworth is called by Ernest Amano, whose son Lance has been kidnapped and is held at an amusement park. While attempting to exchange the ransom money, Edgeworth is also kidnapped, but is freed by Kay, who calls herself the true Yatagarasu. They release Lance, and find the dead body of Oliver Deacon, who Lance identifies as one of the kidnappers. As Edgeworth investigates the mystery, he meets Interpol agents Shi-Long Lang and Shih-na, <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Amano's business group is involved with the smuggling ring; the ring's counterfeit money has ruined the economy of their home country Zheng Fa, so they seek {{to bring an end to}} the ring. Edgeworth learns that the kidnapping was a ploy by Lance to get money from his father, and that Lance had killed Deacon after the latter tried to back out of the plan. Evidence is found tying Amano to the smuggling ring, and Lang brings Amano in for questioning.|$|E
5|$|While McClellan's {{reputation}} {{has suffered}} over time, especially {{over the last}} 75 years, {{there is a small}} but intense cadre of American Civil War historians <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the general has been poorly served on at least four levels. First, McClellan proponents say that because the general was a conservative Democrat with great personal charisma, radical Republicans fearing his political potential deliberately undermined his field operations. Second, that as the radical Republicans were the true winners coming out of the American Civil War, they were able to write its history, placing their principal political rival of the time, McClellan, in the worst possible light. Third, that historians eager to jump on the bandwagon of Lincoln as America's greatest political icon worked to outdo one another in shifting blame for early military failures from Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to McClellan. And fourth, that Lincoln and Stanton deliberately undermined McClellan because of his conciliatory stance towards the South, which might have resulted in a less destructive end to the war had Richmond fallen {{as a result of the}} Peninsula Campaign. Proponents of this school claim that McClellan is criticized more for his admittedly abrasive personality than for his actual field performance.|$|E
