5|$|It was the 21st {{perfect game}} in MLB {{history and the}} first since Roy Halladay's perfect game on May 29, 2010. It was the third perfect game in White Sox history (tying them with the Yankees for most perfect games) after Charlie Robertson's (<b>who</b> <b>threw</b> the only other perfect game in April in MLB history) on April 30, 1922 and Mark Buehrle's on July 23, 2009, and the 18th no-hitter in White Sox history (tying them with the Red Sox for second most no-hitters). It was Humber's second start of the 2012 season and first career {{complete}} game.|$|E
5|$|On 18 May 2010, {{the front}} façade of the building, made of rare green tonalite, was {{severely}} damaged by students <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> granite rocks {{removed from a}} nearby pavement at the building's main entrance. The incident happened during a large student protest against the proposed law on the introduction of mini jobs that would curb student work and changes to scholarship policy. Repairs to the building were estimated at 27,000 euros.|$|E
5|$|On offense, the Jayhawks {{recorded}} {{a total of}} 344yards, 249of which came through the air. Quarterback Todd Reesing was the key contributor to the Kansas aerial attack, completing 20of his 37passes for 227yards and just one interception. The only other Kansas player to record passing yards was running back Brandon McAnderson, <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> a 22-yard first-down pass during a fake punt. Though under pressure {{for much of the}} game—Reesing was sacked four times—Kansas continued to maintain an effective pass attack throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|The 2003 Insight Bowl {{kicked off}} at 8:30p.m. EST on December 26, 2003. From the {{beginning}} of the game, it was a quick-paced, high-scoring contest. In the first quarter, Virginia Tech jumped out to a 21–7 lead courtesy of the Tech passing game, which was coordinated by quarterback Bryan Randall, <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> four touchdowns during the game. In the second quarter, California recovered from its 14-point first-quarter deficit by scoring twotouchdowns. Tech, meanwhile, scored another, and took a 28–21 lead into halftime.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Humanitarian Bowl Most Valuable Player honors {{were awarded}} to Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott, who rushed for 174yards, and Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick, <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> for 370yards. Each was the {{statistical}} leader at his respective position, and Scott scored Maryland's two final touchdowns {{to break the}} 28–28 stalemate. Scott also was able to help Maryland clinch the victory in the final minutes by rushing for a first down that allowed the team to run out the clock.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the loss}} {{of some of the}} {{previous}} year's important players, Maryland entered the 2008 season with a seasoned squad. Forty-six of sixty-two lettermen returned (74percent), which included ten offensive and six defensive starters. The 2008 team contained 31 seniors, which was the largest group since Friedgen became head coach in 2001. Important returnees on the defensive unit included cornerback Kevin Barnes, who recorded four interceptions in 2007; defensive end Jeremy Navarre, who had recorded 5.5 sacks; and linebacker Dave Philistin, who had recorded 124 tackles. The offense's returning statistical leaders included quarterback Chris Turner, <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> for 1,958passing yards in 2007; wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey, who had 786receiving yards; and running back Da'Rel Scott, who had 135rushing yards.|$|E

Shackleton reported that McNish calmly mentioned his narrow escape the next day after further cracks appeared in the ice. Mrs. Chippy, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot after the loss of the Endurance, as it was obvious he would not survive the harsh conditions. McNish apparently never forgave Shackleton for giving the order.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{jumped out}} to a quick 28–7 lead {{in the first two}} {{quarters}} of play, but the Hokies closed the lead to a 28–14 margin by halftime with a 3-yard run from Vick. In the second half, Tech made its biggest run of the game as Kicker Shayne Graham kicked a field goal and tailback Andre Kendrick added two rushing touchdowns to give the Hokies their first and only lead—29–28—with just over three minutes left in the third quarter. But in the end, the Hokies could not contain Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> twotouchdowns in the fourth quarter and 329yards in the game. The Seminoles defeated Virginia Tech 46–29.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been the}} franchise's {{starting}} quarterback for 13 seasons (longer {{than any other}} Vikings player), Fran Tarkenton holds {{the record for the}} most starts in a Vikings jersey, and those for the most wins and ties. He is also the franchise's leading passer in terms of numbers of attempts, completions, total yards gained and passing touchdowns, although Brett Favre has the best pass completion percentage. However, Tarkenton has also thrown the most interceptions. The record for the longest completed pass by a Vikings starting quarterback is held by Gus Frerotte, <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> a 99-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bernard Berrian in a home game against the Chicago Bears in the 2008 season.|$|E

Although Thorkildsen did not retake the national number one spot right away, he did display increasing {{form in the}} preparations for the Olympic Games. He qualified for the Olympics with an 84.12m throw at the Bergen Bislett Games, an event which was won by Breaux Greer with a North American record and world leading throw of 87.39metres. On 27 July Thorkildsen took his first victory in an IAAF Grand Prix meet, beating Breaux Greer by a comfortable margin at the DN Galan meet in Stockholm. Three days later he improved his season best to 84.45metres at the London Grand Prix at Crystal Palace.|$|E
5|$|King Harald Hardrada invaded {{northern}} England {{in early}} September, leading {{a fleet of}} more than 300 ships carrying perhaps 15,000 men. Harald's army was further augmented {{by the forces of}} Tostig, <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> his support behind the Norwegian king's bid for the throne. Advancing on York, the Norwegians defeated a northern English army under Edwin and Morcar on 20 September at the Battle of Fulford. The two earls had rushed to engage the Norwegian forces before King Harold could arrive from the south. Although Harold Godwinson had married Edwin and Morcar's sister Ealdgyth, the two earls may have distrusted Harold and feared that the king would replace Morcar with Tostig. The end result was that their forces were devastated and unable to participate {{in the rest of the}} campaigns of 1066, although the two earls survived the battle.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{freshman}} {{wide receiver}} Torrey Smith, with his 99-yard kickoff return touchdown, broke the all-time ACC record for single-season kickoff returns with 1,089yards. Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott rushed for 174yards, earning Most Valuable Player honors alongside Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> for 370yards. Scott set the University of Maryland's record for rushing {{yards in a}} bowl game, in what was just one-and-half quarters of playing time due to his curfew suspension. He also broke the 1,000-yard per season barrier, making him one of just seven players in school history to do so. Four Maryland back-ups who saw significant play due to the curfew suspensions also scored touchdowns: second-string X-receiver Torrey Smith, second-string slot receiver Ronnie Tyler, third-string slot receiver Adrian Cannon, and third-string running back Morgan Green.|$|E

5|$|Through 11 {{weeks in}} 2012, the Jets {{struggled}} to a 4–7 record. The presence of quarterback Tim Tebow created a controversy {{as the media}} and fans called for Ryan to bench the inconsistent Mark Sanchez in favor of Tebow. Ryan was criticized for his decision to keep Tebow activated during the Jets' Thanksgiving Day contest against the New England Patriots despite Tebow playing with two broken ribs, leading to questions about his job security. With Tebow inactive for the Jets' following contest against the Arizona Cardinals, Ryan {{made the decision to}} bench Sanchez, <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> three interceptions, in favor of Greg McElroy. McElroy threw a touchdown pass to tight end Jeff Cumberland to score the team's only points in a 7–6 victory over Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Arkansas State got {{the ball}} to start the second half, and {{promptly}} drove down the field relying predominantly on Knighten, <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> six passes and attempted three rushes; ultimately, their drive stalled at the 2-yard line, and Davis kicked an 18-yard field goal to put the Red Wolves atop 13–10. Ball State subsequently faced a fourth down and one (4th and 1) situation, on which they attempted a fake punt – Schmidt was tackled by Brock Barnhill on the play and lost three yards on the rush, and the Cardinals had to relinquish the ball in their own territory. Arkansas State {{took advantage of the}} field position, converting another field goal attempt, this one from 29 yards, to give them a 6-point lead. Once again, Ball State turned the ball over on downs on their ensuing possession, this time doing so at the Arkansas State 32-yard line. This time, Arkansas State failed to take advantage, punting after achieving only one first down. At the end of the quarter, Ball State {{was in the midst of}} a possession around their 25-yard line.|$|E
5|$|During the Syracuse game, Kafka set {{a school}} record for {{consecutive}} completions in a game with 16, breaking the 47-year-old record set by Tom Myers in 1962. He set a new career-high in passingyards in a game by passing for 390yards, breaking his previous career-high in the season opener. Kafka also ran for a three-yard touchdown and threw three touchdown passes along with an interception. He caught a receiving touchdown when he tossed a lateral to Andrew Brewer <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> it back to Kafka for a 24-yard touchdown. Kafka became the first Big Ten Conference player to score at least one passing, receiving and rushing touchdown in a game since Zack Mills from Penn State accomplished it on September 4, 2004, against Akron. Kafka finished the game with 35 completions on 42 attempts. However, despite his record-breaking performance, the Wildcats lost 37–34. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week on September 20 for his performance.|$|E

5|$|In early March 2006, Helms {{suffered}} a broken nose. After complaining to Long {{about having to}} wrestle on the March 10 episode of SmackDown!, Long told Helms {{that he did not}} have to defend his title, but put Helms in a champion versus champion match against the United States Champion, Chris Benoit. During the match, Helms attempted to leave, but was blocked by other cruiserweights <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> Helms back into the ring, resulting in Helms losing the match. Helms underwent successful surgery on his nose and was expected to miss five to six weeks. During this time SmackDown! announcers stated that Helms had a no-compete clause in his contract allowing him to waive the thirty-day title defense rule due to any injury. Helms returned to the ring on the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, teaming with MNM to face Super Crazy, London and Kendrick in a six-man tag team match. Helms continued to defend his belt during pay-per-views, but he made more regular appearances on SmackDown!s sister show, Velocity.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck at {{the start}} of the second innings, {{bringing}} his tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, fearing that it would be interpreted as retaliation and lead to a negative media and crowd reaction. However, Miller did retaliate with a series of bouncers, earning the ire of the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and order him to stop. Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes. This was aided by the Australian fielders, who twice dropped Washbrook at long leg and once in the slips cordon. Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six, but was immediately run out by Morris, <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> down the stumps from cover. Toshack removed Compton for a duck, leaving England at 125/3. Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball, as England reached 174 at the close without further loss, with Washbrook unbeaten on 85.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gorman alleges, Kelly {{was looking}} after the daughter, Alice, both {{during and after}} the raid. Gorman asserts that at first Kelly was content to hide the child, but then she, along with her friends Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman and Elizabeth Stride, decided to {{blackmail}} the government. Gorman accuses Salisbury of conspiring with his fellow freemasons, including senior policemen in the London Metropolitan Police, to stop the scandal by staging the murders of the women. Gorman says Salisbury assigned the task to Gull, who lured the four women into a carriage individually where Gull murdered them with the assistance of coachman John Netley and Sir Robert Anderson, Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard. Gorman claims a fifth victim, Catherine Eddowes, was killed accidentally in a case of mistaken identity because she used the alias Mary Ann Kelly and was confused with Mary Jane Kelly. Gorman alleges that Netley tried to kill the young Alice twice but after the second unsuccessful attempt several witnesses chased Netley, <b>who</b> <b>threw</b> himself into the Thames and drowned. Gorman completes the story by saying that Alice lived well into old age, later becoming Walter Sickert's mistress, and that Alice and Walter Sickert are his parents.|$|E
