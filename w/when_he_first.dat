5|$|According to some sources, Lincoln's first romantic {{interest}} was Ann Rutledge, {{whom he met}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> moved to New Salem; these sources indicate that by 1835, {{they were in a}} relationship but not formally engaged.

Crillon resumed active service with the Army of Germany (Reichsarmee) in 1757, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> served in a separate corps commanded by the Prince of Soubise on the frontiers of Saxony and then joined the French Grand Army. He defended the city of Weißenfels in October 1757, commanding four imperial battalions and 17 companies of French grenadiers.

5|$|Amir {{began writing}} poetry while still a teenager: though his works are undated, the {{earliest}} {{are thought to}} have been written <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> travelled to Java. Drawing influences from his own Malay culture and Islam, as well as from Christianity and Eastern literature, Amir wrote 50 poems, 18 pieces of lyrical prose, and numerous other works, including several translations. In 1932 he co-founded the literary magazine Poedjangga Baroe. After his return to Sumatra, he stopped writing.

Ryan White emphasized his differing experiences in Kokomo and Cicero {{as an example of the}} power and importance of AIDS education.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{was sworn}} into the Senate on November 7, 1962. He {{maintained}} a deferential {{attitude towards the}} older, seniority-laden Southern members <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> entered the Senate, avoiding publicity and focusing on committee work and local issues. Compared to his brothers in office, he lacked John's sophistication and Robert's intense, sometimes grating drive, but was more affable than either of them.|$|E
5|$|Selphie was {{the second}} {{character}} that Nomura drew, after Squall, intentionally giving her an impractical hairstyle. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> designed Selphie, Nomura drew her in overalls; however, he realized {{that none of the}} characters would be wearing a skirt. In the end, he gave Selphie a mini-skirt and let Quistis have pants. In the Kingdom Hearts series, Nomura included a younger version of Selphie as a resident of Destiny Islands, and uses a jump rope instead of nunchaku. She is voiced by Mayuko Aoki in the Japanese version, and by Molly Marlette in the English version.|$|E

He was Yuki's classmate in elementary school, and he eventually became her boyfriend after her transition. Unlike Yuki, Shiina had many friends in school. He generally just watches over Shuichi and Yoshino with Yuki, but he sometimes does bold and unexpected things, such as grabbing Yoshino's crotch <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> meets Yoshino because he feared that, because Yoshino was dressed as a boy at the time, Yuki might be having an illicit affair with Yoshino.|$|E
5|$|The solar block has two storeys and a cellar, {{and would}} have {{probably}} acted as the living space for Laurence of Ludlow <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> moved into the castle. The solar room itself is on the first floor, and is reached by external steps. The wood panelling and carved wooden fireplace are of 17th-century origin, probably from around 1640. This woodwork would have originally been brightly painted, and included spy-holes so that the hall could be observed from the solar.|$|E

He played three frames of snooker against former world championship runner-up Rex Williams, winning all three. The charge of bringing the game into disrepute was subsequently dropped.|$|E

Johnson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958, and {{is also a member of}} the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum and the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1995–96 season, Bure changed his jersey number from 10 to 96.

He had {{originally}} asked to wear the number <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> joined the Canucks, but was not permitted to do so by head coach Pat Quinn, who did not approve of high jersey numbers. After the Canucks traded with the Buffalo Sabres for Alexander Mogilny, reuniting the two Russian players, the jersey number was deemed acceptable because Mogilny had used number 89 since defecting to North America in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>first</b> {{met him in}} {{the late}} 1870s, but grew more {{tolerant}} of him with time, and even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control of the Cuban Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada's leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada sympathized {{with the idea of}} having the United States intervene in the Cuban independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E
5|$|Burchard held a prebend in {{the cathedral}} chapter of York, {{although}} the exact prebend that he held is unknown.

Burchard also held a number of churches, including those at Heighington Alne, and Aycliffe. Hugh {{is thought to have}} wanted the archbishopric of York for Burchard, most notably in 1189.|$|E
