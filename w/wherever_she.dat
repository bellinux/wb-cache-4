5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter. She {{obtained}} an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing her first novel while living on state benefits. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, <b>wherever</b> <b>she</b> could get Jessica to fall asleep. In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was that taking her baby {{out for a walk}} {{was the best way to}} make her fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice was the shyest {{of all of}} Queen Victoria's children. However, {{because she}} {{accompanied}} Queen Victoria almost <b>wherever</b> <b>she</b> went, she became among the best known. Despite her shyness, she was an able actress and dancer {{as well as a}} keen artist and photographer. She was devoted to her children and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and had a sense of humour, and as a public figure she was driven by a strong sense of duty. She was Patron of the Isle of Wight Branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1920 until her death. Music, a passion that was shared by her mother and the Prince Consort, was something in which Beatrice excelled, and she played the piano to professional standards. Like her mother, she was a devout Christian, fascinated by theology until her death. With her calm temperament and personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.|$|E

60|$|I was {{absolutely}} tongue-tied. <b>Wherever</b> else <b>she</b> failed, she {{was certainly a}} superb actress. A moment ago, she had been keeping my earnestness at bay with bantering words; then, {{at the sound of}} Lady Dennisford's approach, had come those few dramatic words; and now, at her entrance, I felt at once that I was the casual guest, being entertained as a matter of duty during my hostess' absence.|$|R
25|$|Patti's {{career was}} one of success after success.

The reception was very positive, earning three curtain calls. In 1882, the Kaiser awarded her the title of Hofkammersängerin.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} her {{performances}} in Kyoto that she also became {{known for her}} performances of nembutsu odori (or nembutsu dance) {{in honor of the}} Amida Buddha. Though this dance traces its origins to Kūya, a tenth-century evangelist of Pure Land Buddhism, by Okuni's time it had become a largely secular folk dance, and her particular adaptation tended to be known for its sultriness and sexual innuendo. Other popular themes for Okuni's acts included humorous skits about lover's trysts at various public establishments and meetings between men and prostitutes. Between these and other dances and acts, she garnered much attention and began to draw large crowds <b>wherever</b> <b>she</b> performed. Eventually she was summoned to return to the shrine, a call she ignored, though she continued to send money back.|$|E
25|$|Anderson {{attended}} Stanton Grammar School, {{graduating in}} the summer of 1912. Her family, however, could not afford to send her to high school, nor could they pay for any music lessons. Still, Anderson continued to perform <b>wherever</b> <b>she</b> could and learn from anyone who was willing to teach her. Throughout her teenage years, she remained active in her church's musical activities, now heavily involved in the adult choir. She joined the Baptists' Young People's Union and the Camp Fire Girls which provided her with some limited musical opportunities. Eventually the directors of the People's Chorus and the pastor of her church, Reverend Wesley Parks, along with other leaders of the black community, raised the money she needed to get singing lessons with Mary Saunders Patterson and to attend South Philadelphia High School, from which she graduated in 1921.|$|E

In this period of hardship, the Church Union’s Sustentation Fund supported Fr. Enraght and his family.|$|R
60|$|Now I did {{not care}} to depart from Cho-Sen except with the Lady Om. When I {{broached}} the possibility of it she told me, warm in my arms, that I was her king and that <b>wherever</b> I led <b>she</b> would follow. As you shall see it was truth, full truth, that she uttered.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{is about}} the {{phenomenon}} of groupies, and takes a dismissive attitude toward them ("Think I'll let her keep on going, <b>wherever</b> it is <b>she's</b> going to / Give her an autograph and tell her 'It's been nice knowing you'"... "It won't take much time / Before I get her off my mind").|$|R
25|$|After this, Napoleon gave Spain to {{his brother}} Joseph Bonaparte and forced the Royal family into exile in Fontainebleau. Maria Luisa {{requested}} a separate residence and moved with her children to a house in Passy, but was soon moved to Compiegne on June 18. She was plagued by frequent sickness and shortage of money and, not owning any horses, was forced to walk <b>wherever</b> <b>she</b> needed to go. When at last Napoleon sent 12,000 francs as the promised compensation, the expenses of her trip to France were discounted. She wrote a letter of protest, saying that prisoners were never made {{to pay for their}} removal, but she was advised not to send it out. She was promised to retire to the Palace of Colorno in Parma with a substantial allowance, but once in Lyon, under the pretext of conducting her to her destination, she was escorted to Nice, where she was kept under strict vigilance.|$|E
25|$|Others mate in December with a {{gestation}} period {{of four to}} five months, and give birth in April or May. Mothers {{give birth to a}} single pup in a litter. Mothers take care of the young after birth; the males take no part in raising it. The pup clings to its mother's abdomen during flight and when perched. The young will remain with the mother, clinging to her chest <b>wherever</b> <b>she</b> goes, until it is able to fly. The mother nurses the young during this time. The young drink their mother's milk until they are weaned onto their adult diet of insects. The time spent with the mother allows the young to observe hunting behavior as well as learn other skills necessary for survival as an adult. Once the young bat is able to fly, it can forage for itself. It may stay with the mother's colony or find another when it is grown.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after their}} marriage, Laura Cornelius Kellogg’s {{loyalty to the}} Oneida tribe came into question. An {{anonymous}} member of the Oneida tribe described Laura Cornelius Kellogg as a “ready borrower” with the “habit of making little touches <b>wherever</b> <b>she</b> finds any of her people” to a local newspaper called the Tulsa Daily World. This accusation came {{from the fact that}} Mrs. Kellogg had a history of using other people’s money to fund her projects. Kellogg’s projects were often thought to be very risky what others called “self-serving” Due to this claim, both of the Kelloggs were arrested with the charges of “Pretense of Indian Agents with intent to invest Indian funds”. The charges against Laura Cornelius Kellogg and her husband were eventually dropped; however, because of her actions, Kellogg was removed from the Society of American Indians (SAI). Reportedly, Kellogg thought her removal was “an injustice and humiliation”. Deeply hurt, Kellogg never forgave the SAI.|$|E
