They contended that O'Neal was worth more than $20million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.|$|E

The same year saw Lugosi playing a straight character role in a major motion picture: he was a stern commissar in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's comedy Ninotchka, starring Greta Garbo. This small but prestigious role {{could have been a}} turning point for the actor, but within the year, he was back on Hollywood's Poverty Row, playing leads for Sam Katzman. These horror, comedy and mystery B-films were released by Monogram Pictures. At Universal, he often received star billing for <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> supporting part.

25|$|The Wildcats {{received}} the Southeast regional bracket's eighth seed and were matched {{in the first}} round against ninth-seeded Dayton, with the game held in Dayton's home arena. Despite the disadvantage of playing in <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> road game, Villanova advanced after a closely contested contest; a go-ahead layup by Pressley gave the Wildcats a late lead that they held until the end. The Wildcats then won their second-round game, 59–55, over the region's top seed, Michigan, before a 46–43 victory in a rematch against Maryland (the fifth seed) that sent them to the regional final. North Carolina, their opponent, held a five-point lead at halftime before a strong performance in the second half led to a 12-point Villanova win and a spot in the Final Four. In their game against Memphis State, the Wildcats won by a 52–45 final score to gain their title game berth.|$|E
25|$|Green posted six Top 10's in the 2002 season, {{including}} a career best second at Loudon in July, and finished seventeenth in points. Although the team started 2003 with a Daytona 500 pole, Green {{and the team}} failed to jell as Childress had hoped and on May 5, was fired following the first race at Richmond. In <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> trade between organizations, Green {{was replaced by the}} former driver of the No. 1 car for Dale Earnhardt, Inc., Steve Park, with Green taking Park's ride at DEI. Green's firing was largely connected to an altercation between him and teammate Kevin Harvick during the Richmond race in which Harvick wrecked Green while racing for a top 10 position, igniting an already tumultuous relationship between the two drivers that went back to their competition in the Busch Series. Park would score a pole at Daytona in July and earn two Top 10s but had only six finishes inside the Top 20, ending the season 32nd in points.|$|E
25|$|The pool {{round at}} the ACHA National Tournament in Newark, Delaware was a tight-checking, nail-biting two days. An upstart Liberty team (the runners-up from 2013, but only seeded seventh in 2014) gave the Minutemen {{all the trouble}} they wanted before a Chelsea Bräm goal with 5:02 {{remaining}} squeaked out a 2–1 victory. That evening, UMass survived another close call, as Labossiere buried Adrian in overtime by a 2–1 count after the Bulldogs tied things late. After those two wins secured {{a spot in the}} semifinals - and results early {{on the second day of}} the tournament clinched first place in the pool - Robert Morris (IL) overcame two Harrington goals with five in the second period, as the Eagles picked up <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> consolation win by a 6–4 count. The contest was notable as a meeting of future Buffalo Beauts teammates Harrington and Hayley Williams (who grabbed an assist), and as a World University Games reunion of sorts - in addition to the five Minutemen and Williams, RMU's Jessica Merritt and Ramey Weaver were also on Team USA, with the latter both its captain and leading scorer.|$|E

25|$|In , Williams {{employed}} the Supertec engine, {{which was a}} rebadged Mecachrome-Renault unit, and a new driver line-up. Villeneuve moved to the new British American Racing (BAR) team and Frentzen moved to the Jordan team. German Ralf Schumacher joined Williams in <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> driver trade as Frentzen would be taking over Schumacher's old ride at Jordan. Alex Zanardi, an Italian driver who had won the last two CART series championships, also joined the team after Williams had {{spent the better part}} of the last year trying to sign him. The team managed three podiums, all scored by Ralf Schumacher, with third place in Australia and Britain and a second place in Italy. The team finished fifth in the Constructors' Championship, the lowest finish for Williams in the 1990s; the team finished behind Stewart and Jordan, scoring a total of 35 points. Of those points, all were scored by Schumacher as Zanardi, who had not performed well in his previous stint in F1, failed to finish in the top six in any race. At the end of the season, Williams bought out Zanardi's contract.|$|E
25|$|Work on {{the first}} edition started with funds from Mankind 2000, {{matching}} those of the UIA. The publisher Klaus Saur, of Munich, provided funds, in conjunction with those from the UIA, for work on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions. Seed funding for the third volume of the 4th edition was also provided on behalf of Mankind 2000. In the nineties, seed funding was provided, again on behalf of Mankind 2000, for computer equipment which subsequently allowed the UIA to develop a large website and make progressively available for free the Encyclopedia databases as from the 1994–1995 edition. In turn, this proven knowledge management capacity enabled the UIA, on the initiative of Nadia McLaren, a consultant ecologist {{who has been a}} primary editor for the Encyclopedia, to successfully instigate two multi-partner projects funded by the European Union, with matching funds from the UIA. The work done through those two projects, Ecolynx: Information Context for Biodiversity Conservation (mainly) and Interactive Health Ecology Access Links, eventually resulted in <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fifth, web-based, edition of the Encyclopedia in 2000. In their own ways, two other persons in particular effectively supported the project over the years: Robert Jungk of Mankind 2000, and Christian de Laet of the UIA.|$|E
25|$|This was {{followed}} by a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's, which fielded a virtual England Test team. Seven of the MCC's representatives went on to play in the First Test, while three others had already had Test experience, including former national captain Freddie Brown, so it was an opportunity to gain a psychological advantage in <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rehearsal for the Ashes. The first day's play was entire washed out by rain, leaving a bowler-friendly surface when the match started on the following morning. Miller bowled seven wicketless overs, conceding only ten runs, before Doug Ring took over and claimed five wickets as the MCC were dismissed for 80. Miller was then bowled by Trevor Bailey for a duck as the tourists slumped to 4/26 before recovering to take a 99-run first innings lead. In the second innings, Miller took the wickets of English Test opening batsmen, Reg Simpson and David Sheppard, trapping his victims leg before wicket and bowled respectively, to leave the hosts at 2/15 just before stumps on the second day. He later removed Fred Brown and Godfrey Evans in the middle-order, to end with 4/47, as the MCC made 196. The last two wickets came from deliberately unconventional balls, a full toss and a round arm delivery that were designed to surprise his opponents. This left Australia with a target of 98 for victory, but they had only reached 2/13 when time ran out. Miller was not required to bat.|$|E

500|$|Biographer John E.

Not only were several jurors closely tied through business arrangements to the British army, but five ultimately became Loyalist exiles." [...] While benefitting from prosecutorial mismanagement, Adams [...] "performed brilliantly." [...] Hiller B. Zobel is a scholar who has closely studied the trial, and he concluded, [...] "we can be fairly sure that before a single witness had been sworn, the outcome of the trial was certain." [...] Ferling also surmises that Adams may have been encouraged to take the case in exchange for political office; one of Boston's seats opened three months later in the Massachusetts legislature, and Adams was the town's first choice to fill the vacancy.|$|E

Scott Mendelson of Forbes, said, [...] "It was darn-clever for Disney to put out a miniature 'can't see anything without a microscope' version of the now-standard trailer for the trailer. I sighed just a little when they 'gave in' and released a human-sized version, realizing that Disney had just released <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> teaser to a teaser to a trailer... But nonetheless, credit where credit is due, Disney was able to turn a single theatrical trailer into three separate news drops in about five days." [...] Mendelson {{went on to say that}} [...] "the peppy, witty trailer above is a general audience sell. Marvel knows the geeks will come if only to throw stones, but it's the mainstream audience that needs to be sold. So far, so good." [...] However, Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the trailer for its placement during the broadcast premiere of Agent Carter, its tone, its soundtrack, and for being thematically similar to other trailers from Marvel Studios. McMillan concluded, [...] "The Ant-Man trailer isn't bad, per se; it is, however, impressively underwhelming, which almost seems worse. Thanks to the last-minute exit of original writer-director Edgar Wright and the subsequent struggle to find a replacement, Ant-Man has become the movie that people are expecting to be Marvel's first failure, in critical if not financial terms, at least; this trailer, which fails to convince and gets by on goodwill for those involved and the Marvel brand as much as anything else, doesn't do enough — or anything, really — to persuade audiences that that's not the case." [...] The trailer generated 29 million views worldwide in three days, the third-largest viewership for a Marvel Studios film, behind trailers for Iron Man 3 and Avengers: Age of Ultron.|$|E
