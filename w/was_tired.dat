After Baldwin was finished, Singer told him exactly what he expected and wanted, which impressed the actor.|$|E

He <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> of negotiating the things which related exclusively to America in London, Paris, and Madrid.|$|E

5|$|At the 3 March 1962 election, Askin led the Coalition {{to another}} defeat to the Labor Party, now under Bob Heffron, {{who had become}} Premier {{following}} Cahill's death in October 1959. Morton retained his seat again with 80.76%. Heffron was Premier until his retirement on 30 April 1964. He was succeeded by Jack Renshaw, whose tenure was {{perceived to be the}} last days of a party which, after almost {{a quarter of a century}} in government, <b>was</b> <b>tired.</b> At the May 1965 election, Askin led the Coalition to its first ever state electoral victory, gaining eight seats and a swing of 5.6% to achieve a majority of two. Askin became the first Liberal Premier. Morton was re-elected with 82.30%.|$|E
5|$|Denning {{was told}} he would be ineligible {{to serve in the}} Armed Forces because of a {{systolic}} heart murmur, which he believed the doctor diagnosed because he <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> of sending young men off to die. He successfully appealed against the decision, and enlisted on 14 August 1917 as a cadet in the Hampshire Regiment before being sent to the Royal Engineers Oxford University Officer Training Corps. He trained at Newark and was temporarily commissioned as a second lieutenant on 17 November 1917. Although he was old enough to serve in the armed forces, regulations meant that he was not allowed to serve in France until he was nineteen.|$|E
5|$|Following the European tour, Butthole Surfers {{experienced}} more upheaval when Nervosa left around Christmas 1985, as she <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> {{of the living}} conditions associated with constant touring and had {{a desire to be}} with family. She was replaced by another female drummer, Kytha Gernatt, who was dubbed Cabbage Gomez, Jr. in the press soon after joining the band. Cabbage had previously performed with Kathleen Lynch (a.k.a. Kathleen, a.k.a. Ta-Da the Shit Lady) in the band Easturn Stars; Lynch gained fame as Butthole Surfers' infamous naked dancer from 1986 to 1989. Kramer also left during this period and was replaced by Jeff Pinkus, who gave the band's bass position its longest period of stability by staying until 1994.|$|E

After completing his college career in 1981, Larson <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> of swimming and quit, only to return to competition a year later because he missed the focus.

5|$|Legend has it {{that the}} Cailleach <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> from a long day herding deer. Atop Ben Cruachan she fell asleep on her watch and a well she was tending overflowed, running down from the {{highlands}} and flooding the valleys below, forming first a river and then the loch. The overflowing well is a common motif in local Gaelic creation tales - as seen in the goddess Boann's similar creation of the River Boyne in Ireland. Other connections to the region include her above-mentioned strong ties with the fierce whirlpool in the Gulf of Corryvreckan.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came to begin You Only Live Twice, the {{producers}} were faced with the problem of a disenchanted star.

Saltzman and Broccoli were able to persuade Connery by increasing his fee for the film, but geared up to look for a replacement.|$|E

5|$|After the {{groundbreaking}} opticals of Star Wars, The Motion Pictures producers realized the film required similarly high-quality visuals. Douglas Trumbull, a film director with an excellent reputation in Hollywood {{who had worked}} on , was the first choice for director of special effects, but declined the offer. When approached, Trumbull was busy on Close Encounters, and <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> of being ignored as a director and having to churn out special effects for someone else's production; after completing the effects work, Trumbull planned on launching his own feature using a new film process. The next choice, John Dykstra, was similarly wrapped up in other projects. Post-production supervisor Paul Rabwin suggested Robert Abel's production company Robert Abel and Associates might {{be up to the}} task. The scope and size of the effects grew after the television movie became The Motion Picture. Abel and Associates bid $4million for doing the film's effects and Paramount accepted. As new effects were added, Abel increased their bid by $750,000, and Roddenberry suggested that the effects costs and schedules be reexamined.|$|E
5|$|Caliph Walid quickly re-confirmed Qutayba as governor, {{and even}} made his {{province}} independent {{from the governor}} of Iraq, but Qutayba's position was not secure: the Arab army <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> of constant campaigning and was still riven by factional rivalries, while Qutayba himself had alienated the most powerful Arab tribal groups. He was generally popular among the native Iranians, but {{the leader of the}} native auxiliaries, Hayyan an-Nabati, had secretly turned against him. Qutayba was completely unaware of the situation however, and began preparations for the campaign of 715, during which he intended to finally capture the Ferghana Valley and complete the subjugation of the Jaxartes valley. His only concern was that his old rival, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, might be restored to the Caliph's favour after al-Hajjaj's death, and he took few precautions except for removing his family and belongings from Merv to Shash and placing a guard on the Oxus.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{speculation}} {{that he would}} lead the team, as Bradman had made himself unavailable due to concerns over fitness {{and his ability to}} play at his pre-war world-leading standards, the Australian Board of Control appointed Bill Brown as captain and O'Reilly as Brown's deputy. In the Board's ballot for the leadership positions, Hassett received only one of the 13 votes, although it was enough to make him the third on-tour selector. One motive speculated for his being overlooked was that he had rested himself from the match against Victoria because he <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> of the long periods in the military away from his family and decided instead to spend the time in Melbourne with his wife and young daughter; this supposedly drew the ire of the Victorian Cricket Association.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after leaving}} TSR, Gygax was {{approached}} by a wargaming acquaintance, Forrest Baker, who had done some consulting work for TSR in 1983 and 1984. Gygax, who <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> of company management, was simply looking for some way to market more of his Gord the Rogue novels, but Baker had a vision for a new gaming company. He promised that he would handle the business end, while Gygax would handle the creative projects. Baker also guaranteed that, using Gygax's name, {{he would be able}} to bring in one to two million dollars of investment. Gygax decided this was a good opportunity, and in October 1986, New Infinities Productions, Inc. (NIPI) was publicly announced. To help him with the creative work, Gygax poached Frank Mentzer and Dragon magazine editor Kim Mohan from TSR. But before a single product was released, Forrest Baker left NIPI when his promised outside investment of one to two million dollars failed to materialize.|$|E
5|$|In the 1500m, Talbot {{decided that}} Windle would {{attack from the}} outset and attempt to hang on in the latter stages of the race. They also worked on Windle's technique, curing his habit of {{dropping}} his elbow to a lower position when he <b>was</b> <b>tired.</b> Windle broke the Olympic record in the heats {{with a time of}} 17min 15.9s to qualify fastest for the final by more than six seconds. In the final, Windle repeated the strategy of sprinting from the start, leading throughout to lower his own Olympic record to 17min 1.7s and holding off American John Nelson by 1.3s. Windle's tactics disrupted the raceplan of the Americans; Nelson and world record holder Roy Saari had planned to pace each other throughout the race, but ended up reacting to Windle instead of swimming their own race. As a result, Saari finished in seventh place, far outside his global standard.|$|E
5|$|The Demi-Virgin, {{like most}} of Hopwood's farces, was commercially successful, but had no lasting {{literary}} significance. Even as a popular entertainment, the play's appeal was limited by cultural context. Before World War I, in a time with more conservative sexual mores, the production {{would have been more}} likely to be suppressed. A decade later, the sexual attitudes conveyed in the play would be considered too unsophisticated for Broadway. As early as the end of 1921, Woods was suggesting a seven-year hiatus in the production of bedroom farces, saying the genre had become stale. In 1925, Hopwood confessed to the audience at another play that he thought The Demi-Virgin was boring and that he <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> of writing faddish entertainment. The play's script was never published and no movie adaptation was made.|$|E
