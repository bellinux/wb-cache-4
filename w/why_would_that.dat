60|$|James {{dared not}} see her. It was {{obviously}} best to have destroyed the letter. After all, {{it was probably}} {{nothing more than a}} curt, formal congratulation, and its coldness would nearly have broken his heart. He feared also lest in his never-ceasing thought he had crystallised his beloved into something quite different from reality. His imagination was very active, and its constant play upon those few recollections might easily have added many a false delight. To meet Mrs. Wallace would only bring perhaps a painful disillusion; and of that James was terrified, for without this passion which occupied his whole soul he would be now singularly alone in the world. It was a fantastic, charming figure that he had made for himself, and he could worship it without danger and without reproach. Was it not better to preserve his dream from the sullen irruption of fact? But <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> perfume come perpetually entangling itself with his memory? It gave the image new substance; and when he closed his eyes, the woman seemed so near that he could feel against his face the fragrance of her breath.|$|E

50|$|A {{supposedly}} minor character within Monkey Magic. Wowser {{had been}} the original king of Flower Fruit Mountain, {{in which he is}} overthrown later on - or more or less gave away his position to the new king, Kongo. Wowser makes another appearance within the anime when he continuously fought off against the villagers beneath Flower Fruit Mountain and against Dupac's heavenly fleet. Wowser, along with another random monkey, an older monkey, Fanya, and Wukong all head to heaven through Fujin's invitation. While at heaven, Wowser seems to enjoy heaven's fashion, in which he buys a Hawaiian shirt and sun glasses (<b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> be in heaven?). Wowser had also been regularly seen riding a heavenly horse after Kongo had become the Protector of the Stables. Thus, it seems that Wowser literally follows the others around everywhere within heaven, and shares in their joys. After the Peach Pandemonium later on, Wowser plays a central role in continuously throwing various weapons to the weaponless Kongo when he had been battling against the enraged Refang.|$|E

40|$|Genome size {{is defined}} as the DNA content in one set of {{chromosomes}} reported as the C-value in pictograms (pg). Genome size analysis can provide critical information for comparing evolutionary, species, and population relationships. Currently, animal C-values ranging from 0. 02 to 132. 83 pg are available for approximately 5000 species, but a majority of animal C-values remain unmeasured. C- value variation may reflect environmental influence, evolutionary history, ploidy level, and cell or body size. Currently C-value variation does not correlate reliably to most of these hypothesized factors. This may be due to scarce data, however, a confounding problem is that different genome size studies often report different results even for the same species! <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> be? Two sources of variation or error are probable; 1) the technique used, and 2) the dependence upon a “known” standard animal C-value to determine an unknown C-value. Currently, about a dozen animals are used as standards for genome size analysis. Unfortunately, for the common technique known as Flow Cytometry (FCM), the genome sizes of these “standards” do not correlate, meaning that C-values based on different standards are not the same. It is difficult to rely on reported data when standard values are not reproducible. The goal {{of this study is to}} identify a small set of common, reliable animals to use for genome size standard correlation using FCM. For FCM we isolate nuclei from blood or tissue in Kreb’s Ringers containing 0. 1 % Triton X- 100, stain with Propidium Iodide and then measure fluorescence on a Quanta SC-MPL system. We measured nuclei from chicken, cow, Drosophila, goldfish, horse, yellow mealworm, and zebra fish. Of these, only three matched reported C-values: Cow, 3. 908 pg, Drosophila, 0. 165 pg and Horse, 3. 322 pg. We continue work toward finding additional animal standards that cross correlate to chicken and Drosophila, thus forming a globally useful standard C-value set...|$|E

It might not always be an obvious reason, but it is invariably a good one. Occasionally in life, you get to kill two birds with one stone.

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that there is a relationship between religion and business ethics. When looking at the South African society and the statistics that says that 80 {{percent of the population is}} Christian but on the other hand we are confronted within this country with increasing incidents of corruption in private companies as well as in public services. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> be the case? This study seeks to understand if Christianity or the local church really makes an impact on the lives of its members. The research starts of by looking at behaviour in general and what constitute to good ethical decision-making. In the study on Christian ethics it becomes clear that there is a strong appeal in the Bible on ethical behaviour. The Bible goes as far as to claim that, when in a relationship with the Lord, the followers will show His character in the way they live at home and the way they behave and make ethical decisions at the workplace. This study used focus groups to research the role of the local church in changing behaviour. The study finds that Christianity per se does not change the behaviour of church members. The church members‘ definition of the church largely determines the impact the church will have on their lives. In the study on the Christian ethics it was clear that ethics were seen as something that was formed in communities and not by rules or regulations. It was not a case of people telling others what to do and what not. It was more a case of mentors that helped others to live differently in community with others. The study finds that when the local church is build on relationships and if there is a strong sense of community, the church has a huge impact on the lives of its members. This {{suggests that}} the local church should be more focused on strong and intimate relationships and not so much on the church as organisation or institute. This is also important for the businesses that will employ these members because they will make better ethical decisions...|$|E

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy of the University of BedfordshirePURPOSE – To critically investigate the effect/impact the implementation of both team and individual based pay has when responses are {{measured in terms of}} teamworking, job satisfaction, culture and commitment in 2 Nigerian financial institutions. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – The study presents the first empirical case-study research carried out in Nigeria. The data are based on 2 Nigerian financial institutions surveys from 2002 to 2006. The analysis addresses the impact of the introduction of PRP within these institutions. Questionnaires were sent out to the 226 employees. Interviews and focus groups were also carried out with both managers and employees across both organisations. FINDINGS – The findings indicate the importance of valence for monetary incentives, the instrumentality of performance for the monetary incentives and clear individual and group objectives for improving performance. On the basis of the analysis of the data from employees covered by the scheme, the results suggests that there are clear indications that it has raised motivational levels, though employees prefer working with individual performance related pay than in teams, but would not mind working in teams if it is linked to a reward, but the responses indicate that individual performance related pay has damaged the concept of team working. The results indicated a positive link of PRP having a positive effect with employees on higher grade levels; this result support other results from a number of earlier UK studies. The results also indicate that the introduction of PRP can enhance culture change and enhanced performance but may not ultimately lead to commitment from employees. The findings also indicate a positive link between PRP, improved individual and organisational performance, change in culture and job satisfaction. Though the research indicates positive outcomes from one organisation it also indicates negative outcomes from the other organisation. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> occur, as both organisations operate the same form of individual PRP? It leads the researcher to conclude that PRP must be modified {{to take into account the}} cultural (national & organisational) implications of the transference western management practices into non-western organisations. The research finishes by listing out implications for management and recommendations. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS – As this study utilises data from Nigerian financial institutions only, its results cannot be generalised to other sectors and countries characterised by different cultures and contexts. However, what is critical though is that the approach used to finding these results can be applied in a wide variety of situations, thus enabling the examination of external validity. ORIGINALITY/VALUE – This study is one of the first to explore the effect/impact of the introduction of performance related pay in Nigerian financial institutions and reflecting on the historic cultural context of gift giving and culture within organisations and the impact this has on the success or failure of PRP schemes. It also provides a new empirical evidence on the use of performance related pay. The results also show a link between the introduction of performance related pay and a change in the psychological contract from a relational contract to a transactional psychological contract, where commitment (bought) and loyalty is based on the monetary aspects of the relationship. The results supports an interpretation of incentive pay as motivated by expectancy theory and provides new evidence on the relationship between the success of performance related and its use by employees as a bargaining tool for salary increases and new job roles. Its implications should be of interest to human resource managers when designing reward strategies for their organisations...|$|E
