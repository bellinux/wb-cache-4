5000|$|By far, {{the most}} common bearing is the plain bearing, a bearing which uses {{surfaces}} in rubbing contact, often with a lubricant such as oil or graphite. A plain bearing {{may or may not}} be a [...] device. It may be nothing more than the <b>bearing</b> surface <b>of</b> a hole with a shaft passing through it, or of a planar surface that [...] another (in these cases, not a discrete device); or it may be a layer <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>metal</b> either fused to the substrate (semi-discrete) or in the form of a separable sleeve (discrete). With suitable lubrication, plain bearings often give entirely acceptable accuracy, life, and friction at minimal cost. Therefore, they are very widely used.|$|R

40|$|Creating highly {{articulated}} miniature structures requires {{assembling a}} large number of small parts. This is a very challenging task and increases cost of mechanical assemblies. Insert molding presents the possibility of creating a highly articulated structure in a single molding step. This can be accomplished by placing multiple metallic bearings in the mold and injecting plastic on top of them. In theory, this idea can generate a multi degree of freedom structures in just one processing step without requiring any post molding assembly operations. However, the polymer material has a tendency to shrink on top <b>of</b> the <b>metal</b> <b>bearings</b> and hence jam the joints. Hence, until now insert molding has not been used to create articulated structures.

So, the proper operation and maintenance of every mechanical unit in the factory have become important tasks {{from the viewpoint of}} engineers, because a single trouble of the mechanical unit will possibly cause a large damage in the operation of the mill plant. This paper deals with a systematic analysis of a mechanical accident of the mill turbines and reduction gears at one of the cane sugar mill plants in Okinawa.

He let his engine go, he crouched down, and for twenty minutes he must have steered in the continual expectation of a bullet. It never came, and when at last he glanced round, three great planes were close upon him, and his companion, thrice hit, lay dead across his bombs. His followers manifestly did not mean either to upset or shoot him, but inexorably they drove him down, down. At last he was curving and flying a hundred yards or less over the level fields of rice and maize. Ahead of him and dark against the morning sunrise was a village with a very tall and slender campanile and a line <b>of</b> cable <b>bearing</b> <b>metal</b> standards that he could not clear.

50|$|Lubrication can be {{done with}} a grease, which has {{advantages}} that grease is normally held within the bearing releasing the lubricant oil as it is compressed by the balls.

Biological removal of metals is possible by both living and non living algal biomass.

The potential metal binding groups present on the cell surface of the algal species are carboxylate, amine, imidazole, phosphate, sulfhydrl, sulphate and hydroxyl.

5000|$|Although {{there are}} many other {{apparent}} causes <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> failure, most can be reduced to these three. For example, a bearing which is run dry of lubricant fails not because it is [...] "without lubricant", but because lack of lubrication leads to fatigue and welding, and the resulting wear debris can cause abrasion. Similar events occur in false brinelling damage. In high speed applications, the oil flow also reduces the <b>bearing</b> <b>metal</b> temperature by convection. The oil becomes the heat sink for the friction losses generated by the bearing.|$|R

If hydrogenases of SRB contribute to the reduction of Au(III), hydrogenase-displaying yeasts also could reduce Au(III). Furthermore, there are five kinds <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> <b>bearing</b> chemical and physical properties similar to those of platinum [ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), osmium (Os), and iridium (Ir)]. These five metals and platinum are together called platinum group metals (PGMs), and are important because of their catalytic properties (Kettler 2003). Owing to the similarity in their properties, hydrogenase-displaying yeasts could reduce these metal ions. Therefore, the constructed hydrogenase-displaying yeasts could be available as an environmentally friendly technology for the recovery of platinum group metal ions.|$|R
