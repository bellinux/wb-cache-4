40|$|To clarify {{whether or}} not scapho-lunate ligamentous injury is common in {{scaphoid}} non-union with D. I. S. I. deformity and whether ligamentous repair is required to treat scaphoid non-union with D. I. S. I. deformity, roentgenographic, arthrographic and arthroscopic findings were analysed and compared to those of scaphoid non-union without D. I. S. I. deformity. The carpal alignment of scaphoid non-union with D. I. S. I. deformity treated by reduction and anterior <b>wedge</b> <b>grafting</b> without ligamentous repair was also studied. No {{significant difference in the}} scapho-lunate gap was present between 26 patients with D. I. S. I. deformity and 20 without. No statistically significant difference was detected in the incidence of arthrographically-proved scapho-lunate ligamentous tears between the two groups. Arthroscopic examination carried out in 22 patients did not detect massive ligamentous injury, and carpal alignment was satisfactory in most patients who underwent anterior <b>wedge</b> <b>grafting.</b> These results show that ligamentous injury rarely causes D.

The present study aimed to evaluate the success of grafting guava as a scion on accessions of cattley guava as rootstocks resistant to M. enterolobii. The treatments consisted of the rootstocks cattley guava plants (three accessions of Psidium cattleyanum) and common guava (control). In the apical <b>wedge</b> <b>grafting</b> method, scion of Paluma cultivated variety was used. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with four treatments and five replicates, and eight plants per plot.

Graft success was observed for the control (common guava) and for accessions 115 and 117 of cattley guava plants, with success rates of 63, 32 and 29 %, respectively. In the field, the cattley guava used as rootstocks hampered Paluma canopy development and caused death of plants.

40|$|Abstract Background Plant {{grafting}} {{techniques have}} deepened {{our understanding of}} the signals facilitating communication between the root and shoot, as well as between shoot and reproductive organs. Transmissible signalling molecules can include hormones, peptides, proteins and metabolites: some of which travel long distances to communicate stress, nutrient status, disease and developmental events. While hypocotyl micrografting techniques have been successfully established for Arabidopsis to explore root to shoot communications, inflorescence grafting in Arabidopsis has not been exploited to the same extent. Two different strategies (horizontal and wedge-style inflorescence grafting) have been developed to explore long distance signalling between the shoot and reproductive organs. We developed a robust wedge-cleft grafting method, with success rates greater than 87 %, by developing better tissue contact between the stems from the inflorescence scion and rootstock. We describe how to perform a successful inflorescence stem graft that allows for reproducible translocation experiments into the physiological, developmental and molecular aspects of long distance signalling events that promote reproduction. Results <b>Wedge</b> <b>grafts</b> of the Arabidopsis inflorescence stem were supported with silicone tubing and further sealed with parafilm to maintain the vascular flow of nutrients to the shoot and reproductive tissues. Nearly all (87 %) grafted plants formed a strong union between the scion and rootstock. The success of grafting was scored using an inflorescence growth assay based upon the growth of primary stem. Repeated pruning produced new cauline tissues, healthy flowers and reproductive siliques, which indicates a healthy flow of nutrients from the rootstock. Removal of the silicone tubing showed a tightly fused <b>wedge</b> <b>graft</b> junction with callus proliferation. Histological staining of sections through the graft junction demonstrated the differentiation of newly formed vascular connections, parenchyma tissue and lignin accumulation, supporting the presumed success of the graft union between two sections of the primary inflorescence stem. Conclusions We describe a simple and reliable method for grafting sections of an Arabidopsis inflorescence stem. This step-by-step protocol facilitates laboratories without grafting experience to further explore the molecular and chemical signalling which coordinates communications between the shoot and reproductive tissues. </p...|$|R

Mutants nod 49 and nod 772 are allelic to the naturally-occurring mutation rj 1 while nod 139 is non-allelic and represents a newly found gene conditioning non-nodulation in soybean. Using the standard reciprocal <b>wedge</b> <b>grafting</b> technique it was shown earlier that non-nodulation in mutant nod 49 is root controlled and supernodulation in mutant nts 382 is shoot controlled. Non-nodulation in mutants nod 772 and nod 139 (the newly found non-nodulation gene in soybean) is also root controlled. In addition, scions of nts 382 failed to alter the nodulation phenotype when grafted onto stocks of the non-nodulating lines. Lateral roots developing from the scion of nts 382 and Bragg exhibited supernodulation and the wild-type pattern of nodulation, respectively, indicating that the lesion(s) conditioning non-nodulation only affect the root in a localized manner. Physiological studies conducted on the mutants indicate that they are not altered in the assimilation of nitrogen and carbon when grown on nitrate, and a study of their nitrogen contents indicate that the anomaly in the non-nodulation mutants is clearly specific for the nodulation process.

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} was conducted {{to determine the effects}} of three different grafting periods (March 1, April 1 and May 1) and six grafting methods (tongue, splice, cleft graft-ing by hand and cleft, wedge, omega grafting by three different manual grafting tools) on graft success and plant growth in persimmon sapling production. The experiment was car-ried out in a randomized complete block design with three replications in Rize, Turkey during 2012 – 2013. The ‘Hachiya ’ persimmon (Diospyros kaki L.) were used for grafting scions. Two-year old Diospyros lotus L. seedling were used for rootstocks. In conclusion, graft take percentages varied from 21. 7 to 81. 7 % in 2012, from 10. 0 to 73. 3 % in 2013. Sprouting percentages varied from 11. 7 to 73. 3 % in 2012, from 5. 0 to 68. 3 % in 2013. These parameters, tongue and <b>wedge</b> <b>grafting</b> (with tool) performed on April 1 gave the highest results in both years. Graft shoot lengths varied from 38. 6 to 65. 7 cm in 2012, from 38. 3 to 61. 5 cm in 2013. Graft shoot diameters varied from 5. 3 to 8. 3 mm in 2012, from 5. 5 to 7. 8 mm in 2013.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz ssp. esculenta) is {{the second}} most {{important}} food crop and a main source of income for the rural communities with potential for industrial use in the coastal region of Kenya. However, its productivity of 5 to 9 t ha- 1 is low due to the low yield potential of the local cassava landraces caused by cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) among other biotic and abiotic constraints. Breeding for CBSD resistant varieties with farmer desired characteristics is hampered by limited information on the current status of the disease and farmers’ preferred characteristics of new CBSD resistant genotypes. In addition, {{there is a lack of}} an effective inoculation technique for cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) for screening genotypes for CBSD resistance. Information about the general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) for CBSD above and below ground symptoms, fresh biomass yield (FBY) and fresh storage root yield (FSRY) (kg plant- 1), harvest index (HI), dry matter % (DM %) and picrate score (PS) is limited and conflicting especially for the cassava germplasm in Kenya. These studies were carried out to update information on the status of CBSD, farmer’s preferences for cassava genotypes, and identify the most effective CBSV inoculation technique. In addition, the studies aimed to: determine the GCA and SCA for, and gene action controlling, the incidence and severity of above ground CBSD, root necrosis, FBY, FSRY, HI, DM %, and PS; and identify CBSD resistant progeny with farmers’ desired characteristics. A survey carried out in three major cassava-growing divisions in Kilifi, Kwale and Malindi Districts indicated that there was potential to increase production and productivity by increasing the area under cassava production and developing CBSD resistant genotypes that are early maturing, high yielding and sweet. In addition, CBSD was widely distributed, being present in 98. 0 % of the farms surveyed at a mean incidence of 61. 2 %. However, 99. 0 % of farmers interviewed lacked awareness and correct information about the disease. The genetic variability of cassava within the farms was low as the majority of farmers grew one or two landraces. Highly significant differences (P < 0. 01) were observed among inoculation techniques for CBSV for which the highest infection rate of up to 92. 0 % was observed in plants inoculated by <b>wedge</b> <b>grafting</b> infected scion. Highly significant differences (P < 0. 01) were observed among genotypes, between sites and their interaction for incidence of CBSD and root necrosis, while the differences among genotypes and the interaction between genotypes and the period of ratings were highly significant (P < 0. 01) for the severity of CBSD and root necrosis. Above ground CBSD symptoms were not always associated with below ground CBSD symptoms and below ground CBSD symptoms were more severe at 12 months after planting (MAP) than at 6 MAP. Therefore, selecting cassava genotypes with resistance to below ground CBSD is more important than selection based on resistance to above ground CBSD and should be done after 12 months. Genotypes 5318 / 3 (exotic) followed by Msa 140 and Plot 4 (both local) had high resistance and can be used as new sources of resistance to root necrosis. Both GCA and SCA effects were highly significant with GCA sums of squares (SS) predominant over the SCA SS for most traits evaluated except for DM % at the clonal stage. These results indicate that although additive and non-additive genetic effects are involved in the inheritance of these traits, the additive genetic effects are more important except for DM %. Therefore breeding for CBSD-resistant genotypes that have characteristics desired by farmers in the coastal region of Kenya can be achieved through recurrent selection and gene pyramiding followed by participatory selection or use of a selection index that incorporates characteristics considered important by farmers...|$|E

MÉTODOS: Trinta e um joelhos operados no período de 2006 a 2008 em uma série consecutiva de casos de cirurgia de revisão de artroplastia total de joelho foram analisados retrospectivamente. CRITÉRIOS ANALISADOS: número de cunhas ou enxertos ósseos estruturados utilizados para preenchimento dos defeitos ósseos; localização das cunhas e enxertos ósseos utilizados e espessura média do polietileno utilizada. A classificação AORI era estabelecida previamente através de radiografias pré-operatórias segundo critérios preestabelecidos. Após a análise, os joelhos foram divididos em quatro grupos (I, IIA, IIB e III). RESULTADOS: O número médio de cunhas ou enxertos ósseos utilizados em cada joelho variou de maneira crescente entre os grupos (grupo I: 1, 33; grupo IIA: 2; grupo IIB: 4, 33; grupo III: 4, 83) (P = 0, 0012).

40|$|Four non-allelic mutants with {{increased}} branching, rmsl, rms 2, rms 3 and rms 4, were utilised {{to investigate the}} control of apical dominance in the garden pea, Pisum sativum L. The role of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) was examined in detail by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), quantification of free IAA in shoot tissue of various ages, and by the application of IAA and the auxin transport inhibitor 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid. The procedure for the purification and quantification of endogenous IAA was refined to allow rapid routine analysis of this substance. <b>Wedge</b> <b>grafts</b> of young seedlings were performed to determine the site of action of the four ramosus genes and {{to determine whether or}} not a grafttransmissible substance is involved in their action. The levels of c ytokinins zeatin riboside and dihydrozeatin riboside were also quantified by GC-MS from the xylem sap of rms 2 and wild-type roots, after the development of a suitable extraction and quantification technique. Branching was inhibited in rmsl and rms 2 scions when grafted to wild-type stocks while rmsl and rms 2 stocks were not able to promote branching in wild-type scions. The most plausible explanation of these results is that the rmsl and rms 2 mutations act to promote branching by altering the level of a hormone-like substance which is produced in the rootstock and shoot. Further grafting studies indicated that the Rmsl gene acts prior to the Rms 2 gene in the biosynthetic pathway for the same substance. It is unclear whether the rmsl and rms 2 mutations act by increasing the level of a branching promoter, or by decreasing the level of a branching inhibitor, although the latter seems more likely. Similar grafting studies indicated that the rms 3 mutation acts predominantly in the shoot but also in the rootstock and appears to alter the level of a grafttransmissible substance other than that controlled by the Rmsl and Rms 2 genes. As above, the specific nature of the substance controlled by the Rms 3 gene has not been elucidated. In contrast, the rms 4 mutation does not appear to control the level of a graft-transmissible substance. IAA quantifications from mutant and wild-type shoot tissue indicated that the increased branching in each of the mutant shoots was not attributable to a reduced level of endogenous IAA in comparison with the level in wildtype plants. Mutant rms 4 plants contained normal levels of IAA in comparison with wild-type plants. Branching in rms 4 plants was not inhibited by IAA application. Furthermore, rms 4 rootstocks appeared over-responsive to the grafttransmissible substance produced by rms 2 scions since rms 4 rootstocks exhibited a promotion of lateral growth at the cotyledonary node when grafted to the rms 2 mutant scions compared with the rms 4 rootstocks grafted to rms 4 or wildtype scions. It is therefore suggested that the Rms 4 gene influences the response to factors involved in the control of branching. The rmsl, rms 2 and rms 3 plants contained an elevated lev. el of IAA in comparison with wild-type plants, prior to, during, and after bud release. This accumulation of IAA in rmsl, rms 2 and rms 3 plants was not simply due to imminent or actual lateral bud growth or release as firstly, it did not occur in comparable rms 4 plant portions, and secondly, was present in rms 2 scions in which branching was inhibited by grafting to wild-type rootstocks. Possible explanations for the accumulation of IAA in rmsl, rms 2 and rms 3 plants are discussed in view of the conventional theory that IAA acts to inhibit lateral branching. In the case of the rms 2 plants, the level of zeatin riboside and dihydrozeatin riboside in the xylem sap of the rootstock did not appear to be significantly different from that in wild-type plants. Since these cytokinins may be the most a bundant and physiologically important cytokinins in the root xylem sap it appears unlikely that the graft-transmissible substance controlled by the Rms 2 gene in the rootstock is a cytokinin. The possibility that a novel substance may be involved in the control of branching in pea is suggested. Studies on the effect of the flowering genes Sn, Dne and Ppd on branching in pea supported the proposition that these genes influence the pattern of branching along the stem...|$|R

Few supernumerary skeletal structures formed following control operations in which pelleted dissociated anterior or posterior mesoderm was grafted into homologous locations in host chick wing buds. When pelleted, dissociated anterior mesoderm was cultured in vitro for 1 or 2 days prior to being implanted in posterior locations, the incidence of supernumerary cartilage formation increased to 95. 5 % and 93. 8 %, respectively. The incidence of supernumerary cartilage formation following control orthotopic grafts of cultured mesoderm was 11. 8 % for 1 -day and 31 % for 2 -day cultured anterior mesoderm; for 1 - and 2 -day cultured posterior mesoderm, the incidence of supernumerary cartilage formation was 20 % and 41. 7 %, respectively. Longer-term culture resulted in a substantial decrease in the percentage of supernumerary cartilage after anterior to posterior grafts and an increase in the incidence of supernumerary cartilage from control grafts. The results demonstrate that quail anterior wing bud mesodermal cells do not need to maintain constant contact with one another in order to retain the ability to form or stimulate the formation of supernumerary cartilage after being grafted into a posterior location in a host wing bud.
