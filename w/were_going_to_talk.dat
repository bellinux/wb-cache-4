60|$|STRAKER. Oh, {{this is a}} love story, is it? Right you are. Go on: I {{was only}} afraid you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about yourself.|$|E
60|$|A YOUNG MAN. That is not {{the subject}} for to-day; you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the words the beggar wrote upon the walls of Babylon.|$|E
60|$|From the {{beginning}} of their conversation there had been the promise of this pause, and I pricked my ears. I knew perfectly what was bound to come; they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of my father. I was enormously strengthened in my persuasion when I found my mother's eyes resting thoughtfully upon me in the silence, and than my uncle looked at me and then my aunt. I struggled unavailingly to produce an expression of meek stupidity.|$|E
5000|$|Scene 4: Joan and Todd {{compliment}} {{each other}} on their almost completed hats. Todd claims he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> [...] "him" [...] (someone working above Todd). He claims that he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the brother-in-law and hint {{at the possibility of}} leaking information to friend of his who is a journalist. He claims that if he lost his job, he'd miss her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] Lady Caroom said, motioning Brooks {{to a seat}} by her side, [...] "that I {{feel very}} middle-class and elderly and interfering. For I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about Sybil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At Craig, if I can," [...] Lenora replied, {{moving towards}} the telephone. [...] "Please {{give me the}} phototelesme. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the Professor." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{had never}} been felt by them both in so great a degree, and never by each so {{perfectly}} to {{the knowledge of the}} other, as on a day when he came to Mr Dorrit's to take his leave before quitting Venice. Mrs Gowan was herself there for the same purpose, and he came upon the two together; {{the rest of the family}} being out. The two had not been together five minutes, and the peculiar manner seemed to convey to them, 'You <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about me. Ha! Behold me here to prevent it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Husband {{and wife}} walked {{slowly in the}} {{afternoon}} sunlight across the still beautiful garden. Each was gravely aware of an embarrassed incapacity for the task they had set themselves. They <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> things over. Never in their lives had they really talked to each other clearly and honestly about anything. Indeed it is scarcely {{too much to say}} that neither had ever talked about anything to anyone. She was too young, her mind was now growing up in her and feeling its way to conscious expression, and he had never before wanted to express himself. He did now want to express himself. For behind his rant and fury Sir Isaac had been thinking very hard indeed during the last three weeks about his life and her life and their relations; he had never thought so much about anything except his business economics. So far he had either joked at her, talked [...] "silly" [...] to her, made, as they say, [...] "remarks," [...] or vociferated. That had been the sum of their mental intercourse, as indeed it is the sum of the intercourse of most married couples. His attempt to state his case to her had so far always flared into rhetorical outbreaks. But he was discontented with these rhetorical outbreaks. His dispositions to fall into them made him rather like a nervous sepia that cannot keep its ink sac quiet while it is sitting for its portrait. In the earnestness of his attempt at self-display he vanished in his own outpourings.|$|E

[...] "And then the campaign felt they didn't want a week to go by without hearing anything from Governor Palin because they were doling out the interviews very selectively. So they decided when she was visiting some world leaders at the UN, {{that that would be}} an opportunity for her to sit down that morning and talk to me and it was very serendipitous for us, because we could—that opened the door to a lot of interesting foreign policy questions. And, also, in addition to that, the financial crisis was sort of really heating up during that week, so that was another opportunity. Then, we had scheduled an interview the following Monday, during which we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about a lot of domestic and social issues, so they gave us tremendous access." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, if you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> poetry," [...] said Jill, [...] "I'll leave you. Anyhow, I {{ought to}} be getting below and putting my things together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! If you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> that way, {{what will}} you say {{if we have to}} stay here weeks, or months, or maybe years?" [...] asked Phil.|$|R
6000|$|... "After dinner," [...] Mr. Foley remarked, as {{he lit a}} cigarette, [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> At present, Maraton {{is under}} a solemn promise to play tennis." ...|$|R
40|$|In this radio programme, <b>we?re</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about simple {{actions that}} {{small-scale}} farmers {{can take to}} control banana weevils on their farms. The programmme will specifically talk about: ? How to identify banana weevil presence in your farm, ? How to overcome banana weevils on your farm, and finally ? How to prevent banana weevils from attacking your farmBanana {{is a very important}} crop not only in Uganda, but all over the world. It is the world's fourth most widely-grown food crop after rice, wheat and maize, and the most important food staple in many other countries in Africa. In recent years, banana productivity in Uganda has been decreasing due to pests and diseases, declining soil fertility and socio-economic factors such as inadequate labour and marketing problems. Most banana workers in Africa are women, a trend which may be increasing due to migration of males in search of work. It is important that women especially listen carefully to this radio programme...|$|E
40|$|In this radio programme, <b>we?re</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about simple {{actions that}} {{small-scale}} farmers {{can take to}} control stem borers on their farms. The programmme will specifically talk about: ? How to identify stem borer presence in maize and sorghum, ? How to overcome stem borers on your farm, and finally ? How to prevent stem borers from attacking your maize and sorghumStemborers are dangerous insect pests in Uganda. They are capable of destroying {{a great deal of}} the maize and sorghum plants. Crops between 3 to 5 weeks old are at a higher risk of attack by the Stemborer caterpillar. Stemborers are notorious for killing or stunting corn rows next to fences, grassed waterways, and conservation terraces. How do stemborers get into your maize or sorghum crop? It happens when moths lay eggs on the plant. The eggs hatch in about two to five days. The freshly hatched caterpillars migrate towards the central shoot where they first feed on the tender leaves for sometime. Later on they bore into top internode and move downwards. In case of younger plants, the growing point gets badly damaged resulting into the drying up of the central shoot...|$|E

60|$|Jone <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{more about}} {{the comfort of the}} Pullman cars, but they began to shut the {{carriage}} doors, and he had to come back to me.|$|R
6000|$|... “I think so, but I am not sure. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{your father}} about it, and then I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{take another look}} around Crumville and around the offices.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{will have}} no assurances," [...] she {{interrupted}} smilingly. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of other things. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask you a ridiculous question. Are you fond of music?--seriously!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{you about}} family matters, and Picotee,' said Ethelberta. 'But, {{as you are}} busy, and I have a headache, I will put it off till to-morrow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{begin to}} talk," [...] he said. [...] "Don't {{look as though}} you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> run away, because you're not. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about that fellow Maraton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let him sip this," [...] he said. [...] "Keep {{his head}} back. That's right. We will call a truce {{for a few}} moments. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with my friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Crawley," [...] said Dr. Tempest, [...] "do let {{me speak}} {{to you as a}} friend. You have walked eight miles, and <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me on a subject which is of vital {{importance}} to yourself. I won't discuss it unless you'll take a glass of wine and a biscuit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{me about}} Africa, are you not?" [...] she {{reminded}} him. [...] "Couldn't {{we sit in}} the shade somewhere. I got quite hot walking from the station." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Miss Lalonde," [...] she said. [...] "After we {{have had}} an {{opportunity}} of witnessing your skill, Mr. Chetwode, we may trust ourselves another time. Au revoir!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{to thank}} you for coming, but I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> plainly," [...] he said. [...] "You connived at the {{meetings}} between my daughter and the rascally adventurer who has married her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may {{stay here}} and play a little while," [...] said Mary Erskine to Mary Bell. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with your mother a little; but I shall be back again pretty soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nedda's spirit gave a jump; {{he seemed}} almost at last <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{about the things}} she wanted, above all, to find out. Her cheeks went hot, she clenched her hands and said resolutely: ...|$|R
6000|$|Leland {{showed some}} little embarrassment. [...] "I did. I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{you about it}} in a day or two, because it wouldn't be quite {{convenient}} to have Mrs. Heaton out from Chicago just now." ...|$|R
60|$|As I <b>am</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, then, {{about the}} {{philosophy}} of the beautiful, or the history of art, you will ask me what I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about. The subject of my lecture to-night is what makes an artist and what does the artist make; what are the relations of the artist to his surroundings, what is the education the artist should get, and what is the quality of a good work of art.|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he said, [...] "but I {{could not}} help overhearing some {{sentences}} of your conversation with Sir Charles Somerfield as we sat at dinner. You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with him now, is it not so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom, if you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> that way, I'll {{really have}} to leave you, don't you know," [...] cried William Philander. [...] "I <b>am</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stand for it any longer. I have told you {{at least a hundred}} times----" ...|$|R
6000|$|Rowland {{presently}} joined Mrs. Light, to whom her restless protege {{had not yet}} returned. [...] "That 's right," [...] she said; [...] "sit down here; I {{have something}} serious to say <b>to</b> you. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you as a friend. I want your assistance. In fact, I demand it; it 's your duty to render it. Look at that unhappy young man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{it was not}} Fashoda that I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about. I {{want to ask you}} {{something}} about England. I know really nothing about it, for I was born in Alexandria, shortly after my parents came out from England.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it's the new {{cemetery}} I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about," [...] said Miss Inchman. [...] "It {{has been}} spoken {{of a good}} deal since you went away, and we all thought that if you'd agree to go into it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] said Madam Rachel, as she sauntered {{along the}} walk, the {{children}} around her, [...] "that {{you will not}} like the verse that I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with you about this evening, very well, when you first hear it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes,' {{came the}} rather {{dissatisfied}} reply. 'I do agree; perfectly. But then, you see--I told you I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{of nothing but}} myself--what did at first happen to me was something much worse, and, I suppose, something quite different from that.' ...|$|R
