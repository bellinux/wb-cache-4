5|$|Serevi started 2001 {{by leading}} Fiji in the 2001 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Argentina.

Serevi was omitted from the team due to form, and the desire to develop new players for the 2004 Rugby World Cup Sevens. Fiji's coach at the time, Tomasi Cama, suggested Serevi had lost some pace and age was catching up with him. Serevi's last sevens tournament for the year was the <b>World</b> <b>Games</b> in Akita, Japan. As captain, he led Fiji to the Gold medal after defeating Australia 35–19 in the final.|$|E

5|$|The Cook Islands compete {{as a part}} of netball's Oceania region. More than 1,000 {{players have}} {{registered}} to play the sport. Participation in the game grew during the 1970s. Much of this is possible because of the national governing organisation, the Cook Islands Netball Association which is a member of Oceania Netball Federation. Because of the level of organisation and the game's development, the country has participated at several international events including the Pacific Games, the Commonwealth Games, the <b>World</b> <b>Games,</b> the Oceania Netball Tournament, the World Youth Netball Championship, and the International Challenge Men’s and Mixed Netball Tournament. A demonstration of the Cook Islands success can be found by looking at the national team: It {{is one of the top}} ranked in the world.|$|E

5|$|At that time, the {{demography}} for the PlayStation shifted as more {{teenagers and}} children started {{to use the}} console to play video games. As a result, the team decided not to make another violent game like Disruptor and instead develop a family-friendly game that would be suitable for every member of a family, regardless of their age. The family game market was dominated by Sony's competitor Nintendo with games like Super Mario 64, while the PlayStation has no similar exclusives. Cerny later pushed Insomniac Games to develop a game with a mascot and mass appeal. An environment artist of Disruptor, Craig Stitt proposed that the game's theme and story should revolve around an anthropomorphic dragon. At the same time, Alex Hastings began developing an engine that specialized in games with panoramic view, which is suitable for open <b>world</b> <b>games.</b> The engine allowed more gameplay features including the ability for the dragon to glide through air. Spyro the Dragon was released in late 1998.|$|E

5|$|Up {{until the}} early 1920s, track and field had been almost {{exclusively}} a male-only pursuit. A growing women's sports movement in Europe and North America led {{to the establishment of}} the Women's <b>World</b> <b>Games</b> in 1921 and this ultimately caused the introduction of five track and field events for women in the athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics. In China, women's track and field events were being held in the 1920s, but were subject to criticism and disrespect from audiences. In 1923, physical education advocate Zhang Ruizhen called for greater equality and participation of women in Chinese track and field. The rise of Kinue Hitomi and her 1928 Olympic medal for Japan signified the growth of women's track and field in East Asia. More women's events were gradually introduced as years progressed (although it was only {{towards the end of the}} century that the men's and women's programmes approached parity of events). Marking an increasingly inclusive approach to the sport, major track and field competitions for disabled athletes were first introduced at the 1960 Summer Paralympics.|$|E
