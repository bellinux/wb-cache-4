In general, in connection with a residential mortgage there should be an established escrow or impound account for the payment of taxes, hazard insurance, and (if applicable) flood insurance, mortgage insurance, ground rents, and any other required periodic payments. Lender shall disclose to borrower at least three business days before closing the specifics of the amount required to be in the escrow account and the subsequent uses of the funds. If an escrow, impound, or trust account is not established, or the consumer chooses to close the account, the servicer shall provide a timely and clearly <b>written</b> <b>disclosure</b> to the consumer that advises the consumer of the responsibilities of the consumer and implications for the consumer {{in the absence of any}} such account. The amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (or RESPA) change how a Mortgage servicer (those who administer loans held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.) should interact with consumers.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{test the}} effects of <b>written</b> {{emotional}} <b>disclosure</b> {{on the health of}} adolescents with asthma and to examine how language in disclosures predicts outcomes. Methods We ran-domized 50 adolescents with asthma to write for 3 days at home about stressful events (disclo-sure) or control topics. At baseline and 2 months after writing, we assessed symptoms, affect, disability, internalizing behavior problems, and lung function; parents independently rated internalizing behavior and disability. Results Compared with control <b>writing,</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>writing</b> led to improved positive affect and internalizing problems. Disclosure also decreased asthma symptoms and functional disability among adolescents with baseline elevations of these difficulties. Lung function was not changed. Disclosures with more negative emotion, insight, and causal words—and increased causal or insight words over days—predicted improved health. Conclusions <b>Written</b> emotional <b>disclosure</b> improves emotional and behavioral func-tioning among adolescents with asthma, particularly those whose writings suggest emotional processing and cognitive restructuring.

Directed writing helped [...] many of the individuals who had experienced a loss of a significant relationship. It involved individuals trying to make meaning out of the loss through sense making, (making sense of what happened {{and the cause of}} the death), or through benefit finding (consideration of the global significance of the loss of one's goals, and helping the family develop a greater appreciation of life).

2500|$|Ethical {{standards}} of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), the American Medical Association (AMA) Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, and the American College of Physicians Ethics Manual require disclosure {{of the most serious}} adverse events. However, many doctors and hospitals do not report errors under the current system because of concerns about malpractice lawsuits; this prevents collection of information needed to find and correct the conditions that lead to mistakes. , 35 US states have statutes allowing doctors and health care providers to apologize and offer expressions of regret without their words being used against them in court, and 7 states have also passed laws mandating <b>written</b> <b>disclosure</b> of adverse events and bad outcomes to patients and families. In September 2005, US Senators Clinton and Obama introduced the National Medical Error Disclosure and Compensation (MEDiC) Bill, providing physicians protection from liability and a safe environment for disclosure, as part of a program to notify and compensate patients harmed by medical errors. It is now the policy of several academic medical centers, including Johns Hopkins, University of Illinois and Stanford, to promptly disclose medical errors, offering apologies and compensation. This national initiative, hoping to restore integrity to dealings with patients, make it easier to learn from mistakes and avoid angry lawsuits, was modeled after a University of Michigan Hospital System program that has reduced the number of lawsuits against the hospital by 75% and has decreased the average litigation cost. The Veterans Health Administration requires the disclosure of all adverse events to patients, even those that are not obvious. However, [...] these initiatives have only included hospitals that are self-insured and that employ their staffs, thus limiting the number of parties involved. Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the US, after heart disease and cancer, according to research by Johns Hopkins University. Their study published in May 2016 concludes that more than 250,000 people die every year due to medical mix-ups. Other countries report similar results.|$|E

40|$|Introduction:We {{conducted}} {{the present study}} aimed at reducing stress and inhibition through emotional <b>disclosure</b> with <b>written</b> structure in patients suffering from psychosomatic disorder. Material and Methods:After completing the questionnaires of perceived stress and defense mechanisms, 43 patients with psychosomatic disorder with stress scores of over 21 and repression scores of over 11. 5 were selected from patients referring to Emam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling and randomly assigned to experiment and control groups. After <b>written</b> emotional <b>disclosure,</b> data were collected and analyzed using independent t-test. Results:The findings of the study indicate that <b>written</b> emotional <b>disclosure</b> reduces perceived stress significantly in the experiment group compared to the control group (p< 0. 05). Moreover, inhibition in the experiment group diminished significantly compared to the control group following the <b>written</b> emotional <b>disclosure</b> intervention (p< 0. 05). Conclusion:Our findings indicate that although <b>written</b> emotional <b>disclosure</b> is hurtful during performance, it will nevertheless modify and reduce stress in the long run.

40|$|Prior {{research}} has shown that affective valence and arousal interact to alter pain perception. One personally relevant method of inducing affective states is the <b>written</b> emotional <b>disclosure</b> procedure. The current study examined the immediate effects of <b>written</b> emotional <b>disclosure</b> on secondary hyperalgesia, flare, and spontaneous pain in healthy undergraduate men and women. Fifty-five men and women undergraduates participated in an IRB approved experiment in which they wrote about a traumatic or neutral event fro twenty minutes. After writing, the participants underwent pain perception testing for area of secondary hyperalgesia, flare, and spontaneous pain. Results indicated that women writing about a traumatic experience rated their spontaneous pain as more intense than those writing about a neutral topic, whereas males did not. In addition, men showed greater physiological arousal and area of flare than women. These findings suggest that men and women experience different affective and pain modulatory reactions to <b>written</b> emotional <b>disclosure,</b> though the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated...|$|R

40|$|Rationale: as {{stress is}} known to {{exacerbate}} asthma symptoms, we examined whether <b>written</b> emotional <b>disclosure</b> (<b>writing</b> about traumatic experiences) could improve lung function in adults with asthma. Writing may facilitate cognitive and emotional processing of stressful events and help to reduce the physiological stress associated with inhibition of emotions. Methods: 138 adults aged between 18 and 45 with a diagnosis of asthma, requiring regular inhaled corticosteroids and able to read and understand English {{were invited to participate}} in this double blind randomised controlled trial. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either the <b>written</b> emotional <b>disclosure</b> or non-emotional <b>writing</b> instructions. Participants were asked to write for 20 minutes over 3 consecutive days. Spirometry readings and questionnaires measuring quality of life, asthma symptoms, subjective asthma control and medication use were conducted at baseline, 1 and 3 -month follow up. Results: baseline analysis showed {{no significant differences between the}} two conditions. Controlling for baseline scores, no significant findings for lung function, quality of life or asthma symptoms were found. At 3 -month follow up, participants in the intervention condition reported significantly better subjective control of their asthma (as defined by the Asthma Control Test) : OR = 3. 01, 95 %CL (1. 30, 6. 94) and reported significantly better objective control of their asthma (defined as using their ?-agonist less than once a day) : OR = 2. 96, 95 %CL (1. 38, 6. 33).

40|$|Writing about a {{personal}} stressful event {{has been found}} to have psychological and physical health benefits, especially when physiological response increases during writing. Response training was developed to amplify appropriate physiological reactivity in imagery exposure. The present study examined whether response training enhances the benefits of <b>written</b> emotional <b>disclosure.</b> Participants were assigned to either a <b>written</b> emotional <b>disclosure</b> condition (n = 113) or a neutral writing condition (n = 133). Participants in each condition wrote for 20 minutes on three occasions and received response training (n = 79), stimulus training (n = 84) or no training (n = 83). Heart rate and skin conductance were recorded throughout a 10 -minute baseline, 20 -minute writing, and a 10 -minute recovery period. Self-reported emotion was assessed in each session. One month after completing the sessions, participants completed follow-up assessments of psychological and physical health outcomes. Emotional disclosure elicited greater physiological reactivity and self-reported emotion than neutral writing. Response training amplified physiological reactivity to emotional disclosure. Greater heart rate during emotional disclosure was associated with the greatest reductions in event-related distress, depression, and physical illness symptoms at follow-up, especially among response trained participants. Results support an exposure explanation of emotional disclosure effects and are the first to demonstrate that response training facilitates emotional processing and may be a beneficial adjunct to <b>written</b> emotional <b>disclosure...</b>|$|R

40|$|Comprehensive exposure-based {{approaches}} to treating {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) are effective, but they are time intensive and not widely used because of factors such as client noncompliance and fears of iatrogenic effects. Exposure by <b>writing</b> <b>disclosure</b> (WD), modeled after Pennebaker’s brief stress-reduction procedure, may circumvent these obstacles. WD treat-ment reduces PTSD symptoms in trauma victims but has rarely been tested in diagnosed PTSD participants and never in substance use disorder (SUD) populations—despite high comorbidity rates. The authors applied a standard Pennebaker WD treatment for 45 SUD inpatients screened for full or sub-syndromal PTSD in an uncontrolled study. Results suggested potential strong cost-effectiveness: Posttreatment outcome measures showed significant symptom reductions, which remained stable at 3 -month follow-up. With con-verging evidence from future controlled studies, WD strategies may emerge as effective and easily implemented treatment options for PTSD in SUD treatment settings. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on May 12, 2016 bmo. sagepub. comDownloaded fro...|$|R
