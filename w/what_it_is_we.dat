"Marry You" [...] {{is one of}} {{the eleven}} songs {{composed}} and produced by The Smeezingtons, the collaboration of Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence, and Ari Levine, for Mars's debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans. Lawrence explained the inspiration behind the song in an interview with American Songwriter stating, [...] "e had this image of a slow-mo video in Vegas of a couple running, and she’s in her gown and he’s in his tux, the wedding party is behind them. This sort of crazy, daring, wedding feeling". Lawrence was surprised at the impact of the song after watching some YouTube videos. He stated that [...] "e always {{thought it was a good}} song and catchy, but we didn’t think it would affect pop culture the way that it has. The first time we saw one of those YouTube videos...we were almost in tears... the power of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> can create. These ideas, words, and lyrics and how they can get into the fabric of society and affect people’s lives in such an amazing way." [...] In an interview with Idolator Bruno Mars said that the song had its beginning by [...] "just playing the chords," [...] and then freestyling the lyrics [...] "I think I wanna marry you!". He continued, [...] "you’re in Vegas...had way too many drinks, and you love everybody, and you want to do something that you probably shouldn’t do and you’ll regret in the morning." ...|$|E
500|$|By October 2013, Marvel was {{preparing}} four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, {{to present to}} video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest. In November 2013, {{it was announced that}} Disney would provide Netflix with live-action series based on Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders. Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Netflix was chosen to air the shows, [...] "when Disney realized it could use the streaming service as a way to grow the popularity of the characters". He added that, if the characters prove popular, they could become feature films. Loeb later stated that Marvel was not [...] "interested in making four pilots and then hoping someday that they could all get together. Netflix really understood <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do. They're very open to directors that might not have that same opportunity in broadcast television. The notion of having all 13 episodes at one time, particularly in serialized storytelling, is very appealing." [...] Loeb also added that the four characters chosen [...] "all had a previous existing relationship and all grew up on the same kind of stoop in New York [...] So it lent itself to a world. Does that mean these shows {{are going to be the}} same? No. They can't be. The characters have different issues, different problems, different feelings about them ... the example that I continually give is that I cannot think of two films that are more different in tone than [...] and Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, if you watch them back to back, they feel very Marvel. They feel very much like, 'Oh, it is still the same universe that I'm in.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|We do not, however, {{hold the}} Bible—or any other account of human experience—to be either an infallible guide or the {{exclusive}} source of truth. Much biblical material is mythical or legendary. Not {{that it should}} be discarded for that reason! Rather, it should be treasured for <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>We</b> believe that we should read the Bible as we read other books—with imagination and a critical eye. We also respect the sacred literature of other religions. Contemporary works of science, art, and social commentary are valued as well. We hold, in the words of an old liberal formulation, that [...] "revelation is not sealed." [...] Unitarian Universalists aspire to truth as wide as the world—we look to find truth anywhere, universally.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his papers}} of 1935, Istrati {{presents}} himself exclusively {{as an enemy}} of [...] "the Jewish bourgeoisie", a class he describes as [...] "corrupt, pseudo-humanitarian, pseudo-democratic" [...] and accuses of stirring up scandal. Istrati's articles in Cruciada Românismului are more adamantly philosemitic. One of them, [...] "A Letter to Love", led {{to a series of}} articles on the subject, from Stelescu and other Crusade people. In his own articles, Talex answered for the Stelist movement: [...] "Panait Istrati, do you know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> need? A fist... The Crusade of Romanianism will attempt to become that fist... Our antisemitism? Just the same as yours: a humane one. But it is also combative, {{for as long as the}} Judaic element shall attempt to set up a state within our own state, sabotaging us with any opportunity it gets". Stelescu's newspaper was noted for its obstinate claim that Jews were a rootless, disloyal race.|$|E
2500|$|The Party's Ard Fheis in 2009 {{unanimously}} {{passed a}} motion to organise in Northern Ireland by establishing forums, rather than cumainn, {{in each of the}} North's six counties. In December 2009, Fianna Fáil secured its first Northern Assembly MLA when Gerry McHugh, an independent MLA, announced he had joined the party. Mr. McHugh confirmed that although he had joined the party, he would continue to sit as an independent MLA. In June 2010, Fianna Fáil opened its first official office in the North in Crossmaglen, County Armagh. The then Taoiseach Brian Cowen officially opened the office, accompanied by Ministers Éamon Ó Cuív and Dermot Ahern and Deputies Rory O’Hanlon and Margaret Conlon. Discussing the party's slow development towards all-Ireland politics, Mr. Cowen observed: [...] "We have a very open and pragmatic approach. [...] We are a constitutional republican party and we make no secret of the aspirations on which this party was founded. [...] It has always been very clear in our mind <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> are seeking to achieve, that is to reconcile this country and not being prisoners of our past history. [...] To be part of a generation that will build a new Ireland, an Ireland of which we can all be proud".|$|E

60|$|His {{approach}} was announced {{by one of}} the scouts, upon which someone suggested that we should let him enter, and then put him in the stocks. But Long Ghost proposed better sport. <b>What</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>we</b> shall presently see.|$|R

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{hard work}} for the boys to keep their minds on their lessons. Dick, especially, was very serious, and for a good reason.

6000|$|A {{few days}} afterwards, Sir Richard, {{on his way}} from Bideford to Stow, looked in at Clovelly Court, and mentioned, with a [...] "by the by," [...] news which made Will Cary leap from his seat almost to the ceiling. <b>What</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>we</b> know already.|$|R
60|$|After these orgies I {{would get}} home very tired and excited, {{and find it}} {{difficult}} to get to sleep. I would lie and speculate about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>we</b> WERE going to do. One hadn't anticipated quite such a tremendous accession to power for one's party. Liberalism was swirling in like a flood....|$|R
60|$|When {{the supreme}} {{authority}} of the people is in question, before we attempt to extend or to confine it, we ought to fix in our minds, {{with some degree of}} distinctness, an idea of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> mean when we say the PEOPLE.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall never}} be able to leave this city. There are no trains out of Munich at all. It's a plot to keep us here, that's <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>We</b> shall {{never be able}} to get away. We shall never see dear old England again!" ...|$|E
60|$|The plot which Charles sent to Shirley as a fit {{subject for}} his muse {{is taken from}} one of those {{collections}} of Italian novels of which we have already had occasion to speak, and occurs {{in the second part of}} the 'Ducento Novelle' of Celio Malespini; and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> shall see forthwith.|$|E
5000|$|With {{some fans}} {{reportedly}} detecting [...] "something romantic" [...] between the characters early on, Evans {{stated that he}} and Claywell were initially unsure of their characters' mutual history, saying, [...] "All <b>we</b> knew <b>was</b> that something had happened, but we weren't necessarily sure <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>We</b> had our different ideas. It's funny to see people say, 'I knew it! I knew it!.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Numabo. [...] "In a {{great thing}} which resembled a bird he flew {{down out of the}} sky. The thing is still there where it came down close to the four trees near the second bend in the river. We left it there because, not knowing <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> afraid to touch <b>it</b> and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> still there if it has not flown away again." ...|$|R
40|$|You {{have to ask}} yourself, {{why would}} you start a {{technical}} session dealing with communications. You know <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all here to learn various aspects of our trade. Why start {{it out with a}} session on communications? Well, let me give you the answer to that one. The success of every enterprise depends on public goodwill. When I first read that I thought, yes, in a free society the success of every enterprise depends on public goodwill. But then the Berlin wall came down, communism collapsed and you realize that even tyranny cannot withstand the pressure of public goodwill. So, it becomes tremendously important to us all that the public understands <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that <b>we</b> do, the value of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that <b>we</b> do, and the rightness of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that <b>we</b> do...|$|R
60|$|I ground myself {{therefore}} on this principle--that if {{the abuse}} is proved, {{the contract is}} broken, and we re-enter into all our rights; that is, into the exercise of all our duties. Our own authority is indeed as much a trust originally, as the company's authority is a trust derivatively; {{and it is the}} use we make of the resumed power that must justify or condemn us in the resumption of it. When we have perfected the plan laid before us by the right honourable mover, the world will then see <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> destroy, and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> create. By that test we stand or fall; and by that test I trust that it will be found in the issue, {{that we are going to}} supersede a charter abused to the full extent of all the powers which it could abuse, and exercised in the plenitude of despotism, tyranny, and corruption; and that in one and the same plan, we provide a real chartered security for the RIGHTS OF MEN, cruelly violated under that charter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not wonder, Mr. Lancaster," [...] she said, [...] "that you did {{not want}} to come back and tell me your doleful story, but as I know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> need not say {{anything}} about it now, except that I am ever so much obliged to you for all your kindness to me. And now I am going to ask another favor. Won't you let me speak to Mrs. Easterfield a few moments?" ...|$|E
60|$|Believing it, therefore, a {{question}} at least arduous in the theory, {{and in the}} practice very critical, it would become us to ascertain {{as well as we}} can what form it is that our incantations are about to call up from darkness and the sleep of ages. When the supreme authority of the people is in question, before we attempt to extend or to confine it, we ought to fix in our minds, with some degree of distinctness, an idea of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> mean, when we say, the PEOPLE.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the Major Signs, a Companion of the Prophet narrated: [...] "Once <b>we</b> <b>were</b> sitting {{together}} and talking amongst ourselves when the Prophet appeared. He asked us <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> discussing. <b>We</b> said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the Day of Judgment. He said: 'It {{will not be}} called until ten signs have appeared: Smoke, Dajjal (the Antichrist), the creature (that will wound the people), the rising of the sun in the West, the Second Coming of Jesus, the emergence of Gog and Magog, and three sinkings (or cavings in of the earth): one in the East, another in the West and a third in the Arabian Peninsula.'"

6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to give you a surprise, gentlemen," [...] De la Noue said, with a smile. [...] "I will tell you <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> once outside the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It wasn't fancy, Kate, my dear, I'm {{certain of}} that,' {{returned}} her mother. 'However, it's gone now at any rate, so it don't much matter whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> or not. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> talking about? Oh! Mr Frank. I never saw such attention in MY life, never.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come!" [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "let us {{stop talking about}} this thing, and {{thinking}} about it. We shall all be maniacs if we don't quiet ourselves a little, and, besides, it cannot be long before those black fellows come back, {{and we do not}} want to be speaking about it then. To-morrow we will examine the mound and see <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> have discovered. In the meantime, let us quiet our minds and get a good night's sleep, if we can. This whole affair is astounding, but we must not let it make us crazy before we understand it." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{thus have}} I done with this, and shall come {{next to the}} reasons of the point, namely, to show you, why or how it comes to pass, that a broken heart, a heart truly contrite, is to God such an {{excellent}} thing. That to him it is so, we have proved by six demonstrations; <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> have showed by the six signs thereof; that it must be, is manifest by those nine reasons but now urged; and why it is with God or in his esteem an excellent thing, that is shown by that which follows.|$|E
60|$|It is {{precisely}} before this phenomenon {{of life in}} literature and language that criticism is forced to stop short. That it is there we know, but <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> cannot precisely tell. It flits before us like the bird in the old story. When we think to grasp it, we already hear it singing just beyond us. It is the imagination which enables the poet to give away his own consciousness in dramatic poetry to his characters, in narrative to his language, so that they react upon us with the same original force {{as if they had}} life in themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Clothes-Line {{illustrated}} {{the development of}} fashion history through live models in original costumes from C. Willett Cunnington's collection. Laver provided verse commentary on the garments, while Binder drew lightning sketches and illustrations at an easel. After the first episode was broadcast, The Listener commented: [...] "we were left wondering quite <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>we</b> had just seen and heard — a poetry-reading, a lightning-artist display, a mannequin parade, or what?" [...] As {{they went on to}} acknowledge, Clothes-Line in fact used features of all three to create a new type of television programme.|$|R
