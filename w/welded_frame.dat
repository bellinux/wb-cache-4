2500|$|A more {{economical}} method of bicycle frame construction uses cylindrical steel tubing connected by TIG welding, {{which does not}} require lugs to hold the tubes together. [...] Instead, frame tubes are precisely aligned into a jig and fixed in place until the welding is complete. [...] Fillet brazing is another method of joining frame tubes without lugs. It is more labor-intensive, and consequently {{is less likely to}} be used for production frames. As with TIG welding, Fillet frame tubes are precisely notched or mitered and then a fillet of brass is brazed onto the joint, similar to the lugged construction process.

40|$|Abstract. The {{buckling}} {{resistance of}} orthogonally stiffened cylinders is investigated for elastic critical buckling and non-linear elasto-plastic buckling tests. The effects of residual stresses arising from cold forming the cylinder and <b>welding</b> <b>frame</b> components are {{considered in the}} analysis of two stiffened cylinder models with similar material weights and different geometric spacings. A static axial load is applied to the models to represent loading from the supported structure followed by a non-linear elasto-plastic buckling step representing a wave loading combined with hydrostatic pressure, producing large displacement compartment buckling. Residual stress is shown to cause a reduction in buckling resistance of approximately 25 % in the stiffened cylinder segments. 1...|$|R
40|$|Articulated haulers are {{fundamental}} equipment to transport material. The load carrying structure on a hauler consists mainly of <b>welded</b> <b>frames.</b> During <b>welding</b> of the <b>frames</b> high residual stress will be introduced. These stresses {{may have a}} significant impact on the fatigue life of the frames. This is the reason for having good knowledge of the weld residual stresses. The finite element method was used to calculate the residual stress distributions in a butt weld and a T-join weld. Simulation of the welding process with thermal and mechanical analysis was prepared by means of welding GUI implemented in LS-PrePost. The welding simulation is a computer intensive operation with high CPU time. That is why it is important to investigate which process factors that have the largest impact on welding simulation results. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the correlation between designed models in FEA software with published results of weld residual stress measurements and conclude which parameters should be mainly taken into consideration...|$|R

50|$|Among {{the first}} of Ritchey’s designs {{to be brought to}} use was his “Logic” steel frame tubing. With the new era of fillet brazing he pioneered, and the new {{uprising}} of TIG <b>welded</b> <b>frame</b> production, Ritchey knew that condensed, force-direction butted tubing would produce steel frames that would be lighter and stronger than common butted tubes previously manufactured. Initially Ritchey tasked Italian tubing giant Columbus to produce this new style of butted tubing, however their inability to produce tubes to Ritchey’s specifications drove Ritchey to a Japanese company named Tange. Their success lead to the birth of Logic Tubing. This tubing changed the way tubing manufacturers thought about butting profiles, ushering in a new era of lighter, more lively, yet extremely durable larger diameter steel tubing bikes. He later took his same shortened butt concept to spoke manufacturer DT Swiss to produce spokes to build lighter, stronger wheels.|$|E
50|$|Development {{of these}} trucks began around 1984 and were {{introduced}} in April 1987 as 1988 models (known as the GMT400 platform, and their nickname: OBS (Old Body Style) Chevy or GMC). There were eight {{different versions of the}} C/K line for 1988. Fleetside Single Cab, and Fleetside Extended Cab, were the first chevy trucks to be available with this type of cab version, and the 1973 to 1987 C10s and C20s where only available with a single cab. Fleetside Crew Cab, and Stepside Single Cab models, each in either 2WD (C) or 4WD (K) drive-lines were also available. All C/K models would ride on independent front suspension. Three trim levels were available: Cheyenne, Scottsdale, and Silverado. Engines were a 160 hp (119 kW) 4.3 L V6, a 175 hp (130 kW) 5.0 L V8, a 210 hp (157 kW) 5.7 L V8 and a 6.2 L diesel V8. A 230 hp (172 kW) 7.4 L V8 was available in the 3/4-ton and one-ton trucks. Most of the powertrain were a carryover from the 1987 R/V with fuel injection. To enhance durability the trucks featured extensive use of galvanized steel for corrosion resistance and a fully <b>welded</b> <b>frame</b> with a boxed front section for strength and rigidity. During the development of the GMT400 platform GM designers based their prototypes on the compact GMT325 S-series (S10 and S15/Sonoma) - upon the official release the GMT400 were the first GM vehicles to use an electronic speedometer, and a serpentine accessory drive. Some consider the GMT400 as a scaled up version of the S10/Sonoma with rounded off contours - later incorporated into the second generation S-series.|$|E
