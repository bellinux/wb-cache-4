40|$|This paper {{exhibits}} the intertwinement {{between the}} prime {{numbers and the}} zeros of the Riemann zeta function, drawing upon existing literature by Davenport, Ahlfors, et al. We begin with the meromorphic continuation of the Riemann zeta function and the gamma function . We then derive a functional equation that relates these functions and formulate the Riemann hypothesis. We {{move on to the}} topic of nite-ordered functions and their Hadamard products. We show that the xi function  is of finite order, whence <b>we</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>many</b> <b>useful</b> properties. <b>We</b> then use these properties to and a zero-free region for in the critical strip. We also determine the vertical distribution of the non-trivial zeros. We finally use Perron's formula to derive von Mangoldt's explicit formula, which is an approximation of the Chebyshevfunction . Using this approximation, we prove the prime number theorem and conclude with an implication ofthe Riemann hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|If {{an outer}} (multilinear) {{commutator}} identity holds {{in a large}} subgroup of a group, then it holds also in a large characteristic subgroup. Similar assertions are valid for algebras and their ideals or subspaces. Varying {{the meaning of the}} word 'large', <b>we</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>many</b> interesting and <b>useful</b> facts. An example is produced showing that these results cannot be extended to arbitrary (non-multilinear) identities. As an application, a sharp estimate is given for the 'virtual derived length' of a (virtually solvable) -by-(virtually solvable) group. Â© 2009 London Mathematical Society...|$|R
