40|$|The {{estimation}} of accumulated radiation doses in people professionally exposed to ionizing radiation was performed using methods of biological (chromosomal aberrations frequency in lymphocytes) and physical (radionuclides analysis in urine, <b>whole-body</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>meter,</b> individual thermoluminescent dosimeters) dosimetry. A group of 84 "A" category employees after {{their work in}} the territory of former Semipalatinsk test site (Kazakhstan) was investigated. The dose rate in some funnels exceeds 40 μSv/h. After radionuclides determination in urine using radiochemical and WBC methods, it was shown that the total effective dose of personnel internal exposure did not exceed 0. 2 mSv/year, while an acceptable dose limit for staff is 20 mSv/year. The range of external radiation doses measured with individual thermo-luminescent dosimeters was 0. 3 - 1. 406 µSv. The cytogenetic examination showed that chromosomal aberrations frequency in staff was 4. 27 ± 0. 22 %, which is significantly higher than at the people from non-polluting settlement Tausugur (0. 87 ± 0. 1 %) (р ≤ 0. 01) and citizens of Almaty (1. 6 ± 0. 12 %) (р≤ 0. 01). Chromosomal type aberrations accounted for 2. 32 ± 0. 16 %, 0. 27 ± 0. 06 % of which were dicentrics and centric rings. The cytogenetic analysis of different types group radiosensitivity among «professionals» (age, sex, ethnic group, epidemiological data) revealed {{no significant differences between}} the compared values. Using various techniques by frequency of dicentrics and centric rings, the average cumulative radiation dose for group was calculated, and that was 0. 084 - 0. 143 Gy. To perform comparative individual dosimetry using physical and biological methods of dose assessment, calibration curves (including own ones) and regression equations based on general frequency of chromosomal aberrations obtained after irradiation of blood samples by gamma-radiation with the dose rate of 0, 1 Gy/min were used. Herewith, on the assumption of individual variation of chromosomal aberrations frequency (1 – 10 %), the accumulated dose of radiation varied 0 - 0. 3 Gy. The main problem in the interpretation of individual dosimetry results is reduced to different reaction of the objects to irradiation - radiosensitivity, which dictates the need of quantitative definition of this individual reaction and its consideration in the calculation of the received radiation dose. The entire examined contingent was assigned to a group based on the received dose and detected cytogenetic aberrations. Radiosensitive individuals, at the lowest received dose in a year, showed the highest frequency of chromosomal aberrations (5. 72 %). In opposite, radioresistant individuals showed the lowest frequency of chromosomal aberrations (2. 8 %). The cohort correlation according to the criterion of radio-sensitivity in our research was distributed as follows: radio-sensitive (26. 2 %) — medium radio-sensitivity (57. 1 %), radioresistant (16. 7 %). Herewith, the dispersion for radioresistant individuals is 2. 3; for the group with medium radio-sensitivity — 3. 3; and for radio-sensitive group — 9. These data indicate the highest variation of characteristic (reactions to radiation effect) in the group of radio-sensitive individuals. People with medium radio-sensitivity show significant long-term correlation (0. 66; n= 48, β ≥ 0. 999) between the values of doses defined according to the results of cytogenetic analysis and dose of external radiation obtained with the help of thermoluminescent dosimeters. Mathematical models based on the type of violation of the radiation dose according to the professionals radiosensitivity level were offered...|$|E

40|$|Radiation {{emissions}} within territories that accommodate {{nuclear power}} facilities are monitored by stationary gamma radiation measuring systems. Any facilities that may contemplate the hazard of radioactive emissions {{must meet the}} safety requirements {{both in terms of}} normal conditions of their operation and in case of accidents. Thus, radioactive materials now in use must comply with strict rules. The account for and control of radioactive materials, their proper application, compliance with the rules and security measures minimize their impact on the environment. However, the loss of professional control over the above materials (various emergencies, losses in the course of transportation, plunders) may involve serious consequences. One of the most effective ways of reconnaissance of territories exposed to radioactive contamination to assure the search for the sources of radionuclides represents remote measurement of surface gamma radiation performed by <b>radiation</b> <b>meters</b> installed on unmanned airborne vehicles (UMAV).

40|$|Acute {{radiation}} injury leads to thymic involution, adrenal enlargement, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal ulceration, and impaired wound healing. The authors hypothesized that supplemental vitamin A would mitigate these adverse effects in rats exposed to acute <b>whole-body</b> <b>radiation.</b> This hypothesis {{was based on}} previous experiments in their laboratory that showed that supplemental vitamin A is thymotropic for normal rodents and lessens the thymic involution, lymphopenia, and adrenal enlargement that follows stress, trauma, and neoplasia, largely obviates the impaired wound healing induced by the radiomimetic drugs streptozotocin and cyclophosphamide, lessens the systemic response (thymic involution, adrenal enlargement, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia) to local radiation, and shifts the median lethal dose (LD 50 / 30) following <b>whole-body</b> <b>radiation</b> to the right. To test their hypothesis, dorsal skin incisions and subcutaneous implantation of polyvinyl alcohol sponges were performed in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats at varying times following sham radiation or varying doses of <b>whole-body</b> <b>radiation</b> (175 - 850 rad). In each experiment, the control diet [which contains about 18, 000 IU vit. A/kg chow (3 X the NRC RDA for normal rats) ] was supplemented with 150, 000 IU vit. A/kg diet beginning at, before, or after sham radiation and wounding or radiation and wounding. The supplemental vitamin A prevented the impaired wound healing and lessened the weight loss, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, thymic involution, adrenal enlargement, decrease in splenic weight, and gastric ulceration of the radiated (750 - 850 rad) wounded rats. This was true whether the supplemental vitamin A was begun before (2 or 4 days) or after (1 - 2 hours to 4 days) radiation and wounding; the supplemental vitamin A was more effective when started before or up to 2 days after radiation and wounding. The authors believe that prevention of the impaired wound healing following radiation by supplemental vitamin A is due to its enhancing the early inflammatory reaction to wounding, including {{increasing the number of}} monocytes and macrophages at the wound site; possible effect on modulating collagenase activity; effect on epithelial cell (and possible mesenchymal cell) differentiation; stimulation of immune responsiveness; and lessening of the adverse effects of radiation...|$|R

The patients were allocated randomly to receive a single infusion of unlabeled rituximab 250 mg/m(2) on day - 7 and consolidation on day 0 with a single dose of (90) Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, 14. 8 MBq/kg, immediately after unlabeled rituximab, 250 mg/m(2), or no further treatment. On day - 7, a subset of patients received an injection of 185 MBq of (111) In-ibritumomab tiuxetan immediately after unlabeled rituximab, 250 mg/m(2), for central dosimetry analysis. Correlations were assessed between organ radiation absorbed dose and toxicity, body weight, body mass index, and progression-free survival. RESULTS: Central dosimetry evaluations were available from 57 of 70 patients. Median radiation absorbed doses were 100 cGy (range, 28 - 327 cGy) for the red marrow and 72 cGy (range, 46 - 106 cGy) for the whole body. Radiation absorbed doses did not differ significantly between patients who had a partial response or complete response to initial therapy.
