25|$|The {{formaldehyde}} {{surrounding the}} shark, Hirst says, {{is the process}} of death and decay. Though formaldehyde is used as a preservation means, over time, the object being preserved will soon wilt, flake, and wrinkle. Because the sculpture itself was made in 1991, the shark is very much rotting and deformed due to the formaldehyde taking its toll on the corpse. With the corpse rotting away, it symbolizes that no matter how well we take care of ourselves or how timeless <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> our mind will start to fade away and we slowly will begin to forget.|$|E
500|$|By December 1972, having {{recorded}} Machine Head, Made in Japan and the yet to {{be released}} Who Do <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> with Deep Purple, Gillan finally decided the workload had driven him to exhaustion. Unlike some band members, he was unhappy about Made in Japan, and disliked live albums in general. He tended {{to go into the}} studio after the rest of the band had recorded and finished the backing tracks, particularly for Who Do <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are,</b> to lay down his vocals separately. He had been continually at loggerheads with Blackmore, disagreeing about music regularly, which culminated in Gillan writing [...] "Smooth Dancer" [...] about him. While on tour in Dayton, Ohio, he sat down and wrote a resignation letter to the band's managers, stating he intended to leave the band, effective from 30 June 1973.|$|E

[...] Nevertheless, he complimented both teams by saying that India and Australia were the two best teams in the tournament, and said that the Indian players {{deserved}} to be in the final. Ganguly praised the Australian batsmen and said that they played like [...] "real champions".|$|E

Feelings are said to reflect whether we are experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Identifying feelings is said {{to allow us to}} more easily connect with one another, and [...] "Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the UK in December 1972, with a special offer price of £3.10, {{the same as a}} typical single LP from that period. It reached number 16 in the charts. The cover was designed by Glover and featured a colour photo of the band on the front and rear covers, and black and white photos in the inside gatefold. The release in the US was delayed until April 1973, because Warner Bros. wanted to release Who Do <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> first. They were motivated into releasing it due to a steady flow of UK imports being purchased, and it was an immediate commercial success, reaching number 6 in the charts. Warner Brothers also released [...] "Smoke on the Water" [...] as a single, coupling the live recording on Made in Japan with the studio version on Machine Head, and it reached number 4 in the Billboard charts. A recording of [...] "Black Night" [...] from the Tokyo gig, one of the encores that was not on the album, was released as the B-side to the single [...] "Woman from Tokyo" [...] in Europe, and as a single in its own right in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|The classic Deep Purple Mark II line-up {{continued}} to work, and released the album Who Do <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> in 1973.

But internal tensions and exhaustion were more noticeable than ever.

40|$|The {{effective}} use of one’s memory depends on many factors above and beyond its fidelity. We constantly make decisions about what aspects of a situation or an object to commit to memory, how to do so, and how successful <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in doing so. Metamemory research focuses on such monitoring and control processes that interact with memory (e. g., Nelson & Narens, 1990) and holds promise not only to help import memory research into applied and educational settings, but also to provide novel approaches {{to the understanding of}} memory phenomena. This article revisits a debate {{on the nature of the}} informa-tion that is incorporated into metamnemonic judgments and, in particular, on whether cue familiarity or target retrievability influences metamemory judgments.

2500|$|Daniel Dennett {{argued that}} the way <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> seeing the world is, for the most part, an illusion. Part of Dennett's {{argument}} is the claim {{that each of us}} possess what he calls a [...] "Cartesian theater", in which we believe there is a full representation of the visual world in our mind {{and that there is a}} place in the mind where it is observed. According to Dennett, none of this exists. Instead, the only place where a full and rich representation exists is directly on the fovea, and every time a saccade occurs, the information is overwritten. Therefore, there is no such thing as transsaccadic memory. Information previously lost only appears to be retained in visual memory because we can look again. In this way, the outside world acts as a visual memory. Since our eyes are constantly moving, we are not aware that visual inputs are constantly being refreshed to give the illusion of the completed picture <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> seeing.|$|E
