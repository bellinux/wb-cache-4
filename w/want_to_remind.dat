2500|$|While {{similarities}} between the Visitors and the Obama and Bush administrations have been discussed in the media, Peters refuted that they were intentional. He has stated that {{the theme of the}} show is [...] "blind devotion", with no political or religious agenda. Peters commented: [...] "Watching any television show is a subjective experience. If you're looking for something in a show, you can find it, whether you're {{on one side of the}} political spectrum or the other. The central theme of this show is blind devotion, and you can look at that in two different ways. It's our job, as storytellers, to put some provocative things out there and leave some things open to interpretation." [...] Bell added: [...] "We're talking about metaphors and allegories here.

2500|$|Day {{turned in}} a {{generally}} weak performance during the campaign that did little to allay media concerns about his socially-conservative views. A particular campaign stunt that attracted much attention occurred, when Warren Kinsella, often known as Chrétien's [...] "attack dog", went on the Canada A.M TV show with a stuffed Barney dinosaur doll to mock's Day's purported belief that dinosaurs and humans once co-existed, saying that: [...] "I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> Mr. Day that The Flintstones was not a documentary. And {{this is the only}} dinosaur that recently co-existed with humans" [...] while holding up the Barney doll. After the [...] "Barney moment", Kinsella's debating partner, Tim Powers of the Alliance is said to have remarked to Kinsella: [...] "We're fucked. We are well and truly fucked". Kinsella had gotten the idea for the Barney stunt after a meeting with Chrétien's close associate Jean Carle to discuss a documentary about Day where several people claimed that Day had given a speech in 1997 where he was alleged to have stated his belief that humans and dinosaurs had co-existed. According to Kinsella, Chrétien phoned him to congratulate him on the Barney stunt, and found it so funny that he asked Kinsella to repeat his retelling of the [...] "Barney moment" [...] several times. The Barney stunt was part of a gambit by Kinsella to win NDP voters for the Liberals as Kinsella believed if New Democratic voters could be convinced that Day was a [...] "crazy" [...] Protestant fundamentalist fanatic, then they would vote for the Liberals as the best party to stop Day rather risk Vote splitting on the left. The New Democrats and Bloc Québécois also ran lacklustre campaigns, while the Progressive Conservatives, led by former Prime Minister Joe Clark, struggled to retain official party status. The relentless Grit attacks meant to demonize the Alliance as a gang of crazed right-wingers with a [...] "hidden agenda" [...] had the effect of causing many New Democratic voters to support the Liberals as the best party to stop the Alliance. The Liberals secured a strong majority mandate in the 2000 election, winning nearly as many seats as they had in 1993, largely thanks to significant gains in Quebec and in Atlantic Canada. Without Jean Charest as leader, the Tories who had done well in winning the popular vote in Quebec in 1997 fared poorly in 2000, and most of their voters defected over to the Liberals. Many voters in English Canada expressed the view that they had voted Liberal less of affection for the [...] "natural governing party" [...] than because the alternative in the form of Day was so much more worse. The fact that Martin attracted more enthusiasm from the public on the campaign trail than did Chrétien was much noticed within the Liberal Party.|$|E
