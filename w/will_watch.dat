The group includes Steven Melnick, a structural engineer, and Dr. Hellura Lyle, CDC employee specializing in pathogens.

The use of the unmanned surveillance aircraft is an enhancement of the partnership between U.S. and Canadian agencies.|$|E
25|$|Three ships, the Arrow, Whitby, and <b>Will</b> <b>Watch,</b> sailed {{that month}} for New Zealand with {{surveyors}} and labourers to prepare plots {{for the first}} settlers (scheduled to follow five months later). Land sales proved disappointing, however, and threatened {{the viability of the}} settlement: by early June only 326 allotments had been sold, with only 42 purchasers intending to actually travel to New Zealand. Things had improved little by the drawing of the lottery in late August 1841, when only 371 of the allotments were drawn by purchasers, three-quarters of whom were absentee owners.|$|E

Some {{have pointed out}} that he qualified his statements on the constitution with the statement that this is a personal suggestion. Furthermore, it is widely believed in Taiwan that some of these gestures were essentially forced on him again by pressure from the United States and the PRC.

500|$|It Takes a Church has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Tom Conroy of Media Life enjoyed the premiere episode, {{arguing that it}} may even attract a secular audience: [...] "Even secular viewers will be curious to see which one Angela picks, and they’ll get a glimpse into a subculture that is largely invisible on TV. Members of that subculture, on the other hand, <b>will</b> <b>watch</b> It Takes a Church and say, 'Amen!'". Contrastly, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times called the series [...] "utterly frivolous," [...] and called into question the [...] "state of America's spiritual health" [...] after watching an episode. Genzlinger also argued that the show was a {{not much more than}} a [...] "desperate" [...] effort to find something the conservative Christian audience <b>will</b> <b>watch.</b> Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment added that viewers should [...] "pass" [...] on the series, calling GSN's The American Bible Challenge a better [...] "solid game format." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{animation}} director Yoo Jae-myung, Nickelodeon {{was initially}} reluctant {{to approve the}} series and suspended production because, unlike in almost all American animated series, the protagonist was a girl. Conventional wisdom, according to Konietzko, had it that [...] "girls <b>will</b> <b>watch</b> shows about boys, but boys won't watch shows about girls".

500|$|In {{the final}} case, Apollo is {{selected}} {{to serve as}} the defense in an experimental jury trial organized by Phoenix. His client, professional forger Vera Misham, is accused of poisoning her father Drew. After Vera succumbs to poison while testifying, the player is instructed by Phoenix to investigate the circumstances leading to the case. Seven years earlier, while representing magician Zak Gramarye in court, Phoenix was tricked into using false evidence created by Vera, costing him his reputation and job. Zak subsequently disappeared, leaving his daughter Trucy in Phoenix's custody. Over the years, Phoenix uses his experience and connections to gradually uncover the truth: Trucy and Apollo are half-siblings gifted with a unique power of perception by their mother, Thalassa Gramarye. Furthermore, Zak was forced to abandon Trucy, his daughter, in order to honor the wishes of her grandfather, who passed the legal rights to his magic to her side of the family. It also transpires that Zak is Shadi Smith, the victim in the first case, who had come to give the rights to Magnifi's magic to Trucy before being killed by Kristoph when the latter recognized him. The whole matter takes a surprise turn when Kristoph is summoned to testify and Apollo accuses him for setting up Phoenix out of jealousy and then killing everyone related to the case out of fear of being found out. Following the final arguments, the player takes control of a member of Phoenix's jury and must decide whether or not Vera is guilty. If [...] "Not Guilty" [...] is chosen, then she is declared innocent by unanimous vote and ultimately recovers from the poison. With his name cleared, Phoenix decides to apply for readmission to the bar and assures Lamiroir, who is really Thalassa in disguise, that he <b>will</b> <b>watch</b> over Apollo and Trucy. If [...] "Guilty" [...] is chosen, it triggers an alternate ending in which a hung jury forces the court with no choice but to delay the verdict. Vera's sudden death occurs soon after, resulting in an uncertain future for the Wright Anything Agency.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Grey's {{received}} mostly positive reviews from the critics. In {{regard to the}} first season, New York Daily News named Grey's Anatomy a [...] "winner", whereas Newsday expressed a positive opinion by stating [...] "You simply can't stop watching." [...] Walter Chaw from Film Freak Central said the show was [...] "so odious, so repugnant, that it's impossible not to have predicted its newly-minted role as the most popular program in the land." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales was critical of the early series, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: [...] "The show is much {{more a matter of}} commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different". He called Rhimes' script for the pilot episode [...] "nothing but a casserole made of equal parts ham and corn", writing that overall: [...] "It's a 'new' show only in the sense that Dr. Frankenstein's monster was a new man." [...] Kate Aurthur for The New York Times deemed the show a hybrid of Ally McBeal, Sex and the City and ER, writing of the news that it had become the highest-rated midseason drama in 12 years that: [...] "When you parse its ratings, Grey's Anatomy underscores one of the real lessons of the current season - men <b>will</b> <b>watch</b> shows with a female lead. That goes against conventional wisdom, which dictates that it's easier to get women to watch shows aimed at men." [...] Review Stream gave positive reviews regarding the pilot episode, [...] "A Hard Day's Night", due to the undeniable chemistry between Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey from the series' first scene. Regarding Miranda Bailey's appearance in the pilot, ReviewStream.com stated [...] "She's such a small woman but wait until she speaks". HomeTheaterInfo.com, however, had a mixed perspectives on the pilot, noting that the storylines were similar to fellow ABC series Desperate Housewives, but also [...] "brilliantly written, extremely well acted and directed to near perfection". IGN gave a positive review stating, [...] "The show isn't derivative, and actually maintains a tenuous edge over its predecessor, the characters resemble real people - who are fragile, and yes, fallible." [...] and added, [...] "this facile description does little justice to the show's tightly-wound plotting, character subtleties, or masterful acting, it speaks to the intangible nature of what differentiates the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, in network television." ...|$|E
