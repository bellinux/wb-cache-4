Three weeks later, on 1 July, the battleship and her escorts sailed once more for Japanese home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland. Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy aircraft {{on the ground}} and smashed industrial sites in the Tokyo area. Wisconsin and the other ships made no attempt <b>whatsoever</b> <b>to</b> conceal the location of their armada, {{due in large part to}} a weak Japanese response to their presence.|$|E
5|$|Anti-annexation Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri {{had been}} the only Southern Democrat to vote against the Tyler-Texas measure in June 1844. His {{original}} proposal for an annexed Texas had embodied a national compromise, whereby Texas would be divided in two, half slave-soil and half free-soil. As pro-annexation sentiment grew in his home state, Benton retreated from this compromise offer. By February 5, 1845, in the early debates on the Brown-amended House bill, he advanced an alternative resolution that, unlike the Brown scenario, made no reference <b>whatsoever</b> <b>to</b> the ultimate free-slave apportionment of an annexed Texas and simply called for five bipartisan commissioners to resolve border disputes with Texas and Mexico and set conditions for the Lone Star Republic's acquisition by the United States.|$|E

25|$|In June 2006, US and UK {{competition}} authorities investigated alleged {{price fixing}} between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways over passenger fuel surcharges. In August 2007, BA was fined £271million by the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the USDepartment of Justice. However, the Chief Executive of Virgin Atlantic, Steve Ridgway, {{was forced to}} admit that the company had been a party to the agreement, had been aware of the price fixing and had taken no steps <b>whatsoever</b> <b>to</b> stop the price fixing. The company escaped a similar fine to that levied on British Airways only by virtue of the immunity it had earlier negotiated with the regulators.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in Austria, {{there is}} no law in effect in Germany {{requiring}} the return of Nazi-looted art, as long as the items in question can be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the 1998 Washington Agreement, Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement <b>whatsoever</b> <b>to</b> return Nazi-looted art. Any failure {{on the part of the}} German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt might very well prove to be a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.|$|E

25|$|Klaas A. Posthuma {{argues that}} neither Tristan nor Isolde try {{for one moment}} to ignore their {{feelings}} of {{love for each other}} nor do they try to overcome them. On the contrary, they yield to their feelings with all their hearts – but secretly. This has nothing <b>whatsoever</b> <b>to</b> do with the Schopenhauer doctrine. Another important point in this philosophy is Schopenhauer's opinion about finding happiness with one woman only, which he rejected – his reason for never marrying. But for Tristan there is only one woman, Isolde, with Death as alternative. And this leads to the inevitable conclusion that it was not Schopenhauer and his doctrine that were responsible for the creation of Wagner's sublime music drama but his unfulfilled love for the woman he met and loved during these years, Mathilde Wesendonck.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that he}} holds the record for scoring in 9 {{consecutive}} England matches between 13 March 1886 and 7 April 1888. However, there is no substance <b>whatsoever</b> <b>to</b> this claim, as this includes the match against Wales on 29 March 1886, in which all contemporary reports credit the goals to George Brann, Fred Dewhurst and Andrew Amos. He did, however, score {{in each of the}} next 6 consecutive games, which is still an England record (though note that Steve Bloomer scored in 10 consecutive matches in which he played, and George Camsell in 9). In total he scored 14 international goals in just 13 games. He held the overall England goalscoring record from March 1888 when he equalled Charles Bambridge's tally of 11 until his final tally of 14 was overhauled by Steve Bloomer in 1898.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{polished}} and complex {{nature of the}} Aeneid (legend stating that Virgil wrote only three lines of the poem each day), the number of half-complete lines and the abrupt ending are generally seen as evidence that Virgil died before he could finish the work. Because this poem was composed and preserved in writing rather than orally, the Aeneid is more complete than most classical epics. Furthermore, {{it is possible to}} debate whether Virgil intended to rewrite and add to such lines. Some of them would be difficult to complete, and in some instances, the brevity of a line increases its dramatic impact (some arguing the violent ending as a typically Virgilian comment on the darker, vengeful side of humanity). However, these arguments may be anachronistic—half-finished lines might equally, to Roman readers, have been a clear indication of an unfinished poem and have added nothing <b>whatsoever</b> <b>to</b> the dramatic effect.|$|E

500|$|A British officer {{recovered}} some regimental banners either {{during this}} engagement, or following the American retreat from Fort Anne. [...] It is widely claimed {{that one of}} the flags captured was a new design of American flag with thirteen red and white stripes and a constellation of stars, representing the earliest known use of the stars and stripes motif. [...] However, this story is likely untrue, as the time needed for news of the flag design approved by Congress to travel, followed by construction of such a flag and then its delivery to such a remote location render the story implausible, and the flags known to have been recovered bear no resemblance <b>whatsoever</b> <b>to</b> the United States flag.|$|E

500|$|The {{investigation}} {{was led by}} Detective Chief Superintendent John McCammont of West Mercia Police, and involved more than 100 detectives from three police forces. Officers examined similar unsolved murders amid concerns that they could all {{be the work of}} the same individual. Of particular interest were the recent murders of Tracey Turner and Samo Paull, whose bodies were also found on motorways after they had been strangled. McCammont ruled out a link at a press conference on 4 January: [...] "I would stress that at this stage there is no firm evidence <b>whatsoever</b> <b>to</b> link Celine's murder with any other investigations." [...] He appealed for information concerning a bottle of Pascal Chretien champagne, a gift given to Figard before she came to England: [...] "This particular type of champagne is not exported to anywhere in the world outside France and is not sold in this country. It is a 1993 vintage and only 60,000 bottles have been produced." ...|$|E

500|$|A Trip to the Moon {{is highly}} satirical in tone, {{poking fun at}} nineteenth-century science by exaggerating it in the format of an {{adventure}} story. The film makes no pretense <b>whatsoever</b> <b>to</b> be scientifically plausible; the real waves in the splashdown scene are the only concession to realism.

The film historian Richard Abel believes Méliès aimed in the film to [...] "invert the hierarchal values of modern French society and hold them up to ridicule in a riot of the carnivalesque". Similarly, the literary and film scholar Edward Wagenknecht described the film as a work [...] "satirizing the pretensions of professors and scientific societies while simultaneously appealing to man's sense of wonder {{in the face of an}} unexplored universe." ...|$|E
