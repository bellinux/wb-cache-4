25|$|Ángela Peralta {{died in the}} Hotel Iturbide in Mazatlán {{at the age of}} 38 on 30 August 1883. She {{married her}} lover Julián Montiel y Duarte on her deathbed. According to an {{eyewitness}} account of the marriage ceremony, she was already unconscious when it took place. One of the singers from her company, Lemus, supported her by the shoulders. When asked if she took Montiel y Duarte as her husband, Lemus moved her head to make it appear that she <b>was</b> <b>nodding</b> her assent. Before her burial in Mazatlán, her body lay in state, dressed in one of her opera costumes and her best jewels. In 1937, her remains were disinterred and brought to the Rotunda de Hombres Ilustres (the Rotunda of Illustrious People) in Mexico City's Panteón de Dolores. Both Mazatlán and San Miguel de Allende have theatres named in her honour.|$|E
2500|$|Peaking {{at number}} 134 on the U.S. Billboard Top LPs chart, In a Silent Way became Davis's first album since 1965's My Funny Valentine {{to reach the}} chart. While it {{performed}} better commercially than most of Davis's previous work, the album's critics were divided in their reaction upon its release. Its incorporation of electronic instrumentation and experimental structure have been sources of extreme controversy among jazz critics. According to The Rolling Stone Album Guide (1992), Davis's recording process and producer Teo Macero's studio editing of individual recordings into separate tracks for the album [...] "seemed near heretical by jazz standards". In his book Running the Voodoo Down: The Electric Music of Miles Davis, Phil Freeman writes that rock and jazz critics {{at the time of}} the album's release were biased in their respective genres, writing [...] "Rock critics thought In a Silent Way sounded like rock, or at least thought Miles <b>was</b> <b>nodding</b> in their direction, and practically wet themselves with joy. Jazz critics, especially ones who didn't listen to much rock, thought it sounded like rock too, and they reacted less favorably". Freeman continues by expressing that both reactions were [...] "rooted, at least partly, in the critic's paranoia about his place in the world", writing that rock criticism was in its early stage of existence and such critics found [...] "reassurance" [...] in viewing the album as having psychedelic rock elements, while jazz critics felt [...] "betrayed" [...] amid the genre's decreasing popularity at the time.|$|E

60|$|He sat there, with {{a curious}} feeling of having {{swallowed}} a heavy weight, hardly {{listening to what}} Mr. Downing was saying. Mr. Downing was talking rapidly to the headmaster, who <b>was</b> <b>nodding</b> from time to time.|$|E

Here Hans pulled up and touched Fred on the shoulder.|$|E
