5|$|The trains {{were put}} back into service on 13 July. The trains were only allowed {{to operate at}} {{conventional}} speeds and {{had to go through}} a weekly inspection. At the same time, NSB removed the surcharge on the Signatur services. NSB stated that they were considering revocation the purchase of the four trains which were still to be delivered. In addition to problems <b>with</b> <b>axles,</b> there were also issues with the braking and air conditioning systems. In mid-August, the tilting mechanism was disabled on all the trains because of a fault in a bearing in the connection between the bogie and the body which allowed for a movement of several millimetres (at least 0.1 in). In late August, problems occurred with the braking system causing the trains to automatically brake even when not receiving such signals from the automatic train stop system.|$|E

There were no casualties, although the locomotive suffered significant damage. An investigation into the accident found that the axles were overstressed and the VR Commissioners announced that all four Sclass locomotives would be equipped <b>with</b> <b>axles</b> of a revised design.|$|E

25|$|SEALAB I {{was lowered}} {{off the coast}} of Bermuda in 1964 to a depth of 192 fsw below the sea's surface. It was {{constructed}} from two converted floats and held in place <b>with</b> <b>axles</b> from railroad cars. Bond and Captain Walter Mazzone inspected the habitat prior {{to the beginning of the}} project. The experiment involved four divers (LCDR Robert Thompson, MC; Gunners Mate First Class Lester Anderson, Chief Quartermaster Robert A. Barth, and Chief Hospital Corpsman Sanders Manning), who were to stay submerged for three weeks. The experiment was halted after 11 days due to an approaching tropical storm. SEALAB I proved that saturation diving in the open ocean was a viable means for expanding our ability to live and work in the sea. The experiment also provided engineering solutions to habitat placement, habitat umbilicals, humidity, and helium speech descrambling.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the Whyte {{notation}} and AAR system, both {{of which}} are used to classify wheel arrangements, and the UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements, the Swiss system, in both its original and updated forms, takes into account a number of other variables, including track gauge, motive power type, and maximum speed. [...] The Swiss system is also less precise than those other systems in the way it deals <b>with</b> <b>axles,</b> because it refers only to numbers, rather than to arrangements, of powered axles, and axles as a whole. [...] The Swiss system is therefore more a method of classifying locomotive and railcar types and series than a method of classifying wheel or axle arrangements.|$|E

In the mid 1950s all cars were converted to bogies <b>with</b> <b>axles</b> at 8 ft-centres, taken from withdrawn suburban trailers.
