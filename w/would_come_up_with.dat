In place of the militarily inspired propaganda of the first game, Dishonored 2 would employ a subtler approach; lavish posters for invariably canceled enterprises meant to aid the people of Serkonos were made to exhibit the nature of tyranny as practised by the Duke of Serkonos and his government.

The project has been officially halted in June 2007, after the major proponent of the project, Nikolai Sevastyanov, was dismissed from the position of the president of RSC Energia. The newly appointed president of RSC Energia, Vitaly Lopota, confirmed that Kliper would not be displayed on the 2007 MAKS aviation and space show. He said that Energia would spend more time on the project analysis, perform additional dynamic modeling, revise the design and appearance and then <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> new proposals for Roscosmos.|$|E

In an article published in Rolling Stone magazine, Lavigne stated that while working with The Matrix, one member would be in the recording studio while they were writing, but did not write the guitar parts, lyrics, or the melody. According to Lavigne, she and Christy wrote all the lyrics together.

He would soon be a part of Apatow's [...] "frat pack", a close-knit group that includes Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. Of the awkwardness of a grown man spending so much time with a teenaged Rogen, Apatow said: [...] "I'm such a comedy fan that, even though he's16, I know I'm hanging out with one of the guys who's {{going to be one of}} the great comics." [...] Around this time, Apatow <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> odd requests for Rogen and Goldberg, such as turn an idea of his into a movie in 10 days and come up with 100 one-page ideas for films.

500|$|It’s a rerelease of {{a nine-year-old}} game that quietly smuggled microtransactions into its online mode, and I can’t believe a concept so ludicrous {{is a real}} thing. That’s {{something}} a parody of the industry <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with.</b> It’s one thing to see the sad normalization of fee-to-pay elements within brand new releases, but to witness them shoveled retroactively into an old beloved title from an age before such trash gained traction? Activision has set the bar for “AAA” avarice – a new height for greed and a new low for the games business overall. [...] Most remasters are sold as complete, definitive editions of the original games, packing in all the downloadable content and expansions that may have followed the initial launch. COD4 is {{paving the way for}} publishers to triple down – not just make money by selling an old game with updated visuals, but by tacking on DLC and microtransactions too. Should this pay off, I’ve little doubt that other publishers will attempt it themselves. [...] The rampant, unchecked greed on display is almost impressive in its audacity. To sneak freemium bullshit into a nine-year-old game that leveraged its own fandom to sell a completely different game is a masterstroke of sliminess, a monument to Bobby Kotick’s notorious lack of shame.|$|E

[...] She was mostly impressed with Madonna's vocal and emotional power on the track [...] "You'll See" [...] which became [...] "the clearest proof that the ambitious blonde is more singer than celebrity." [...] J. Randy Taraborrelli in his book Madonna: An Intimate Biography picked the David Foster produced tracks as standouts, saying [...] "It was interesting that, {{with all of his}} [...] exciting musical ability from which to draw, he and Madonna <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> two of the most sombre songs she has ever recorded—but such is the excitement of collaboration; one never knows what will come of it." [...] Tirzah Agassi from The Jerusalem Post said the arrangements on the new songs [...] "show a great leap in sophistication" [...] and felt that Madonna [...] "has invested much in improving her vocal technique."

The entire band were abusing both alcohol and other drugs, but Iommi says Osbourne [...] "was on a totally different level altogether". The band <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> new song ideas but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them. Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of input coming to a head, Iommi {{made the decision to}} fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely. [...] "At that time, Ozzy had come to an end", Iommi said. [...] "We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time. We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like 'Rehearse today? No, we'll do it tomorrow.' It really got so bad that we didn't do anything. It just fizzled out." [...] Drummer Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979. [...] "I hope I was professional, I might not have been, actually. When I'm drunk I am horrible, I am horrid", Ward said. [...] "Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed critical reception. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{found the}} episode less enjoyable than [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter". He explained {{that when he}} first learned that the show would tackle the Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien situation [...] "I {{felt a surge of}} excitement and optimism. I thought the writers <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a smart new angle to attack the imbroglio", but after the airing he noted the janitor plot only hampered the episode. Rabin, however, enjoyed Tracy's actions in the episode, commenting that it [...] "provided a showcase for some great Tracy Morgan non-sequiturs". Emily Exton of Entertainment Weekly also found [...] "Khonani" [...] the weaker of the two episodes, and also believed that the [...] "late-night jokes felt tired". Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger disliked the episode, and as a result he noted in his recap that he would remove 30 Rock from the rotation of shows for which he always did detailed reviews. Willa Paskin of New York magazine wrote had the show make reference to the Leno and O'Brien debacle a few months ago [...] "this would have been a cutting-edge satire... Now, not so much." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad remarked that the writing in [...] "Khonani" [...] was sharp, though added that [...] "for some reason" [...] the episode [...] "didn't ring nearly as sharp or funny as many others. I think {{it was a lot of}} unfulfilled potential." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste magazine deemed this episode disappointing, but proclaimed [...] "it was still entertaining enough." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Humbug" [...] {{received}} {{praise from}} critics. In a 2010 {{review of the}} episode, The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff gave it a [...] "Grade A" [...] rating. He noted {{the difference between the}} style of the episode and previous stories of the series, saying that at first, it [...] "feel like it might be a very special Murder, She Wrote or something," [...] and that later, [...] "we're clearly in some other show entirely, the only links in the continuity chain being Mulder and Scully themselves." [...] Including Morgan's other scripts for the show, VanDerWerff called his writing [...] "deeply, deeply funny", but said that [...] "Humbug" [...] "may be [...] weakest script". He particularly praised the ending of the episode, saying [...] "there are few other TV writers that <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> something as haunting and as perfectly understanding of the human condition as the final reveal of who the killer is." [...] Also writing for The A.V. Club in 2010, Zack Handlen called it [...] "a terrific episode ... well-written and odd". Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called [...] "Humbug" [...] "the pivotal episode of The X-Files." [...] Robert Goodwin said of the episode [...] "Talk about offbeat. It's very theatrical and grandiose. The trick was being careful that it didn't become like a bad Vincent Price movie, but it worked out well." [...] Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A grade. Reviewers for website IGN named [...] "Humbug" [...] the tenth best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series. Topless Robot named it the sixth funniest episode of the series.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} the story was that while each case is a {{standalone}} episode, they are also all interlinked, forming a larger mystery, with each episode revealing {{a piece of the}} puzzle. Because Edgeworth is portrayed as a genius prosecutor, whereas Phoenix Wright is a rookie attorney, the development team felt that they needed to come up with incidents that were larger in scale for Ace Attorney Investigations, to match Edgeworth's skill level; therefore, the opponents were made [...] "more formidable" [...] compared to the ones in previous games in the series. Eshiro saw the story as {{the most important part of}} the game, and said that, while time consuming, it was important to make sure that it works. This was accomplished through a lot of trial and error, and several rewrites and revisions: Yamazaki <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> an idea, which was tested to see if players had a hard time understanding it. Based on feedback from the testers, Yamazaki would rewrite and reorder some parts, and add hints. When creating the game's story, the development team took into account that some players might not have played any Ace Attorney games before. Because of this, they tried to make the game as accessible as possible, and make it playable without first having played any of the previous titles; for instance, the first part of the game is a tutorial that introduces the game and the characters. They did however add in-jokes for players who had played previous Ace Attorney games. Kay Faraday was the first new character that was created for the game, and was cited by Eshiro as one of his favorite characters.|$|E

Time-Life later conducted a test in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in which salesmen presented the concept of a pay cable channel to residents by offering free service for the first month and a refundable installation fee; half of residents surveyed in the test expressed interest in purchasing the conceptual service. In a meeting of Dolan and some Time-Life executives who were working on the project, various other names were discussed for the new service.
