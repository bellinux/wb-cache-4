We didn't really think it was pioneering, we just did what rappers did before us was doing on tapes. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the old guys, like Kool Moe Dee, The Treacherous Three, and Grandmaster Flash, got in the studio, they never put their greatness on records.

The Telegraphs Helen Brown commented that [...] "the lads have given this album everything, everything and then some", while Andrew Backhouse of DIY called it [...] "a masterpiece": [...] "this is in a new gear to what their younger selves – or any other band today – could ever dream of." [...] Much was said about the album's reliance on dark themes. Laura Snapes of Pitchfork wrote that these can be [...] "overwhelming", though she credited them for [...] "attempting to offer a nuanced understanding of a broken world at a time <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> their significantly less imaginative British indie rock peers say worse than nothing".|$|E

500|$|Gameplanet {{criticized the}} game's poor support for online multiplayer, {{saying it was}} [...] "unstable and quite frustrating." [...] FiringSquad felt {{that the lack of}} {{communication}} between players in combat during online games was problematic, but that Local Area Network play would be more satisfying. PC Zone said that multiplayer was as unimpressive as {{it had been in the}} first game in the series and said the game needed multiplayer maps. IGN, however, felt that multiplayer play was solidly implemented and fun. Criticism was also directed at bugs in the game, such as frequent crashes when trying to access certain locations. According to GameSpy, Baldur's Gate II is [...] "not 100% stable." [...] GameSpot noted that the game's loading times were somewhat long and that the game crashed on occasion, but said that these problems are not significant. IGN, though noting that the game slowed down during combat <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> animations were happening simultaneously due to spells or [...] "dazzling backgrounds", said that there were almost no other technical problems. GameSpot also felt that the small number of character portraits to choose from was a disappointment and was displeased that the game reused special effects, audio, and graphics from the first game.|$|E
500|$|In May 2000, Howarth {{played for}} Premier League club Leeds United in a seven-a-side tournament in Singapore, because their own goalkeepers were unavailable. He also {{represented}} York in the Candia-66 International Under-20s Tournament {{for a second}} successive summer, although he only played one match as he was being rested after playing for Leeds. His first appearance of 2000–01 came 22 August 2000, in York's 5–1 defeat at home to Stoke City in the League Cup first round first leg. During the match, he fumbled a Graham Fenton cross, and Stoke opened the scoring from the error. He garnered praise from York's part-time goalkeeping coach and former Everton player Neville Southall, who Howarth held as a boyhood hero, saying: [...] "Russ can {{be as good as}} he wants to be. He works hard and has a great attitude <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> youngsters today at big clubs don't have such a good attitude. He will succeed. Even if it is in three, five or even ten years, he will succeed." [...] With Fettis rested, Howarth made his second appearance of the season on 9 January 2001, starting in a 4–0 defeat at home to Darlington in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round. Despite conceding four goals, he was the only player to escape criticism from manager Terry Dolan, who said: [...] "He was let down by everyone else around him. He had no protection whatsoever. His kicking was excellent and he did everything else he had to do without a problem." [...] Due to the good form of Fettis, Howarth finished the season with only two appearances.|$|E

When more and more dancers join the dance ring, the circle starts to bend and forms a new one within itself.|$|E
2500|$|Later on as his Motown career developed, Gaye {{would seek}} {{inspiration}} in fellow label mates such as David Ruffin of The Temptations and Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops as their grittier voices led to Gaye and his producer seeking a similar sound in recordings such as [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] and [...] "That's the Way Love Is". Later in his life, Gaye {{reflected on the}} influence of Ruffin and Stubbs stating, [...] "I had heard something in their voices something my own voice lacked".

2500|$|Feeling the {{pressures}} of success, {{with much of the}} burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on Vedder, the band decided to decrease the level of promotion for its albums, including refusing to release music videos.

[...] In 1994, the band began a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster, which lasted for three years and limited the band's ability to tour in the United States.
