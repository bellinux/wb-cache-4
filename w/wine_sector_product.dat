Consumer preference can allow enterprises to comply with more restrictive rules and sustain higher costs for dierentiating their products and achieving higher quality. When choosing a product, consumers do not evaluate each single quality factor but the product as a whole, therefore the analysis {{has to be done}} with a methodology considering both the combination of all characteristics of the product, and the contribution of every factor to the creation of value for consumers. For this reason the value that consumers attribute to dierent characteristics is evaluated through an experimental economic analysis applying the method of the Conjoint analysis. The experiment was realized evaluating dierent labels of a protected designation of origin "Montepulciano d'Abruzzo DOC" wine, with two dierent groups of consumers: a group of inhabitants of the Abruzzo Region, the region of origin of the wine, and a group of Brazilian people (inhabitants of the Santa Catarina State) ...|$|R

On the demand side, consumers are oriented to a wide quality concept, which covers final product’s characteristics, inputs quality, process attributes, environmental characteristics, product’s safety, etc. On the supply side, facing an increasing competition at international level, firms have to develop a competitive advantage increasingly based on product’s quality differentiation strategies. Furthermore, {{it is noteworthy that}} modes of supply chain organization and types of vertical relationship among supply chain participants are likely to affect final product’s quality. More specifically, in the <b>wine</b> <b>sector,</b> <b>product’s</b> range and product’s quality are influenced, in the long term, by the coexistence of several types of vertical relationship and buying-selling alternatives, notably between vine growers, wineries and bottling firms. Different selling-buying trade-offs may thus arise, for the grower/winery, grape or wine sells to the spot markets or bottled wine sells to the final market, for the bottling company, the trade-off between Appellation of Origin (AO) and private brand strategy (Giraud-Héraud et al., 1998).

40|$|The <b>wine</b> <b>sector</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{representative}} of the Italian economy, due to the fact that it is famous worldwide for its countless wines. Our research goals are twofold. The first is to examine the impact of the <b>wine</b> <b>sector</b> in Italy by comparing it with the manufacturing sector in Italy, which is particularly representative of the Italian economic texture, and analyzing the ability of wine products to attract foreign consumers. The second goal is to observe the changes within wine consumption that have occurred in recent decades, as a consequence of changes in the socio-demographic, cultural, political and economic behavior of the context in consideration, and also due to changes in beverage-sector demand. We formulated two research questions correlated to the above goals. The objective of the research was identified through an analysis of the national and international literature. In addition, a quantitative and qualitative survey was conducted, using a series of market data, in order to deduce the mechanisms acting as drivers in the <b>wine</b> <b>sector.</b> Hence, we used results derived from quantitative surveys carried out by market research companies on a reference population composed of Italian and foreign customers. Finally, we carried out 20 qualitative interviews with managers or owners of important wine Italian companies. It emerged that the <b>wine</b> <b>sector</b> represents an important driver in the Italian industry, due to the richness of the country’s landscapes and its resources in terms of human production and marketing capabilities. In addition, demand within the Italian <b>wine</b> <b>sector</b> was particularly sensitive to natural, socio-demographic, cultural, economic and political changes, as it is influenced by external factors linked to the macro-economic context, and by other factors linked to the perceptions and desires of individuals. The research presents several limitations. In order to overcome them, it would be interesting to compare the Italian <b>wine</b> <b>sector</b> to the <b>wine</b> <b>sector</b> in other countries or regions, such as Chile and California.

40|$|The <b>wine</b> <b>sector</b> in EU {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{complicated}} regarding the legislation and preparations for the wine reform have been long and comprehensive. The wide-ranging EU wine reform was implemented in two phases. The first phase implied retrieval of balance on the wine market and casted out market intervention measures allowing enhanced budget use. The second phase included rules regarding protected designations of origin (PDO), protected geographical indications (PGI), wine making practices and the vineyard register. The primary aim of this paper is contribution to the understanding of the EU wine reform and the next aim is to investigate the impact on Croatia. Using descriptive analysis approach, the quality analysis of the legislation in the European and Croatian <b>wine</b> <b>sector</b> has been conducted. The wine reform in the EU was necessary because of: (i) the structural surplus on the European market, (ii) the steady decline in wine consumption in the EU and (iii) slower growth in EU exports since 1996.

The rising costs associated have stimulated the sector to seek sustainable management’s strategies, focussing on controlling the demand for water and improving its supply. Some EU Directives were implemented concerning water protection and management. These included in particular the Framework Directive in the field of water policy and environmental legislation about specific uses of water and discharges of substances. Several winery wastewater treatments are available, but the development of alternative technologies is essential to increase their efficiency and to decrease the investment and exploration costs. The main goals of the present paper are the comparison of different biological treatment systems, in particular fixed and suspended biomass, operating under aerobic conditions. Since the accurate design of the bioreactor is dependent on many operational parameters, aspects related to hydraulic retention time; oxygen mass transfer and contact time, energetic costs; sludge settling and production; response time during startup, flexibility and treated wastewater reuse, in crop irrigation, with the aim of closing the water cycle in the <b>wine</b> <b>sector,</b> will be addressed. A new treatment system will be presented as a case study, an air micro-bubble bioreactor (AMBB), that will highlight the advantages and constraints on its performance at bench-scale and full-scale, {{in order to fulfill}} the gaps associated with the implemented winery wastewater treatment systems. The data presented was collected during four years monitoring plan and used to develop a tool to support the selection of the best available technology. The present study will also contribute to the implementation of an integrated strategy for sustainable production in the <b>wine</b> <b>sector,</b> based on a modular and flexible technology that will facilitate compliance with environmental regulations and potential reuse for crop irrigation.

We formulated two research hypotheses correlated to the above goals. The objective of the research was identified through an analysis of the national and international literature on the research topic. In addition, a quantitative and qualitative survey was conducted in order to achieved to research objectives. It emerged that Italian wine consumption trend negatively impacted on core business performance, while not on the return on equity; despite the world consumption crisis, global wine consumption is kept to a similar extent in pre-crisis period and foreign companies in the sample have obtained an increase in economic performance.
