5|$|Krishna's {{childhood}} {{illustrates the}} Hindu concept of lila, playing {{for fun and}} enjoyment and not for sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or Rasa-lila is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from whatever they <b>were</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>to</b> {{the banks of the}} Yamuna River, and join him in singing and dancing. Even those who could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the prakṛti matter and the impermanent body.|$|E
25|$|Racial {{violence}} continued {{by whites}} against blacks as they enforced white supremacy. Despite this, freedmen pursued education, organize new churches and fraternal organizations, and entered politics, winning local offices. By the 1890s, more than 100,000 blacks were voting in state elections. In 1896 and 1898, Republican Robert B. Hawley {{was elected to}} Congress from the state by a plurality, when most white voters split between the Democratic and Populist parties. Democrats were determined to end competition by Republicans and Populists, and reviewed what other Southern states <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> disenfranchise blacks and poor whites. Mississippi's new constitution of 1890 had survived a Supreme Court case, although in practice it was highly discriminatory against freedmen.|$|E

[...] In recent years, broadcasts on WGN-TV and CSN Chicago have begun delaying postgame commentary to enable viewers to hear Goodman's song and to watch fans at Wrigley listening and singing along. Cubs management decided to incorporate the song into the stadium experience following the team's annual winter conference (not to be confused with baseball's winter meetings) in which attendees dropped everything they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> sing along.|$|E
500|$|The {{increasing}} attention {{being paid}} to fossil plants in {{the first decades of}} the 19th century would trigger a significant change in the terminology for the study of past life. The editor of the influential French scientific journal, Journal de Physique, a student of Cuvier's named Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, coined the term [...] "paleozoologie" [...] in 1817 to refer to the work Cuvier and others <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> reconstruct extinct animals from fossil bones. However, Blainville began looking for a term that could refer to the study of both fossil animal and plant remains. After trying some unsuccessful alternatives, he hit on [...] "palaeontologie" [...] in 1822. Blainville's term for the study of the fossilized organisms quickly became popular and was anglicized into [...] "paleontology". The term [...] "paleobotany" [...] was coined in 1884 and [...] "palynology" [...] in 1944.|$|E
500|$|The film entered {{production}} over {{a two-month}} period. Principal photography began in July 2009 {{on a large}} open-air set in Tsuruoka in the Yamagata Prefecture in northern Japan. The filming of the action scenes took about three weeks and was met with minor weather-related difficulties. Miike had strayed {{from the use of}} CGI in the film as well as planning the scenes via storyboarding, insisting on shooting the scenes right away. In a separate interview, however, Miike said that some CGI were used, albeit minimal. Over half of the thirteen actors playing the assassins were reportedly inexperienced in swordfighting and horseback riding, and Miike wanted them to be just that, explaining, [...] "If the actors had been skilled from the beginning, and had been in several samurai movies before, the way they approached the action would've been different; they probably would've ended up being something they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> look good or be beautiful, or to fall into the trappings of the stereotypical form that they had."

500|$|During {{his time}} in Germany, Gerber learned about Magnus Hirschfeld and the work he and his Scientific-Humanitarian Committee <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> reform anti-homosexual German law, {{especially}} Paragraph 175, which criminalized sex between men. Gerber traveled to Berlin, which supported a thriving gay subculture, on several occasions and subscribed {{to at least one}} homophile magazine. Gerber marveled at the development of the gay community in Berlin and later wrote [...] "I had always bitterly felt the injustice with which my own American society accused the homosexual of 'immoral acts.' What could be done about it, I thought. Unlike Germany, where the homosexual was partially organized and where sex legislation was uniform for the whole country, the United States was in a condition of chaos and misunderstanding concerning its sex laws, and no one was trying to unravel the tangle and bring relief to the abused." [...] He was particularly impressed with the work of a group called Bund für Menschenrechte (Association for Human Rights) and absorbed a number of Hirschfeld's ideas, including the notion that homosexual men were naturally effeminate. Following his military service, Gerber returned to the United States and {{went to work for the}} post office in Chicago.|$|E
500|$|Their {{action was}} {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference on 29 April 1963. The following day they claimed that none of the city's West Indians were using the buses and that many white people supported them. In an editorial, the Bristol Evening Post pointed out that the TGWU opposed apartheid in South Africa and asked what trade union leaders <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> counteract racism in their own ranks. When reporters questioned the bus company about the boycott, the general manager, Ian Patey, said: [...] "The advent of coloured crews would mean a gradual falling off of white staff. It is true that London Transport employ a large coloured staff. They even have recruiting offices in Jamaica and they subsidise the fares to Britain of their new coloured employees. As a result of this, the amount of white labour dwindles steadily on the London Underground. You won't get a white man in London to admit it, but which of them will join a service where they may find themselves working under a coloured foreman? ... I understand that in London, coloured men have become arrogant and rude, after they have been employed for some months." ...|$|E

On the April 17 episode of Impact Wrestling, Anderson participated in the TNA World Tag Team Championship Tournament with Rockstar Spud, but they lost {{in the first round}} against The Beat Down Clan. On the May 8 episode of Impact Wrestling, Anderson was defeated by Ethan Carter III in a Falls Count Anywhere match. On the May 15 episode of Impact Wrestling, he defeated Tyrus. On the May 29 episode of Impact Wrestling he suffered a lose once again against Ethan Carter III. At Slammiversary, Anderson team with Lashley but lost against Ethan Carter III and Tyrus. Several months later, he started a feud against Bram. At No Surrender, Anderson defeated Bram and defeated him once again at Turning Point in an Open Mic Challenge for ending the feud. At Bound for Glory he participated in the Bound for Gold but was eliminated last by Tyrus. During October and November (taped in July), Anderson participated in the TNA World Title Series for the vacant TNA World Heavyweight Championship. However, he ended fourth of his block by failing to defeat Ethan Carter III, Lashley and Austin Aries.|$|E

[...] Horrified at what the Birmingham police <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> protect segregation, New York Senator Jacob K. Javits declared, [...] "the country won't tolerate it", and pressed Congress to pass a civil rights bill. Similar reactions were reported by Kentucky Senator Sherman Cooper, and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse, who compared Birmingham to South Africa under apartheid. A New York Times editorial called the behavior of the Birmingham police [...] "a national disgrace." [...] The Washington Post editorialized, [...] "The spectacle in Birmingham... must excite the sympathy {{of the rest of the}} country for the decent, just, and reasonable citizens of the community, who have so recently demonstrated at the polls their lack of support for the very policies that have produced the Birmingham riots. The authorities who tried, by these brutal means, to stop the freedom marchers do not speak or act in the name of the enlightened people of the city."

2500|$|The {{official}} {{claim was}} that there was tension among the defendants and especially between Meinhof and Ensslin. On 9 May the Federal Prosecutor [...] spoke about [...] "deep contradistinctions" [...] and [...] "profound clashes" [...] among the team, claiming Meinhof had realized that Baader was [...] "a common criminal", and finally tried to prove the conflict between Meinhof and Ensslin by mentioning a series of letters between them. However these letters were dated no later than early March when they informed the other prisoners (through the [...] "info" [...] network) that their conflict was over, mentioning that: [...] "We didn't even realise what they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> ourselves" [...] (Meinhof), the cause of their conflict [...] "finally seemed strange" [...] when they [...] "understood what was happening" [...] to them (Ensslin).|$|E

Savage said his name, believing they were targeting only jocks (which he himself was not), in an attempt to save his life; he then asked Klebold what they <b>were</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>to</b> which he answered, [...] "Oh, just killing people." [...] Savage asked if they were going to kill him. Possibly because of a fire alarm, Klebold said, [...] "What?" [...] Savage asked again whether they were going to kill him. Klebold hesitated, then told him to leave. Savage fled immediately, and escaped through the library's main entrance.|$|E

2500|$|On February 6, 2012, GSA {{announced}} that it had chosen The Trump Organization as the potential redeveloper of the Old Post Office Building. The company partnered with Colony Capital, a private equity firm, in its bid. [...] The Trump Organization bid pledged to spend $200 million to turn the structure into a 250-room (later sources said 261-room) luxury hotel. Much of the investment would be in cash, not debt. The hotel would include a conference center, spa, three high-end restaurants, and a [...] meeting and banquet facility. The company also pledged to create a small museum dedicated {{to the history of}} the building and the Bells of Congress, and to maintain the historic exterior. The Trump Organization also tentatively agreed to pay GSA $3 million a year in rent. The Trump Organization bid touted the involvement of Arthur Cotton Moore, a noted local architect who had renovated historic buildings in the area before and who had helped design the Old Post Office Building renovations in the 1970s. Moore left the effort within less than a year for health reasons.
