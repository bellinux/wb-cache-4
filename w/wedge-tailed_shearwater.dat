5|$|Seabird colonies {{are highly}} variable. Individual nesting sites can be widely spaced, as in an {{albatross}} colony, or densely packed {{as with a}} murre colony. In most seabird colonies, several different species will nest on the same colony, often exhibiting some niche separation. Seabirds can nest in trees (if any are available), on the ground (with or without nests), on cliffs, in burrows under the ground and in rocky crevices. Competition can be strong both within species and between species, with aggressive species such as sooty terns pushing less dominant species out of the most desirable nesting spaces. The tropical Bonin petrel nests during the winter to avoid competition with the more aggressive <b>wedge-tailed</b> <b>shearwater.</b> When the seasons overlap, the wedge-tailed shearwaters will kill young Bonin petrels {{in order to use}} their burrows.|$|E
5|$|Like most seabirds, the {{majority}} of procellariids breed once a year. There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the white-headed petrel, will skip a breeding season after successfully fledging a chick, {{and some of the}} smaller species, such as the Christmas shearwaters, breed on a nine-month schedule. Among those that breed annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species breed in a fixed season while others breed all year round. Climate and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that breed at higher latitudes always breed in the summer as conditions are too harsh in the winter. At lower latitudes many, but not all, species breed continuously. Some species breed seasonally, to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation or to take advantage of seasonally abundant food. Others, such as the tropical <b>wedge-tailed</b> <b>shearwater,</b> breed seasonally for reasons unknown. Among the species that exhibit seasonal breeding there can be high levels of synchronization, both of time of arrival at the colony and of lay date.|$|E
25|$|When {{numbers of}} {{individuals}} {{are taken into}} account, the tropical birds overwhelmingly dominate. The islands {{are one of the}} most important breeding sites for tropical seabirds in Australia and have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). They contain by far the largest colonies of <b>wedge-tailed</b> <b>shearwater</b> in the eastern Indian Ocean, with over a million breeding pairs recorded there in 1994. They also contain Western Australia's only breeding colonies of the lesser noddy, and the largest colonies in Western Australia of the little shearwater, white-faced storm petrel, common noddy, Caspian tern, crested tern, roseate tern and fairy tern. In addition, they contain important breeding areas for the Pacific reef heron, Pacific gull, bridled tern, white-bellied sea eagle and osprey.|$|E

500|$|Many of the shearwaters in {{the genus}} Puffinus are {{proficient}} divers. While {{it has long}} been known that they regularly dive from the surface to pursue prey, using both their wings and feet for propulsion, the depth that they are able to dive to was not appreciated (or anticipated) until scientists began to deploy maximum-depth recorders on foraging birds. Studies of both long-distance migrants such as the sooty shearwater and more sedentary species such as the black-vented shearwater have shown maximum diving depths of [...] and [...] Tropical shearwaters, such as the <b>wedge-tailed</b> <b>shearwater</b> and the Audubon's shearwater, also dive in order to hunt, making the shearwaters the only tropical seabirds capable of exploiting that ecological niche (all other tropical seabirds feed close to the surface). Many other species of procellariid, from white-chinned petrels to slender-billed prions, dive to a couple of metres below the surface, though not as proficiently or as frequently as the shearwaters.|$|E

40|$|The {{population}} of Flesh-footed Shearwaters (Puffinus carneipes) on Lord Howe Island, Australia, has decreased over recent decades. Known threats include long-line fishing {{and loss of}} nesting habitat. The recent occurrence of plastic debris in breeding colonies has raised concerns that plastic ingestion also may be contributing to the decline of this species. In this paper we investigate the extent of plastic ingestion by Flesh-footed and <b>Wedge-tailed</b> <b>shearwaters</b> (P. pacificus) on Lord Howe Island. The remains of failed Flesh-footed Shearwater fledglings contained substantial quantities of plastics: up to 37 cm 3, equivalent to at least 31 % of proventricular capacity. Road-killed adults (n = 21) had no plastic in their proventriculus. Proventricular contents of near-fledged birds, obtained by non-lethal means, showed that 79 % of Flesh-footed Shearwaters and 43 % of <b>Wedge-tailed</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> contained plastics, in volumes of up to 18. 0 cm 3 and 2. 8 cm 3, respec-tively. Plastic loads were significantly less in <b>Wedge-tailed</b> <b>Shearwaters,</b> the difference possibly due to different densities of plastic within the foraging locations of each species. The impact of plastic ingestion on the survival of Flesh-footed Shearwater chicks and fledglings, and the consequent impacts on the demography of the population are unknown and warrant further investigation...|$|R
