5|$|The pig-faced women {{exhibited}} at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it {{large amounts of}} strong beer, and then shave it. Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would {{be attached to the}} bear's hind paws, and stuffed gloves to the front paws. The bear would then be placed in a chair <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the back, and securely tied to the chair.|$|E
5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{televised}} {{contest of}} Bound for Glory was the Steel Asylum {{to determine the}} number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. There were ten participants in this contest; those involved were Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, Sonjay Dutt, and Super Eric. Christy Hemme accompanied Rave to the ring, while SoCal Val accompanied Dutt. In this encounter, the ring was surrounded by a large red steel cage that domed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the center of the ceiling. The objective was for a competitor to fight up the walls of the cage and escape via the hole in the center. The first person to complete the task won the match and became number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. The duration of the bout was 12 minutes and 7 seconds. After several minutes of fighting among one another, several wrestlers attempted to climb the cage but were stopped. At one point, Devine performed his signature Devine Intervention maneuver on Rave, with Rave landing awkwardly on his neck. The winner of the contest was Lethal, who climbed the cage and escaped through the hole while everyone was preoccupied.|$|E

Others, often in more rural, older areas in European countries, simply have a hole with two indents on either side for your feet. In Eastern societies, there is a hole in the floor, over which the user crouches. A roll of toilet paper is usually available. Old corn cobs, leaves, or other types of paper are also used.|$|E

He also holds the dubious distinction of scoring fewer runs (167) off his bat than wickets (242) taken in Test cricket; the only other cricketer with this distinction over a significant Test career is New Zealand fast bowler Chris Martin.|$|E

The front sight is contained in a protective hood <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the top to insert an elevation adjustment tool, while the rear sight is shielded by two metal ears.|$|E
25|$|The {{fifth wheel}} {{coupling}} provides a pivoting link between a semi-trailer and the towing truck, tractor unit, leading trailer or dolly. Some recreational vehicles have a fifth wheel configuration, requiring the coupling to be installed {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck as a towing vehicle. The coupling consists of a coupling pin (or kingpin) {{on the front of the}} semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped coupling device called a fifth wheel on the rear of the towing vehicle. In 1911, Charles Martin invented the fifth wheel coupler consisting of a round plate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> it, attached to a frame mounted on his tractor.|$|E

25|$|As {{the range}} of {{permissible}} transformations becomes broader, {{the range of}} objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by {{the application of the}} transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a polygon from an annulus (ring <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the centre), but do not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.|$|E
25|$|PMC's early International {{models were}} usually molded in bright yellows, oranges, reds, and sky blues and were toy-like, but very attractive. Many {{of these were}} not promotional models, exactly, rather display models for the showroom. Some 1951 trucks can be found <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the roof and chassis where a metal display post passed through the vehicle. Besides a pickup truck, the 1951 line {{featured}} a larger dumper/flatbed truck, a flatbed stake truck, and a moving truck. The 1955, 1956 and 1957 pickups show a decade long PMC relationship with IH. The 1955 International pickup was later offered by Canadian Kempro, of London, Ontario (Hover 2011).|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, {{questions}} of hygiene posed {{a problem in}} the camps, built in haste. The goal was to quickly build a maximum number of installations, which relegated sanitary considerations to the back burner. Camps in Germany featured only a simple faucet in the yard for thousands of people. Very often, latrines consisted of a simple board <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the middle above a pit, which the prisoners were tasked with emptying at regular intervals. Because of their basic construction, the toilets often overflowed during powerful rains, making an unbreathable atmosphere prevail in the camps. Moreover, the clayey soil turned to muck from the first rains.|$|E

25|$|In January 1935, Rowntree {{decided to}} abandon its attempt to compete with Cadbury Dairy Milk. In May 1935, Rowntree {{launched}} the Aero, an aerated milk chocolate. The Chocolate Crisp, a wafer-and-chocolate bar later known as the Kit Kat, was also launched in 1935. In 1937, the Dairy Box of assorted chocolates was launched, using the market research that had been undertaken for Black Magic. Chocolate beans were first sold loose in 1938, but were later packaged in a cardboard tube and branded as Smarties. Polo, the distinctive mint <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the centre, was developed in 1939, but its introduction was delayed by the onset of war. Harris was made company chairman in 1941.|$|E
25|$|As a consequence, certain traditions {{stated that}} popes {{throughout}} the medieval period {{were required to}} undergo a procedure wherein they sat on a special chair <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the seat. A cardinal would have the task of putting his hand up the hole to check whether the pope had testicles, or doing a visual examination. This procedure is not taken seriously by most historians, {{and there is no}} documented instance. It is probably a scurrilous legend based on the existence of two ancient stone chairs with holes in the seats that probably dated from Roman times and may have been used because of their ancient imperial origins. Their original purpose is obscure.|$|E
25|$|The trapper who has {{located a}} cricket must catch and contain the insect without causing it any injuries. Present-day trappers use zhao, a soft {{catching}} net {{on a wire}} frame, to contain the cricket on the ground. The captured crickets are then placed into a clay pot and stay there until being sold; they are fed a few boiled rice grains per day. Earlier, the Chinese used cage-like traps made of bamboo or ivory rods. Pavel Piassetsky, who visited Beijing in the 1880s, described a different technique. The Beijing people used two kind of tools: a bell-like bowl <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> its bottom, and a tube several inches long. When a cricket {{was forced to leave}} its hideout, the trapper would quickly cover it with the bell. When the trapped cricket emerged from the hole, the trapper would present the tube, and the cricket would eagerly hide inside it. The plugged tube then became a convenient cricket cage.|$|E
