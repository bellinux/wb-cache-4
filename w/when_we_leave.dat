2500|$|Specter {{introduced}} legislation {{to clarify that}} {{it is illegal to}} capture silent visual images inside a person's home. [...] Specter said: [...] "... a very significant invasion of privacy with these webcams ..." [...] … us expect to [...] … video surveillance <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> our homes and go out each day—at the ATM, at traffic lights, or in stores … we do not expect is … surveillance in our homes, in our bedrooms … we do not expect it for our children in our homes.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{must know}} more," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I must learn Florimond's whereabouts, if only {{that we may}} go to meet him <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> Condillac to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stella," [...] he said, [...] "you {{asked me}} at dinner <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were <b>leaving</b> here. You are leaving to-morrow morning by the twelve-thirty train." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> took <b>leave</b> {{of these}} simple folks, <b>we</b> took <b>leave</b> of almost the only natural and {{unprepared}} aspect of Italian life {{which we were}} to see in Rome; {{but we did not}} know this at the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, dear friends, {{we are in}} sad want of {{good news}} about God; and what does other good news signify if we haven't that? For {{everything}} else comes to an end, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> die <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> it all. But God lasts when everything else is gone. What shall we do {{if he is not}} our friend?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, {{you have}} burnt your ships behind you. My only {{hope is that}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> here tomorrow, her pessimistic papa's poison will {{neutralize}} yours somehow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sire, we {{are going}} to him <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> you, to tell him that order is restored, and that he may now without danger leave his hiding-place." ...|$|E
6000|$|And, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> {{the heated}} room, [...] And, when at four the lights expire, [...] The crew shall gather round the fire And mock our {{laughter}} in the gloom; ...|$|E
60|$|GERALD. Nobody is more {{weary of}} hate than I am--and yet we can't fix our own hour, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>leave</b> off hating and fighting. It {{has to work}} itself out in us.|$|R
60|$|Much had befallen {{the house}} of Underwood since the days <b>when</b> <b>we</b> took <b>leave</b> of them, still sorrowing under {{the loss of the}} main pillar of their house, but sending forth the new founders with good hope.|$|R
6000|$|And that is {{the history}} of the conquest of Mexico. What, you may ask, is that the end? <b>When</b> <b>we</b> are <b>leaving</b> the Spaniards a {{worn-out}} and starving handful struggling back for refuge to Tlascala, without anything but their old swords; do you call that a conquest? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've no {{idea how}} we've {{improved}} him," [...] Sybil murmured. [...] "He used to read Owen Meredith after dinner, and go to sleep. By the bye, {{where are you going}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> Enton?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is this heated stove atmosphere. She {{will soon}} forget if you don't keep it up, {{and she will}} be herself <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> this place, and it depends on you when we do that, Ave.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the bye," [...] Harcutt remarked {{with sudden}} cheerfulness, [...] "we shall {{be able to}} find out who the man is <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave.</b> The table was reserved, so the name will be on the list at the door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nor {{any other}} woman. We don't {{need to know}} a man well in order to love him. That's only {{necessary}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> want to <b>leave</b> off.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson," [...] {{answered}} Charley. [...] "Sir Francis Bernard, the new governor, {{had given}} him the chair, instead of putting it away in the garret of the Province House. And <b>when</b> <b>we</b> took <b>leave</b> of Hutchinson he was sitting by his fireside, and thinking of the past adventures of the chair and of what was to come." ...|$|R
60|$|In my folly I {{even went}} so far as to lay plans how and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> might best <b>leave</b> the town to make report, and even gave a list of those to whom we should apply for skiffs.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, Mr Osten," [...] said Big Ben, {{in a low}} tone, [...] "it's a {{piece of}} good luck that they've brought us this way, 'cause <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> them we have nought to do but {{continue}} our journey." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mike intimated that he {{was with}} him on the point. [...] "The {{difficulty}} is, though," [...] he said, [...] "about <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> this room. I mean, we're all right while we stick here, but we can't stay all night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you {{quite sure}} you don't {{recognise}} him? Look again--look carefully. I {{will tell you}} why I am so anxious about it <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> the theatre. Stop! {{let me help you}} up here, where you can see him better." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{had never}} before seen Agnes cry. I had seen {{tears in her eyes}} when I had brought new honours home from school, and I had seen them there <b>when</b> <b>we</b> last spoke about her father, and I had seen her turn her gentle head aside <b>when</b> <b>we</b> took <b>leave</b> of one another; but I had never seen her grieve like this. It made me so sorry that I could only say, in a foolish, {{helpless}} manner, 'Pray, Agnes, don't! Don't, my dear sister!' ...|$|R
25|$|Measuring consumers' {{conscious}} and subconscious through studying their biological sensorimotor, {{cognitive and affective}} response to marketing stimuli, called neuromarketing, is of increasing interest to marketers {{in order to gain}} insight into how they consume. Dawkins (1989) explained that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> die <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> behind genes and memes; genes being the unit of genetic information, and memes the units of cultural information. Neuromarketing aims to examine the memory of these memes in order to manipulate them.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will become}} acquainted with Mr. George Germaine," [...] my {{brother-in-law}} said, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> took <b>leave</b> of him, [...] "at a very interesting period of his life. My last news of him {{tells me that he}} is just married. I know nothing of the lady, or of the circumstances under which my friend first met with her. But of this I am certain: married or single, George Germaine will give you and your wife a hearty welcome to England, for my sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{author of}} all our misfortunes!" [...] he cried, {{pointing}} at me. [...] "We shall have the satisfaction of a partial vengeance at least <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> behind us here the dead and mutilated corpses of the Prince and Princess of Helium.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Since {{you are in}} {{the habit}} of passing dreadful nights,' I said, 'it won't be Miss who spoils your ease: you'd be the same had she never come. However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you'll get quieter <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a reg'lar fool, Gus Dobson. So {{long as we}} {{can keep}} the stuff where it is, what'll be gained by arrestin' us? We've got to take it with us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave,</b> an' then whoever catches us will have the thing down fine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR UNCLE--One hasty line, {{to inform}} you of a {{temporary}} obstacle, which we neither of us anticipated <b>when</b> <b>we</b> took <b>leave</b> of each other at St. Crux. While I was wasting {{the last days of}} the week at the Grange, the Tyrrels must have been making their arrangements for leaving London. I have just come from Portland Place. The house is shut up, and the family (Miss Vanstone, of course, included) left England yesterday, to pass the season in Paris.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Armadale is {{probably}} with her husband," [...] replied the doctor. He approached a {{door at the}} inner end of the sitting-room while he spoke--hesitated--and, turning round again, looked at his sour companion anxiously. [...] "I am afraid I spoke a little harshly, sir, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were <b>leaving</b> your room," [...] he said. [...] "I beg your pardon for it, with all my heart. Before this poor afflicted lady comes in, will you--will you excuse my asking your utmost gentleness and consideration for her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tis easy {{to deceive}} us, [...] In pity of your pain; [...] But <b>when</b> <b>we</b> love, you <b>leave</b> us, [...] To rail {{at you in}} vain. [...] Before we have descried it, [...] There is no bliss beside it; [...] But she, that once has tried it, [...] Will never love again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{hope they}} will," [...] she replied, [...] "because <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> here dad and I {{are going to}} stay for a week or so with some friends quite near. There! Did you hear that noise? That's daddy {{stamping}} because he is getting impatient." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "you've {{had your}} way, and a kind, nice way it was. Now I'll have mine. I don't want any politeness. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> this place I {{am going to}} walk home, and I am going to walk home alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> to God his name, {{his kingdom}} and will, then will he also [...] give unto us our daily bread, and will remit our sins, and deliver us [...] from {{the devil and}} all evil. Only his honor {{he will have to}} himself.|$|E
60|$|Well, we {{presented}} ourselves before the commander, announcing {{that the time}} had come <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were to <b>leave</b> camp, and, considering all the risks which were to be run, it seemed to me as if the message he would have delivered was exceeding brief and unimportant, as compared with what might result from the attempt at delivery.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> {{were nearly}} ready for sea, the English frigate, {{weighing}} her anchor, made all sail with the sea-breeze, and began showing off her paces by gliding about {{among all the}} men-of-war in harbour, and particularly by running down under the Neversink's stern. Every time she drew near, we complimented her by lowering our ensign a little, and invariably she courteously returned the salute. She was inviting us to a sailing-match; and it was rumoured that, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> should <b>leave</b> the bay, our Captain would have no objections to gratify her; for, be it known, the Neversink was accounted the fleetest keeled craft sailing under the American long-pennant. Perhaps this was {{the reason why the}} stranger challenged us.|$|R
6000|$|Manners {{regarded}} him steadily {{for a moment}} without speaking, {{but in a way}} that I could not help thinking was much more embarrassing to the bystanders than to him. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> rose to <b>leave,</b> as he placed his usual gratuity into Tom's hand, he said carelessly, [...] "You might drop into my office to-morrow if you have anything to tell ME." ...|$|R
