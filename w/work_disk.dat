5000|$|Strategy (1) enables to {{estimate}} the job termination time {{and to make it}} easy to allocate nodes for the next batch jobs in advance. Strategy (2) contributes to an efficiency job execution. The job can use the nodes exclusively and the processes in each node can be executed simultaneously. As a result, the large-scale parallel program is able to be executed efficiently.PNs of L-system are prohibited from access to the user disk to ensure enough disk I/O performance. herefore the files used by the batch job are copied from the user disk to the <b>work</b> <b>disk</b> before the job execution. This process is called [...] "stage-in." [...] It is important to hide this staging time for the job scheduling.Main steps of the job scheduling are summarized as follows; ...|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} studies, we {{have examined}} a resonant excitation of disk oscillations in deformed disks. In these studies, however, mathematical treatment around the resonant points was not rigorous. In this paper the inadequate point is corrected, with no essential {{changes in the}} final results. For this excitation process to <b>work,</b> <b>disks</b> must be general relativistic. That is, the non-monotonic radial distribution of epicyclic frequency in relativistic disks {{is essential for the}} presence of the resonance and for trapping of oscillations. In this paper, the growth rate of resonant oscillations is expressed in a form more suitable for numerical calculations. Comment: 18 pages, to be published in PASJ 60, No. 6, 200...|$|R

40|$|External mergesort is {{normally}} implemented {{so that each}} run is stored contiguously on disk and blocks of data are read exactly in the order they are needed during merging. We investigate two ideas for improving the performance of external mergesort: interleaved layout and a new reading strategy. Interleaved layout places blocks from different runs in consecutive disk addresses. This {{is done in the}} hope that interleaving will reduce seek overhead during merging. The new reading strategy precomputes the order in which data blocks are to be read according to where they are located on disk and when they are needed for merging. Extra buffer space makes it possible to read blocks in an order that reduces seek overhead, instead of reading them exactly in the order they are needed for merging. A detailed simulation model was used to compare the two layout strategies and three reading strategies. The effects of using multiple <b>work</b> <b>disks</b> were also investigated. We found that, in most cases, inte [...] ...|$|R
