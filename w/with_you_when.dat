It was kind of real but it wasn't really. I always said whenever someone says fantasy they immediately think of more Disney--esque. The idea of a hard hitting drama in a fantasy world, {{that was kind of}} different at the time... I always thought of it as a musical. They kind of saw it worked in the world of an MTV video.|$|E
2500|$|Albarn {{revealed}} that originally, many people whom he knew were {{against the war}} were reluctant to take a stand, stating [...] "to be honest <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> Robert Del Naja and myself started really stepping up prior to the war {{it was very difficult}} to find anyone. And I don't want to name any names because they are people who I respect but they were really, for some reason, very reticent to stand with us. A lot of people who you would now associate with being anti-war at that particular point didn't seem to be prepared to do it." ...|$|E

Griffin stated he did not really know his worth because it [...] "would keep me from sleeping at night". Former First Lady Nancy Reagan and he exchanged birthday greetings each July 6 for their shared birthday.

2500|$|From mid-March {{to early}} May 2004 Sodastream {{undertook}} their first US tour, with further tours of Europe (in May) and Australia (in August). In October {{of the following}} year they released another EP, Take Me <b>with</b> <b>You</b> <b>When</b> You Go; the seven tracks had been recorded from March to July by Cohen and Smith. Eliza Sarlos at Mess+Noise enthused [...] "at once calming and intriguing, where the interplay between acoustic guitar, double bass and voice is immediately affecting ... they've still got the songs, the killer songs ... have taken more risks, {{and in terms of}} expression ... narratives flourish with a development in both structure and music".|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, she {{formed a}} folk rock band named The Breeders with her sister. She {{then became a}} {{prolific}} songwriter, as she {{found it easier to}} write songs than cover them. Deal later commented on her songwriting output: [...] "I got like a hundred songs when I was like 16, 17 ... The music is pretty good, but the lyrics are just like, OH MY GOD. We were just {{trying to figure out how}} blue rhymes <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> I was writing them, they didn't have anything to do with who I was." [...] The Deals bought microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio. According to Kelley, they [...] "had the whole thing set up by the time we were 17". They later bought a drum machine [...] "so it would feel like we were more in a band".|$|E
2500|$|In addition, his {{propensity}} for throwing strikes and avoiding walks kept his pitch counts low. On July 2, 1997 {{he won a}} game against the New York Yankees, for example, with the numbers [...] "nine innings, three hits, no walks, eight strikeouts, one pickoff, one double play, 84 pitches ... two hours and nine minutes". Dodgers general manager Fred Claire admired Maddux's pitching consistency, saying [...] "It's almost like a guy lining up a 60-foot-6-inch putt ... he is just so disciplined, so repetitive in his pitches." [...] Speaking about Maddux's accuracy, Orel Hershiser said, [...] "This guy can throw a ball in a teacup." [...] Baseball Hall of Famer Wade Boggs talked about facing Maddux: [...] "It seems like he's inside your mind <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> he knows you're not going to swing, he throws a straight one. He sees into the future. It's like he has a crystal ball hidden inside his glove." ...|$|E

[...] But during the rainy weather some of them thought they had an excuse to drink. [...] They said they thought it kept them warm. [...] I saw at once that this must not go on, as a little whiskey always calls for more. [...] So I called all the Indians together in council, and explained to them that I had noticed they were beginning to look for liquor again and that it was not good for them. [...] Then I said: “I am going to make a new rule with you. [...] Every man and woman hereafter will receive only half their pay. [...] The balance will be kept in my care until near the end of the season. [...] Then those of you who think you must be spending your money all the time will have something to take home <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> your work is done.’ [...] Some, of course, did not like this plan. [...] While they knew it was for their best interest, still they did not want to do without their liquor. [...] But the majority fell right in with my proposition. [...] They knew I would be honest with them, and that their money was safe with me. [...] So it was agreed that on each pay day half of the money should be put away until the show closed. [...] Further, each man was warned that he must be more careful about drinking.” ...|$|E
