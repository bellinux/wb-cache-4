5|$|Its {{status in}} the history of Danish {{photography}} is rivalled by a portrait of Bertel Thorvaldsen sitting at an easel outside his studio in the garden of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at Charlottenborg Palace in Copenhagen. This daguerrotype was taken by the French photographer Aymard Charles Théodore Neubourg, who visited Copenhagen in the summer of 1840. An examination of the circumstances under which it was taken reveals that the date <b>was</b> <b>Sunday,</b> 26 July 1840. It has also been noticed that Thorvaldsen is making the horn sign with what apparently is his left hand although, {{as a result of the}} daguerrotype mirror effect, it is actually his right hand. This has been ascribed to the anxiety he must have experienced while facing the new mechanical device which could reveal even the slightest detail.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing as}} Headington United, orange and blue striped shirts were worn with navy shorts and socks. The {{design of the}} shirt changed regularly, with the stripes being changed every few seasons. After joining the Southern League, the blue stripes were lost for good and a lighter shade of orange {{was used for the}} shirt. The yellow kit was first worn during the 1957–58 season, with black shorts and yellow socks. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the black shorts were first {{replaced}} with yellow ones, and then with light blue shorts. Since the early 1990s, the strip has been composed of the yellow shirt and navy coloured shorts and socks. A large variety of away kits has been used over the years, ranging from red and black stripes on the shirts, to a fully white kit. The first sponsor to appear on the shirt <b>was</b> <b>Sunday</b> Journal, a local newspaper, in 1982. Between 1983 and 1985, there were three sponsors: BPCC, Pergamon and the Sunday People. Following those were Wang Laboratories (1985 to 1989), Pergamon (1989 to 1991), Unipart (1991 to 2000), Domino (2000 to 2001) and Buildbase (from the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001 to 2010). Following the return to the Football League, Bridle Insurance were announced as new shirt sponsors. The Bridle deal ended after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season. The home sponsor for the 2013–14 season was announced as Animalates, with the away kit being sponsored by Isinglass Consulting for that same season after winning an innovative prize draw. That one-year deal with Isinglass was extended for the 2014–15 season, again featuring on the away kits only.|$|E

25|$|After a brief 1957 {{engagement}} to GMO vocalist Lorry Peters, Hambro met vocalist and beauty queen Lynn Michels in 1958, {{when he was}} 34 and she was 18. Michels, born Charlotte Joyce Wexler, was from Chester, Pennsylvania. She was on stage from an early age, working alongside a number of Pennsylvania-based acts, including The Four Aces and Bill Haley and the Comets. At age 10, she took first place during an appearance on Paul Whiteman's Philadelphia-based Saturday morning talent show, TV Teen Club (an indirect predecessor to American Bandstand). Later, she was a regular on the Sunday morning children's talent show, The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour, hosted by Stan Lee Broza on WCAU TV in Philadelphia and broadcast on WNBT TV in New York. While still in High School, Michels sang with the Al Raymond big band, playing the many ballrooms and lounges in the Tri-State area, as well as performing for weddings, ballroom dances, and senior proms at many Tri-State area high schools and colleges. However, the band's steady gig <b>was</b> <b>Sunday</b> nights at Upper Darby's St. Alice's Social Center. When she met Hambro in 1958, Michels was in her {{senior year of high}} school and singing with Al Raymond. She was introduced to Hambro by the manager of the El Rancho Club in Woodlyn, Pennsylvania, where she had gone to see Ray McKinley's Glenn Miller Orchestra. Hambro called her later that year to invite her to a GMO performance at a ballroom in Philadelphia. That evening, Hambro told her that he would pursue and marry her, but it was an extended and often long-distance courtship. When Michels graduated from high school, she went to work for the Matys Brothers, a rockabilly and later polka band from the Philadelphia area that was part of Bill Haley's stable. She would be with them until June 1960, touring the U.S. and Canada, while continuing to see Hambro when she could. Hambro and Michels were engaged July 23, 1960, after a GMO gig at the Brandywine Music Box and married on November5,1960, at The Wynne catering hall on North 54th Street in Philadelphia (Wynnefield), with Ray McKinley as their best man, and Ray's wife, Gretchen, looking on. They moved into an apartment at 159-15 83rd Avenue in Kew Gardens, Queens, New York. Son, Larry was born in the late summer of 1961, followed by brother Lee, in the winter of 1963.|$|E

500|$|... "Don't Rush" [...] is {{a country}} song written by Blu Sanders, Natalie Hemby and Lindsay Dawn Chapman, and {{produced}} by Dann Huff. It features American country singer-songwriter Vince Gill. The song {{is set in a}} [...] "drowsy, take-it-easy beat" [...] which is composed of a layer of Clarkson's and Gill's soulful harmonies. The song begins with a breezy soft-rock tune. In the first verse, Clarkson sings [...] "I see the way you’re looking at me / Baby know I’m feeling it too / We can just light up every candle / Move from room to room" [...] which was ensued by the sound of Gill's guitar. As the song launches into the chorus, both Clarkson and Gill are heard singing [...] "Stopping every minute just because you're in it/Wishing everyday <b>was</b> <b>Sunday,</b> you're right next to me/It's how it's supposed to be", a vocal chorus deemed as [...] "slightly awkward" [...] by Will Hermes of Rolling Stone.

500|$|On May 7, eruptions {{similar to}} those in March and April resumed, and over the next days the bulge {{approached}} its maximum size. All activity had been confined to the 350-year-old summit dome and did not involve any new magma. A total of about 10,000 earthquakes were recorded prior to the May 18 event, with most concentrated in a small zone less than [...] directly below the bulge. Visible eruptions ceased on May 16, reducing public interest and consequently the number of spectators in the area. Mounting public pressure then forced officials to allow 50 carloads of property owners to enter the danger zone on May 17 to gather whatever property they could carry. Another trip was scheduled for 10a.m. the next day. Because that next day <b>was</b> <b>Sunday,</b> more than 300 loggers would not be working in the area. By the time of the climactic eruption, dacite magma intruding into the volcano had forced the north flank outward nearly [...] and heated the volcano's groundwater system, causing many steam-driven explosions (phreatic eruptions).|$|E

Throughout the service the Chief responded with dignity to every detail of the long and solemn ceremony--and it may be said too that he attracted the gaze of everyone present. When formal service ended, the popular Father McGivney came to take his hand in welcome and gave his blessing, but it was long before the Chief was permitted to take leave of his friends and neighbors gathered about him to shake hands. The Chief was visibly agitated and frequently referred to his disappointment in having to go.
