5|$|Further work on {{the model}} has shown that a slight {{difference}} in assumptions can produce completely different results. For example, Eaton and Grossmann showed that if the firms compete in prices rather in quantities (Bertrand competition rather than Cournot) then the optimal policy is an export tax rather a subsidy – a policy rarely used in practice, politically unpopular and contrary to protectionist sentiment <b>which</b> <b>generally</b> touted New Trade Theory models as an argument for their favored policies.|$|E

5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, <b>which</b> <b>generally</b> considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E
5|$|Salta, {{like the}} rest of the Solway plain, has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate {{classification}} Cfb), with warm summers and cool winters <b>which</b> <b>generally</b> avoid extremes of temperature. Salta has a cool climate, with average daytime highs of around 19°C during July and 7°C during December, although lows of −12°C have been recorded. It is wet all year round, with rain or drizzle expected on 16 to 19 days of most months. Snowfall is relatively uncommon.|$|E

The name of a wrestler's character was not always the person's birth name, as wrestlers often use a stage name to portray their character.|$|E

Modern concepts use either doubly fed machines with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or synchronous generators (both permanently and electrically excited) with full scale converters.|$|E

The Bahá'ís around the world are currently being encouraged to focus on capacity building through children's classes, youth groups, devotional gatherings, and a systematic study of the religion known as study circles. Further focuses are involvement in social action and participation in the prevalent discourses of society. The years from 2001 until 2021 represent four successive five-year plans, culminating in the centennial anniversary of the passing of `Abdu'l-Bahá.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous Scleractinia coral genera {{failed to}} cross the K–Pg {{boundary}} into the Paleocene. Further analysis of the coral extinctions shows that approximately 98% of colonial species, ones that inhabit warm, shallow tropical waters, became extinct. The solitary corals, <b>which</b> <b>generally</b> do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper (below the photic zone) areas of the ocean were less impacted by the K–Pg boundary. Colonial coral species rely upon symbiosis with photosynthetic algae, which collapsed due to the events surrounding the K–Pg boundary, however, the use of data from coral fossils to support K–Pg extinction and subsequent Paleocene recovery, must be weighed against the changes that occurred in coral ecosystems through the K–Pg boundary.|$|E

5|$|Ash fallout occurs {{immediately}} after the eruption and is controlled by particle density. Initially, coarse particles fall out close to source. This is followed by fallout of accretionary lapilli, {{which is the result}} of particle agglomeration within the column. Ash fallout is less concentrated during the final stages as the column moves downwind. This results in an ash fall deposit <b>which</b> <b>generally</b> decreases in thickness and grain size exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano. Fine ash particles may remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks and be dispersed by high-altitude winds. These particles can impact on the aviation industry (refer to impacts section) and, combined with gas particles, can affect global climate.|$|E
5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European warfare, <b>which</b> <b>generally</b> took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E
5|$|Chalukyan temples {{fall into}} two {{categories}} – the first being temples with a common mantapa (a colonnaded hall) and two shrines (known as dvikuta), and the second being temples with one mantapa and a single shrine (ekakuta). Both kinds of temples have two or more entrances giving access to the main hall. This format differs from both the designs of the northern Indian temples, which have a small closed mantapa leading to the shrine and the southern Indian temples <b>which</b> <b>generally</b> have a large, open, columned mantapa.|$|E

5|$|Etty did not base The Combat on {{any single}} {{incident}} from history or literature, or on any existing artwork, {{but on his}} own imagination; this was a highly unusual step to take regarding history paintings, <b>which</b> <b>generally</b> depicted themes from literature or religion. He had been considering the topic as early as 1821, and his plans took shape following his visit to Italy. During this visit Etty had met Antonio Canova and been very impressed by him; The Combat is clearly influenced by his work. As well as drawing inspiration from classical sculpture, he was also strongly influenced by the composition of Old Master works he had seen while in Italy. As with many of Etty's works, the models posed for him separately in his studio, {{rather than as a}} group.|$|E
5|$|In Hawaii, the planarian Endeavouria septemlineata {{has been}} used to control the {{imported}} giant African snail Achatina fulica, which was displacing native snails, and Platydemus manokwari, another planarian, {{has been used}} for the same purpose in Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea and Guam. Although A. fulica has declined sharply in Hawaii, there are doubts about how much E. septemlineata contributed to this. However, P. manokwari is given credit for severely reducing, and in places exterminating, A. fulica – achieving much greater success than most biological pest control programs, <b>which</b> <b>generally</b> aim for a low, stable population of the pest species. The ability of planarians to take different kinds of prey and to resist starvation may account for their ability to decimate A. fulica. However, these abilities have raised concerns that planarians may themselves become a serious threat to native snails.|$|E
