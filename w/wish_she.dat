As she took the stand, the trial judge Lord Bracadale {{explained}} {{that she had the}} right not to give evidence against her husband if she did not <b>wish.</b> <b>She</b> declined to give evidence. Mrs Gilroy could only decline to give evidence because the events she would speak to took place before section 86 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 came into force.

Unfortunately he died of smallpox in 1689, at the early age of 22. His young widow Muttammal – the only woman, strange to say, whom he had married – was inconsolable at his loss and, though she was far advanced in pregnancy, insisted upon committing sati on his funeral pyre. His mother, Rani Mangammal, with great difficulty persuaded her to wait until her child was born, solemnly swearing that she could then have her way. When the child (a son) arrived, she was put off with various excuses until, despairing of being allowed her <b>wish,</b> <b>she</b> put an end to her own life.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the themes}} and musical styles of the album were {{inspired}} by Beyoncé's role in Dreamgirls. The plot of the film revolves around The Dreams, a fictional 1960s group of three female singers who attempt success in the mainstream music industry {{with the help of}} their manager, Curtis Taylor. Beyoncé portrays Deena Jones, the lead singer of the group and the wife of Taylor, and is emotionally abused by him. Because of her role, Beyoncé was inspired to produce an album with an overriding theme of feminism and female empowerment. In the bonus track, [...] "Encore for the Fans", Beyoncé says, [...] "Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I <b>wish</b> <b>she</b> would have said in the film." ...|$|E
500|$|The Florida Citrus Commission reiterated its {{commitment}} to Bryant by stating that it [...] "wholeheartedly support(ed)" [...] her right to free speech, praising her [...] "courageous leadership on a moral issue that it is tearing up religious and other organizations which have become involved". The commission received thousands of letters both supporting Bryant's stance and condemning the commission; {{at one point the}} U.S. Postal Service installed bomb detection equipment for the mail collected for delivery to the Florida Citrus Commission. The publicity director for the Florida Department of Citrus told a reporter from the Associated Press, [...] "The whole Anita thing is a mess. No matter what we decide, we're only going to lose. I <b>wish</b> <b>she</b> would just resign." [...] Although in 1979 the commission extended their $100,000 annual contract with Bryant, they did not renew it in 1980.|$|E

It also features the catchy hook, [...] "My chick bad / My chick 'hood / My chick do stuff that your chick <b>wish</b> <b>she</b> could." [...] As Ludacris's verse brags about his significant other, Minaj's as well as the females present on the remix, brag about themselves. In the song, Ludacris refers to tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams, and to the Tiger Woods scandal in a reference of his wife, Elin Nordegren. Minaj refers to basketball star Lisa Leslie, as well as the horror franchises A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th, and their respective main antagonists, Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees.|$|E

[...] Emanuel Levy called Tower Heist a [...] "formulaic, haphazardly plotted action comedy... whose best asset is its strong ensemble." [...] Levy said [...] "What makes the picture... work is not its plot, which is overly familiar and utterly implausible, but the socio-psychological dynamics that prevail among the [...]" [...] Levy singled out Stiller as [...] "well cast" [...] and Sidibe as having [...] "some of the picture's best lines," [...] but gave individual praise to Murphy, saying that he [...] "dominates {{the second half of the}} picture," [...] rendering [...] "a joyous performance that recalls his witty, charming, streetwise roles of the 1980s." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga, Bennett {{wanted her}} to sing {{different}} songs and was impressed by her vocals during [...] "Lush Life", referring to the Billy Strayhorn written standard that has been recorded by everyone from Nancy Wilson and Sarah Vaughan to Donna Summer and Linda Ronstadt. Gaga explained that she was nervous about recording with Bennett. [...] "I just wanted him to hear I have an authentic jazz voice and that I studied that... If he can hear that, I'm okay. If he can't hear it, I'm not an authentic jazz voice", she added. Inspiration for singing came from jazz singer Amy Winehouse, who died in July 2011; Gaga added [...] "I thought of her almost {{every day in the}} studio. I <b>wish</b> <b>she</b> was still here. She was jazz to her core". The songs were recorded live with the band, and during the recording process Gaga asked for carpets to be placed on the studio floor, so that it looked like a film set and it could be photographed.|$|E

The track was then added to the set-list of the concert tour. Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger was most impressed with the performance, calling it {{one of the highlights of}} the concert. He added that [...] "reinterpretation of the single, which was far more Laura Nyro than Madonna, was such an improvement over the mechanized, tricked-out hit version that it was hard not to <b>wish</b> <b>she</b> could get back to the studio and re-cut it before the album comes out." [...] Gaga performed an acoustic version on The Oprah Winfrey Show, in May 2011, along with another song from Born This Way, [...] "You and I". Sitting atop a high stool, Gaga—in a red leather blazer, a floppy mask-like hat and see-through leopard bodysuit—played a piano made out of a wire high-heel structure.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was shot from May 23 to 24, 2008 on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, with {{director}} Joseph Khan. American recording artist Britney Spears filmed a cameo appearance for the video on June 4 at the Warner Bros. lot in Los Angeles. An on set [...] "insider" [...] said that Spears' scene was short, only consisting of her driving in a passing car and waving {{to the other}} girls. On June 12, 2008 it was announced by MTV News that the cameo had been cut from the final video. Scherzinger was asked why Spears got cut from the video. She said: [...] "I honestly am not so sure. You shoot {{a lot of things}} when you do a video. Some things stay in but other things don't make the cut and Britney just didn't make it. I've seen a little clip of her performance and she looked adorable so I really <b>wish</b> <b>she</b> was in it! Hopefully we'll work together in the future."

500|$|The North Jersey Media Group {{gave the}} DVD 2.5starts out of five, saying that Madonna {{felt to be}} [...] "overly" [...] {{attached}} to her contemporary songs than her classic releases. They added [...] "that plodding through overlong arrangements of inconsequential songs— from the annoyingly vocoder-treated 'Revolver' early to the throwaway dance cut 'Celebration' at the end— will leave listeners wondering why so many substantial hits were given only a nod, if anything at all." [...] A review by Kevin Taft in online website [...] "Edge on the Net" [...] was overall negative. Taft noticed that Madonna's vocals were altered and mixed {{so much that it}} sounded disembodied and did not match the singer's lips. He was [...] "shocked" [...] to find that the audio CDs also contained the badly mixed songs. The reviewer explained that [...] "The choice to have the backing track turned down so low doesn't help much either. In fact, it makes it sound as if Madonna is on a cabaret stage with a five-piece band... For the six months it took Madge to edit her concert, one would <b>wish</b> <b>she</b> got her vocals to match her lips." [...] However, Taft commended the overall show and the technical brilliance accompanying it.|$|E
500|$|... "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. While reviewing Femme Fatale, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted Spears [...] "does what pop stars invariably do {{in lieu of}} having a detectable character of their own: {{goes on and on}} about sex", while commenting that [...] "after a while, you get the feeling the lyricists just gave up trying in the face of her indifference: 'You got me kind of hot … Steaming like a pot full of vegetables,' she sings, which somehow makes you think not of thrillingly sweaty congress but the smell of boiled cabbage." [...] Contemporary critic Robert Christgau noted the songs on the album are [...] "such a convincing illusion that any guy who goes all the way with it has too much libido invested in the bimbo fantasy", saying that the singer is [...] "just too straight-faced" [...] on [...] "the nauseous 'Your body look so sick I think I got the flu'". A reviewer of Samesame.com.au compared the background vocals of the song to Kesha's [...] "Blow" [...] (2010), and noted [...] "guest rapper Sabi <b>wish</b> <b>she</b> was Nicki Minaj". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani considered [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] one of the album's [...] "best offerings", comparing the song to Christina Aguilera's [...] "Desnudate" [...] (2010).|$|E
