500|$|The {{design changes}} forced Kenny Myers to abdicate his other makeup job, that of Warner's Gorkon, to Margaret Bessera. Gorkon's {{appearance}} was of special concern to Meyer, {{who had two}} specific role models: Ahab and Abraham Lincoln. [...] " [...] loves to play the classics," [...] Kenny Myers explained, [...] "and incorporating these two images was really genius on his part. He wanted there to be uncertainty about Gorkon's true intentions. Did he want peace, or <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> sinister in his mind? From his appearance, {{it was impossible to}} tell if he was friend or foe. Subliminally, there were aspects of both." ...|$|E

60|$|A timid, insane hope sprang in {{the breast}} of Harker. Was it possible? <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> in his playing? It had, indeed, seemed to him at times as if he got {{a kind of a}} {{richness}} out of it. Was he a genius? Meantime the military gentleman stumbled over the air.|$|E

6000|$|Miss Milray {{took her}} hand, for parting, {{but did not}} kiss her. [...] "I won't advise you, my dear. In fact, you haven't asked me to. You'll know what to do, if you haven't done it already; girls usually have, when they want advice. <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> {{you were going to}} say?" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{followed}} a pause, {{at the end}} of which she asked him was that the sum of his message, or <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> that he had forgotten. The herald, bowing gracefully upon the arched neck of his caracoling palfrey, answered her that what he had said was all he had been bidden say.|$|E
60|$|Her {{head was}} bent over her plate. She seemed to be {{listening}} to the music--or <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> there which she did not wish me to see? I could not tell. The waiter intervened with another course. When she spoke to me again, her tone was almost cold, but it troubled me very little. There was a softness in her eyes which she could not hide.|$|E

6000|$|Blanche {{turned toward}} Arnold, daunted by a vague sense of {{something}} serious to come. The letter {{that she had}} received from her husband on her departure from Ham Farm had necessarily alluded to relations between Geoffrey and Anne, of which Blanche had been previously ignorant. Was any reference coming to those relations? <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> yet to be disclosed which Arnold's letter had not prepared her to hear? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To men of nicely poised nervous {{organisation}} such as ourselves, Comrade Windsor," [...] said Psmith, smoothing his waistcoat thoughtfully, [...] "these {{scenes are}} acutely painful. We wince before them. Our ganglions quiver like cinematographs. Gradually recovering command of ourselves, we review the situation. Did our visitor's final remarks convey anything definite to you? Were they the mere casual badinage of a parting guest, or <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> solid behind them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I do!" [...] Out it came {{in those}} words, before I could stop it. <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> unbecoming to a young lady in saying what I had just said? Mrs. Staveley {{seemed to be more}} amused than angry with me. She took my arm kindly, and led me along with her. [...] "My dear, you are as clear as crystal, and as true as steel. You are a {{favorite}} of mine already." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{left one}} New York Times writer groping for answers: [...] "Are the killings the natural {{byproduct of the}} country’s culture of violence, drinking and machismo? Or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> inherently sinister in the song?" ...|$|R

60|$|She {{repeated}} {{these words}} {{over and over}} again, till the hearing them seemed to bewilder all my senses. I hardly knew what I touched. Suddenly, my searching hands stopped of themselves, I could not tell why. Was there some change in the room? Was there more air in it, as if a door had been opened? <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> moving over the floor? Had Margaret left her bed?--No! the mournful voice was speaking unintermittingly, and speaking from the same distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} my heart ever since then, {{such as it}} was; and such as you were, I cared for no other woman. What little {{reputation}} I have won, it was {{that you might be}} pleased with it: and indeed, it is not much; and I think a hundred fools in the army have got and deserved quite as much. <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> in the air of that dismal old Castlewood that made us all gloomy, and dissatisfied, and lonely under its ruined old roof? We were all so, even when together and united, as it seemed, following our separate schemes, each as we sat round the table." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> in {{the eager}} sympathy {{of his eyes}} as they met hers, which spoke to the little lonely heart in the sole {{language}} that could ever reach it? Did the child, with the quick instinct of the deaf and dumb, read his compassionate disposition, his pity and longing to help her, in his expression at that moment? It might have been so. Her pretty lips smiled on him as they had smiled on no one else that night; and when she held out some cards to be chosen from, she left unnoticed the eager hands extended {{on either side of}} her, and presented them to Valentine only.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I wouldn't say he <b>was</b> exactly... but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> queer... <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> uncanny about him. I'll {{tell you}} my opinion...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh dear no. He's never uncivil. But I'm sure of it. Never mind how. I {{never told}} him that I cared for him and I never did care for him. Papa, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> going to happen?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Ware," [...] she said, [...] "we haven't talked {{much about}} it, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>{{something}}</b> <b>there</b> behind, isn't <b>there,</b> <b>something</b> you <b>are</b> terrified about, {{something that might}} come, even now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And yet he {{had been}} so {{determined}} this morning, before he went to Gawaine's; and while he <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> had taken hold of him and made him gallop back. It seemed he couldn't quite depend on his own resolution, as he had thought he could; he almost wished his arm would get painful again, and then he should think of nothing but the comfort it would be {{to get rid of the}} pain. There was no knowing what impulse might seize him to-morrow, in this confounded place, where there was nothing to occupy him imperiously through the livelong day. What could he do to secure himself from any more of this folly? ...|$|E
60|$|Gyp {{went back}} to her seat by the bed. Irony! She whose only desire was to be let go free, was mainly {{responsible}} for his breakdown! But for her, there would be nothing on his mind, for he would not be married! Brooding morbidly, she asked herself--his drinking, debts, even the girl--had she caused them, too? And when she tried to free him and herself--this was the result! <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> fatal about her that must destroy the men she had to do with? She had made her father unhappy, Monsieur Harmost--Rosek, and her husband! Even before she married, how many had tried for her love, and gone away unhappy! And, getting up, she went to a mirror and looked at herself long and sadly.|$|E
6000|$|The river {{suggested}} {{fishing and}} so he dawdled upon its shores, catching fish after a fashion of his own devising and eating them raw. When night came he {{curled up in a}} great tree beside the stream--the one from which he had been fishing during the afternoon--and was soon asleep. Numa, roaring beneath him, awoke him. He was about to call out in anger to his noisy neighbor when something else caught his attention. He listened. <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> in the tree beside himself? Yes, he heard the noise of something below him trying to clamber upward. Presently he heard the click of a crocodile's jaws in the waters beneath, and then, low but distinct: [...] "By George! The beggar nearly got me." [...] The voice was familiar.|$|E

6000|$|... "B. M.," [...] Sir Henry muttered, {{looking over}} his shoulder. [...] "How very interesting! B. M.," [...] he repeated, turning to Philippa, who had recommenced her knitting. [...] "Is it my fancy, or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> a little {{familiar}} about that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|What {{problems}} {{of life are}} here presented? Which is principal: the relation of man and woman, the need of soul for great work, or the interrelation between character and achievement? Or, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> else for which the poem stands? ...|$|R
60|$|Was it her own breathing, quickened with {{a sudden}} nameless terror? or <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> outside? Her heart seemed to stop beating while she listened. Yes! it was a panting outside--a panting now increased, multiplied, redoubled, mixed {{with the sounds of}} rustling, tearing, craunching, and {{occasionally}} a quick, impatient snarl. She crept {{on her hands and knees}} to the opening and looked out. At first the ground seemed to be undulating between her and the opposite tree. But a second glance showed her the black and gray, bristling, tossing backs of tumbling beasts of prey, charging the carcass of the bear that lay at its roots, or contesting for the prize with gluttonous choked breath, sidelong snarls, arched spines, and recurved tails. One of the boldest had leaped upon a buttressing root of her tree within a foot of the opening.|$|E
60|$|We {{have often}} blamed {{him for a}} habit of {{wire-drawing}} and over-refining; from of old we have been familiar with his tendency to Mysticism and Religiosity, whereby in everything he was still scenting out Religion: but never perhaps did these amaurosis-suffusions so cloud and distort his otherwise most piercing vision, as in this of the Dandiacal Body! Or <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> of intended satire; is the Professor and Seer not quite the blinkard he affects to be? Of an ordinary mortal we should have decisively answered in the affirmative; but with a Teufelsdrockh there ever hovers some shade of doubt. In the mean while, if satire were actually intended, the case is little better. There are not wanting men who will answer: Does your Professor take us for simpletons? His irony has overshot itself; we see through it, and perhaps through him.|$|E
60|$|Her path wound {{through a}} thicket {{fragrant}} with syringa and southernwood; the faint perfume was reminiscent of Atlantic hillsides, where, long ago, a girl teacher, {{she had walked}} with the girl pupils of the Vermont academy, and kept them from the shy advances of the local swains. She smiled--a little sadly--as the thought {{occurred to her that}} after this interval of years it was again her business to restrain the callow affections. Should she never have the matchmaking instincts of her sex; never become the trusted confidante of youthful passion? Young Calton had not confessed his passion to HER, nor had Frida revealed her secret. Only the elder brother had appealed to her hard, practical common sense against such sentiment. <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> in her manner that forbade it? She wondered if it was some uneasy consciousness of this quality which had impelled her to snub the elder Calton, and rebelled against it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I know. And yet--and yet--Maurice <b>is</b> right. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> else, <b>something</b> <b>there,</b> {{which you}} never knew <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> and which you can't express.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{question}} [...] "Why <b>is</b> <b>there</b> {{anything at}} all?", or, [...] "Why <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>something</b> rather than nothing?" [...] {{has been raised}} or commented on by philosophers including Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Martin Heidegger − who called it the fundamental question of metaphysics − and Ludwig Wittgenstein.|$|R
