Multipath mitigation is, thus, an important issue. The proposed channel parameter estimator performs multipath mitigation in two ways: First, the maximum-likelihood estimator is able to take all relevant multipath components into account {{in order to minimize}} the modeling error. Second, soft information can be obtained for the parameter estimates. Soft information corresponds to the variance of an estimate and is a measure of reliability.

The first <b>weighted</b> <b>position</b> technique simply weights the 96 -h, 108 -h, and 120 -h dynamical model positions inversely to their distances from the 60 -h, 66 -h, and 72 -h consensus positions. The second weighted consensus technique {{uses the same}} weighting factors but {{is applied to the}} forecast motion vectors to assess 96 h â 120 h track errors. The <b>weighted</b> <b>position</b> consensus yields modest reductions in error relative to an unweighted position consensus at 96 h â 120 h and produces smoother track forecasts. <b>Weighted</b> <b>position</b> consensus errors are reduced when the COAMPS model and the Air Force Weather Agency MM 5 model are removed from the unweighted consensus used to form the weighting factors.

40|$|The use of {{differential}} GPS {{is becoming increasingly}} popular for real-time navigation systems. As these systems migrate to safety-of-life applications (e. g. precision approach and landing), their integrity becomes more important than their accuracy.

This method uses a priori information to weight certain satellites (e. g. those at higher elevation) over other satellites. The accuracy increases because we better use the information available.

30|$|In this paper, {{a channel}} {{parameter}} estimator {{based on the}} maximum-likelihood approach is proposed for joint communication and positioning. The parameters of the physical channel (e.g., TOA) and the equivalent discrete-time channel model are estimated jointly. In order to mitigate multipath propagation effects and to improve the positioning accuracy, soft information concerning the parameter estimates is used. Two different methods to obtain soft information are proposed: The linearization and the likelihood method. The accuracy of the methods depends on the nonlinearity of the parameter estimation problem, which is evaluated by the curvature measures of Bates and Watts. It is shown that the likelihood method is always accurate for the parameter estimation problem. The linearization method is only accurate in a single-path channel or at high SNR for a multipath channel. Nevertheless, Monte Carlo simulations for a two-dimensional positioning problem show that this has only very little influence on the positioning. The positioning algorithms that exploit the soft information obtained by the linearization and the likelihood method perform equally well. For severe multipath propagation, the RMSEs for the <b>weighted</b> <b>positioning</b> algorithms are closer to the CRLB than the RMSE of positioning without weighting. A gain of approximately 7 - 10 dB can be achieved. Hence, multipath propagation effects can be mitigated significantly, even for one-shot estimation without oversampling. Based on these results, it is suggested to apply the linearization method because of its lower computational complexity.|$|R
