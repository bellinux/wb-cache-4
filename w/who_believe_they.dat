25|$|During the 1980s and 1990s in Norway, {{there was}} {{considerable}} and intense public debate {{on the use of}} dental amalgam. The Norwegian Dental Patients Association (Forbundet Tenner og Helse), made up of people <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> suffered health effects from amalgam fillings, was a driving force in this debate. During this time, the media often featured interviews with people claiming that their health problems were caused by amalgam fillings, and who have regained their health after replacing their amalgam fillings with a different material. Some scientific studies also reported that patients have been restored to health after having had their amalgam fillings replaced. However, these studies were heavily disputed at the time and the Norwegian Board of Health still maintain there is no scientifically proven connection between dental amalgam and health problems.|$|E

25|$|Adherents of {{different}} religions generally disagree {{as to how}} to best worship God and what is God's plan for mankind, if there is one. There are different approaches to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic religions. One view is taken by exclusivists, <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> are the chosen people or have exclusive access to absolute truth, generally through revelation or encounter with the Divine, which adherents of other religions do not. Another view is religious pluralism. A pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one, but does not deny the partial truth of other religions. An example of a pluralist view in Christianity is supersessionism, i.e., the belief that one's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions. A third approach is relativistic inclusivism, where everybody is seen as equally right; an example being universalism: the doctrine that salvation is eventually available for everyone. A fourth approach is syncretism, mixing different elements from different religions. An example of syncretism is the New Age movement.|$|E
25|$|The Antambahoaka {{share their}} origins with the Antaimoro people, <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> are the descendents of an Arab named Raminia who {{migrated}} from Mecca to Madagascar between the 10th and 12th centuries. Oral tradition offers two explanations for Raminia's emigration. It is commonly {{said that he}} left to escape an increasingly rigid application of Islamic law; others attribute the departure to his search for fertile land to cultivate. The Antambahoaka split off from the Antaimoro {{in the fifteenth century}} when an Antaimoro named Ravalarivo established a new community called Masindrano that later grew to become the town of Mananjary; the neighborhood of Masindrano exists to the present day. Among some Antambahoaka it is said that Ravalarivo came to be called Ratiambahoaka (beloved by his people), and the community he founded derived its name from a deformation of this title - Antambahoaka. Very little is known about their history from the 16th to the 18th centuries.|$|E
25|$|The Rainbow Sash Movement covers two {{separate}} organizations created by and advanced by practicing LGBT Catholics <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> {{should be able}} to receive Holy Communion. It has been most active in the United States, England, and Australia. The Rainbow Sash itself is a strip of a rainbow colored fabric which is worn over the left shoulder and is put on {{at the beginning of the}} Liturgy. The members go up to receive Eucharist. If denied, they go back to pews and remain standing, but if the Eucharist is received then they go back to the pew and kneel in the traditional way. Cardinal Francis Arinze, Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, said that members of the Rainbow Sash Movement disqualified themselves from Communion by making reception of it a display of opposition to the Church's teaching, while Archbishop Harry Joseph Flynn, when head of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, said that the decision to take Communion lay with individual Catholics as to their state of grace and freedom from mortal sin, but that receiving Communion should not be used as a protest. The movement in Illinois also planned to hold in a cathedral prayer for legalization of same-sex marriage, an initiative that Bishop Paprocki of Springfield called blasphemous.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Gosling co-starred in the {{psychological}} thriller Murder by Numbers with Sandra Bullock and Michael Pitt, where Gosling and Pitt portrayed {{a pair of}} high school seniors <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> can commit the perfect murder. Bullock played the detective tasked with investigating the crime. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly described him as [...] "a phenomenal talent even in junk like this" [...] while Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the [...] "strong and [...] "charismatic" [...] young actors were [...] "let down by the screenplay". The film was a minor commercial success, grossing $56 million worldwide from a production budget of $50 million. His second screen appearance of 2002 was in The Slaughter Rule with David Morse which explores the relationship between a high school football player and his troubled coach in rural Montana. Gosling has said that the opportunity to work with Morse made him [...] "a better actor". Stephen Holden of The New York Times described Gosling as [...] "major star material" [...] with a [...] "rawness and an intensity that recall the young Matt Dillon" [...] while Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times was won over by his [...] "raw talent". The film was released in just three US theatres and grossed $13,411. In 2003, Gosling starred in The United States of Leland as a teenager imprisoned for the murder of a disabled boy. He was drawn to the role because it was unusual to find a character that was [...] "emotionally disconnected for the whole film." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the [...] "gifted actor does everything that can be done with Leland, but the character comes from a writer's conceits, not from life." [...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times noted that he [...] "struggles to rescue Leland from the clutches of cliché" [...] while David Rooney of Variety felt that his [...] "one-note, blankly disturbed act has none of the magnetic edge of his breakthrough work in The Believer". The film grossed $343,847 in the United States and was not released overseas.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to learn of Black adopted children's {{adoption}} adjustment by investigating their beliefs about adoption, spirituality, family support, and their attributions in relation to their beliefs about adoption satisfaction.

Suggestions are to provide children with opportunities to support their spirituality and involvement with mentors from the time they enter foster care to post-adoption.
