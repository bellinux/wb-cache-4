Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Satanic Majesties had been recorded in difficult circumstances while Jagger, Richards and Jones were dealing with their court cases. The band parted ways with Oldham during the sessions. The split was amicable, at least publicly, but in 2003 Jagger said: [...] "The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren't concentrating and that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> childish. It was not a great moment really – and I {{would have thought it}} wasn't a great moment for Andrew either. There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point, that was Andrew's job." ...|$|E

It was directed by Marcos Siega, who is most notable for his work with Blink-182 and Papa Roach. In an interview with MTV, Wade talked about the idea behind the music video and said, [...] "This is the closest we'll probably ever come to being in a Tim Burton fantasy world. It was done in a real 'Jack and the Beanstalk' style. And Marcos used some camera tricks that make it look amazing.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of the war, No.82 Squadron was {{selected}} to join the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan. It re-equipped with North American P-51D Mustang fighters between 12September and 11January 1946, losing two aircraft to accidents in the process. The squadron deployed to Bofu, a former kamikaze base, during 13–18March 1946, once again as part of No.81 Wing with Nos.76 and 77 Squadrons; Nos.381 and 481 Squadrons provided logistics and maintenance support, respectively. No.82 Squadron lost three of its twenty-eight Mustangs, along with an escorting deHavilland Mosquito, in bad weather en route to Bofu, killing all crew members. From April 1946, the squadron conducted surveillance patrols over Japan as well as participating in routine exercises and flypasts. The Australians found that, far from offering resistance, the Japanese went out of their way to be accommodating. No.82 Squadron's [...] commanding officer, Squadron Leader Graham Falconer, remarked following a dinner with Bofu's mayor, [...] "I felt that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> treated more as visitors than as an occupying force!" ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly before 16:00, Hipper's force {{encountered}} the six ships of Vice Admiral Beatty's 1st and 2nd battlecruiser squadrons. The German ships {{were the first}} to open fire, at a range of approximately 15,000 yards (14,000m). When the British ships began returning fire, confusion amongst the British battlecruisers resulted in Moltke being engaged by both New Zealand and Tiger. The British rangefinders had misread the range to their German targets, and so the first salvos fired by the British ships fell a mile past the German battlecruisers. Due to errors in British communication, Derfflinger was unengaged during the first 10 minutes of the battle. Derfflingers gunnery officer, Korvettenkapitän Georg von Hase later remarked [...] "By some mistake <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> left out. I laughed grimly and now I began to engage our enemy with complete calm, as at gun practice, and with continually increasing accuracy." [...] At 17:03, the British battlecruiser [...] exploded after 15 minutes of gunfire from Von der Tann. Shortly thereafter the second half of Beatty's force, the four s of the 5th Battle Squadron, came into range and began firing at Von der Tann and Moltke.|$|E
500|$|Protesters {{demonstrated}} {{their opposition to}} the road's construction by blocking the path of construction equipment, but generally not involving themselves in physical altercations. They were met by security officers from Group 4. In December 1992, in view of a film crew from The Observer, a protester was assaulted by five officers. Another protester, {{according to a report by}} local MP John Denham, was strangled by officers and left unconscious on top of the Down for 30 minutes. Maggie Lambert, then a mature photography student, took numerous photographs of the protest, and challenged an injunction which suggested she had been involved with direct action. While Lord Justice Mann admitted there was no evidence to suggest she had done anything more than take photographs, the injunction was upheld. Protester Rebecca Lush Blum, who had stayed on the down from September to the night of eviction, later claimed [...] "It was a horrific experience and very violent. We were dragged through thorns and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> kicked and punched and someone pulled out a clump of my hair." [...] In March 1993, Kenneth Carlisle, then Minister for Roads and Traffic, refused to order an inquiry into any wrongdoing or excessive force by security officers, stating it was a matter for the police.|$|E
5000|$|Kaigama also openly {{condemned}} the disproportionate focus on contraception in foreign aid programs. In 2014, Kaigama said: “In the first place, children die in infant mortality, in inter-tribal wars and diseases, but yet {{you come to}} say ‘decrease your population and {{we will give you}} economic help.’ We want food, we want education, we want good roads, healthcare. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> given the wrong things and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> asked to accept, simply because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> poor.” ...|$|R

500|$|Secrets reveal {{themselves}} steadily {{throughout the}} episode. Xander fears that his future marriage will turn {{him into an}} argumentative drunk like his father. He attempts to avoid his fears through the song [...] "I'll Never Tell", singing [...] "'coz there's nothing to tell", after summoning Sweet to Sunnydale to show him that he and Anya will be happy. Amid the various annoyances Xander and Anya express through this song, some verses are clear-sighted observations of behavior, such as Anya's accusation that Xander—once in love with Buffy—uses Buffy as a mother figure to hide behind. Anya also avoids the truth by burying herself in wedding plans without thinking critically about what being married will entail; instead she considers Xander an accessory to her desired lifestyle. Of all the characters, Anya is the most preoccupied with the style of singing and songs, demanding to know if Spike sang [...] "a breakaway pop hit, or a book number", and asking Dawn if the pterodactyl she facetiously says {{she gave birth to}} also broke into song. Anya and Xander's duet is the only song in the episode to address the audience directly. During the long single-shot scene when she and Xander talk over each other insisting to Giles that evil must be at play, Anya refers to the audience, saying [...] "It was like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> watched... Like there was a wall missing ... in our apartment... Like there were only three walls and not a fourth wall." [...] Albright asserts that Anya's constant preoccupation with her and others' performances indicates that she has serious doubts about her future supporting role as Xander's wife.|$|E

Unknown men also trailed the team, one even appearing at journalist John Sweeney's wedding. Sweeney later complained of being [...] "chased round the streets of Los Angeles by sinister strangers [...] In LA, the moment our hire car left the airport we realised <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> followed by two cars.

2500|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parent's realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say they're going to be back at midnight and they don't come back, you immediately think they're dead and you start to worry. If they'd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't think she would have been the same person again." ...|$|E

To avoid the incoming fire, I repeatedly swam under water." [...] Del Sandusky, the helmsman on Kerry's boat, PCF-94, stated, [...] "I saw the gun flashes in the jungle, and I saw the bullets skipping across the water." [...] Wayne Langhofer, who manned the machine gun on Don Droz's PCF-43, stated, [...] "There {{was a lot of}} firing going on, and it came {{from both sides of the}} river." [...] Michael Medeiros, aboard PCF-94, recalled [...] "a massive ambush. There were rockets and light machine gun fire plus small arms."

[...] Harry Ashmore, editor of the Arkansas Gazette newspaper, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing [...] "for the forcefulness, dispassionate analysis and clarity of his editorials on the school integration conflict in Little Rock", said that no one, whatever their beliefs on school integration, could feel anything but admiration for the way the Arkansas Guardsmen went calmly about their duties, steering clear of partisan pressure. [...] Superintendent of Little Rock Schools, Virgil Blossom, was also quoted as saying, [...] "I have nothing but praise for the Guardsmen and the manner in which they performed a trying job under difficult circumstances." [...] They were not, however, applauded by at least one member of the Little Rock Nine.

Clinger of the Arkansas National Guard after the guardsmen [...] "stood by, socializing and flirting, while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> beaten within an inch of our lives." [...] According to Beals, Clinger did not deny the charges, but merely explained that his men had to live in the community. [...] She further described the eighteen guardsmen selected as bodyguards after this meeting as the [...] "biggest, dumbest, most disheveled hayseeds I'd ever seen."Others recall the inside-the-school guardsmen as neat with starched and pressed khakis, and dispute the allegation of beatings.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the album}} {{ready to be}} mixed, Yello decided to try the new digital mixing process instead of the {{standard}} analogue process, and in August 1984 they visited Hartmann Digital Studio in Nuremberg where engineer Tom Thiel began mixing the album. However, Yello abruptly cancelled the sessions after just ten days, unhappy {{with the sound of}} the album. Meier explained that the duo felt that the songs were losing their soul, saying, [...] "Getting technically more experienced was leading us onto a slick perfectionist track. We even went to a German digital studio to do the most perfect remixes on a digital machine with the SSL Desk and the rest of it. And we had to learn, a difficult process for us, that perfection is just a way to escape from having nothing to say... With Stella <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> dragged down by an excess of perfection." [...] Blank later said, [...] "All the balances were wrong and the dynamic was lost, so I did lots of remixes again in Zurich to save this album". The group returned to their studios in Zurich and Blank started the process of remixing the tracks himself, with the exception of [...] "Desert Inn" [...] which he felt was acceptable as it was, [...] "Blue Nabou" [...] which the duo had already decided would not appear on the album and hence there was no urgency to improve it, and [...] "Angel No" [...] because Blank did not have time to mix it to the standard that he wanted. With the delay in mixing, the album's provisional release date of 1 October 1984 could not be met, and in order to avoid being lost among the Christmas releases, a new release date in January 1985 was set.|$|E
