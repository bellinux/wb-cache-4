40|$|This project {{presented}} about {{a failure}} of drive shaft in conventional passenger vehicles. Perodua Kancil front <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> {{was chosen as the}} specimen of this analysis. This project deals with analysis on stress using finite element method. The solid model of the drive shaft need to be constructs using SOLIDWORK software. The type of material used in the drive shaft need to be known first before stress analysis can be performed using Patran-Nastran software. The known material will provide the information such as density, modulus of elasticity and tensile strength required for the software to perform the stress and failure analysis. Spectroscopic analysis is carried out using FOUNDRY-MASTER UV instrument. The load applied at the ends of the shaft that are lateral bending load of 1 / 4 of weight of the full car. Boundary conditions are applied at the bearing and geared location. The highest stress at and displacement was predicted occurred at the fillet cross section location. Stresses will concentrate in the smaller diameter portion due to change in shaft diameter as they pass from large to the small diameter. In any case, one must determine the cause of failure and predict the fatigue life to prevent future occurrence and to improve the performance of the device, component or structure...|$|E

50|$|A shaft-driven bicycle is {{a bicycle}} {{that uses a}} <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> instead of a chain to {{transmit}} power from the pedals to the <b>wheel.</b> <b>Shaft</b> <b>drives</b> were introduced over a century ago, but were mostly supplanted by chain-driven bicycles due to the gear ranges possible with sprockets and derailleurs.

50|$|Pushing {{the clutch}} pedal {{disengages}} the engine from the powertrain like <b>wheels,</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> and gearbox. Releasing the accelerator makes the engine slowing down to idle. Turning of the ignition takes further affects. Pulling the key causes locking the steering wheel. Some vehicles drop head- or stoplights when ignition is turned off. After {{the engine is}} stopped, applying the brake longer time or give a few pushes to the brake releases the reserve of the vacuum servo, causing a lost of the brake support. A belt driven power steering fails immediately. Real hybrid vehicles have electric driven support of power steering and brake. Bigger engines and engines with higher compression ratio can cause damage to components of the powertrain at a rough start over clutch from gliding vehicles kinetic power or trailing drag. Using a higher gear decreases the torque force on the powertrain. By turning off the ignition the engine control unit (ECU) needs to detect the engine shafts position. Some ECUs need several rotations of the camshaft to detect ignition an injection timing points. Starting the engine in coldstart takes temporary more fuel until operation temperature of the engine is detected by the ECU.|$|R
5000|$|In British English, {{the term}} [...] "drive shaft" [...] is {{restricted}} to a transverse shaft that transmits power to the wheels, especially the front <b>wheels.</b> A <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> connecting the gearbox to a rear differential is called a propeller shaft, or prop-shaft. A prop-shaft assembly consists of a propeller shaft, a slip joint and one or more universal joints. Where the engine and axles are separated from each other, as on four-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive vehicles, it is the propeller shaft that serves to transmit the drive force generated by the engine to the axles.|$|R
50|$|Cyclic {{stress is}} the {{distribution}} of forces (aka stresses) that change over time in a repetitive fashion. As an example, consider {{one of the large}} <b>wheels</b> used to <b>drive</b> an aerial lift such as a ski lift. The wire cable wrapped around the wheel exerts a downward force on the <b>wheel</b> and the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> supporting the <b>wheel.</b> Although the shaft, wheel, and cable move, the force remains nearly vertical relative to the ground. Thus a point {{on the surface of the}} <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> will undergo tension when it is pointing towards the ground and compression when it is pointing to the sky.|$|R

If the front wheels slip, the viscous coupling progressively releases torque to the rear wheels. Additionally, the ControlTrac II system provided a mechanical lock of four-wheel drive though there was no low range provided by the system.|$|R
40|$|To gain a more {{fundamental}} understanding of the frictional properties of skin, various parameters (hydration, oils, surfactants, etc) affecting skin friction were evaluated using a rotational friction technique. The rotational device utilized a motor-driven wheel. The <b>wheel</b> and <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> were connected to the motor through a flexible rubber coupling {{in such a way}} that friction encountered by the wheel caused a lateral displacement of the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> which was monitored by a photocell and recorded on a strip-chart recorder. Our observations suggest that separate frictional events occur when materials are applied to the skin surface. Thus, the increase in friction observed upon wetting the skin involves two distinct phenomena—one is related to the surface tension of the aqueous phase, while the other, closely associated with hydration, is a consequence of physicochemical adhesion of the skin to the rotational friction probe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is a {{mechanical}} part of transmission system {{which is used}} to transfer the power from engine to the wheel.

However, wisdom gained from early experience with sidewheelers deemed that they be operated with clutches out, or as solid shaft vessels. Crews noticed that as ships approached the dock, passengers moved {{to the side of}} the ship ready to disembark. The shift in weight, added to independent movements of the paddles, could lead to imbalance and potential capsizing. Paddle tugs were frequently operated with clutches in, as the lack of passengers aboard meant that independent paddle movement could be used safely and the added maneuverability exploited to the full.|$|R
