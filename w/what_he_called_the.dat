5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, {{he announced that}} he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and Environmental Cabinet. The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The plan called for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the plan called for an exploration of the use of nuclear power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{elements}} that Winnicott considered could be lost in childhood was <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> sense of being for him, a primary element, of which a sense of doing is only a derivative.

Ulrich Hoerni, Jung's grandson who manages the Jung archives, decided to publish it to raise the additional funds needed when the Philemon Foundation was founded.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{first set}} its sights on {{moving from a}} resource-based economy to one based on knowledge in its 20-year development plan, Vision 2025, adopted in 2005. This transition became a priority after international sanctions were progressively hardened from 2006 onwards and the oil embargo tightened its grip. In February 2014, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei introduced <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> ‘economy of resistance’, an economic plan advocating innovation and a lesser dependence on imports that reasserted key provisions of Vision 2025.|$|E
25|$|Noten's work The Pistol Saints (2003) {{is part of}} the Design Against Crime project. Whenever Noten {{asked people}} why they carried a gun they said it made them feel more secure, {{although}} most of them never actually used their gun. This inspired him to copy <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> soul of the gun in pieces of jewellery the owner could wear instead of the gun. The Pistol Saints consists of twelve golden brooches with imprints of a gun. On the brooches the gun markings can be clearly distinguished.|$|E

After returning to Japan, he entered Rissho University {{with the objective of}} becoming a monk. At the same time, he became a member of an ultra-nationalist group, Kinno Makotomusubi. With independent funds, he built <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Isshinryo in the Meguro District of Tokyo. At this location he discussed with his friends the news of Japanese reverses in the war. He suggested that the military cabinet be overthrown. Eventually, they tried to obtain weapons for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|He was {{a leading}} member of the Frankfurt School of {{critical}} theory, whose work {{has come to be}} associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the works of Freud, Marx, and Hegel were essential to a critique of modern society. He is widely {{regarded as one of the}} 20th century's foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists. As a critic of both fascism and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> culture industry, his writings—such as Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), Minima Moralia (1951) and Negative Dialectics (1966)—strongly influenced the European New Left.|$|E
25|$|Edward Kemp's {{plan was}} for a formal garden {{containing}} a conservatory and plant houses {{to the north of}} the house. Beyond these were a garden yard, a stable yard, a coach house and a farm yard. To the west of these was a substantial kitchen garden. The other outbuildings included a vinery, with a heated wall, and a smoke house for curing bacon and ham. Joseph Stubs was a collector of rare plants and many of these were planted in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> American Garden. In the days of the Wright family a head gardener and seven full-time gardeners were employed and also during this time more outbuildings were constructed beyond the coach house.|$|E
