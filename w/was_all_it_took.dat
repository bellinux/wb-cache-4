2500|$|The {{coaching}} {{began to}} be criticized after a pair of midseason losses to the Minnesota Vikings and Denver Broncos. Denver players stated that shutting down Jimmie Giles <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> to stop the Buccaneer offense, while the defense was still vulnerable to a short-yardage, ball-control attack. McKay felt that the team had become an [...] "aerial circus" [...] and that Williams' performance was being affected by trying to do too much, and so {{made a decision to}} establish a running game, taking over playcalling responsibilities on running plays. Having lost 4 of their last 5 games, there was concern that, about to face a Green Bay Packers team on a three-game win streak, the Buccaneers were about to repeat the late-season slides of the last three seasons. After breaking their two-game losing streak by routing the Packers, the Buccaneers demonstrated a newfound ability to continue to stick to and execute their game plan when playing with a deficit. Quarterbacks coach Bill Nelsen correctly predicted that the Buccaneers' performance against the Packers would cause the Vikings to underestimate the Packers, and thus lose their matchup the following week. Nelsen admonished the team not to miss a chance to take charge of the division, and they responded with an uncharacteristic rebound from a 14-point deficit against the Saints. A Week 14 last-minute victory over the Atlanta Falcons, combined with upset losses by the Lions and Vikings the same day, left the Buccaneers needing to win only one of their last two games to make the playoffs. They were one of only five teams in Week 15 who were capable of winning a division championship without help from another team. The season ended with a matchup against the Detroit Lions in front of a Pontiac Silverdome-record crowd of 80,444, with the Buccaneers and Lions tied for the division lead at 8–7. A season-ending New York Giants win against the Dallas Cowboys left the Giants at 9–7, guaranteeing that the winner of the Buccaneers-Lions game would win the division (the Packers were still in contention, but required an improbable set of circumstances that included a Buccaneers-Lions tie), while the loser would miss the playoffs entirely. Although the Lions outplayed the Buccaneers in most statistical categories, numerous Buccaneers stepped forward with key plays at crucial moments in the game, resulting in an upset victory. A crowd of over 8,000 gathered at team headquarters to greet them on their return from Detroit. The Buccaneers traveled to Dallas for a matchup with the Cowboys, where they suffered an embarrassing 38–0 shutout.|$|E

Even through the painful 1940's Nebraska had still managed to win eight of ten Kansas State games in that decade, and ten in a row against the Wildcats overall, before this completely demoralizing defeat.

50|$|To Althea from prison, {{written by}} Richard Lovelace in 1642, {{was a result}} of Lovelace’s imprisonment. According to luminarium.org, that year, Richard Lovelace {{presented}} a petition to the British parliament that protested the Bishops Exclusion Bill. The bill prevented those heavily involved with the Churches of England to enact any temporal control. Lovelace on the other hand protested that the role of Anglican Bishops that were excluded be restored in Parliament. In the poem, Richard Lovelace continues his desire to protest by undermining the “justice system” of England. Lovelace touts that obeying the King and following England’s orders does not make him free. Similarly, Lovelace states that being in a jail does not mean he is imprisoned. Freedom and imprisonment stem from the body and soul. Lovelace’s writing is both significant and brave because he lived in a time where freedom of speech was far from guaranteed. A simple petition <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> to lead to his imprisonment.|$|E
50|$|Bailey had {{his first}} taste of {{professional}} hockey {{at the age of}} 16 when he played 22 games with the Windsor Hettche Spitfires of the International Hockey League. He performed well, but many on the coaching staff felt he needed more time develop. He continued his play with the Stratford Kroehlers and didn't return to the IHL until the 1951-52 season, when he played in the final two games of the season for the Toledo Mercurys. However that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>took.</b> The Detroit Red Wings owned the rights to Bailey and decided to trade him to the Cleveland Barons along with his brother, John Bailey for the rights to Lou Jankowski and Bill Dineen in June 1951. In the American Hockey League Bailey flourished, playing in 54 games, amassing 46 points and a team-high 115 penalty minutes. That's all it took, as the Toronto Maple Leafs had had their eye on young Bailey and wanted to see what he could do. On May 30, 1953, Toronto traded Chuck Blair and 30,000 USD to Cleveland for Bailey and Gerry Foley.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Christopher Brady and Steven Birch became friends through mutual {{connections}} in the burgeoning northwest music scene. Both were in the first Portland, Oregon bands to sign to Seattle rock heavyweight Sub Pop Records (Brady with Pond and Birch with Sprinkler). Playing numerous shows together throughout the Northwest United States, they quickly became a two-man mutual admiration society. After Sprinkler broke up in early 1994, they didn't see each other all that often, but Birch remained a huge Pond fan. Fast-forward to fall 1998: After a brilliant third record (Rock Collection) on a very confused label, Brady and the Pond boys decided {{to call it a}} day. At the same time, Birch had reached complete burnout from a grueling year of non-stop touring with Everclear. The two had long talked about playing music together, but it was only now that the time seemed right. Initial rehearsals included Pond's David Triebwasser on drums. When Triebwasser decided to move away from Portland, a mutual friend introduced Brady and Birch to drummer Paul Johnson. Johnson, a music major in college, had played in numerous bands, but was looking for something bigger, better, and more challenging—one rehearsal <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> to know that his dynamic playing would be a perfect fit.|$|E

The actress called the storyline [...] "very important" [...] and commented that children have to know that that kind of behaviour was not acceptable. Sursok later became frustrated with the producers after the scenes involving Dani's attack were cut. Sursok said [...] "For me as an actor the rape storyline was really good, but unfortunately they ended up cutting everything and we had to re-shoot the whole thing because it was too emotional and too intense." [...] The actress {{admitted that}} was the moment she thought the show was not realistic as the storyline went from being a rape to an attack. Sursok added that it was quite hard for her as the scenes had been some of her best and she had received lots of letters from viewers telling her she had helped them. [...] Dani later learned that her sister, Kirsty, had begun a relationship with Kane and was horrified by her betrayal. Kirsty insisted that Kane was her soulmate, while a [...] "furious" [...] Dani threatened to break them up.|$|E
5000|$|The town {{must have}} flourished with Sejanus as benefactor. But {{the town was}} {{ultimately}} hurt with the demise of Sejanus when he was {{proved to be a}} traitor. All statues and monuments were subject to [...] "damnatio" [...] along with the coinage. Most coins were of the Ass or semi variety. These were filed or stamped to erase his name from memory. Some very rare coins have his name still legible. Dr. Paul L. Maier puts forth a thought-provoking history of how Sejanus {{played a role in the}} life of Jesus in his book Pontius Pilate. It seems Sejanus was in a powerful position as co-emperor to appoint Pilate to Judaea as Tiberius was in retirement on the Island of Capri. After Sejanus' fall, his family and supporters were hunted down and eliminated for years to come. This raises the question of why Pilate, a hard and tough governor, caved in under Jewish request to hand over Jesus to be crucified. [...] "You are no friend of Caesar" [...] and that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>took.</b> Pilate knew his head was on the block, and he was recalled to Rome two years later to answer charges but Tiberius died as Pilate took the long winter route.|$|E
50|$|Believing God {{sent her}} a {{disturbing}} vision of a grandfather she never knew, Sister Sara left her convent in Kansas to journey through unfamiliar territory to get to Tennessee to offer her help. Sara, alone and naïve, asked a trucker for a ride, but once they arrived Sister Sara had no {{money to pay the}} driver for the trip. The trucker wanted to negotiate some form of payment, but he soon found out one of the Lord's flock was not a meek little lamb. Sara knocked the trucker's head through his window and ran from the truck. As fate would have it, Johnny Blaze {{was on his way to}} Tennessee too. First he was unwilling to help, but an angry and injured truck driver convinced Johnny to give Sister Sara a lift. The two of them wound up at the seemingly insignificant shack of Sara’s grandfather, Caretaker.Caretaker was badly wounded and dying because of an assault on his home led by Daniel Ketch - a former Ghost Rider now servant of the rogue angel, Zadkiel. Caretaker managed to defeat three of Ketch's allies, Doghead, The Orb, and Death Ninja, before the vampire known as Blackout struck the fatal blow. Ketch began to destroy the contents of Caretaker's home as Blackout confronted Blaze. Caretaker, in the meantime, told Sara she was about to enter a life that he never meant for her to have. She desperately wanted to get him to a hospital, but Caretaker knew his time on Earth was done, so he urged her to get to the tunnels under his house and save what she could before Danny destroyed it all. Distraught over losing the family she never knew she had, Sara did as she was told and found a library of books within the tunnels. One touch <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>took,</b> and the knowledge contained within the books flooded Sara's mind. She became the new Caretaker, librarian and guardian to everything dealing with the Spirits of Vengeance.|$|E
50|$|Another, unusual variant {{was found}} in the Ortgies {{semi-automatic}} pistols. To disengage the safety, a user would squeeze a lever until flush with the rear of the grip. The lever then would latch in the disengaged position until the user released it again by pressing a button under the slide, whereupon tension from the striker spring would push it back to the engaged position. Thus, engaging the safety also relieved some tension in the striker spring. As the Ortgies is a pocket pistol meant for personal defense, this feature eliminates the problem of failing to disengage the safety when one needs to shoot. Gripping the pistol tightly <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to disengage the safety.|$|R

In December 1994, The Washington Post noted that [...] "listening to the opening (and title) track {{for a few seconds}} <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to confirm that this sessions atmosphere and pacing {{has more to do with}} Percy Mayfields laconic balladry, than Big Joe Turners barroom barking".
