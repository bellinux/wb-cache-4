How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable?

In a five-year period the provincial government had provided roughly $1.3 million in grant money for things like research, seafood marketing and fisheries technology programs. Minister King cited the union's criticism of the provincial government {{as the reason for}} the move, stating 'No matter <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> this province, the FFAW are more concerned with their own self-interest than they are with the interests of the industry.' ...|$|E

500|$|On March 7, 1970, Nixon {{announced}} {{the end of}} the Kennedy-Johnson era's massive efforts in the space race, stating [...] "We must think of [...] as part of a continuing process [...] and not as a series of separate leaps, each requiring a massive concentration of energy. [...] We must also realize that space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> space from here on in must become a normal and regular part of our national life and must therefore be planned in conjunction with all of the other undertakings which are also important to us."

500|$|A real-life {{journalist}} named Reid, who Gray {{interviewed for}} his book, states that [...] "Girly Edition" [...] mirrors well how some journalists actually work.

2500|$|... "Virtual communities" [...] {{are being}} {{established}} online and transcend geographical boundaries, eliminating social restrictions. Howard Rheingold (2000) describes these globalised societies as self-defined networks, which resemble <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> real life. [...] "People in virtual communities use words on screens to exchange pleasantries and argue, engage in intellectual discourse, conduct commerce, make plans, brainstorm, gossip, feud, fall in love, create {{a little high}} art {{and a lot of}} idle talk" [...] (Rheingold cited in Slevin 2000: 91). For Sherry Turkle [...] "making the computer into a second self, finding a soul in the machine, can substitute for human relationships" [...] (Holmes 2005: 184).

60|$|To hedge round a grave with respect, {{what choice}} is there, between the relinquished wealth and honors of the world, {{and the story}} of such a woman's unrewarded devotion!

What we have said will speak to some hearts. There are those who will be glad to know how the lamp, whose light of poetry has beamed on their far-away recognition, was watched over with care and pain, that they may send to her, who is more darkened than they by its extinction, some token of their sympathy. She is {{destitute}} and alone. If any, far or near, will send to us what may aid and cheer her through the remainder of her life, we will joyfully place it in her hands.|$|E
60|$|How to do something, {{and still}} not do too much, is the desideratum. Let each {{contribute}} his mite {{in the way of}} suggestion. The late Silas Wright, {{in a letter to the}} Chicago convention, contributed his, which was worth something; and I now contribute mine, which may be worth nothing. At all events, it will mislead nobody, and therefore will do no harm. I would not borrow money. I am against an overwhelming, crushing system. Suppose that, at each session, Congress shall first determine how much money can, for that year, be spared for improvements; then apportion that sum to the most important objects. So far all is easy; but how shall we determine which are the most important? On this question comes the collision of interests. I shall be slow to acknowledge that your harbor or your river is more important than mine, and vice versa. To clear this difficulty, let us have that same statistical information which the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Vinton] suggested at the beginning of this session. In that information we shall have a stern, unbending basis of facts--a basis in no wise subject to whim, caprice, or local interest. The prelimited amount of means will save us from doing too much, and the statistics will save us from doing <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> wrong places. Adopt and adhere to this course, and, it seems to me, the difficulty is cleared.|$|E

"Just so," [...] resumed Brace, {{when they}} had recovered, [...] "that is exactly <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the mizzen-top o' the Victory when we made out the signal, only we stuck a cheer on to the end o' the laugh.

The effect of that signal was just treemendious, I tell you.|$|R
60|$|Again:--and, my good women, {{you must}} not think me hard on you, for you know in your hearts that I am not hard on you; but I must speak a word on a sin which I am afraid is growing in this parish, and in too many parishes in England; and that is deceiving kind and {{charitable}} persons, {{in order to get}} more help from them. God knows the temptation must be sore to poor people at times. And yet you will surely find in the long run, that 'honesty is the best policy.' Deceit is always a losing game. A lie is sure to be found out; as the Lord Jesus Himself says, 'There is nothing hid which shall not be made manifest;' and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> secret, is sure, unless we repent and amend it, to be proclaimed on the housetop: and many a poor soul, in her haste and greediness to get much, ends by getting nothing at all. And if it were not so;--if you were able to deceive any human being out of the riches of the world: yet know, that a man's life does not consist in the abundance of the things which he possesses. And know that if you will not believe that,--if you will fancy that your business is to get all you can for your mortal bodies, by fair means or foul,--if you will fancy that you are thus debtors to your own flesh, you will surely die: but if you, through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.|$|E
60|$|Let me {{tell you}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the {{biological}} laboratory which is lodged in a building adjacent to this. There I lecture to a class of students daily for about four-and-a-half months, and my class have, of course, their text-books; but the {{essential part of the}} whole teaching, and that which I regard as really {{the most important part of}} it, is a laboratory for practical work, which is simply a room with all the appliances needed for ordinary dissection. We have tables properly arranged in regard to light, microscopes, and dissecting instruments, and we work through the structure of a certain number of animals and plants. As, for example, among the plants, we take a yeast plant, a Protococcus, a common mould, a Chara, a fern, and some flowering plant; among animals we examine such things as an Amoeba, a Vorticella, and a fresh-water polype. We dissect a star-fish, an earth-worm, a snail, a squid, and a fresh-water mussel. We examine a lobster and a cray-fish, and a black beetle. We go on to a common skate, a cod-fish, a frog, a tortoise, a pigeon, and a rabbit, and that takes us about all the time we have to give. The purpose of this course is not to make skilled dissectors, but to give every student a clear and definite conception, by means of sense-images, of the characteristic structure of each of the leading modifications of the animal kingdom; and that is perfectly possible, by going no further than the length of that list of forms which I have enumerated. If a man knows the structure of the animals I have mentioned, he has a clear and exact, however limited, apprehension of the essential features of the organisation of all those great divisions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms to which the forms I have mentioned severally belong. And it then becomes possible for him to read with profit; because every time he meets with the name of a structure, he has a definite image in his mind of what the name means in the particular creature he is reading about, and therefore the reading is not mere reading. It is not mere repetition of words; but every term employed in the description, we will say, of a horse, or of an elephant, will call up the image of the things he had seen in the rabbit, and he is able to form a distinct conception of that which he has not seen, as a modification of that which he has seen.|$|E

30|$|<b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> {{this paper}} was {{consider}} Bitcoin more as an asset rather than a real currency.
