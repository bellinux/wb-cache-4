Two main types of Lyocell fibers were studied, standard with various processing conditions and crosslinked. Standard fibers have a skin-core structure with a more amorphous skin of 35 - 80 nm. Crosslinked fibers are resisting much more to fibrillation in the wet state. The crosslinked layer is thicker that the skin. The diameter distribution of fibrils is very wide and ranges from a few tens of nanometers to several micrometers. It depends {{on the type of}} fiber and its processing conditions.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the effects of certain {{abrasion}} procedures upon specific physical properties of a high wet modulus rayon. The type of abrasion applied included surface abrasion in dry and <b>wet</b> condition, edge <b>abrasion</b> in dry condition, and flexing abrasion in dry condition. Dry flexing abrasion was performed only in the Stoll tester but all other abrasion procedures were performed both in the Accelerator and Stoll tester. Breaking load or bursting strength, elongation, weight of fabric and microscopy were the criteria used to evaluate abrasion damage. Five null hypotheses were tested to determine whether any significant correlations existed (1) among the percentage losses in physical properties or (2) between period of abrasion and the percentage losses in physical properties as a result of abrasion; to determine whether any significant differences in the percentage losses in physical properties occurred (3) between warpwise and fillingwise abraded specimens or (4) between specimens abraded wet and dry; and to determine (5) whether each side of a specimen was evenly abraded in the Accelerotor. Analysis of data obtained was based on the regression analysis and the t-test. Damage of the fabric, yarn and fiber observed under a microscope seemed to increase with the increasing period of abrasion. The yarn and fabric tended to deteriorate continuously. Fibrillation of the fiber was observed at the end point on specimens subjected to <b>wet</b> surface <b>abrasion</b> in the Stoll tester. Correlations among the percentage losses in physical properties were positive and generally significant. The rate change in physical properties had a positive linear relationship with period of abrasion. Some abrasion procedures had significantly different effects upon certain physical properties of warpwise specimens and filling specimens. There were significantly greater percentage losses in breaking load and weight of specimens subjected to dry surface <b>abrasion</b> than to <b>wet</b> surface <b>abrasion</b> in the Accelerotor. Each side of specimens subjected to dry surface abrasion in the Accelerotor was unevenly abraded in terms of the percentage losses in breaking load and elongation, and those subjected to <b>wet</b> surface <b>abrasion</b> in the Accelerotor were unevenly abraded in terms of the percentage losses in elongation. It was concluded that different abrasion procedures affected a physical property differently, and a given procedure of abrasion affected various properties of the fabric differently...|$|R
40|$|Compressed and cement-stabilized blocks are now {{recognized}} as important walling units for building low-cost dwellings in developing countries. Although {{the durability of}} their surfaces under in-service exposure conditions in the humid tropics {{has become a major}} matter of concern, it has received little formal research. Premature deterioration - as typified by surface erosion, mass loss, pitting, cracking and crazing - is common. A weather-resistant surface is required if a block is to remain durable for its service lifetime. However, current accelerated ageing tests to predict the overall performance of blocks under conditions causing surface deterioration (<b>wetting,</b> <b>abrasion</b> and drying) are inadequate. A new method is required that can be applied to blocks immediately after curing to evaluate the likely durability of their surfaces. ne present paper explores the suitability of using the slake-durability test, originally developed for argillaccous rocks, to evaluate the durability of low-cost walling materials. During the test, surface erosion leading to mass loss of between 1 and 50 % is recorded within only 10 minutes, representing an acceleration of in-service ageing by a factor of around 1 million. The test method proved reliable, controllable and repeatable. More importantly, the ranking of materials via their performance in this test correlated well with a ranking of their durability in service based on long professional field experience in Uganda. It is concluded that the slake-durability test not only is robust, but also provides a quick predictive surface and quality test for cement-stabilized blocks and other like materials...|$|R

The single-layered antireflection (AR) coatings and the three-layered AR coatings were prepared using the hybridized thin films as building blocks. The former showed the near-perfect transmittance and reflectance, 99. 16 and 0. 42 %, respectively, {{at a single}} wavelength of 600 nm, while the average transmittance (T (ave)) and reflectance (R (ave)) from the near ultraviolet (UV) to the visible region (300 - 800 nm) were moderate; the latter demonstrated an excellent AR capability in broadband that T (ave) reaches 97. 29 %, much {{higher than that of}} the single-layered AR coating, 95. 86 %.

In this study, the tribological properties of the HVOF-sprayed coatings WC- 17 %Co, WC- 10 %Co 4 %Cr, WC- 15 % NiMoCrFeCo, Cr 3 C 2 - 25 %NiCr, (Ti,Mo) (C,N) - 37 %NiCo, NiCrSiB, and AISI 316 L and the plasma-sprayed Cr 2 O 3 coating were compared with the properties of electrolytic hard chrome and surface-hardened steel. Four different wear behavior tests were performed; the abrasive wear performance of the coatings was assessed using a dry sand/ rubber wheel test according to ASTM G- 65 and a <b>wet</b> slurry <b>abrasion</b> test according to ASTM G- 75, the sliding wear behavior was evaluated by pin-on-disk testing according to ASTM G- 99, and the erosion wear resistance was measured for three impact angles. In all tests, the HVOF-sprayed hardmetal coatings exhibited superior properties and can be recommended as a replacement for traditional surface treatments. Due to its tendency to exhibit brittle cracking, the plasma-sprayed ceramic coating Cr 2 O 3 can only be recommended for purely abrasive wear conditions. The tested HVOF-sprayed metallic coatings, NiCrSiB and AISI 316 L, did not have sufficient wear resistance compared with that of traditional surface treatment and should not be used under more demanding conditions.

40|$|Diante da retomada do crescimento do agronegÃcio do AgropÃlo do Baixo Jaguaribe, a melhoria da malha viÃria da regiÃo tornou-se imprescindÃvel. No entanto, o baixo volume de trÃfego registrado nas rodovias locais, a baixa qualidade dos materiais ocorrentes na regiÃo e os parcos recursos disponÃveis para investimentos em infra-estrutura, inviabilizam economicamente os empreendimentos rodoviÃrios. Tornou-se entÃo necessÃria a busca por soluÃÃes alternativas que reduzam os custos de implementaÃÃo e melhoria de pavimentos. Acredita-se que a adiÃÃo de emulsÃo asfÃltica aos solos ocorrentes na regiÃo, devido Ãs suas propriedades aglutinantes e impermeabilizantes, pode constituir-se em uma dessas alternativas. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a viabilidade tÃcnica da estabilizaÃÃo betuminosa de solos ocorrentes no AgropÃlo do Baixo Jaguaribe, no Estado do CearÃ, para o emprego em camadas de base de rodovias. Para tanto, foram selecionados trÃs solos da regiÃo para o estudo da estabilizaÃÃo com a adiÃÃo da emulsÃo asfÃltica de ruptura lenta (RL- 1 C). As variÃveis investigadas foram o teor de emulsÃo aplicado (2 %, 5 % e 8 %), o tempo de cura seca ao ar livre (sem cura, 7 dias e 28 dias de cura), e a forma de distribuiÃÃo da emulsÃo (distribuiÃÃo uniforme ou em gradiente decrescente com a profundidade). As misturas solo-emulsÃo foram submetidas Ã avaliaÃÃo da resistÃncia mecÃnica (por meio dos ensaios de resistÃncia Ã compressÃo simples, resistÃncia Ã traÃÃo por compressÃo diametral, Ãndice de Suporte CalifÃrnia e mÃdulo de resiliÃncia) e Ã avaliaÃÃo da resistÃncia ao desgaste e Ã abrasÃo (por meio dos ensaios adaptados Loaded Wheel Test â LWT e <b>Wet</b> Track <b>Abrasion</b> Test â WTAT). Foi observado que a estabilizaÃÃo betuminosa promoveu incrementos de resistÃncia das amostras de solos estudadas, sendo essa resistÃncia dependente da umidade {{residual}} dos corpos de prova no momento da realizaÃÃo do ensaio. Os resultados indicaram tambÃm que a adiÃÃo de emulsÃo asfÃltica tem efeitos distintos para os vÃrios tipos de solos, sendo que a quantidade de sÃlica presente nas amostras parece influenciar a qualidade das misturas solo-emulsÃo. Conclui-se, Ã luz dos ensaios realizados, que algumas amostras de solos ocorrentes na RegiÃo do Baixo Jaguaribe podem ser satisfatoriamente estabilizadas com emulsÃo asfÃltica. Taking {{into account}} that the agribusiness of Baixo Jaguaribeâs Agricultural Pole is developing again, {{it is essential to}} improve the road network of the area. However, the low traffic volume observed in the local highways, the low quality of the materials in the area and the limited available resources to invest on infrastructure make the road constructions economically unfeasible. Therefore, it became necessary to search for alternative solutions that reduce the implementation costs and improve pavements. It is considered that the addition of asphalt emulsion to the soils in the area can be one of those alternatives, due to its agglutinative and waterproof properties. The objective of this work was to evaluate the technical viability of the bituminous stabilization of soils occurring in the Agricultural Pole of Baixo Jaguaribe, in the State of CearÃ, to be used in base layers of highways. For that purpose, it was selected three soils on the area {{to the study of the}} stabilization with the addition of a cationic slow setting asphalt emulsion. The variables investigated were the rate of emulsion applied (2 %, 5 % and 8 %), the open air dry curing time (without cure, 7 days and 28 days), and the emulsion distribution (uniform distribution or in decreasing gradient with depth). The soil-emulsion mixtures were evaluated regarding their mechanical resistance (through the compression strength test, diametrical compression test, California Bearing Ratio and the resilience modulus test) and their resistance to wearing and abrasion (through the adapted tests Loaded Wheel Test - LWT and <b>Wet</b> Track <b>Abrasion</b> Test - WTAT). It was observed that the bituminous stabilization produced an increase in the resistance of the soil samples studied, that resistance being dependent on the residual humidity of the test specimens in the moment of test conduction. The results also indicated that the addition of asphalt emulsion has different effects for the several types of soils, so that the amount of silica present in the samples seems to influence the quality of the soil-emulsion mixtures. According to the tests carried out, it was concluded that some samples of soils present in the area of Baixo Jaguaribe can be satisfactorily stabilized with asphalt emulsion...|$|R
40|$|<b>Wet</b> <b>abrasion</b> of sand-sized quartz and {{orthoclase}} in polyethylene bottles for 912 hours {{showed that}} abrasion of fine material is practically negligible, {{in agreement with}} Kuenen (1959). The size distributions of the sand. sized quartz and orthoclase remained unchanged. The size distributions of sand-sized quartz, orthoclase, plagioclase, and hornblende abraded off of pebbles appear to be lognormal by number percentage. There is considerable question as {{to the accuracy of}} the method of counting grains. The size distributions of quartz and orthoclase crushed or abraded to sized less than 0. 5 mm appears to be lognormal, which is in disagreement with Rogers, Krueger and Krog (1963). Several tentative reasons are given. Roundness and sphericity of both crushed sand-sized quartz and orthoclase and sand-sized quartz and orthoclase abraded off of pebbles increase with time in the abrasion mill, the rate of change being greater for the fine sand sizes than for the coarse sand sizes. One result of the experiments described in this report is the indication that the size distributions of natural materials seem to be determined by the size distributions of the source rocks. This result is the basis for criticism of the concept of tectonic control of grain size distribution used by Cadigan (1961). It is concluded that the processes of abrasion, sorting, mixing with other sediments, etc. are at least as important as tectonic environment in the production of particular size distributions in sediments...|$|E

MethodsOn 12 human molars, a flat superficial dentine surface was exposed by <b>wet</b> <b>abrasion.</b> A model simplified adhesive system was formulated (40 wt. % UDMA/MDP, 30 wt. % HEMA and 30 wt. % ethanol). Two initiator systems were investigated: 0. 5 mol% CQ+ 1. 0 mol% EDMAB and 0. 5 mol% CQ+ 1. 0 mol% EDMAB+ 0. 2 mol% DPIH. Each adhesive was applied and light-cured (10 s; 600 mW/cm 2). Composite build-ups were constructed incrementally and resin–dentine specimens (0. 8 mm 2) were prepared. For NL, 3 bonded sticks from each tooth were coated with nail varnish, placed in the silver nitrate, polished down with SiC papers and analysed by EDX-SEM. NH and YM were performed on the hybrid layer in 2 bonded sticks from each teeth. The remaining bonded sticks were tested on μTBS (0. 5 mm/min). The data from each test were submitted to a Student t-test (α= 0. 05). ResultsNo significant difference was found for μTBS between groups (p> 0. 05). Significant lower NL and higher NH and YM were found in the hybrid layer and adhesive layer produced with the iodinium salt-containing adhesive (p< 0. 05). ConclusionsThe inclusion of the DPIH to the traditional CQ is a good strategy to improve the adhesive and mechanical properties of a simplified etch-and-rinse adhesive system...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{examine the}} effect of {{prolonged}} application time on the early and 3 -year resin-dentin microtensile bond strength. Methods. Water/ethanol (Single Bond [SB]) and acetone-based systems (One Step [OS]) were employed. A flat superficial dentin surface was exposed in third human molars by <b>wet</b> <b>abrasion.</b> The adhesives were applied to a delimited area of 52 mm(2) on wet surfaces, for 40, 90, 150 and 300 s. Four teeth were assigned for each experimental condition. Composite build-ups were constructed incrementally After water storage at 37 degrees C for 24 h, teeth were sectioned to obtain sticks with cross-sectional areas of 0. 8 mm(2) to be tested in tension (0. 5 mm/min) either immediately (IM) or after 3 years (3 Y) of water storage. The microtensile bond strength (mu TBS) values were analyzed by two way repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey`s test (alpha = 0. 05). Results. The 90 - and 150 -s groups achieved the highest IM mu TBS for OS (p < 0. 01). For SB, the highest IM mu TBS values were observed after 300 -s application (p < 0. 01). Significant decreases in mu TBS were observed for OS in the 40 - and 90 -s groups after 3 Y, except for the 150 -s group. With regard to SB, after 3 Y significant drops in mu TBS values were observed for the 40 - and 150 -s groups, except for the 300 -s group. Significance. Prolonged application times can increase the immediate LTBS of two-step etch-and-rinse adhesive systems and make the adhesive layer more stable over time. (c) 2007 Academy of Dental Materials.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from IEEE via the DOI in this record. This paper discusses several new technologies for mooring floating marine energy converter (MEC) devices, such as wave energy generators, tidal current turbines and floating wind turbines. The principal mooring component is a special nylon fiber rope which provides cyclic tension fatigue endurance much superior to that of conventional nylon ropes. The nylon fiber is treated with a new proprietary coating which has excellent <b>wet</b> yarn <b>abrasion</b> properties. The parallel-subrope type rope construction further reduces internal abrasion. Extensive laboratory testing was carried out on this new nylon rope design. Cyclic tension fatigue tests were conducted at mean loads and load amplitudes typical of actual service conditions and at higher mean loads and amplitudes. These tests demonstrate that the special nylon rope has essentially the same, desirable stretch characteristics as conventional nylon rope and has much better endurance performance. The mooring connection to the floating MEC device consists of a high-modulus fiber rope pendant which passes through a low-friction bell-mouth nylon fairlead on the MEC device. This eliminates the use of heavy, unreliable chain in this critical connection. A unique bag anchor system would be used on sand, clay, rock and other sea beds in which conventional drag embedment anchors and driven piles are impractical. The bag anchor consists of a large abrasion resistant carcass with lifting straps and top closure. The bag is transported to site in a collapsed form and is filled with local sand or aggregate to provide ballast weight. Several or many such bags are enclosed within a fiber rope net for deployment and are grouped together for connection to the mooring line. The paper will be {{of particular interest to}} designers of moorings for MEC systems in shallow water and severe wave environments. It will also be of interest for other mooring applications.

40|$|Introduction and objective: Human {{teeth are}} {{frequently}} used in laboratory and research activities. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the bond strength of human dentin subjected to different forms of storage. Material and methods: Fifteen intact third molars were selected and divided into three experimental groups (n = 5) : 1) teeth sterilized by autoclave for 15 minutes (121 °C) and frozen in distilled water for 60 days; 2) teeth immersed in 2 % glutaraldehyde solution for 24 hours and frozen in distilled water for 60 days; 3) only frozen in distilled water for 60 days (control). Samples were prepared with a diamond disk under cooling until obtaining flat surfaces of middle dentin, which were exposed by <b>wet</b> <b>abrasion</b> with 600 -grit SiC paper in order to create smear layer prior to hybridization. The conventional adhesive system Adper Single Bond 2 and the composite Filtek Z 250 (3 M Espe) were used according to manufacturer’s instructions. Tygon tubing molds were placed on each sample and its internal volume was filled with the composite. After photoactivation, the molds were removed and the specimens were exposed and stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 hours before microshear bond strength test. Results: The bond strength was calculated in MPa±SD, and data were statistically analyzed by Anova and Tukey test at 5 % significance level.

40|$|The low {{abrasion}} resistance of wool fabrics compared with many man-made fibre fabrics {{is known to}} be a frequent cause of consumer dissatisfaction particularly in pure wool suiting fabrics. Accordingly this project was undertaken to attempt to improve the {{abrasion resistance}} {{in order to maintain the}} quality image associated with wool fabrics and improve their market competitiveness vis-ä-vis other fabrics. Although several workers have discussed the effects of particular finishes on specific fabrics, very little systematic investigation of the effects of chemical treatments on the abrasion resistance of wool fabrics has been carried out. In the current study the difference in abrasion rates of woven wool fabrics composed of different structures have been studied in relation to the abrasion resistance and other relevant physical properties. The work carried out in this thesis is divided into two parts. A review of the literature is followed by a description of the experimental work carried out. The review of the literature summarises current views on the general mechanisms and factors involved in abrasion processes for textile fabrics and the effects of selective finishing treatments on the abrasion resistance of wool fabrics. In addition details of the abrasion testing conditions used in this work for determining fabric abrasion resistance have been described. The' experimental work is concerned with the changes in wool fabric abrasion resistance produced by the following treatments: (i) Application of polymer shrink-resist finishes by padding and by exhaustion treatments, (ii) Treatment with organic solvents, (iii) Treatment with ethylene glycol at- 1500 C, (iv) Deamination and esterification, (v) High temperature steaming (130 °C), (vi) Dyeing, (vii), <b>Wet</b> <b>abrasion.</b> Because of the great commercial importance of polymer shrink resist finishes for wool fabrics, the main objects of the experimental work were to establish the effects of a range of polymer shrink-resist finishes applied by conventional padding and exhaustion techniques on the abrasion resistance of wool fabrics and the mechanisms by which the abrasion resistance is improved...|$|E

Throughout the project, the new powders and coatings were compared to commercial WC-Co powders of the same binder content and commercial WC-Co thermal spray coatings. All the powders i. e WC- 10 VC-Co and WC-Co powders, were produced by agglomeration (by spray drying) and sintering and characaterised by determining the sizes and size distributions of the powders' particles, the morphology, the flowability and the phase composition and grain size and size distribution of carbide grains. The vanadium carbide in the WC- 10 VC-Co powders occurred in the solution as the double carbide (V,W) C and the carbides present in the WC- 10 VC-Co powders were WC and (V,W) C. None of the starting VC {{was left in the}} powders. Coatings were deposited using high pressure high velocity oxy-fuel (HP/HVOF) spraying systems, and characterized by determining the microstructures, the phase compositions and the carbide grain sizes, as had been done for the powders.

40|$|Contamination {{caused by}} insects on {{aircraft}} leading edge surfaces {{can result in}} premature transition of the boundary layer, leading {{to an increase in}} skin friction drag and fuel consumption. Consequently, the use of novel low surface energy coatings to mitigate insect residue adhesion was investigated. In order to determine the effect of surface characteristics on insect residue adhesion a range of surfaces, from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic, were evaluated. Surfaces were characterized in terms of their microstructure and hydrophobic properties by profilometry and dynamic contact angle measurements, respectively. Insect impact tests were conducted using two different test facilities, an insect delivery device and a laboratory scale wind tunnel, both capable of producing single and multiple insect impacts at speeds of ca. 100 m/s. Topography of insect residues was investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). A screening and evaluation technique, utilizing a modified <b>wet</b> <b>abrasion</b> scrub tester, was developed to determine the effectiveness of candidate coatings against insect residue adhesion. The test method provided a direct quantification of insect residue adhesion to a surface. The use of an analogue as a substitute to live insect testing was evaluated, with Schneider’s Insect Medium shown to be successful in mimicking the adhesive properties of Drosophila melanogaster haemolymph. The exposure to environmental factors (e. g. relative humidity, exposure to water) on the adhesive properties of insect haemolymph was found to be negligible. The dynamics of an insect impact event and its influence on the wetting and adhesion mechanisms of insect residue to a surface were studied. It was found that the effect of angle of impact and impact speed significantly influenced the insect residue patterns. Exposure to a constant airflow during the insect impact event imparts a shear force, resulting in an increase in the residue area and a decrease in the height measurements. The dominant factor influencing the rupture velocity (i. e. the lowest speed needed to fracture the exoskeleton) was found to be the orientation of the insect body relative to the surface upon impact. Tests with different insect species were conducted to investigate the effect of insect size and type on the effectiveness of the coatings and evaluation procedure. The influence of substrate temperature on insect impact dynamics and adhesion was evaluated and shown to have a minimal effect. Insect residue areas were theoretically predicted using high speed liquid droplet theory and compared to experimentally obtained results. The surface topography and chemistry, in particular the sliding angle of a coating, was found to have a significant influence on the adhesion of insect residue. Only superhydrophobic coatings with a specific microstructure and low sliding angle showed a significant reduction in insect residue adhesion...|$|E
