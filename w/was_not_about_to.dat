5|$|The wartime {{debate about}} post-war {{perspectives}} was accelerated by {{the resolution of}} the February 1944 European Conference of the Fourth International. The conference appointed a new European Secretariat and elected Michel Raptis, a Greek resident in France also known as Michel Pablo, the organisational secretary of its European Bureau. Raptis and other bureau members re-established contact between the Trotskyist parties. The European conference extended the lessons of a revolution then unfolding in Italy, and concluded that a revolutionary wave would cross Europe as the war ended. The SWP had a similar perspective. The British Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP) disagreed and held that capitalism <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> plunge into massive crisis but rather that an upturn in the economy was already underway. A group of leaders of the French Internationalist Communist Party (PCI) around Yvan Craipeau argued a similar position until they were expelled from the PCI in 1948.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of Igloo White/Commando Hunt, the aerial interdiction effort entered a new phase. Armed {{reconnaissance}} – the patrolling of known segments of the trail system by aircraft searching for targets of opportunity – gave way to strikes directed by the sensor system. That {{is not to say}} the Task Force Alpha had operational control of the aircraft that carried out the missions. The Seventh Air Force <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> surrender the single air manager control that it had just fought so hard to obtain. Task Force Alpha supported the Seventh by gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence. This intelligence was delivered from Nakhon Phanom to the Seventh's headquarters at Ton Son Nhut Air Base, where it issued the strike orders. The ABCCCs were also {{under the control of the}} Seventh, not Task Force Alpha.|$|E
5|$|Despite the American concerns, the IJN <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> {{attack the}} Allied supply lines and Cam Ranh Bay {{was not a}} major fleet base. As of 1 January 1945, both the Ise-class battleships and {{the small number of}} other Japanese {{warships}} in the region were stationed at or near Singapore, and only escort vessels operated from Cam Ranh Bay. While large numbers of aircraft were located in Japanese-held territories bordering the South China Sea in January 1945, relatively few trained pilots were available to operate them. At this time the Imperial General Headquarters was considering a major offensive against the supply line to Lingayen Gulf, but on 20 January 1945 it decided to concentrate Japan's defensive efforts on the area around the home islands and only conduct delaying actions elsewhere. The Japanese forces in the South China Sea were also unable to counter powerful attacks on convoys. While the Navy's convoy escort forces had been expanded during 1944, they remained weak. The IJN also assigned few fighter aircraft to protect convoys in the South China Sea and, due to the interservice rivalry which badly hindered the Japanese war effort, rejected an offer from the Army to provide additional fighters for this purpose just before the Third Fleet's attacks on French Indochina. In an effort to better coordinate the Japanese forces in the South East Asia region, all Army and Navy units were placed under the overall control of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group in January 1945. This command was led by Gensui Count Hisaichi Terauchi from his headquarters in Singapore.|$|E

But Iowa State's Seneca Wallace <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> leave Iowa City with a loss. Coupled with two Banks fumbles in Iowa territory, a stellar performance by the senior quarterback led to 29 straight Iowa State points.

25|$|So far, the Confederate {{strategy}} was working, because Sherman was {{being forced to}} disperse his strength to maintain his lines of communications. However, Sherman <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> fall into Hood's trap completely. He intended to provide Thomas with sufficient strength to cope with Forrest and Hood, while he completed plans to strike out for Savannah. On September 29, Hood began his advance across the Chattahoochee River, heading to the northwest with 40,000 men to threaten the Western & Atlantic Railroad, Sherman's supply line. On October 1, Hood's cavalry was intercepted by Union cavalry under Brig. Gens. Judson Kilpatrick and Kenner Garrard in a raid on the railroad near Marietta, but Sherman was still uncertain of Hood's location. For the next three weeks, Sherman had difficulty keeping abreast of Hood's movements. Hood moved rapidly, screened his march, and maintained the initiative. The Union cavalry, which Sherman had neglected to train adequately, {{had a difficult time}} following Hood and reporting his movements.|$|E

25|$|However, Toronto <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> {{give up on}} Bargnani yet and {{committed}} the entire summer coaching {{him to become a}} more effective interior player, forcing him to drive to the basket more and settle less for jump shots. The arrival of six-time NBA All-Star Jermaine O'Neal also meant that Bargnani was likely to come off the bench in most games, with Bosh and O'Neal forming the starting frontcourt. During the summer he worked hard on his body, putting up some more weight (adding some 15 pounds of muscle); this work showed his effects in the first games of the regular campaign, when the Italian was more willing to rebound in traffic and drive to the basket. He also seemed to rediscover his shooting stroke, had better shot selection and became a consistent shot-blocker, and he was soon moved to the starting line-up as small forward.|$|E

500|$|Reminded of {{the earlier}} Fan Zhongyan, Wang <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> allow ministers who opposed his reforms to have sway at court, and with his prowess (and {{perceived}} arrogance) was known as 'the bullheaded premier'. He gathered to his side ministers who were loyal to his policies and cause, an elite social coalition known as the New Policies Group (新法, Xin Fa). He had many able and powerful supporters, such as the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo. Ministers of state who were seen as obstructive {{to the implementation of}} Wang's reforms were not all dismissed from the capital to other places (since the emperor needed some critical feedback), but many were. A more extreme example would be [...] "obstructionist" [...] officials sent far to the south to administer regions that were largely tropical, keeping in mind that northern Chinese were often susceptible to malaria found in the deep south of China.

500|$|The Paraguayan's {{victory was}} fleeting, however. [...] The new Viceroy of Peru, the Marquis of Castelfuerte, was a {{dedicated}} supporter of absolutist monarchy who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> allow disobedience to the lawful authorities to linger and spread. [...] The Audencia of Charcas was sent a final warning that continuing to meddle in the Paraguayan affair {{would not be}} tolerated; perhaps frightened by both the new Viceroy's connections in Spain as well as Antequera's battle against the Spanish forces, the Audencia backed down and ceased to campaign on Antequera's behalf. [...] A second expedition was organized by Zavala personally, with more forces, while the bishop of Asunción, who had never supported Antequera, implored the cabildo in the strongest of terms to back down and accept Zavala without a fight. [...] The stronger force {{made it clear that}} continuing to struggle would be fruitless. [...] Zavala additionally guaranteed that the Jesuit mission Indians would not enter the civil territory this time if the settlers submitted peacefully. [...] Zavala made no mention of retribution or arrests, as well. [...] The cabildo decided to submit to Zavala; Antequera fled to Charcas, where he was arrested.|$|E
500|$|While these {{preparations}} {{were under}} way, the Allies continued to monitor Tirpitz. In late February the escort carrier [...] transported photo analysts {{and the ground}} crews for a Royal Air Force photo reconnaissance detachment to Vaenga airfield in northern Russia. These personnel were joined by three Supermarine Spitfires fitted for photo reconnaissance work and a single Consolidated PBY Catalina in March. The Spitfires flew regular sorties over Kaafjord and took very detailed photographs of Tirpitz and the nearby anti-aircraft batteries on 12 and 13 March; after being developed the Catalina flew these images to the UK. Although the German forces in northern Norway detected the Spitfire flights, the Kaafjord area's defences were not increased or placed on alert. On 16 March eight British, Dutch and Norwegian submarines were directed to take up positions off the Norwegian coast after decrypted German radio messages indicated that Tirpitz may have been preparing to depart Kaafjord for Germany to complete her repairs. A further eight British and Dutch submarines were dispatched on 18 March, but two days later {{it was concluded that}} Tirpitz <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> put to sea and the submarines were diverted to other tasks or ordered back to port. On 21 March British intelligence warned the Admiralty that due to recent Soviet advances on the Eastern Front, the Germans were placing a strong emphasis on disrupting the flow of supplies to the Soviet Union and could dispatch Tirpitz to attack any convoys not escorted by capital ships. In response, Fraser was directed to provide battleship protection for the next Arctic Convoy.|$|E

500|$|At the Conference of State Metternich {{lost his}} {{principal}} ally Karel Clam-Martinic in 1840, which furthered the growing paralysis {{at the heart}} of Austrian government. Metternich now struggled to enforce even the level of censorship he desired. Fortunately there were no major challenges to the regime from outside. Italy was quiet, and neither Metternich's attempt to lecture the new Prussian king Frederick William IV nor the boredom of the new British Queen Victoria at their first meeting posed immediate problems. Far more worrying was Tsar Nicholas, whose estimation of the Habsburg dynasty and Austria was low. After an impromptu tour of Italy in 1845 the Tsar unexpectedly stopped in Vienna. Already in a bad mood, he was an awkward guest, though in between criticisms of Austria he reassured Metternich that Russia <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> invade the Ottoman Empire again. Two months later their countries were required to work together over the Galician slaughter and a declaration of independence from Kraków. Metternich authorised the occupation of the city and use of troops to restore order in surrounding areas, intent on undoing the pseudo-independence that had been granted Kraków in 1815. After months of negotiations with Prussia and Russia, Austria annexed the city in November 1846. Metternich regarded it as a personal victory, but it was an action of dubious utility: not only were Polish dissidents now officially part of Austria, the Europe-wide Polish dissident movement was now worked actively against the [...] "Metternich system" [...] that had overridden the rights enshrined in 1815. Britain and France appeared similarly outraged, although calls for Metternich's resignation were ignored. For the next two years Ferdinand could not abdicate in favour of his nephew without a regency; Metternich believed Austria would need him in the interim to hold government together.|$|E

2500|$|The crisis {{committee}} appointed {{an interim}} government on 8 April; using {{the terms of the}} 1991 constitution instead of the Arusha Accords, the committee designated Theodore Sindikubwabo as interim president of Rwanda, while Jean Kambanda was the new prime minister. All political parties were represented in the government, but most members were from the [...] "Hutu Power" [...] wings of their respective parties. The interim government was sworn in on 9 April, but immediately relocated from Kigali to Gitarama to avoid fighting between the RPF and the Rwandan army in the capital. The crisis committee was officially dissolved, but Bagosora and the senior officers remained the de facto rulers of the country. The government played its part in mobilising the population, giving the regime an air of legitimacy, but was effectively a puppet regime with no ability to halt the army or the Interahamwe's activities.

Kiedis recalled {{the first time he saw}} Smith by saying, [...] "I spied this big lummox walking down the street with a really bad Guns N' Roses hairdo and clothes that were not screaming I've got style". Smith was a six-foot three-inch tall drummer who, according to Flea, [...] "lit a fire under our asses". From the moment they started jamming, Smith and Flea instantly found chemistry. Smith was a hard-hitting musician with whom the Chili Peppers believed they would create a strong relationship. Kiedis said the audition with Smith [...] "left the band in a state of frenzied laughter, that we couldn't shake out of for a half an hour". Smith was so much different from the other three. Kiedis, Flea and Frusciante were heavily influenced by punk rock, whereas Smith's taste in heavy metal music and his biker appearance contrasted with their punk rock views. Kiedis informed Smith he would be hired on one condition: as an initiation to the band, Smith had to cut his long hair. He refused, though Kiedis <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> argue with the much larger Smith. Smith was hired as the band's fourth drummer on December 3, 1988.|$|E
