40|$|The {{moisture}} {{content of the}} charged <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> is a significant factor affecting the gasification process. The increased {{moisture content}} increases the demand on the energy consumption, which is needed to cover the heat consumption related to the water evaporation and adversely affects the wood gas quality and input fuel amount.

The issues related to the moisture content estimation include preliminary the selection of the suitable methodology based on the assumed moisture content in the <b>wood</b> <b>chips.</b> Further factor which needs to be considered {{is the fact that the}} moisture content in <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> is time dependent due to the changing parameters of the ambient air (as temperature, pressure and air humidity).

40|$|Hedgerows are {{landscape}} features with ecological value and agricultural benefits which are appreciated in organic farming. Biomass from periodical cutting down of hedgerows is often unutilized litter. The study assesses different ways {{how to use}} <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> from hedgerows, and quantifies the biomass potential for either mulching arable land with <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> or, alternatively, for bioenergy use. The calculations are based on experiments at the experimental station for organic farming Kleinhohenheim and on literature. The yield of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> was clearly too low to mulch the total arable land of the model farm. Hedgerows on an area equal to 1 % of the farm area yielded <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> for 0. 05 ha if 160 m 3 ha- 1 were applied. This layer significantly reduced weeds. Hedgerows covering 5 % or 20 % of the farmland would provide <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> for about 0. 2 or 1 ha for mulching or, used as firewood, they would cover the corresponding fuel oil demand {{of more than one}} average household. Compared to poplars in short rotation coppice on the same area, the energy output is low. Since an energy use of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> is ecological and economical inefficient, mulching seems a reasonable way to use <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> from cutting hedgerow, in spite of low yields. <b>Wood</b> <b>chips</b> should be applied to thoroughly selected areas, such as slopes (protection from soil erosion), crops with wide inter-row-distance or to perennial, high-value crops...|$|R

40|$|The {{published}} {{version of}} this article can be viewed at the link below. A technique for the dissection and measurement of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> used in cement bonded particleboard (CBPB) removed from the unpressed mat and the pressed board has been developed. The prepared chips were subjected to changing relative humidity (RH) conditions. The results illustrated the contribution of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> to the performance of CBPB. The trend in change of dissected chips was similar to that of CBPB but to a different degree under both a single and cyclic change in RH. However, the compression, contortion and chemical degradation of, and the inclusion of cement in, <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> within CBPB resulted in an increase in mass change but decrease in dimensional change of dissected chips which were about 0. 7, 3. 0 and 1. 3 times the change of raw <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> respectively in mass, length and thickness over period tested. The combined effects of anisotropic characteristic, distribution and orientation of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> within CBPB brought about a significantly different ratio between length and thickness change of dissected chips to CBPB, having a ratio of about 2. 5 for length and 15 for thickness. The nature of hysteresis loop for dissected chips was also very close to that of CBPB but dissimilar to that of raw <b>wood</b> <b>chips.</b> Chips from the various stages of the production process showed very different responses to RH due to the effect of the processing parameters (pressure, curing temperature and time) on the nature of <b>wood</b> <b>chips.</b> The chips coated without any curing treatment were the most resistant to changing RH while raw <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> had the greatest change in mass and the chips dissected from final product had the greatest change in dimensions.

500|$|Cyathus striatus, {{commonly}} known as the fluted bird's nest, is a common saprobic bird's nest fungus with a widespread distribution throughout temperate regions of the world. This fungus resembles a miniature bird's nest with numerous tiny [...] "eggs"; the eggs, or peridioles, are actually lens-shaped bodies that contain spores. C.striatus can be distinguished from most other bird's nest fungi by its hairy exterior and grooved (...) inner walls. Although most frequently found growing on dead wood in open forests, it also grows on <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> mulch in urban areas. The fruiting bodies are encountered from summer until early winter. The color and size of this species can vary somewhat, but they are typically less than a centimeter wide and tall, and grey or brown in color. Another common name given to C.striatus, splash cups, alludes to the method of spore dispersal: the sides of the cup are angled such that falling drops of water can dislodge the peridioles and eject them from the cup. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin stria, meaning [...] "with fine ridges or grooves".|$|E
