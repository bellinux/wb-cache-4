His photojournalism career lasted at least as late as 1936, when he is credited <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> two photographs of Jerome Brannigan being arrested, after Brannigan had attempted to assassinate King Edward VIII. Effectively work soon ceased and Brooks and his wife had lived variously in the London suburbs for many years. For the last dozen years of his life lived in Golders Manor Drive in Hendon.|$|E

5|$|Kenshin first {{appeared}} in two chapters of Rurouni, Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story, the pilot chapters of the manga, in which he arrives in Tokyo and defeats several groups of villains attacking families. In these stories, Kenshin is given a similar personality to the one {{he has in the}} series, but his name is not mentioned. Following the original series' ending, Watsuki wrote two shorts where Kenshin makes brief appearances; in Yahiko no Sabato Kenshin and Kaoru entrust Yahiko <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> care of a dojo whereas in Haru ni Sakura he reunites with all his friends and learn about the place where Saito left and learn of his friend Sagara Sanosuke through a letter after he left Japan.|$|E

U.S. forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing {{since the end of}} World War II, five years earlier, and Shadrick's division was the closest to the warzone. Under the command of Major General William F. Dean, the division was understrength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. In spite of these deficiencies the division was ordered into South Korea, tasked <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> the initial shock of the North Korean advances until the rest of the Eighth United States Army could arrive and establish a defense.|$|E

5|$|The {{best known}} {{cleaning}} symbioses are among marine fishes, where {{several species of}} small fish, notably of wrasse, are specialised in colour, pattern and behaviour as cleaners, providing a cleaning and ectoparasite removal service to larger, often predatory fish. Cleaner species, {{as shown in the}} table, vary widely in their degree of dependence on their clients. Some are essentially pure obligate symbionts like the cleaner wrasse; some are opportunistic or facultative symbionts, like the orange chromide or some cleaner shrimps; and some, like the oxpeckers, combine a little eating of parasites (beneficial to client) <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> of blood (harmful to client), their favoured food.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} Catholic {{chronicle of}} the Anonymus Valesianus portrays Eutharic {{in a negative}} light, connecting him <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> the Jews' side in anti-Jewish disturbances in Ravenna over the Jewish congregation's rights to their synagogue; the disagreement prompted a conflict between the Arians and Catholics as the Arian Eutharic chose {{to side with the}} Jewish people. It is thought that the outrage expressed by the Catholics at this action was in proportion to Eutharic's being a symbol of the recent reconciliation between the Eastern and Western Churches brought about under the direction of Theoderic.|$|E

5|$|As {{an amateur}} rugby union player John was not paid to play rugby at club or {{international}} level. To receive money for playing {{would have been}} recognised {{as an act of}} professionalism and would have resulted in action from one of the governing unions, normally suspension or a ban. To prevent players switching to professional rugby league, players were given 'boot money' by their clubs or sponsors, named after the early practice of placing money in the players' boots. In his 2011 book Addy, Meirion Appleton claimed that in the 1970s he made illegal payments to both John and Gareth Edwards. Appleton claims that before an international match he gave both players envelopes containing money from sportswear manufacturer Adidas. John was never charged <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> illegal payments during his career.|$|E
5|$|As {{promised by}} Fillmore, treaty commissioners arrived in La Pointe in 1854 to {{conclude}} a final treaty. Recalling {{the experiences of}} 1837 and 1842, the Ojibwa leaders sought to control the negotiations in 1854. Ambiguity in those treaties had been partially to blame for ensuing problems, so Buffalo insisted he would accept no interpreter other than Armstrong, whom he referred to as his adopted son. The Ojibwa insisted on a guarantee {{of the right to}} hunt, fish, and gather on all the ceded territory, and on the establishment on several reservations across western Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northeastern Minnesota. In his mid-nineties and in failing health, Buffalo directed the negotiations but left most of the speaking to other chiefs. He entrusted Armstrong <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> care of the details in the written version.|$|E
5|$|By 17 June, Allied planes began {{operating}} from Labuan airfield and the 2/43rd Battalion was transferred across Brunei Bay to the mainland, landing at Menumbok and Mempakul, after an amphibious reconnaissance, {{along with the}} 2/11th Commando Squadron. Two companies and the battalion headquarters landed at Mempakul on 19 June, and the 2/43rd subsequently advanced up the Klias River, using barges and landing craft, while the 2/32nd Battalion advanced along the Padas River. By late June, the two battalions converged on Beaufort, linking up {{to the west of}} Kandu, and between 26 and 29 June 1945, the town was the scene of heavy fighting during which the 2/43rd lost 13 men killed and 30 wounded. The 2/43rd was tasked <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> the high ground {{to the north of the}} town around the Woodford Estate and Mount Lawley, and carrying out a flanking attack to the east. For his actions in destroying four Japanese machine-gun positions, Private Tom Starcevich was awarded the Victoria Cross. After the capture of Beaufort, the fighting continued in the area as the 2/28th Battalion kept up the pressure on the withdrawing Japanese; for the 2/43rd, though, Beaufort proved to be the last significant action of the war, as hostilities ended in mid-August, following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The battalion's final campaign of the war cost it 56 casualties, including those killed or wounded on Labuan.|$|E

Meanwhile, Marius realizes that the band of barbarians he encountered years ago had invaded Rome and slain his father at Nero's instigation {{as a means of}} eliminating a political rival. Furthermore, the Celts, led by a just-escaped Boudica, lay siege to York, with XIV Legion tasked with defending it until Commodus can escape. In the end, Marius sacrifices himself to buy time for the final ships to sail, but is resurrected by the goddess Summer, who tasks him <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> on the mantle of Damocles, a legendary Roman general who was abandoned to his enemies for political expediency. In that guise, Summer tells him to avenge his family and comrades, and save Rome.|$|E
5|$|In February 1892, Sperber {{left for}} another {{overhaul}} in Sydney. While en route, {{she had to}} stop at Tabiteuea in the Gilbert Islands and send a landing party ashore to punish locals who had attacked German businessmen there. The overhaul lasted from 3 March to 3 May, after which Sperber went on another tour of the islands, including the Marshalls, Butaritari, and Matupit Island. At Matupit the Deputy Chancellor, Georg Schmiele, came aboard the ship. Sperber was back in Apia by 17 May, and she remained there until 1 November, when she left for another tour, which included stops at Nukufetau, Herbertshöhethe capital of German New Guineaand Friedrich Wilhelmshafen. Another period of dockyard work at Sydney followed from 6 February 1893 to 18 April. In the meanwhile, unrest in Samoa broke out, under the leadership of King Mata'afa Iosefo. He was arrested, however, which caused the movement to disperse; after she returned from Sydney, Sperber was tasked <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> Mata'afa into exile on Jaluit Atoll.|$|E
5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women. When taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E

5|$|Spanish missionaries {{found that}} fever was treated by Amerindians near Loxa (Peru) with powder from Peruvian bark (later {{established}} to be from any of several trees of genus Cinchona). It {{was used by the}} Quechua Indians of Peru to reduce the shaking effects caused by severe chills. Jesuit Brother Agostino Salumbrino (1561–1642), who lived in Lima and was an apothecary by training, observed the Quechua using the bark of the cinchona tree for that purpose. While its effect in treating malaria (and hence malaria-induced shivering) was unrelated to its effect in controlling shivering from cold, it was nevertheless effective for malaria. The use of the “fever tree” bark was introduced into European medicine by Jesuit missionaries (Jesuit's bark). Jesuit Bernabé de Cobo (1582–1657), who explored Mexico and Peru, is credited <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> cinchona bark to Europe. He brought the bark from Lima to Spain, and then to Rome and other parts of Italy, in 1632. Francesco Torti wrote in 1712 that only “intermittent fever” was amenable to the fever tree bark. This work finally established the specific nature of cinchona bark and brought about its general use in medicine.|$|E
5|$|The Chariot {{festival is}} the most {{prominent}} festival of the temple, and for the surrounding villages. It is celebrated during the Tamil month of Chittirai (March–April) when devotees pull the chariot round the streets of Tirvellarai. Verses from Nalayira Divya Prabandham are recited {{by a group of}} temple priests amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument). The chariot festival is unique in the state as a community feast is offered by several individuals and committees, a custom many centuries old. The processional idols of Pundarikakshan and Pankajavalli are brought to the temple car early in the morning amidst religious chanting. Ratharohanam, the rituals associated <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> the idols to the temple car, is performed at an auspicious time before commencing the procession.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivations of}} the three in the infighting are not {{completely}} clear. According to Friedrich Katz, Madero, in refusing to let Navarro be killed, was motivated not only by his personal humanism but also by a need to assert his civilian authority over military leaders. It also seems that Villa was mostly concerned <b>with</b> <b>taking</b> care of his soldiers and his personal hatred for Navarro, since it was his soldiers—known as Villistas—who Navarro had earlier ordered to be bayoneted. Years later, after he fell out with Orozco, Villa wrote in his memoirs that the whole episode was a set-up by Orozco, who had been paid 50,000 pesos by Díaz's agents {{to get him to}} kill Madero. While Katz and other scholars consider this assessment extreme, it is possible that Orozco, who believed he should be the rightful leader of the revolution, was trying to provoke Villa into killing Madero. That way Madero would be out of the way, Villa would be discredited among the intellectual revolutionary circles as a common bandit and Orozco could claim the mantle of leadership. In the end, however, Villa kept his cool, Madero convinced common soldiers to support him and Orozco did not have the nerve to go through with it.|$|E
