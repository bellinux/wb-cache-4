5|$|Early {{forms of}} {{xylophone}} {{such as the}} atranatrana are found throughout the island and {{are believed to have}} come across with the original Indonesian settlers. The earliest of these is played uniquely by a pair of women, one of whom sits <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> outstretched together and the bars of the xylophone resting across her legs rather than on a separate resonator box. Each woman strikes the atranatrana with a pair of sticks, one keeping the beat while the second plays a melody. The xylophone bars range from five to seven in number and are made of differing lengths of a rot-resistant wood called hazomalagny. A similar xylophone called katiboky is still played in the southwest among the Vezo and Bara ethnic groups.|$|E

Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being {{surrounded}} by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four mannequins in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> spread around a TV screen and Beyoncé is seen on it, singing the song. During one scene, Beyoncé performs a dance choreography on a couch along with several other female dancers. Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white fur jacket and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent. The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko. Her look is further complete with dark make-up around the eyes and red lipstick while her hair is marcelled and blonde.|$|E

25|$|For introduction, {{the woman}} is to sit down, so to say, on her heels, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> spread apart, which will bring the womb down as low as possible. Then taking the womb veil into the right hand with the cavity looking upward and {{compressed}} from side to side, giving it thus {{the shape of an}} ellipse, she has to push it up the vagina as far as it will go. It will then spread out of its own accord and apply itself closely and firmly to the neck of the womb.|$|E
25|$|In {{the missionary}} position, a woman lies {{on her back}} on a bed or other surface <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> comfortably spread with the soles of the feet resting. The {{penetrating}} partner may approach the woman on his knees between her spread legs; and either uses his arms to hold himself up, or lets his weight rest on her. When the woman's vagina is sufficiently lubricated, which may involve fingering her vulva or clitoris in particular, the man will level his erect penis with her vagina for penetration, and may use fingers to open the woman's labia and guide the penis in.|$|E
25|$|Egg-laying {{is done by}} {{bringing}} the abdomen close to the mouthparts where the pap is being held. The female holds her front legs up and open and appears {{to use them to}} touch her abdomen. Her antennae are completely still and her wings are closed during the operation. Then her abdomen begins to vibrate, and her sting is turned inside and out and folded backwards. During this process, the egg is expelled and placed directly on the pap that the female is holding in her mouth. She does not touch it <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> at all. Then her abdomen relaxes and the female places the egg inside the cell. The average length of the eggs laid by L. vechti is 1.36mm, and ovarian eggs are considered ready to be laid once they reach 1.16mm.|$|E
50|$|The popular {{religious}} {{belief is that}} of the contact (sparsh) with the Salabhanjika yakshini's foot. It is said that when the Yakshini encircles a dormant tree <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>leg</b> around it, it starts to blossom and bear fruit. Shalabhanjika yakshi is also an embellishment {{in the form of an}} architectural bracket in many Hindu temples.|$|R
50|$|Arakawa {{is known}} for the {{quietness}} of her blades. She is also a strong spinner. She has an excellent donut spin, a difficult variation of the Camel spin, that requires great flexibility. In 2004, she added a Biellmann spin to her repertoire. Arakawa's signature spiral is a Y-spiral where she releases <b>her</b> free <b>leg</b> and completes the spiral <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>leg</b> still close to her head, without the hand assist.|$|R

25|$|The {{places were}} overrun by the Soviet 4th Guards Tank Corps {{on the night}} of 10 and 11 February 1943. After the reconquest by the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking with the support of 333 Infantry Division and the 7th Panzer Division on 18 February 1943 the Wehrmacht {{soldiers}} discovered numerous deaths. Many of the bodies were horribly mutilated, ears and noses cut off and genital organs amputated and stuffed into their mouths. Breasts of some of the nurses were cut off, the women being brutally raped. A German military judge who was at the scene stated in an interview during the 1970s that he saw a female body <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> spread-eagled and a broomstick rammed into her genitals. In the cellar of the main train station around 120 Germans were herded into a large storage room and then mowed down with machine guns.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} has been used at least for millennia if not longer since it is also used by the great apes, {{as well as other}} primates. Robert Francoeur notes that evidence of the missionary position's use appears in ancient pottery and art in the Fertile Crescent {{as well as in the}} art of Early Greeks, Romans, Peruvians, Indians, Chinese and Japanese. The majority of the positions described in the Kama Sutra involve the woman lying on her back <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> in a variety of positions. According to Canongate, ancient art shows missionary as being less popular than woman-on-top positions in Ur, Greece, Rome, Peru, India, China and Japan. But Francoeur states that the ancient Chinese preferred male-on-top because of their belief that males are born face down and women face up. Kagaba natives in Colombia preferred missionary because of the stability it offers; they believed that if the woman moved during intercourse, the earth would slip off the shoulders of the four giants who held it up above the waters. Some Kerala tribes believe that the male-on-top position is the only way to conceive warriors.|$|E

Parsons meanwhile had founded a company with Hubbard and Hubbard's girlfriend Sara Northrup, Allied Enterprises, into which he invested his life savings. It became apparent that Hubbard was a confidence trickster, who tried to flee with Parsons' money, resulting in the end of their friendship. Returning to Pasadena, Cameron consoled Parsons, painting a picture of Northrup <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> severed below the knee. Parsons decided to sell The Parsonage, which was then demolished for redevelopment, and the couple moved to Manhattan Beach. On October 19, 1946, he and Cameron married at the San Juan Capistrano courthouse in Orange County, in a service witnessed by his best friend Edward Forman. Having an aversion to all religion, Cameron initially took no interest in Parsons' Thelemite beliefs and occult practices, although he maintained that she had an important destiny, giving her the magical name of [...] "Candida", often shortened to [...] "Candy", which became her nickname.|$|E

500|$|A live-action {{version of}} Ariel {{appeared}} in the ABC television series Once Upon a Time, where she was played by JoAnna Garcia. Showrunners Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz had wanted to introduce the character for a while but saved her for season three when the show's setting temporarily moved to the fictional Neverland, a land with mermaids.

The showrunners provided their own [...] "spin" [...] on the character of Ariel for the show, but maintained her spirit as someone [...] "who wants to see the world and who wants to experience things outside of what they know". In portraying the role, García had to film scenes swimming in the cold ocean water of Vancouver <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> bound, which was additionally challenging since it was her first role after giving birth. Ariel's main arc took place over several episodes of the 2013-2014 third season, and she later appeared in one episode each of the fourth and sixth seasons.|$|E
