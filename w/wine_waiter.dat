25|$|Wine is {{a popular}} and {{important}} beverage that accompanies and enhances {{a wide range of}} cuisines, from the simple and traditional stews to the most sophisticated and complex haute cuisines. Wine is often served with dinner. Sweet dessert wines may be served with the dessert course. In fine restaurants in Western countries, wine typically accompanies dinner. At a restaurant, patrons are helped to make good food-wine pairings by the restaurant's sommelier or <b>wine</b> <b>waiter.</b> Individuals dining at home may use wine guides to help make food–wine pairings. Wine is also drunk without the accompaniment of a meal in wine bars or with a selection of cheeses (at a wine and cheese party).|$|E
25|$|Throughout his career, Howerd hid his {{potentially}} career-destroying homosexuality (acts between consenting males being {{illegal in}} England and Wales until 1967) from both his audience and his mother, Edith. In 1958, he met <b>wine</b> <b>waiter</b> Dennis Heymer at the Dorchester Hotel while dining with Sir John Mills; Howerd was 40 and Heymer was 28. Heymer became his lover {{as well as}} manager, and stayed with him for more than thirty years, until Howerd's death, with Heymer helping to revive Howerd's flagging career in the 1960s. However, the two had to remain discreet as Howerd feared being blackmailed if anyone beyond his immediate circle found out. The relationship was explored in 2008 in a drama for BBC Four, Rather You Than Me, starring David Walliams and Rafe Spall.|$|E
60|$|He {{listened for}} a moment intently, as though for {{footsteps}} outside. The disturbance, however, came {{from the other end}} of the building. There was a sharp knocking from the trap-door by which he had ascended. He touched an electric knob. The place was dimly yet sufficiently illuminated. He hastened towards the further end of the place and pulled up the trap-door. A melancholy-looking little procession slowly emerged. First of all came Joseph, stepping backwards, supporting the head and shoulders of Graham, still bound and gagged. After him came a dark, swarthy-faced <b>wine</b> <b>waiter,</b> who supported Graham's feet. Behind followed Fischer, carrying his silk hat and cane in his hand. He paused for a moment as he stepped on the floor of the chapel, and brushed the dust from his trousers.|$|E
50|$|According to a {{character}} in Plutarch's Dinner-table Discussion, (written some 500 years after The Wasps was produced), Old Comedy needs commentators to explain its abstruse references, {{in the same way}} that a banquet needs <b>wine</b> <b>waiters.</b> Here is the wine list for The Wasps as supplied by modern scholars.|$|R

5000|$|A sommelier ( [...] or [...] ), or wine steward, is {{a trained}} and {{knowledgeable}} wine professional, normally working in fine restaurants, {{who specializes in}} all aspects of wine service as well as wine and food pairing.

60|$|Despite her protests, {{he ordered}} an {{elaborate}} and expensive supper.

5000|$|Another popular {{explanation}} {{says that}} King Alfonso XIII {{stopped by a}} famous tavern in Cádiz (Andalusian city) where he ordered a cup of <b>wine.</b> The <b>waiter</b> covered the glass {{with a slice of}} cured ham before offering it to the king, to protect the wine from the beach sand, as Cádiz is a windy place.

5000|$|Ritz {{was born}} in the Swiss village of Niederwald, the {{youngest}} of 13 children in a poor peasant family. At the age of twelve he was sent as a boarder to the Jesuit college at Sion, and at fifteen, having shown only vaguely artistic leanings, was apprenticed as a sommelier at a hotel in Brig. While working there as an apprentice <b>wine</b> <b>waiter</b> he was dismissed by the patron of the hotel from his position, saying, [...] "You'll never make anything of yourself in the hotel business. It takes a special knack, a special flair, and it's only right that I tell you the truth—you haven't got it."

5000|$|A restaurant's {{proprietor}} {{is called}} a [...] like 'restaurant', this derives from the French verb restaurer, meaning [...] "to restore". Professional cooks are called chefs, with there being various finer distinctions (e.g. sous-chef, chef de partie). Most restaurant (other than fast food restaurants and cafeterias) will have various waiting staff to serve food, beverages and alcoholic drinks, including busboys who remove used dishes and cutlery. In finer restaurants, this may include a host or hostess, a maître d'hôtel to welcome customers and to seat them, and a sommelier or <b>wine</b> <b>waiter</b> to help patrons select wines.A new route to becoming a restauranter, rather than working one's way up through the stages, is to operate a food truck. Once a sufficient following has been obtained, a permanent restaurant site can be opened. This trend has become common in the UK and the US.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was centred on {{measuring}} and developing customer service in Waskia restaurant. What is the customer perception of service quality and customer service of Waskia restaurant? The theoretical framework focuses on description and analysis of customer satisfaction and importance of customer satisfaction. The empirical study of this thesis was accomplished by quantitative research by use of questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed {{on the basis of}} theoretical study related to service quality and customer satisfaction. Based on the research results, the level of customer satisfaction in Waskia restaurant would be judged above average which is quite good. Although the majority of customers were satisfied with the overall service quality of the case company, several areas for improvement were found. It is recommended that Waskia restaurant should improve on <b>wine</b> list, <b>waiters</b> mastery of the menu and also waiters knowledge of how to recommend wine and food...|$|R

50|$|In DCI these {{different}} views are factored into Roles. At run time, the Role is {{the identity of}} the object. During the enactment of a use case (like Serve the <b>Wine)</b> the Role <b>Waiter</b> unambiguously identifies a single object at any given time. You might argue there may be several Waiters at the table. However, they are likely to differ in their responsibilities within a use case, such as are found in Role names HeadWaiter and Busboy. Even if their responsibilities are identical, they would still be described as Waiter-1 and Waiter-2, or as individual (named) elements of a Waiter vector, if someone intended to write software for them. So a Role like HeadWaiter becomes the identifier, the handle, by which objects refer to each other in a use case.|$|R

The new owner of Francis Edwards invited Farahar back as manager but when the business moved to Hay-on-Wye in order to reduce costs Farahar decided to leave and set up his own antiquarian travel book business. He and his family had moved to their home in Calne in Wiltshire in 1980 where Sophie had already set up her autograph and manuscript business.|$|E
50|$|Young Chef Young Waiter (YCYW) is {{an annual}} skills {{competition}} for youths launched in 1984 {{which makes it}} the longest-established competition in the UK hospitality industry.

While serving in the military Merker was arrested and imprisoned for six months for distributing (presumably subversive) leaflets.|$|E
5000|$|Although Lady Penelope and Parker {{were among}} the first {{characters}} to be developed, neither was conceived as a central character. The inspiration for Parker came from director David Elliott, who had been reading a spy novel about a safecracker who unwittingly becomes a government agent. The character's Cockney speech (termed [...] "Parkerese" [...] by Graham and series creator Gerry Anderson) was based on the voice of a <b>wine</b> <b>waiter</b> at the Kings Arms in Cookham, Berkshire, which was regularly visited by members of the production staff. Anderson remembered that Arthur, who had formerly been in the service of Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, spoke with a [...] "warm patter, dropping his 'aitches' and putting them back in the wrong places, and this intrigued me ... I thought his voice would be perfect." [...] He therefore had Graham dine at the establishment especially, so as to study the accent. Anderson did not inform Arthur of his importance {{in the development of the}} character, concerned that the waiter would dislike the recognition that such information might bring if it were to become publicly known.|$|E
5000|$|The Screaming Jets was {{a popular}} hard rock act from Newcastle. Having a down to earth image,(some would say both {{screaming}} jets and baby animals were commercial glam rock) they and Divinyls were examples of bands that survived the backlash against so called Hair Rock of the Eighties (i.e. Warrant, Poison, Europe, Cinderella). In 1993 the Melbourne rock band Horsehead also gained popularity after garnering interest internationally from Madonna's Maverick Records and had a hit single 'Liar' reaching the weekly top 40 ARIA charts and was performed televised on MTV's 'Take 40 Australia'. The band stylistically shared affinities with the huge American grunge scene at the time, drawing {{from the likes of}} Soundgarden and Alice in Chains. The band also had a second hit single and video 'Oil and Water' which won the Australian Kerrang! award for best rock video. Their debut album was mixed by the legendary Mike Fraser. In 1994, hard rock band The Poor charted at #30 in the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks with [...] "More <b>Wine</b> <b>Waiter</b> Please". The Candy Harlots' 1990 Foreplay EP reached 17 in the ARIA national Top 100 chart.|$|E
50|$|Peter Agricola {{arrived at}} Liegnitz on April 19, 1550 and was {{introduced}} {{the following day}} at the castle where he started his new duties. Duke Frederick having served in France in 1551, against the will of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, he was stripped of his principality and the young prince Henry, duke of Liegnitz under the regency of his paternal uncle and curator, George II the Pious, duke of Brieg (now Brzeg in Poland), went to reside at Brieg. Peter Agricola followed him there and spent eight years in very good conditions. The prince having become a teenager, {{he went to the}} court of Emperor Ferdinand I of the Holy Empire, and his master was thanked with a valuable reward. At the beginning of 1558, Peter Agricola was offered by the Senate of the city of Ulm the position of headmaster of the city Latin school and in spite of his choice to become a church minister he from now on pursued a secular career, stopping planning to become a Lutheran clergyman anymore. He took part in the school reformation project under Ludwig Rabus and in 1559 went to Augsburg where the imperial court then was, to advise Duke Henry XI, his former student (then <b>wine</b> <b>waiter</b> of Ferdinand I and in a difficult situation towards the Emperor). Peter Agricola declined thereafter a new offer to work again for this prince, though the imperial adviser Warnsdorf strongly advised him to do so, and also refused an offer from Hieronymus Wolf to be employed at St. Anne Latin school (Gymnasium bei St. Anna) of Augsburg, as he had been called by Wolfgang of Wittelsbach, duke in Bavaria and reigning Count Palatine of Zweibrücken and Neuburg, to found a school at Lauingen (Bavaria), a challenge he accepted due to the insistence of his close friend and former mate of Wittenberg university, the lawyer and reformer Ulrich Sitzinger, then princely adviser (privy council) and chancellor of the principalities of Pfalz-Zweibrücken and Pfalz-Neuburg.|$|E
