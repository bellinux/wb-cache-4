5|$|Fearing the {{newspaper}} {{would bring the}} countryside down on the Mormons, the Nauvoo city council declared the Expositor a public nuisance and ordered the Nauvoo Legion to destroy the press.

5|$|The {{following}} month in London at the defunct Battersea Power Station, a rigged 200-foot fireball was filmed, reportedly for an opening sequence, prompting calls from local residents <b>who</b> <b>feared</b> {{a terrorist attack}} on the station.

5|$|The {{three main}} {{characters}} of the novella, Selver, Lyubov, and Davidson, have been described by reviewers as representing three different historical attitudes towards nature. Davidson represent the machismo of some early explorers, <b>who</b> <b>feared</b> nature and wanted to overcome it. Lyubov has a more positive but highly romanticized view of the forest, while only Selver and the other Athsheans are able to live in harmony with it.|$|E
5|$|U.S. President Abraham Lincoln {{diverted}} several regiments of militia {{and volunteer}} troops after the Battle of Gettysburg {{to control the}} city. The rioters were overwhelmingly working-class men, mostly Irish or of Irish descent, <b>who</b> <b>feared</b> free black people competing for work and resented that wealthier men, who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $9,157 in 2017) commutation fee to hire a substitute, were spared from the draft.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised {{the money to}} pay the {{government}} through a combination of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was complicated by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, <b>who</b> <b>feared</b> they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw the value of their holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E
5|$|Estañol's views {{represented}} {{those of}} {{the portion of the}} upper class which was willing {{to come to terms with}} at least a portion of the middle class in order to crush the peasant uprisings, as exemplified by those of Zapata, which were erupting throughout Mexico. Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, <b>who</b> <b>feared</b> the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{attributed}} his recall to Moscow {{to mental}} disorder {{on the part}} of Stalin, <b>who</b> <b>feared</b> conspiracies in Moscow matching those which the ruler believed to have occurred in the fabricated Leningrad case, in which many of that city's Party officials had been falsely accused of treason. Khrushchev again served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province. Khrushchev biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of Georgy Malenkov and security chief Lavrentiy Beria, who were widely seen as Stalin's heirs.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Salih and the Tayy fended off Fatimid {{troops in}} Palestine. On {{his way back}} to Aleppo, Salih {{captured}} a string of towns and fortresses, namely Ba'albak west of Damascus, Hims and Rafaniyya in central Syria, Sidon on the Mediterranean coast and Hisn Ibn Akkar in the hinterland of Tripoli. These strategically valuable towns gave Salih's emirate an outlet to the sea and control of part of the caravan route between Aleppo and Damascus. The fall of Sidon particularly alarmed the Fatimids, who largely prioritized control of Syria's port cities over the inland towns and <b>who</b> <b>feared</b> that other ports would recognize Bedouin rule.|$|E

The Minister for the Army, John Cramer, attempted to appoint Major General Ivan Dougherty, a retired CMF officer, but the proposal was defeated in cabinet on the advice of the Minister for Defence, Athol Townley, <b>who</b> <b>feared</b> the antagonism it was likely to engender among the senior ranks of the Regular Army.|$|E
