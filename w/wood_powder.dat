5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla <b>wood</b> <b>powder</b> and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E

The breeding season in India is mainly February to May (before the Monsoons) while it is March to June in Sri Lanka. When they sit still, the appear hunched. The Hindi name used by hunters is kafni churi and refers to the hunched neckless appearance as if dressed in a fakir's kafni (robe). The Marathi name is karna while it is called kakarne hakki in Kannada In Kerala it is known as theekakka (literally [...] "fire-crow"). In Sri Lanka, it is known as loha wannichcha.Malabar trogons feed exclusively on insects and fruits have not been noted in their diet unlike in the New World trogons. Seeds have however been reported in the diet of Sri Lankan specimens. In the forests of Sri Lanka, they are often found in mixed-species foraging flocks where they may sometimes be subject to kleptoparasitism by drongos. A study in Kerala found that they foraged mainly at 5 to 10 m with females tending to forage lower within the canopy. When foraging on bark, they propped themselves using their tail like woodpeckers, especially on decaying tree stumps. They sometimes descend to the ground and search for insects under leaf litter. They will sometimes fly and try to flush prey and then hover to pick up prey. They may also hang upside down to reach prey on vertical tree surfaces. Prey are often mashed or struck on a branch between the mandibles before feeding on them or prior to feeding young. The contact call is a series of about five low intensity que while these were of higher intensity in territorial fights. The alarm call is a churrrr and a similar call is also delivered prior to roosting. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly. In the Nilgiri hills they are altitudinal migrants and are found in the higher reaches only during summer.The nest is made in rotting trees or stumps that are easy to carve and pulverize using their bills. The male and female take turns to excavate the nest using their bills. It may take about a month to excavate the nest. The floor is made out of the <b>wood</b> <b>powder</b> and no extra lining is added. Two eggs were seen to be the normal clutch in a study in Kerala although older works suggest that the typical clutch is of three eggs. The eggs are laid with a gap of two days and incubated by both males and females with the females usually incubating at night. The incubation period is about 19 days. The hatchlings are fed mainly caterpillars for the initial period and later provided bugs, flies and orthopterans. The parents do not remove the excreta of the nestlings from the nest. The adults continue to feed the fledged juveniles for nearly 5 to 6 months. They are socially monogamous with pair bonds lasting more than a season.Sri Lankan birds have been seen to plunge into water from an overhanging branch to bathe.|$|E

Further investigations showed a high concentration of oxalate in this sample, which is likely to be an explanation for the accelerated release. Industrial cut wood chips, from Scandinavian softwood, birch and eucalyptus, were leached at different temperatures to study their leaching behavior. Birch and softwood were shown to have the same general leaching pattern for calcium and potassium. Eucalyptus showed the same leaching trend for potassium, but it was harder to remove calcium from eucalyptus than from softwood and birch.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the manufacture of dense reaction infiltrated silicon carbide (SiSiC) from wood-based composites is presented in a joint project by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and the Technical University of Munich (TUM). To produce such ceramics, <b>wood</b> <b>powders</b> of small particle sizes were homogeneously mixed with phenolic resin powder and made into boards (140 x 140 x 10 mm³) in an uni-axial thermal pressing process.

The maximum amount of water uptake by the capillary rise method and changes in the aspirated pits seen with scanning electron microscopy before and after of preextraction and precompression were investigated using heartwood samples of four softwoods. The height of penetration and the weight by the capillary rise method for preextractive <b>wood</b> <b>powders</b> are discussed. Three wood species andLarix leptolepis showed marked increases in the amount of solution uptake after precompressed treatment only.Larix leptolepis wood required compression after extraction by boiling in water. These differences among wood species were caused by the accumulation of extractive material. It was also recognized that the accumulative material inLarix wood has plasticity and that inPseudotsuga is brittle. Based on these results it was found that it is difficult to destroy aspirated pits in the former and easy in the latter. On the other hand, the difference in penetration of each wood species was caused by the quantity and quality of the extraction material in addition to the extent of the wettability of the surface of the cell cavity as well as aspirated pit.|$|R

The samples were <b>woods</b> <b>powder</b> obtained by milling. Complementary characterization of the woods was performed by evaluating the crystallinity of cellulose by means of X-ray powder diffraction. The change in colour of woods during ageing was checked by means of spectrophotometric measurements in the visible region. X-ray fluorescence was used to investigate the penetration of metals into wood samples. An artificial ageing treatment with NaOH and O 3 was also performed. Finally, a comparison between the effects of artificial alteration realised in our specimens and natural degradation observed in archaeological woods, was performed...|$|R
