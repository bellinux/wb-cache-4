5|$|The {{first two}} volumes of The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley were {{published}} in 1858, but were poorly received by critics. The book was not as well edited as his previous article and many felt {{that it did not}} contain the insights about Shelley and his works that Shelley at Oxford did. The reception was not universally negative however, and several of Shelley's friends enjoyed the book. The Shelley family <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> at the way Shelley was portrayed; they demanded the return of Shelley's papers and obtained an injunction preventing the publication of any further volumes. Hogg had begun writing a third, but it was never completed.|$|E
25|$|Lewis <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> and stormed {{off when}} Zara and Harry M. {{returned}} to the house, although it was unknown if {{this was due to}} the departure of Hannah (whom he had definitely wanted to return as the two were close friends) or the return of Harry M. (whom Lewis was known not to like).|$|E

25|$|Before the U-2 {{incident}} Khrushchev and Eisenhower {{had been}} getting along {{well and the}} summit {{was going to be}} an opportunity for the two sides to come together. Also, Eisenhower had been looking forward to a visit to the Soviet Union and <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> when his invitation was retracted. The two sides were going to discuss topics such as nuclear arms reduction and also how to deal with increasing tensions surrounding Berlin. According to Eisenhower, had it not been for the U-2 incident the summit and his visit to the Soviet Union could have greatly helped Soviet and American relations.|$|E
25|$|Gabriel {{had asked}} his cousin, Prince Alexander of Leuchtenberg (who himself {{intended}} to marry morganatically), {{to find a}} priest to bless the wedding secretly. At the wedding ceremony, only Lidia Chistyakova (Antonina's sister) {{and a few of}} their friends were present. Gabriel had told his secret to his brother Ivan a few days before, but his elder brother did not want to attend the ceremony because of their mother. However, he promised to keep the secret. On his way to the church, Gabriel saw his brothers Prince Konstantin and Prince Georgy walking on Morskaya Street. They had just met Antonina in a wedding dress in another car. Only later, the two brothers realized what had happened. Once married, Gabriel went to see his mother who, although she <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset,</b> at the end gave him her blessing. From then on Gabriel moved into Nesteroskaya's apartment where for a time, the couple lived quietly.|$|E
25|$|Everyone {{was anxious}} about the divine work, {{including}} the King Indradyumna. After a fortnight of waiting, the King who was anxious to see the deity, could not control his eagerness, and he visited the site where Vishwakarma was working. Soon enough Vishwakarma <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> and he left the carving of the idol unfinished; the images were without hands and feet. The king was very perturbed by this development and appealed to Brahma to help him. Brahma promised the King that the images which were carved would be deified as carved and would become famous. Following this promise, Indradyumna organized a function to formally deify the images, and invited all gods to be present for the occasion. Brahma presided over the religions function as the chief priest and brought life (soul) to the image and fixed (opened) its eyes. This resulted in the images becoming famous and worshipped at Jagannath Puri in the well known Jagannath Temple as a Kshetra (pilgrimage centre). It is, however, believed that the original images are in a pond near the temple.|$|E

25|$|In late 2007, Tania {{became friends}} with Joey Henderson during the 'Ferndale Strangler' storyline and became dangerously close to {{becoming}} one of his victims after she told Alice Piper {{that he was just}} a 'boy' and she wasn't interested in dating him. When Joey overheard this, he was revealed to be the Ferndale Strangler in the 2007 Christmas cliffhanger with him preparing to strangle Tania with IV tubing inside her apartment. When Tania cut her finger with a knife, Joey panicked and put the IV line away, with her narrowly avoiding death without even knowing it. After this he stalked her in a shopping mall and hoped to kidnap her by offering her a lift but Yvonne picked her up and took her up north for Christmas. Joey missed his chance, and once again Tania avoided death unknowingly. Tania dated both Kip Denton (Will Hall) and Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison) before she began an abusive relationship with gang member Kingi Te Wake (Te Kohe Tuhaka). Kingi left her and Tania dated Ben Goodall (Shaun Edwards-Brown), only to lose him to her mother. Ben was assaulted by a small gang of hoodlums and later it was discovered he had a brain hemorrhage. He fell brain dead and after several arguments between Yvonne and his sister Anita (Lara Fischel-Chisholm) as to whether he would come back alive or not, his life support was turned off a week later. Tania <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> over his death and she and Yvonne reunited. She rebounded with Isaac Worthington (Matt Minto) but left him when he cheated on her. In late 2010 {{she fell in love with}} Rafe Durville (Simon London) and left the country with him to Australia to start a clinic. She returned briefly in 2012 for Yvonne's birthday. In 2013, Bella Durville (Amelia Reid-Meredith) visited Tania and Rafe.|$|E
500|$|Pryce took an {{interest}} in cars while driving a baker's van at the age of 10, before informing his parents {{that he wanted to be}} a racing driver. During an interview with Alan Henry in 1975, he stated that he had wanted to become a pilot, but thought he was not intelligent enough. Like many future Formula One drivers, Pryce had a childhood racing hero. In his case it was Lotus's Scottish driver Jim Clark. Pryce's mother recalled that he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> when Clark died at the Hockenheimring in April 1968. His father noted that [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> when Jochen Rindt was killed, too". After he left school at 16, Pryce's mother insisted that he take an apprenticeship as a tractor mechanic at Llandrillo Technical College, giving him [...] "something to fall back on", as she put it, if his career as a racing driver was unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Helicopter Squadron {{commander}} Lt. Col. Bill Harris <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset.</b> He {{concluded that}} the air rescue could not be attempted at that time due to the heavy concentration of North Vietnamese forces in the immediate area around Clark and Hambleton. He called Col. Muirhead {{and told him that}} they had to find another way. Hambleton was told to sit tight while they worked up an alternative plan. Hambleton had two survival radios, a first aid kit, two kinds of flares, a knife and a [...]38 caliber revolver, a compass and a map, an empty water bottle, and no food.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} a {{commercial}} and critical success in Japan, selling {{a million copies}} and receiving a special edition re-release. Critics in the West praised D's horror elements, story, graphics, and presentation. Reviewers of the 3DO version {{found it to be}} one of the best games on the platform. For the PlayStation release, Sony did not print enough copies to match pre-orders. Eno <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> with this, and would later take revenge on Sony by releasing his later games exclusively on Sega platforms. D was followed by two sequels featuring the same [...] "digital actress" [...] named Laura although the stories are unrelated, Enemy Zero (1996) and D2 (1999). Modern retrospectives find D less appealing, but still commend it for its place in history as a unique blend of cinema and gaming and an early example of mature horror game design.|$|E
500|$|... "The Reporter" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel J. Goor and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Blitz. Blitz previously directed episodes of The Office, a comedy series created by Parks and Recreation co-creator Greg Daniels. Michael Schur, who created Parks along with Daniels, said of Blitz, [...] "He's such a great director, and it made us feel, launching this new show, safe and happy to have him." [...] It was originally {{supposed to be the}} second episode shown in the series, but the broadcast schedule was changed and [...] "Canvassing," [...] the original third episode, was shown second instead. Goor <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> with the switch so, as a prank, the Parks and Recreation producers sent him an e-mail message claiming NBC was going to be further held until the second season because it was preempted by [...] "a sports thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{third and}} final single, [...] "Adam's Song", {{performed}} less substantially than the first two but still managed to peak at number two on Billboard Alternative Songs chart. The band was engulfed in controversy when Greg Barnes, a survivor of the Columbine High School massacre, set [...] "Adam's Song" [...] on repeat on his stereo and committed suicide in May 2000. Hoppus <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> {{when he got the}} call from band manager Rick DeVoe explaining what happened, as he intended the track as an anti-suicide song. Rolling Stone later compared the controversy to that of Ozzy Osbourne's [...] "Suicide Solution". Despite that controversy, it managed to connect deeply with fans of the band, who wrote letters to the band remarking the track saved their lives during difficult situations. The constant airplay of the three videos on MTV and TRL cemented the band's image as video stars, amid a climate of teen pop and boy bands.|$|E

500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, Parker and Stone {{received}} feedback that audiences felt [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] was especially unkind to Struthers. Although {{they did not}} speak to her themselves, the duo received word that Struthers was {{a fan of the}} show until [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] aired, after which she <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> and reportedly reacted emotionally over her portrayal. Struthers was particularly saddened by the fact that her character steals food from the same starving children she had been working to help. Parker and Stone were slightly remorseful when they learned of her reaction and have said they did not have anything against Struthers personally. Nevertheless, Struthers was portrayed in an even less flattering way in the third season episode [...] "Starvin' Marvin in Space" [...] as a Jabba the Hutt-like creature. In a DVD commentary track, Parker said of Struthers, [...] "Dude, you're really setting yourself up if you're going to be that fat and go on the air talking about [...] ... We don't think she's a bad person, she's probably nice to try to do this, but cut down on the Twinkies a little bit before going on the air." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 27, 1999 he {{was hospitalized}} in an {{automobile}} driven by Derrick Coleman.

[...] On Christmas Eve 1999 during his time on the injured reserve, Recasner dragged a Continental Airlines clerk across a table by his necktie in frustration while attempting to book a flight to Texas to visit his sister, who was involved in a serious car accident. [...] Recasner was uncertain whether his sister would survive. [...] He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor fourth-degree assault and was sentenced to a 24-month deferred sentence, 45 hours of community service and ordered to pay $200 in court costs.|$|E
500|$|I saw the boy getting {{injured in}} his leg, {{and the father}} asking for help. Then I saw him getting injured in his arm, the father.

500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
