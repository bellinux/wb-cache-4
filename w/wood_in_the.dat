5|$|Reinforcing Presley's {{image as}} a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various Hollywood stars and starlets, from Natalie <b>Wood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s to Connie Stevens and Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s. June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for {{encouraging}} him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind. Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, {{and most of these}} relationships were insubstantial.|$|E
5|$|Another {{work from}} this time is The Green Feather, which Knight painted, and {{reworked}} due {{to a change in}} the weather, outdoors in a single day and shows the model Dolly Snell in an emerald evening dress with a hat and a large feather. Knight sent the painting to an international exhibition held at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400. Knight started the vast painting Lamorna Birch and his Daughters in 1913, painting in a <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lamorna Valley but then kept the painting unfinished in her studio until finally completing it in 1934, the same year Birch was elected a full member of the Royal Academy.|$|E

5|$|At the {{designated}} time of 05:25, the British opened {{up with an}} artillery barrage on the German positions just as the Australian forces entered no man's land for the attack. Heavy machine gun fire assaulted the troops from all directions as they bunched together on the firmer ground to avoid sinking in the boggy mud. Serious resistance was encountered at Hilside Farm, a strong point {{to the east of}} Augustus <b>Wood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre of the highest part of the Passchendaele ridge. The position consisted of two pillboxes, supported by fifty metres of trench that was occupied by approximately thirty men with four machine guns. The fire from these machine guns forced the men of the 34th Battalion to seek cover on the exposed crest and threatened to halt the entire advance.|$|E
5|$|Hilliard {{attended}} Liberty High School in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, {{where he}} was a two-time Associated Press first-team selection. Despite eating, writing, and throwing a football right handed, Hilliard shoots left-handed. As a freshman, he measured 6'1. His parents split up after his freshman year, and he developed a unique bond with Liberty assistant coach Mike Bachman. As a junior, he averaged 18 points and six rebounds per game and shot 52 percent from the field. Hilliard led the Hurricanes to PIAA state semifinals, where Liberty lost to Penn <b>Wood.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> loss to Penn Wood, Hilliard had 26 points. He was named Morning Call player of the year as a junior. In addition, he was selected to the First Team Class AAAA.|$|E
5|$|Semi-regulars in {{the show}} {{included}} Jim Broadbent, who'd previously appeared with <b>Wood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> London staging of her play Talent. He appeared in such parts as a sleazy press photographer and a telephone deodorising engineer. Lill Roughley, who Wood first spotted when she worked with her then husband Geoffrey Durham in 1977, was given various roles, such as impersonating Coronation Streets Minnie Caldwell. Mary Jo Randle, as well as playing Kelly-Marie Tunstall's friend, appeared as an actress who hadn't worked for {{three years in the}} spoof documentary To Be An Actress.|$|E

5|$|The colonies {{are found}} in rotten <b>wood,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground, under rocks or stones and in urban areas. The ants are both diurnal and nocturnal and forage on trees, in low {{vegetation}} and into human homes, where they are regarded as pests. These ants eat a variety of foods, including fruits, insects, sucrose, nectar and bird feces. They visit various flowers and attend {{to a variety of}} butterfly larvae. The thorny devil, an Australian lizard, predominantly feeds on Ochetellus workers, and other ant species also prey on them.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{bridge over}} the Monnow at Monmouth was constructed of <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-12th century. In 1988, work on flood defences revealed remains of the wooden bridge directly under the existing one, and dendrochronological analysis indicated that its timber came from trees felled between 1123 and 1169. An early account in the Flores Historiarum by Roger of Wendover may indicate that the wooden bridge and the nearby Church of St Thomas the Martyr were damaged by fire in the Battle of Monmouth in 1233, fought between supporters of Henry III and the forces of Richard Marshal, Earl of Pembroke. Both {{the site of the}} battle and the specific bridge involved are debated—the local historian Keith Kissack argued that the battle was fought on Vauxhall Fields, below Monmouth Castle and some way from Monnow Bridge, while other modern historians continue to place the battle at Overmonnow.|$|E
5|$|Twelve of {{them were}} {{inventoried}} in 2003, and their populations have been managed since. The light undergrowth contains common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia). Liquorice milkvetch (Astragalus glycyphyllos) and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea (Lathyrus sylvestris) {{are present in the}} small herb glade. The population of lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) is located in the pioneer <b>wood.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> glade with Calamagrostide and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow pyramidal orchid (Anacamptis pyramidalis). bee orchid (Ophrys apifera) and man orchid (Orchis anthropophora) grow everywhere, except in the older glade. In the different herbaceous fringes grow wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) and zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). A tall herb fringe hosts common butterbur (Petasites hybridus).|$|E

5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Cheddar Wood and {{the smaller}} Macall's Wood form a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest from {{what remains of the}} wood of the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13thcentury and of King Edmund the Magnificent's <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 10th. During the 19thcentury, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The wood was coppiced until 1917. This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood. Butterflies include silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) and brown argus (Aricia agestis). The slug Arion fasciatus, which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the soldier beetle Cantharis fusca also occur.|$|E
5|$|Wounded in {{the back}} in June 1917, he was invalided to England to convalesce. Upon recovery, he {{commanded}} reserve battalions at the NZEF bases in England. He returned to France in March 1918 as a temporary major and took up command of a company. By {{this stage of the}} war, he had been recommended for command of a battalion. In August 1918, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and appointed commander of 4th Battalion, New Zealand Rifle Brigade. A month later, during the Hundred Days Offensive, he was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his leadership when dealing with a German counterattack near Havrincourt <b>Wood.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> capture of Le Quesnoy, the New Zealand Division's last action of the war, he led his battalion over the ramparts of Le Quesnoy. He was later mentioned in despatches for his role in this engagement. While the New Zealand Division was on occupation duty in Germany, he coordinated an education program for its soldiers until he returned to New Zealand and was discharged from the NZEF.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E

25|$|Many {{other types}} of sports and {{recreation}} equipment, such as skis, ice hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks and archery bows, were commonly made of <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, but have since been replaced with more modern materials such as aluminium, titanium or composite materials such as fiberglass and carbon fiber. One noteworthy example of this trend is the family of golf clubs {{commonly known as the}} woods, the heads of which were traditionally made of persimmon <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early days of the game of golf, but are now generally made of metal or (especially in the case of drivers) carbon-fiber composites.|$|E
