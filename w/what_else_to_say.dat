2500|$|As {{part of a}} {{statement}} released by his office {{in support of a}} day to honor emergency first responders in 2007, Allard was quoted as saying: “First responders in Colorado have recently provided critical services in the face of blizzards and tornados. Since I don’t think first responders have really done anything significant in comparison to their counterparts who have dealt with real natural disasters, I have no idea <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> here …” ...|$|E
2500|$|Coach Salan, the {{swimming}} coach at Lake Forest. While he allows Conrad {{two days a}} week off to see Dr. Berger and stays late with him to work out on the other days, Conrad does not like him. He only begrudgingly allowed Conrad to rejoin the team, and once told Conrad that a friend of his with similar problems had [...] "been in and out of institutions his entire life". When Dr. Berger says that remark may have been simply a sign that he didn't know <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> Conrad responds that it was simply [...] "stupid".|$|E
60|$|I {{stared at}} her and inquired her name, because I did not know <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
60|$|She made no reply. Her {{eyes were}} {{watching}} his face. She {{seemed to be}} waiting <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>else</b> he had <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{its proper}} place shall be {{considered}} <b>what</b> <b>else</b> Macchiavelli had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> of Cesare Borgia {{and what to}} report of events that he witnessed connected with Cesare Borgia's career.|$|R
6000|$|She {{waited for}} <b>what</b> <b>else</b> I had <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I lay prone, and {{gathered}} together and shaped and reshaped a little heap of pine needles. [...] "You see---- I can't do it. I want you." ...|$|R
60|$|Not knowing <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> {{she still}} paid Penrose the {{compliment}} of feigning {{an interest in}} Father Benwell.|$|E

6000|$|... “But—but—if you aren’t guilty {{how is it}} those fellows {{got your}} name and that of Morr?” asked the money-lender’s son, not knowing <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Lord Emsworth {{began to}} feel like a hunted stag. He could not go on saying [...] "Ah!" [...] indefinitely; yet <b>what</b> <b>else</b> was there <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> this curious little beastly sort of a beetle kind of thing? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, {{it comes}} after all," [...] she continued, [...] "from certain {{original}} convictions {{which have become}} my religion. Rather a magniloquent term, perhaps, but <b>what</b> <b>else</b> am I <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> One of these is that the most absolutely selfish {{thing in the world}} is to give way to depression, to think of one's troubles at all except of how to overcome them. I spend many delightful hours thinking of the pleasant and beautiful things of life. I decline to waste a single second even in considering the ugly ones. Do you know that this becomes a habit?" ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is always}} {{annoying}} <b>to</b> read <b>what</b> someone <b>else</b> has <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about one's papers. The writer [...] usually a reviewer [...] inevitably picks out some small point of tangential interest and expands on it. Such is what I {{intend to do}} to McAloon 1975 here: McAloon prefaces his paper with an abstract which does not even mention the result on which I, perversely enough, wish to focus. This result, as is so subtly hinted {{in the title of}} the present note, is the uniqueness of a certain kind of Rosser sentence for ZF. Rosser's original sentence is easily described. Let Prov(x,y) express "x proves y (or, more precisely: the derivation coded by x proves the formula coded by y "). The Rosser sentence is then any sentence (p provably satisfying c...|$|R

40|$|<b>What</b> <b>else</b> {{is there}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> other than Brrrrrrrr…The coldest I can {{remember}} it being {{prior to this}} was in January of 1994. I was still {{a student at the}} University of Wisconsin-River Falls and around the 18 th- 21 st we had a stretch of days where the air temperature got as low as- 34 /- 35 degrees below zero, and blustery winds resulted in wind chills of- 75 degrees below zero. If you have one of those weather almanac calendars, you can confirm that those record lows still stand to this date. I suspect it was just as cold {{on the east side of}} the state, so many of you may still remember this. The irony is that the most recent climatic statisticians have shown that on average, our low temperatures have increased over the last few decades. I believe this winter is what we could call an “outlier ” in the world of statistical analysis...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{know how}} highly {{you think of}} Jane Fairfax," [...] said Emma. Little Henry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and {{delicacy}} made her irresolute <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "My {{mother would}} be delighted to know you," [...] he ventured, not knowing <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> It was an effort for him to reflect upon their new {{situation}} as poor tenants to a wealthy family.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{give us a}} rest!" [...] growled Ham Spink, {{not knowing}} <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> He caught up the things he had been carrying. [...] "Come on, fellows," [...] he added, and almost ran from the dock.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a {{trouble that}} {{requires}} time to cure it," [...] she said,--not meaning {{to imply that}} time would cure it by enabling the girl to forget her lover; but because in truth she had not known <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E

60|$|She gave it royally, {{while the}} other was there {{pressing}} at her breast. Duane took the proffered hand. He did not know <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|R
6000|$|Hugh muttered, [...] "I thank you," [...] {{not knowing}} <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> But {{in his heart}} he {{wondered}} what kind of friendship this mighty and awful being would show to him and his. Perhaps he might hold that the truest kindness would be to remove him and them from the miseries of a sinful world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentleman {{is such a}} frightful word to have to use to a gentleman; but I did {{not know}} <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Mamma, if you please, we won't talk about it;--not about the letter I mean.
