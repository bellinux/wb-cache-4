2500|$|On the {{occasion}} of the infamous incest case of Amstetten in Austria, the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung writes: [...] "Amstetten between discomposure and media-hype: A dungeon amidst the town, a father inflicting martyrdom onto his children – how <b>we</b> <b>struggle</b> to put the pieces of the incomprehensible together. The dungeon in Amstetten touches something deep inside the marrow of the Austrians, their dark side, mirrored in the poems of their authors and in the Images of Gottfried Helnwein, depicting people with forkes pusched into their eyes. Or Girls with blood running down their legs. Helnwein's paintings are nightmares, that tell of the dungeons in our heads..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{legislature}} met {{in joint}} session as a constitutional convention on February 11, and after {{six hours of}} debate rejected two amendments, one proposed by House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran and the other by Senate President Robert E. Travaglini. Both banned same-sex marriage, one made civil unions possible and the other established civil unions. Finneran commented: [...] "We are as divided as the nation on this. We are doing the best we can. We are human beings. <b>We</b> <b>struggle.</b> Sometimes we come up short." [...] The convention met again {{the next day and}} defeated an amendment that defined marriage as the union {{of a man and a}} woman and disavowed any position on civil unions on a 103-94 vote that showed divisions in each party and Catholic legislators evenly divided. Ronald Crews of the Massachusetts Family Institute blamed Finneran's misreading of his own caucus for the failure of his own proposed language, a defeat in the convention's opening moments from which Crews found it impossible to recover.|$|E

60|$|No, we feared no more, {{not even}} when with the dawn rose the roaring wind, through which <b>we</b> <b>struggled</b> down the {{mountain}} slopes, as it would seem in peril of our lives at every step; not even as hour by hour we fought our way onwards through the whirling snow-storm, that made us deaf and blind. For we knew that those lives were charmed. We could not see or hear, yet we were led. Clinging to the yak, <b>we</b> <b>struggled</b> downward and homewards, till at length out of the turmoil and the gloom its instinct brought us unharmed {{to the door of}} the monastery, where the old abbot embraced us in his joy, and the monks put up prayers of thanks. For they were sure that we must be dead. Through such a storm, they said, no man had ever lived before.|$|R
60|$|But {{now comes}} the period at which a {{conventional}} World-Reason awakens us from the truth of our dream. Doubt, Surprise and Incomprehensibility arrive at the same moment. They say:—“You live and the time was when you lived not. You have been created. An Intelligence exists greater than your own; {{and it is only}} through this Intelligence you live at all.” These things <b>we</b> <b>struggle</b> to comprehend and cannot:—cannot, because these things, being untrue, are thus, of necessity, incomprehensible.|$|E
60|$|I {{write down}} {{his name in}} my little book, among those of others dearly loved, who, too, have been summoned hence. And so we meet and part; <b>we</b> <b>struggle</b> and succeed; or we fail and drop unknown on the way. As we leave the fond mother's knee, the rough trials of {{childhood}} and boyhood begin; and then manhood is upon us, and the battle of life, with its chances, perils, wounds, defeats, distinctions. And Fort William guns are saluting in one man's honor,* while the troops are firing the last volleys over the other's grave--over the grave of the brave, the gentle, the faithful Christian soldier.|$|E

If she be steadfast enough to cling to her affection for this man, then at last you will have to yield." [...] He looked at her frowning, but did not say a word.

60|$|Accordingly our Prior assembles us in Chapter; and, we adjuring {{him before}} God to do justly, nominates, not by our selection, yet with our assent, Twelve Monks, {{moderately}} satisfactory. Of whom are Hugo Third-Prior, Brother Dennis a venerable man, Walter the Medicus, Samson Subsacrista, and other esteemed characters,--though Willelmus Sacrista, {{of the red}} nose, too is one. These shall proceed straightway to Waltham; and there elect the Abbot as they may and can. Monks are sworn to obedience; must not speak too loud, under penalty of foot-gyves, limbo, and bread-and-water: yet monks too would {{know what it is}} they are obeying.

6000|$|Literature, {{the strange}} entity so called,--that indeed is here. If Literature {{continue}} to be the haven of expatriated spiritualisms, and have its Johnsons, Goethes and true Archbishops of the World, to show for itself as heretofore, there may be hope in Literature. If Literature dwindle, as is probable, into mere merry-andrewism, windy twaddle, and feats of spiritual legerdemain, analogous to rope-dancing, opera-dancing, and street-fiddling with a hat carried round for halfpence, or for guineas, there will be no hope in Literature. What if our next set of Souls'-Overseers were to be silent ones very mainly?--Alas, alas, why gaze into the blessed continents and delectable mountains of a Future based on truth, while as yet <b>we</b> <b>struggle</b> far down, nigh suffocated in a slough of lies, uncertain whether or how we shall be able to climb at all! ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{are little}} wax dollies with hearts. We are little tin {{soldiers}} with souls. Oh, King of many toys, are you merely playing with us? IS it only clockwork within us, {{this thing that}} throbs and aches? Have you wound us up but to let us run down? Will you wind us again to-morrow, or leave us here to rust? IS it only clockwork to which we respond and quiver? Now we laugh, now we cry, now we dance; our little arms go out to clasp one another, our little lips kiss, then say good-bye. We strive, and we strain, and <b>we</b> <b>struggle.</b> We reach now for gold, now for laurel. We call it desire and ambition: are they only wires that you play? Will you throw the clockwork aside, or use it again, O Master? ...|$|E
6000|$|Then you {{put your}} hand in mine again, kissed me, [...] and <b>we</b> <b>struggled</b> to be together.

6000|$|... "Keep up stream," [...] I said shortly, and <b>we</b> <b>struggled</b> {{across a}} kind of donga, where only a few wounded men were hidden, into a {{somewhat}} denser patch of bush that had scarcely been entered by the flying Isigqosa, perhaps because here {{the banks of the}} river were very steep and difficult; also, between them its waters ran swiftly, for this was above the drift.|$|R

Is sin, then,--which we deem such a dreadful blackness in the universe,--is it, like sorrow, merely {{an element of}} human education, through which <b>we</b> <b>struggle</b> to a higher and purer state than we could otherwise have attained? Did Adam fall, that we might ultimately rise to a far loftier paradise than his?" [...] "O hush!" [...] cried Hilda, shrinking from him {{with an expression of}} horror which wounded the poor, speculative sculptor to the soul. [...] "This is terrible; and I could weep for you, if you indeed believe it. Do not you perceive what a mockery your creed makes, not only of all religious sentiments, but of moral law? And how it annuls and obliterates whatever precepts of Heaven are written deepest within us? You have shocked me beyond words!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. Britling. [...] "It is the theologians {{who must}} answer that. They have been extravagant about God. They have had silly {{absolute}} ideas--that He is all powerful. That He's omni-everything. But {{the common sense}} of men knows better. Every real religious thought denies it. After all, the real God of the Christians is Christ, not God Almighty; a poor mocked and wounded God nailed on a cross of matter.... Some day He will triumph.... But it is not {{fair to say that}} He causes all things now. It is not fair to make out a case against him. You have been misled. It is a theologian's folly. God is not absolute; God is finite.... A finite God who struggles in his great and comprehensive way as <b>we</b> <b>struggle</b> in our weak and silly way--who is with us--that is the essence of all real religion.... I agree with you so--Why! if I thought there was an omnipotent God who looked down on battles and deaths and all the waste and horror of this war--able to prevent these things--doing them to amuse Himself--I would spit in his empty face...." ...|$|E
60|$|Hitherto, the Universe {{of stars}} {{has always been}} {{considered}} as coincident with the Universe proper, as I have defined it in the commencement of this Discourse. It has been always {{either directly or indirectly}} assumed—at least since the dawn of intelligible Astronomy—that, were it possible for us to attain any given point in space, we should still find, on all sides of us, an interminable succession of stars. This was the untenable idea of Pascal when making perhaps the most successful attempt ever made, at periphrasing the conception for which <b>we</b> <b>struggle</b> in the word “Universe.” “It is a sphere,” he says, “of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference, nowhere.” But although this intended definition is, in fact, no definition of the Universe of stars, we may accept it, with some mental reservation, as a definition (rigorous enough for all practical purposes) of the Universe proper—that is to say, of the Universe of space. This latter, then, let us regard as “a sphere of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference nowhere.” In fact, while we find it impossible to fancy an end to space, we have no difficulty in picturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of beginnings.|$|E

60|$|How long <b>we</b> <b>struggled</b> there hand to hand, {{stumbling}} {{now over}} the lifeless forms of our comrades, and again finding our way checked by the dead {{bodies of the}} savages, I cannot say; but certain {{it is that we}} finally drove the last of the hated foe over the stockade, and gave Thayendanega's boasting braves such a lesson as they would not need to have repeated for many days.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>struggled</b> {{about the}} room, {{striking}} one another, knocking over furniture, and rolling upon the floor. Menelek {{was a powerful}} man, and he was fighting for his life.

60|$|I {{do not say}} {{he might}} not be {{infinitely}} worse, but can any one believe that, given better conditions, he might not have been infinitely better? Is it necessary to argue for a thing so obvious to all clear- sighted men? Is it necessary, even if it were possible, that I should borrow the mantle of Mr. George Gissing or the force of Mr. Arthur Morrison, and set myself in cold blood to measure the enormous defect of myself and my fellows by the standards of a remote perfection, to gauge the extent of this complex muddle of artificial and avoidable shortcomings through which <b>we</b> <b>struggle?</b> Must one, indeed, pass in review once more, bucolic stupidity, commercial cunning, urban vulgarity, religious hypocrisy, political clap-trap, and all the raw disorder of our incipient civilization before the point will be conceded? What benefit is there in any such revision? rather it may overwhelm us with the magnitude of what we seek to do. Let us not dwell on it, on all the average civilized man still fails to achieve; admit his imperfection, and for the rest let us keep steadfastly before us that fair, alluring and reasonable conception of all that, even now, the average man might be.|$|E

Everyone will grumble to you confidentially--Miss Ellicot, she's our swagger young lady, you know--up there, next to Miss White, she will tell you that it is so out of the world here, so far away from everyone one knows. Old Kesterton, choleric-looking individual nearly opposite, will curse the cooking till he's black in the face, but he never misses a dinner.

60|$|When that {{knowledge}} comes, {{it is as}} if a cloud had suddenly gathered over the morning light; so dark a cloud, that {{there seems to be no}} longer any sunshine behind it or above it. The character of our individual beloved one having invested itself with all the attributes of right,--that one friend being to us the symbol and representative of whatever is good and true,--when he falls, the effect is almost as if the sky fell with him, bringing down in chaotic ruin the columns that upheld our faith. <b>We</b> <b>struggle</b> forth again, no doubt, bruised and bewildered. We stare wildly about us, and discover--or, it may be, we never make the discovery--that it was not actually the sky that has tumbled down, but merely a frail structure of our own rearing, which never rose higher than the housetops, and has fallen because we founded it on nothing. But the crash, and the affright and trouble, are as overwhelming, for the time, as if the catastrophe involved the whole moral world. Remembering these things, let them suggest one generous motive for walking heedfully amid the defilement of earthly ways! Let us reflect, that the highest path is pointed out by the pure Ideal of those who look up to us, and who, if we tread less loftily, may never look so high again.|$|E
6000|$|There was a tendency, even on {{the part}} of its sympathisers, to treat the whole {{suffrage}} agitation {{as if it were a}} disconnected issue, irrelevant to all other broad developments of social and political life. <b>We</b> <b>struggled,</b> all of us, to ignore the indicating finger it thrust out before us.
