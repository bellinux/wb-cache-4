5|$|Jaime I {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval {{shipyard}} in Ferrol on 5 February 1912. She was launched on 21 September 1914, {{less than two months}} after the start of World War I. Spain remained neutral during the conflict, but because Britain supplied much of the armament and other building materials, work on Jaime I was considerably delayed. The ship <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to sea by 1917, but she was not completed until well {{after the end of the}} war; work was finally finished on 20 December 1921. Upon her completion, she joined her two sister ships in the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet. Jaime I saw action against insurgents in Morocco in the Rif War during the early 1920s along with her two sisters. Rif insurgents operating a coastal battery damaged the ship in 1924.|$|E

25|$|The Lilac Time {{have gone}} through various line-up changes with the Duffy {{brothers}} as mainstays. The group originally consisted of Stephen Duffy, his elder brother Nick Duffy, and friend Michael Weston, who recorded the first album together; Michael Giri and Fraser Kent joined when the band <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on tour. The Lilac Time put out the albums Paradise Circus in 1989 and & Love For All in 1990 for Fontana before being dropped.|$|E

25|$|By Autumn 1972, {{the mission}} <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> However, it {{required}} certain optimal moon and weather conditions. A quartering moon {{was needed for}} the pilots' night vision goggles. A slight overcast was also desirable. When the first opportunity for the mission came on 5 October, the forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera needed for navigation failed, causing the mission to abort. The FLIR also failed on two subsequent occasions. The next attempt, {{during the last week}} of November, actually made it into North Vietnam before it was turned back by dense ground fog.|$|E
25|$|On May 11, Brewers manager Ned Yost {{announced}} Gagné {{would be}} removed from the closer's role for a while, after 3 blown saves in 6 attempts. But after a couple days Gagné said he <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> and a couple days later got his 10th save. However, Gagné continued to struggle as the team's closer and ultimately became the set-up man after losing his closer job to the veteran Salomón Torres. Gagné's struggles continued out of the bullpen, however. He eventually lost his set-up job to Guillermo Mota, and he finished the season as a middle relief pitcher, a role in which he still struggled.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Kublai Khan had {{defeated}} Ariq Böke, {{and both}} Kublai and Phagpa {{must have felt}} that {{the construction of the}} stupa in the Sakya monastery had gained religious merit that contributed to Kublai's military victory and other achievements. As Imperial Preceptor, Phagpa <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the court and disseminate his sect's teachings. Since no artist in China could make the bewildering array of Himalayan Tantric deities which would be indispensable for his religious activities, he needed to bring with him someone who could. Arniko was a natural choice. Instead of going back to Nepal, Phagpa encouraged him to go to the Mongol court to present himself to Kublai Khan. Phagpa accepted Arniko as his disciple and initiated him into secret Buddhist treaties, thus elevating his social status above an ordinary artisan. Thus having discovered Arniko, Phagpa personally prepared and trained Arniko for his future tasks at the court.|$|E

25|$|For Emperor Napoleon the Battle of Leipzig was a catastrophe. Of his army, only 60,000–70,000 {{survivors}} {{retreated to}} {{the west bank of the}} Rhine River in November 1813. Almost 100,000 of Napoleon's soldiers were left behind in German fortresses and all his German allies abandoned him and joined the Coalition. In the 1814 campaign, Napoleon could act with singleness of purpose since he was both the political and military leader of France. The Coalition's major powers had divergent interests. Czar Alexander I of Russia wished to seize Paris and overthrow Napoleon. King Frederick William III of Prussia <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with the czar and his countrymen were eager to avenge years of French occupation and humiliation. Emperor Francis I of Austria was less keen on the overthrow of Napoleon, who was married to his daughter Marie Louise and Austria already stood to regain all the territories lost to France. Francis and his minister Klemens von Metternich feared Russia and Prussia might gain too much power if France were crushed.|$|E
25|$|Caine ignored {{their advice}} but did adapt the plot and {{characters}} {{to some of}} T.E. Brown's suggestions. He also sought the advice of two other Manxmen, A.W. Moore and Sir James Gell, particularly on the legal background of the novel. Having assembled his materials, Caine wrote the novel at his house in Bexley {{in the space of}} only seven months, a feat made possible by his recycling material from his 1885 novella, She's All The World To Me, in particular the central scene of Ewan's body floating back to shore. Caine visited the Isle of Man for a week in August to check the locations of some scenes in the novel and by September the novel <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the publisher. In financial need, Caine sold the copyright to Chatto & Windus for £150, signing the contract on 27 September 1887. Unfortunately for Caine, the terms of the contract meant that he did not gain the wealth of royalties when the book became a best-seller upon its release in November. Indeed, in 1921 when Caine wanted to release his Collected Works through a different publisher, he would have to pay £350 to Chatto & Windus for the rights to The Deemster.|$|E

500|$|Starr {{left the}} band {{shortly after the}} Hollywood Rock concert in Rio de Janeiro in January 1993, stating {{that he wanted to}} spend more time with his family. Staley told Rolling Stone in 1994 about Starr leaving the band, [...] "It was just a {{difference}} in priorities. We wanted to continue intense touring and press. Mike <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home." [...] Years later, Starr claimed that he was fired due to his drug addiction. Starr was replaced by former Ozzy Osbourne bassist Mike Inez.|$|E
500|$|The Pistols {{were soon}} playing other {{important}} venues, debuting at Oxford Street's 100 Club on 30 March. On 3 April, they {{played for the}} first time at the Nashville, supporting the 101ers. The pub rock group's lead singer, Joe Strummer, saw the Pistols {{for the first time}} that night—and recognised punk rock as the future. A return gig at the Nashville on 23 April demonstrated the band's growing musical competence, but by all accounts lacked a spark. Westwood provided that by instigating a fight with another audience member; McLaren and Rotten were soon involved in the melee. Cook later said, [...] "That fight at the Nashville: that's when all the publicity got hold of it and the violence started creeping in.... I think everybody <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and we were the catalyst." [...] The Pistols were soon banned from both the Nashville and the Marquee.|$|E
500|$|Good Hope {{was built}} by Blyth Harbour and Dock Company at their {{shipyard}} in Blyth, Northumberland and was laid down on 8 November 1943, launched on 5 July 1944 and commissioned on 9 November 1944. The ship was originally named Loch Boisdale, but was renamed by the South Africans after it was transferred by the British while fitting out. After working up at HMS Western Isles in Tobermory, Mull, it {{was assigned to the}} 18th Escort Group of the Western Approaches Command; it was damaged during its first mission and required a month to repair the storm damage. Good Hope rejoined the 18th Escort Group which was covering convoys between England and France until the German surrender in May. It was then refitted for tropical duties before sailing for South Africa on 6 June 1945 with its sister ship, , with 29 ex-prisoners of war aboard the sisters. They arrived on 30 June, but Good Hope was not sent to the Far East because the Japanese surrendered before it <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E

500|$|As a result, Chamberlain {{was less}} dominant, taking only 14% of the team's shots (in his 50.4 ppg season, it was 35.3%), but {{extremely}} efficient: he averaged a career-low 24.1 points, but {{he led the}} league in rebounds (24.2), ended third in assists (7.8), had a record breaking [...]683 field goal accuracy, and played strong defense. For these feats, Chamberlain earned his third MVP award. The Sixers charged their way to a then-record 68–13 season, including a record 46–4 start. In addition, the formerly egotistical Chamberlain began to praise his teammates, lauding hardworking Luke Jackson as the [...] "ultimate power forward", calling Hal Greer a deadly jumpshooter, and point guard Wali Jones an excellent defender and outsider scorer. Off the court, the center invited the team to restaurants and paid the entire bill, knowing he earned 10 times more than all the others. Greer, who was considered a consummate professional and often clashed with the center because of his attitude, spoke positively of the new Chamberlain: [...] "You knew in a minute the Big Fella [...] <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go...</b> and everybody would follow." ...|$|E
500|$|Three weeks later, Beholder {{faced an}} all-star field in {{her return to}} the Pacific Classic on August 20. [...] The field {{included}} her first showdown with 2014 horse of the year California Chrome, as well as Dortmund, whose only career defeats had been to California Chrome and American Pharoah. She also faced Imperative and Hoppertunity, both of whom she had defeated in the previous year's race. [...] Beholder was third favorite on the morning line behind Chrome and Dortmund. California Chrome got the number one post position in the nine-horse field, viewed as an unfavorable draw for him, while Beholder obtained a favorable post at number seven, with Dortmund to her outside. Mandella felt she had trained strongly since her previous loss and <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> [...] Beholder broke cleanly and remained second, stalking California Chrome, who led throughout the entire race. [...] She stalked the pace closely until the mile pole, {{at which point the}} stallion pulled ahead of the field and won by five lengths. [...] Beholder finished [...] lengths ahead of third-place Dortmund. [...] Stevens described her race as a [...] "gutty performance" [...] and Mandella stated, [...] "she ran really good, just second best." [...] Both jockey and trainer expressed respect for the performance of the winner.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2014 NBA draft, Frazier {{worked out}} for several NBA teams, {{including}} the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, Philadelphia 76ers and Washington Wizards. Philadelphia worked him out two times, and head coach Brett Brown invited him to play for them at the 2014 Las Vegas Summer League within an hour after he was not selected in the draft. The situation was {{compared to that of}} Khalif Wyatt, who played for the 76ers through the 2013 edition of the summer league, and attended Temple University in the Philadelphia area. Frazier said, [...] "When [...] reached out to me and said they wanted me for the summer league, I <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> for it. I just want to go out, have fun, play my hardest and show Philly and other teams what they can get from me.". According to the 76ers assistant coach, Chad Iske, he impressed the team's staff by his [...] "poise" [...] and experience at the higher level. At Las Vegas, Frazier averaged 3.4 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.2 steals in five games. On September 29, 2014, the Boston Celtics signed Frazier to a non-guaranteed training camp deal with the likely notion of auditioning with the Maine Red Claws in the future. On October 27, 2014, he was waived by the Celtics after appearing in four preseason games where he went 1-for-2 from the field and recorded two rebounds, four assists and four steals. As expected, four days later, he was acquired by the Maine Red Claws as an affiliate player. Frazier opened his season in the D-League by contributing 18 points, 9 assists, and 4 rebounds against the Oklahoma City Blue. He also shot 12-of-12 on free throws, helping the team win their first game.|$|E
