5|$|A vastly {{different}} application {{can be seen}} in the study of cognitive flexibility and video games. Examining the trait under the guise of “,” Dutch researchers observed that players of first-person shooter games (e.g. Call of Duty, Battlefield) exhibited greater “mental flexibility” on a series of measures than did non-gamers. The researchers posit that, while video game play may be controversial due to frequently graphic content, harnessing the effect of such games could lead to similar gains in various populations (e.g. the elderly, <b>who</b> <b>face</b> cognitive decline) and is therefore socially relevant.|$|E

5|$|The fledgling Union's first film, Kedok Ketawa, was {{released}} in July 1940. Following a young couple <b>who</b> <b>face</b> off against criminals {{with the help of}} a masked bandit, this film was directed by Jo An Djan and starred Oedjang, Fatimah, and Basoeki Resobowo. It received positive reviews; the journalist Saeroen wrote in Pemandangan that the film's quality was comparable to imported Hollywood productions, and a review in Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad praised the cinematography. Following these positive reviews, Union hired Saeroen– who had previously written Terang Boelan and several works for Tan's Film– as a screenwriter. He made his debut for the company with Harta Berdarah, directed by new hires R Hu and Rd Ariffien, following Jo An Djan's departure for Populair's Film. The film, in which a young man convinces a miserly hajji to be more charitable, {{was released}} in October 1940 and starred the singer Soelastri and martial artist Zonder.|$|E

25|$|However, {{these public}} {{reactions}} {{have been criticized}} for embodying white feminism because they do not take into account intersectionality and the increased obstacles that women of color face.

25|$|The ark in {{a synagogue}} {{is almost always}} {{positioned}} {{in such a way}} such that those <b>who</b> <b>face</b> it are facing towards Jerusalem. Thus, sanctuary seating plans in the Western world generally face east, while those east of Israel face west. Sanctuaries in Israel face towards Jerusalem. Occasionally synagogues face other directions for structural reasons; in such cases, some individuals might turn to face Jerusalem when standing for prayers, but the congregation as a whole does not.|$|E

A coffee shop, run jointly by parishioners from the Chapel Royal and St Peter's Church on behalf of local charities, operates every Saturday.

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that claims of Medigap’s tendency to cause over-treatment may be exaggerated and that potential savings from restricting it might be smaller than expected. Meanwhile, there are some concerns about the potential effects on enrollees. Individuals <b>who</b> <b>face</b> high charges with every episode of care have been shown to delay or forgo needed care, jeopardizing their health and possibly increasing their health care costs down the line. Given their lack of medical training, most patients tend to have difficulty distinguishing between necessary and unnecessary treatments. The problem could be exaggerated among the Medicare population, which has low levels of health literacy.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of their career, the members of Point of Grace have had their hearts drawn to reaching out to young women. Early on, they began showing support of Mercy Ministries of America, a non-profit organization that helps young women <b>who</b> <b>face</b> life-controlling issues such as abuse, depression, unplanned pregnancies and eating disorders. The group frequently plugged Mercy Ministries at their concerts, and Nancy Alcorn, the founder, would normally go on the road with them or send a graduate from the Mercy Program to share her testimony about the work of Mercy Ministries. Alcorn is a regular featured speaker at the Girls of Grace conferences.|$|E
25|$|The fifth carved band is {{of small}} figurines, mostly females with various {{expressions}} facing the viewer, while periodically the band includes Yakshas <b>who</b> <b>face</b> towards {{the inside of}} the temple. This layer also has numerous dancers and musicians, as well as professionals with their tools. The band above has pillasters between some of which are carved secular figures mostly females and couples. A nature and creepers band wraps the temple above the pillaster band, with scenes of the Ramayana epic included in this band. Above this layer are scenes from common life depicting kama, artha and dharma. Included here are couples in courtship, eroticism and sexual scenes, followed by couples with children, economic and festive activities. Towards the north outer wall, friezes with scenes from the Mahabharata are portrayed.|$|E
25|$|During the {{recession}} of 2008, SNAP participation hit an all-time high. Arguing in support for SNAP, the Food Research and Action Center argued that “putting more resources quickly {{into the hands of}} the people most likely to turn around and spend it can both boost the economy and cushion the hardships on vulnerable people <b>who</b> <b>face</b> a constant struggle against hunger.” Researchers have found that every $1 that is spent from SNAP results in $1.73 of economic activity. In California, the cost-benefit ratio is even higher: for every $1 spent from SNAP between $3.67 to $8.34 is saved in health care costs. The Congressional Budget Office also rated an increase in SNAP benefits as one of the two most cost-effective of all spending and tax options it examined for boosting growth and jobs in a weak economy.|$|E
