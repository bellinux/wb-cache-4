50|$|An {{aerated lagoon}} or aerated basin is a holding and/or {{treatment}} pond provided with artificial aeration {{to promote the}} biological oxidation of <b>wastewaters.</b> There are many other biological processes for treatment of <b>wastewaters,</b> for example activated sludge, trickling filters, rotating biological contactors and biofilters. They all have in common the use of oxygen (or air) and microbial action to biotreat the pollutants in <b>wastewaters.</b>|$|R
30|$|Many microalgal {{species can}} also be {{cultivated}} in <b>wastewaters</b> {{in addition to their}} specific nutrient media [47] as these effluents are rich in starch, cellulose, carbohydrates, hemicellulose, inorganic and organic compounds [48]. Microalgae are very efficient in removal of toxic metals, phosphorus and nitrogen under controlled environmental conditions from <b>wastewaters.</b> They grow naturally in <b>wastewaters</b> and tolerate varying levels of nitrogen and phosphorus during their growth. The cultivation of microalgae may also reduce the risk of harmful outgrowth of phytoplanktons [49]. Selection of the algal species depends on the type of <b>wastewaters</b> where they are intended to be cultivated.|$|R

Studies of <b>wastewater</b> from Varanasi's sewage treatment plants identify that water's contamination with metals and the reuse of this water for irrigation {{as a way}} that the toxic metals come to be in the plants that people grow for food. One studied example is palak, a popular leafy vegetable which takes up heavy metal when it is in the soil, and which people then eat. Some of the polluting sludge contains minerals which are fertiliser, which could make polluted water attractive to use. Pesticides used in local farming are persistent enough to be spread through the water, to sewer treatment, then back to the farms as <b>wastewater.</b>|$|E

This study was aimed to explore the most {{potential}} agroindustrial <b>wastewaters</b> in dissolving phosphate rock through acidulation in the laboratory scale. The experiment was arranged in a factorial. The first factor was origined of phosphate rock (Sukabumi, west Java and Selagailingga, central Lampung) and the second factor was solvent types (agroindustrial <b>wastewaters</b> which were pineapple, tapioca, tofu industry, and palm oil as well as conventional acid solvents which were HCl, H 2 SO 4, and CH 3 COOH). The incubation processes were 0, 1, 2, and 3 months. The results showed that agroindustrial <b>wastewaters</b> that have the highest potency to solubize phosphate rock was industrial tofu <b>wastewaters</b> and followed by industrial <b>wastewaters</b> of tapioca, palm oil, and pineapple. Both the conventional acid and agroindustrial <b>wastewaters</b> solvent had a big potency to solubilize phosphate rock, however, its highest soluble P-value did not match with the ISO criteria for phosphate fertilizers Quality I (SNI) because it did not reach the solubility of 80 % of its total P 2 O 5, but it has been qualified as a fertilizer both the quality phosphate A, B, and C (SNI) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of advanced oxidation process with the use of Fenton’s reaction on the effectiveness of anaerobic treatment of <b>wastewaters</b> originating from the wood industry that were characterized by a high concentration of formaldehyde. Experiments were established to analyze changes in COD content and in the concentration of formaldehyde in treated <b>wastewaters,</b> additional analyses were carried out to assay quantitative and qualitative changes in the biogas produced. The fi rst stage of the experiment involved analyses of the effectiveness of the tested <b>wastewaters</b> treatment only in the process of methane fermentation. At the second stage of the experiment, the biological process was preceded by chemical pre-treatment of <b>wastewaters</b> with Fenton’s reagent. The conducted study proved that the investigated variants of chemical pre-treatment of <b>wastewaters</b> had a signifi cant effect on increasing the total biogas production. In contrast, no signifi cant effect of the applied technology was demonstrated on changes in the concentration of the analyzed contaminants in the treated <b>wastewaters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Remediation of {{industrial}} <b>wastewaters</b> represents a stringent problem in modern society, which requires particular understanding and ad hoc solutions. In this work, we performed extensive {{experimental study of}} chemical Fenton oxidation {{in order to understand}} the optimal operative conditions to be applied in real industrial <b>wastewaters</b> treatment.

5|$|The dam catalyzed {{improved}} upstream <b>wastewater</b> treatment around Chongqing and its suburban areas. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, as of April 2007 {{more than}} 50 new plants could treat 1.84million tonnes per day, 65% {{of the total}} need. About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5tonnes of solid waste every day. Over onebillion tons of <b>wastewater</b> are released annually into the river, which {{was more likely to}} be swept away before the reservoir was created. This has left the water looking stagnant, polluted and murky.|$|E
5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water {{has become almost}} universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the <b>wastewater</b> collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase <b>wastewater</b> treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in <b>wastewater</b> treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E
40|$|Discharge {{of olive}} mill <b>wastewaters</b> {{is known to}} have adverse effects on environment. Several {{scientific}} treatment technologies were proposed for these effluents. However, they are limited by some economical and technical constraints. Olive mill <b>wastewaters</b> direct agronomical recycling is both classical and innovative alternative for removal of these pollutant effluents. However, this procedure can still not be recommended as safe practice because data is often inconsistent and the physico-chemical characteristics of olive mill <b>wastewaters</b> are not the same depending on several intrinsic and extrinsic aspects. This review compiles and discusses the results of studies conducted worldwide {{over the last two decades}} on the effects of olive mill <b>wastewaters</b> as soil amendment. It particularly focuses on OMW associated eco-toxicity and the capability of the biotic and abiotic components of soils to overcome it. Moreover, it explores olive mill <b>wastewaters</b> bio-transformation in soils and also their potential environmental impact...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} it was {{evaluated}} the adsorption efficiency of calcined eggshell from the egg-breaking {{operations in the}} treatment of <b>wastewaters</b> from different industrial units. It was evaluated the removal of organic material, expressed as chemically oxygen demand (COD), in leachate <b>wastewaters</b> from sanitary landfill (LLWW) and the municipal residual <b>wastewaters</b> (NWW). It was also assessed the efficiency of alkaline metals removal, specifically aluminum, copper, chromium and nickel from effluents from industrial units from superficial treatments. A detailed study of the eggshell characteristics, before and after the absorption process, was carried out, aiming at investigate the adsorption mechanism underlying the removal of different pollutants. Results demonstrate that adsorption of organic material and metals in the calcined eggshell achieved 89 % of organic material (COD) removal in municipal <b>wastewaters</b> and 81 % in landfill leachates <b>wastewaters.</b> It was also verified a removal of 95, 4 % aluminum from residual <b>wastewaters</b> from anodizing industrial plant and a removal of 88 % copper, 95 % chromium and 30 % nickel, in effluents from superficial treatments produced in Ni/Cr plating plants. This evidence demonstrates that calcined eggshell-based adsorbent proved to be appropriated to <b>wastewaters</b> treatment with high contents of organic matter and heavy metals, from different aqueous systems or different industries. The application of this adsorbent in this methodology showed good cost-benefits ratio, which proves that it can be an effective alternative to activated carbon...|$|R

5|$|Wilsonville also {{provides}} its own {{water supply and}} <b>wastewater</b> treatment. The <b>wastewater</b> system was built in 1972, while the water system was upgraded with a new treatment plant in 2002. Water is drawn from the Willamette River from the Wilsonville Water Treatment Plant built {{at a cost of}} $46 million in conjunction with the Tualatin Valley Water District. The city used to use wells to provide drinking water, but those began to run dry in the late 1990s. The plant’s initial capacity was 15 million gallons per day, but can be expanded to 120 million gallons per day. Neighboring Sherwood will begin receiving water from the plant in 2012.|$|E

40|$|CN- {{has been}} widely used in {{electroplating}} and mining, generating {{a vast amount of}} CN-containing heavy-metal <b>wastewaters.</b> In this research paper, we present a strategy to recycle these cyanide-containing electroplating <b>wastewaters</b> (Ni, Zn, Cr and Fe) with pickle acid liquors (Fe) and produce magnetic nanomaterials. The process includes formation of layered double hydroxides (LDH) as the intermediates and their conversion to valuable magnetic materials. LDH intermediates were first precipitated from these two <b>wastewaters</b> and then thermally converted into superparamagnetic mixed oxide nanomaterials, with the crystallite size of 10 - 25 nm and the saturation magnetization up to 40 emu/g. Specifically, during the conversion, secondary pollution resulting from CN- was significantly reduced. This research thus demonstrates a cost-effective and safe way to treat CN-containing <b>wastewaters</b> and transfer to useful nanomaterials...|$|R
40|$|From the {{distillation}} process after butanol fermentation, <b>wastewaters</b> mainly consisted of organic acids and residual sugars and with high COD (usually > 20, 000 mg/L) are generated.
