50|$|The {{impregnated}} tows {{are then}} literally wound around a mandrel (mold core) {{in a controlled}} pattern to form {{the shape of the}} part. After winding, the resin is then cured, typically using heat. The mold core may be removed or may be left as an integral component of the part(Rosato, D.V.).This process is primarily used for hollow, generally circular or oval sectioned components, such as pipes and tanks. Pressure vessels, pipes and drive shafts have all been manufactured using filament winding. It has been combined with other fiber application methods such as hand layup, pultrusion, and braiding. Compaction is through fiber tension and resin content is primarily metered. The fibers may be impregnated with resin before winding (<b>wet</b> <b>winding),</b> pre-impregnated (dry winding) or post-impregnated. <b>Wet</b> <b>winding</b> has the advantages of using the lowest cost materials with long storage life and low viscosity.

40|$|Abstract. An {{extensive}} experimental {{investigation of}} inplane crushing of composite hexagonal ring system between platens {{has been carried}} out. Woven roving glass/epoxy hexagonal ring system with different angles and arrangement were employed. The rings angles are varying between 45 ° and 70 °. The <b>wet</b> <b>winding</b> process was used to fabricate the woven E-glass fabric /epoxy specimens. Four layers of woven E-glass fabric/epoxy wrapped over wooden mandrel to get thickness of about 3 mm. The composite hexagonal tubes were then cured at room temperature (32 oC) for 24 hours to provide optimum hardness and shrinkage. Repeatability of the results was ensuring by performing the experiments on three identical specimens. Typical histories of their crushing mechanism are presented. Behavior of ring as regards the initial crushing load, post crushing load, energy absorbed and mode of crushing has been presented and discussed. Results showed that the crush failure loads and energy absorption capability are greatly affected by the hexagonal ring geometry, arrangement and loading conditions. As the ring angle increases the energy absorption capacity increases. Composite hexagonal ring with 70 degree exhibited the highest energy absorption capability among tested specimens. It is also found that energy absorption capability for systems crushed in-plane X 2 higher than X 1...|$|E

Small segmental portion of circumference of cylindrical sections was considered as width of composite laminate and of metallic plates, necessary to accommodate 5 rows of fasteners in transverse direction with specified pitch distance. Bolted radial joints between carbon epoxy helical wound flat laminate and 15 CDV 6 steel plates were realized with 8 numbers of steel fasteners distributed in 3 longitudinal and 5 transverse rows at each joint. Helical angle of winding, length and thickness of carbon epoxy laminate was ± 22. 5 °, 458 mm and 11 mm respectively. Length and structural thickness of radial joints, total length and width of assembly test specimen were 98 mm, 18 mm, 870 mm and 169. 43 mm respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project was to develop an innovative manufacturing method that allows reinforcing fibres to be on-line impregnated with thermoplastics during wrapping and laid on a liner. The new process {{is based on the}} principle of in-situ extrusion of molten polymer on to a conventional fibre strand, which was not impregnated with the polymer, just before the fibres are laid on the liner. The project is divided into three units consisting of eight work steps in total to produce a demonstration component {{in the form of a}} fully-wrapped plastic cylinder for service pressures up to 300 bar (burst pressure greater than 900 bar). The concept of on-line impregnation with thermoplastics has been successfully realised using a partially reinforced steel liner. Based on a number of full-scale tests carried out, the good bursting behaviour, fatigue strength and ageing resistance of the component have been demonstrated. A plastic liner has been developed, which is produced by the rotational moulding process and into which the metallic end pieces (openings) are introduced during the moulding process. The plastic liner has been shown to be compatible with and to have a low permeability for the gases such as air and natural gas to be contained in it at high pressure. The plastic liner reinforced with fibres by the <b>wet</b> <b>winding</b> method has attained a burst pressure of 1050 bar on average. Compared to a conventional steel cylinder, its weight is reduced by about 70 %. The new winding technique could not be satisfactorily adopted with the plastic liner. It is therefore necessary to try out other thermoplastics or to develop new process steps in order to achieve sufficient temperature stability during winding. (orig.)
