The two Old Firm matches played for the 1909 Scottish Cup Final attracted a total of 131,000.

The fans believed that the replay would be played to a conclusion and demanded that a period of extra time be played.

60|$|But in the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century the game of Cheat the Prophet was made far more difficult than it had ever been before. The reason was, that there were so many prophets and so many prophecies, that it was difficult to elude all their ingenuities. When a man did something free and frantic and entirely his own, a horrible thought struck him afterwards; it might have been predicted. Whenever a duke climbed a lamp-post, when a dean got drunk, he could not be really happy, he could not be certain that he was not fulfilling some prophecy. In {{the beginning}} of the twentieth century you could not see the ground for clever men. They were so common that a stupid man was quite exceptional, and when they found him, they followed him in crowds down the street and treasured him up and gave him some high post in the State.

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} essay {{is to find out}} if neo-fascist {{connection}} will change the next generations citizens (in this specific case ninth graders) opinions about a specific political party. In modern day Sweden, only one political party stands for political ideas that can be seen as neo-fascist (Sverigedemokraterna). <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if the <b>next</b> generation citizens saw this connection and how would they respond? That’s what {{this essay is}} all about, are the students “positive”, “negative” or “on changed” to a neo-fascist political party? The studies research type is mainly of a qualitative nature but quantitative elements occur. The data is coming from two classes of ninth graders that answered eight questions each. The questions remained the same for all students but with one crucial difference. One of the classes answered the questions before they had been informed of the neo-fascist connections that Sverigedemokraterna can be linked too. And the other class answered the questions after they had been informed. The difference in data seems {{to point out that the}} next generations citizens seem to think that it´s worse to be a fascist then a racist. It seems that if a political party is seen as racist party the image deters possible voters. Simultaneously the same racism that deter people also gain votes, therefore it could be said that racism has two faces. If you compare racism and fascism it seems like fascism don´t follow the same pattern...|$|R

40|$|Temporal {{information}} carries {{information about}} changes {{and time of}} the changes. Consider a company investing in another company. The former may choose to inject the money gradually with the amount and frequency depending {{on the performance of}} the latter. This shows that an event can be completed in multiple steps and at any given time before completion, it is partially completed. Thus, the status of an event at any time could be described by some degree of completion. One can make inference based on such temporal information to predict <b>what</b> event(s) <b>would</b> likely <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b> The prediction could be made not only based on the completed or partially completed events in the past, but also based on the correlation between the events, which have taken place (i. e. executed events), and the ones planned (i. e. planned events). This process of making inference based on the executed and planned temporal events is described lively as "Back to the Future" and can be considered as part of the formally-called temporal information inference. Existing temporal information processing frameworks (e. g., temporal database, temporal information extraction, and temporal logic), however, are ineffective for this purpose. We define a novel logical framework for two-dimensional (i. e., executed and planned time lines) temporal information representing and inferencing. An operational model realising the logical framework in financial news data is also addressed. Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{overlooked}} dimension of time judgments, namely subjective judgments {{of the speed}} of time passage: how fast time is judged as passing. It has examined how people make judgments {{of the speed of}} time passage and what factors influence people’s judgments of the speed of time passage. Chapter 2 first unravels the cognitive processes that underlie judgments of the speed of time passage: the more attention is paid to non-temporal information, the faster time is judged as passing; it also disentangles judgments of the speed of time passage from duration judgments (i. e., judgments about how long time lasted), demonstrating that it is not reliable to infer judgments of the speed of time passage from duration judgments. Chapter 3 builds upon the previous chapter and examines two factors: presentation speed of stimuli and comparison, which might interfere with the role of attentional processes in judging the speed of time passage. It shows that both presentation speed of stimuli and comparison could influence people’s judgments of the speed of time passage, but they could not replace the role of attentional processes: when either presentation speed of stimuli or comparison is missing, people can always rely on attentional processes to make judgments of the speed of time passage. Chapter 4 examines the influence of unpredictability on people’s judgments of the speed of time passage. It shows that time is judged as passing faster when people are in both temporal unpredictable situations where they cannot predict when the events <b>would</b> <b>happen,</b> and in content unpredictable situations where they cannot predict <b>what</b> events <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b> Chapter 5 examines the influence of spatial directions of movements on judgments of the speed of time passage. It shows the effect that people judge time as passing faster for the left-to-right movements than the right-to-left movements. This effect was also replicated with Farsi speakers. Overall, the work in this thesis shows original empirical evidence about how people make judgments of the speed of time passage; specifically, it discloses the underlying mechanism of judgments of the speed of time passage (i. e., attentional processes) as well as the factors that influence people’s judgments of the speed of time passage such as presentation speed of stimuli, comparison, unpredictability and spatial directions of movements...|$|R
50|$|One Samhain {{night when}} the warriors of Cruachan were feasting, King Aillil offered a prize to any man who was brave enough to put a wicker band around the ankle of a corpse that had been hanged. Because Samhain was {{considered}} to be a {{night when the}} dead have power, only Nera was courageous enough to volunteer. When he placed the wicker band around the corpse's ankle, it moved and asked him for water. Nera allowed it to climb on his back and he carried it to a house, but flames sprang up around the house when they approached. They tried a second house, which was then surrounded by water. On their third attempt, they were able to enter the house, and the corpse drank three cups of water, spitting the last out on the householders and killing them. Nera returned the corpse to the gallows, but when he went back to court the hall was on fire and all of the inhabitants had been decapitated. He thought he saw an army going into the Hill of Cruachan, so he followed them. Inside the hill, he met a woman of the sidhe who told him that the destruction that he had seen was only a vision of <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> on the <b>next</b> Samhain night unless the warriors of Medb and Aillil destroyed the Hill of Cruachan and defeated the sidhe army.
