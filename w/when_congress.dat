5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Congress</b> {{created the}} Michigan Territory in 1805, it used the Northwest Ordinance's {{language}} {{to define the}} territory's southern boundary, which therefore differed from that in Ohio's state constitution. This difference, and its potential ramifications, apparently went unnoticed at the time, but it established the legal basis for the conflict that would erupt 30 years later.|$|E
5|$|After Kerr's death, Randall was the {{consensus}} {{choice of the}} Democratic caucus, and {{was elected to the}} Speakership <b>when</b> <b>Congress</b> returned to Washington on December 2, 1876. He assumed the chair at a tumultuous time, as the presidential election had just concluded the previous month with no clear winner. The Democratic candidate, Samuel J. Tilden of New York, had 184 electoral votes, just shy of the 185 needed for victory. Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican, had 163; the remaining 22 votes were in doubt.|$|E

5|$|Although a Senate seat {{would be}} {{disposed}} of by the Ohio General Assembly after the resignation of John Sherman to become Treasury Secretary, Hayes needed Garfield's expertise {{to protect him from}} the agenda of a hostile Congress, and asked him not to seek it. Garfield, as the president's key legislator, gained considerable prestige and respect for his role. <b>When</b> <b>Congress</b> debated what became the Bland-Allison Act, to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender dollar coins, Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard, but it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.|$|E
5|$|Beginning as a supporter, Greeley {{soon became}} disillusioned with President Johnson, whose Reconstruction {{policies}} allowed the quick formation of state governments without provision for suffrage for the freedman. <b>When</b> <b>Congress</b> convened and gradually {{took control of}} Reconstruction, Greeley generally supported their actions, favoring universal male suffrage and, his anger against the Confederates having cooled, amnesty. While Greeley generally supported the Radical Republicans, {{he did not like}} the harshness of Thaddeus Stevens. Greeley ran for Congress in 1866, but lost badly, and for Senate in the legislative election held in early 1867, to be defeated by Roscoe Conkling.|$|E
5|$|In January 1897, McKinley offered Sherman the Secretary of State position, which Sherman, {{facing a}} {{difficult}} reelection campaign in 1898, quickly accepted. His appointment was swiftly confirmed <b>when</b> <b>Congress</b> convened that March. The appointment {{was seen as}} a good one, but many in Washington soon began to question whether Sherman, at age 73, still had the strength and intellectual vigor to handle the job; rumors circulated to that effect, but McKinley did not believe them. Asked for advice on the inaugural address, Sherman offered a draft threatening intervention in Cuba, then in rebellion against Spain; the suggestion was ignored.|$|E

5|$|Lower {{courts are}} split {{on whether the}} Clause {{requires}} that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence {{at the time the}} crime was committed. Some courts have held that it does. Others have held that it does not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial. Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity <b>when</b> <b>Congress</b> prospectively divides a judicial district, but retains the former configuration for past offenses.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Congress</b> reconvened in December 1931, the Republicans {{nominally}} {{controlled the}} Senate by the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Charles Curtis, but, as Hoover later wrote, {{there was no}} real majority as Borah and other progressives were against the administration. After the Bonus Army marched on Washington, Borah and Hoover agreed that no action should be taken on their demands so long as the ex-soldiers remained in the capital. Borah considered their presence intimidating to Congress, but was angered when they were forcibly dispersed.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Congress</b> reconvened in July, {{it passed}} a Reconstruction Act against Johnson's position, {{waited for his}} veto, {{overruled}} it, and went home. In addition to clarifying {{the powers of the}} generals, the legislation also deprived the President of control over the Army in the South. With Congress in recess until November, Johnson decided to fire Stanton and relieve one of the military commanders, General Philip Sheridan, who had dismissed the governor of Texas and installed a replacement with little popular support.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun was reelected to the Senate in 1845 {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Daniel Elliott Huger. He soon became vocally opposed to the Mexican–American War. He believed that it would distort the national character by undermining republicanism in favor of empire and by bringing non-white persons into the country. (See §The evils of war and political parties.) <b>When</b> <b>Congress</b> declared war against Mexico on May 13, he abstained from voting on the measure. Calhoun also vigorously opposed the Wilmot Proviso, an 1846 proposal by Pennsylvania Representative David Wilmot to ban slavery in all newly acquired territories. The House of Representatives, through its Northern majority, passed the provision several times. However, the Senate, where non-slave and slave states had more equal representation, never passed the measure.|$|E
5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. <b>When</b> <b>Congress</b> reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues {{to confirm the}} President's replacement nominees, which they did after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his campaign for governor of New York. Sherman replied {{that it was important}} that the Republican party win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves suggests, to a desire to keep Conkling's New York machine friendly to him as the 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E
5|$|In October 1777, {{after more}} than two years in Congress, President Hancock {{requested}} a leave of absence. He asked George Washington to arrange a military escort for his return to Boston. Although Washington was short on manpower, he nevertheless sent fifteen horsemen to accompany Hancock on his journey home. By this time Hancock had become estranged from Samuel Adams, who disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. <b>When</b> <b>Congress</b> voted to thank Hancock for his service, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against the resolution, as did a few delegates from other states.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, 1921, {{striking}} of the Morgan dollar resumed at the Philadelphia Mint {{under the}} recoinage {{called for by}} the Pittman Act. The same day, Congressman Vestal introduced the Peace dollar authorization bill as a joint resolution. Vestal placed his bill on the Unanimous Consent Calendar, but Congress adjourned for a lengthy recess without taking any action. <b>When</b> <b>Congress</b> returned, Vestal asked for unanimous consent that the bill pass on August 1, 1921. However, one representative, former Republican leader James R. Mann (Illinois) objected, and numismatic historian Roger Burdette suggests that Mann's stature in the House ensured that the bill would not pass. Nevertheless, Vestal met with the ANA {{and told them that}} he hoped Congress would reconsider when it met again in December 1921.|$|E
5|$|The Declaration became {{official}} <b>when</b> <b>Congress</b> {{voted for}} it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed {{it has long been}} the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.|$|E
5|$|Active {{military}} service was a long-held dream for Pierce, who had admired his father's and brothers' service in his youth, particularly {{his older brother}} Benjamin's, {{as well as that}} of John McNeil Jr., husband of Pierce's older half-sister Elizabeth. As a legislator, he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias. As a militia officer himself, he had experience mustering and drilling bodies of troops. <b>When</b> <b>Congress</b> declared war against Mexico in May 1846, Pierce immediately volunteered to join, although no New England regiment yet existed. His hope to fight in the Mexican-American War was one reason he refused an offer to become Polk's Attorney General. General Zachary Taylor's advance slowed in northern Mexico, and General Winfield Scott proposed capturing the port of Vera Cruz and driving overland to Mexico City. Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments, and Pierce was appointed colonel and commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment in February 1847, with Truman B. Ransom as lieutenant colonel and second-in-command.|$|E

5|$|Barkley and {{his wife}} Dorothy took a {{vacation}} after the convention, returning to Kentucky in August 1928 to find that, in his absence, Barkley had been chosen state chairman of Smith's campaign. He campaigned for Smith, but Herbert Hoover won a landslide victory. After the election, Barkley led a coalition of liberal Democrats and Republicans that opposed Hoover's use of protective tariffs, a debate that took particular urgency following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Barkley opposed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, claiming it would cost Americans both jobs and exports, but Congress approved it, and Hoover signed it on June 17, 1930. <b>When</b> <b>Congress</b> adjourned, Barkley accompanied Sherwood Eddy and fellow senators Burton K. Wheeler and Bronson M. Cutting to the Soviet Union in August 1930. He {{was impressed by the}} industrial development brought about by Joseph Stalin's first five-year plan but did not advocate closer diplomatic ties with the Communist nation, as some of his colleagues did.|$|E
5|$|Congress also {{proposed}} the Fourteenth Amendment to the states. Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures {{in a process}} in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts. Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed—by Congress, not the president. Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. By the summer of 1866, <b>when</b> <b>Congress</b> finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was in deep trouble. His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition. When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. <b>When</b> <b>Congress</b> passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E
