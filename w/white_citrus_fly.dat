This {{univoltine}} insect enters obligatory pupal diapause in each generation, while {{little is known}} about the course and the molecular mechanisms of diapause. In this study, the course of diapause was determined by measuring the respiratory rate throughout the pupal stage. In addition, the variation of transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of pupae at five developmental stages (pre-, early-, middle-, late-, and post-diapause) were evaluated by next-generation sequencing technology and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), respectively. A total of 4, 808 genes were significantly altered in ten pairwise comparisons, representing major shifts in metabolism and signal transduction as well as endocrine system and digestive system. Gene expression profiles were validated by qRT-PCR analysis. In addition, 48 metabolites were identified and quantified by 1 H NMR. Nine of which significantly contributed to the variation in the metabolomic profiles, especially proline and trehalose. Moreover, the samples collected within diapause maintenance (early-, middle-, and late-diapause) only exhibited marginal transcriptomic and metabolomic variation with each other. These findings greatly improve our understanding of B. minax diapause and lay the foundation for further pertinent studies...|$|R

40|$|The Chinese <b>citrus</b> <b>fly,</b> Bactrocera minax (Enderlein), {{is one of}} {{the most}} devastating pests of citrus in the {{temperate}} areas of Asia. So far, studies involving molecular biology and physiology of B. minax are still scarce, partly because of the lack of genomic information and inability to rear this insect in laboratory. In this study, de novo assembly of a transcriptome was performed using Illumina sequencing technology. A total of 20, 928, 907 clean reads were obtained and assembled into 33, 324 unigenes, with an average length of 908. 44 bp. Unigenes were annotated by alignment against NCBI non-redundant protein (Nr), Swiss-Prot, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway (KEGG) database. Genes potentially involved in stress tolerance, including 20 heat shock protein (Hsps) genes, 26 glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) genes, and 2 ferritin subunit genes, were identified. These genes may play roles in stress tolerance in B. minax diapause stage. It has previously been found that 20 E application on B. minax pupae could avert diapause, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Thus, genes encoding enzymes in 20 E biosynthesis pathway, including Neverland, Spook, Phantom, Disembodied, Shadow, Shade, and Cyp 18 a 1, and genes encoding 20 E receptor proteins, ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (USP), were identified. The expression patterns of 20 E-related genes among developmental stages and between 20 E-treated and untreated pupae demonstrated their roles in diapause program. In addition, 1, 909 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected, which will contribute to molecular marker development. The findings in this study greatly improve our genetic understanding of B. minax, and lay the foundation for future studies on this species...|$|R

We used a 454 pyrosequencing technology to study in depth the microbial communities associated with gut and reproductive organs of Bactrocera minax. Our dataset consisted of 100, 749 reads with an average length of 400 bp. The saturated rarefaction curves and species richness indices indicate that the sampling was comprehensive. We found highly diverse bacterial communities, with individual sample containing approximately 361 microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A total of 17 bacterial phyla {{were obtained from the}} flies. A phylogenetic analysis of 16 S rDNA revealed that Proteobacteria was dominant in all samples (75 %- 95 %). Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were also commonly found in the total clones. Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Serratia were the major genera. However, bacterial diversity (Chao 1, Shannon and Simpson indices) and community structure (PCA analysis) varied across samples. Female ovary has the most diverse bacteria, followed by male testis, and the bacteria diversity of reproductive organs is richer than that of the gut. The observed variation can be caused by sex and tissue, possibly to meet the host's physiological demands...|$|R

40|$|The Chinese <b>citrus</b> fruit <b>fly,</b> Bactrocera (Tetradacus) minax (Enderlein), {{is one of}} {{the major}} citrus pests in Bhutan and can cause > 50 % {{mandarin}} (Citrus reticulata Blanco) fruit drop. As part of the development of a management strategy for the fly in mandarin orchards, population monitoring and experimental manipulations were carried out to determine: (i) adult emergence period; (ii) adult phenology patterns; (iii) period of crop susceptibility; and (iv) period from fruit drop to pupation. In western Bhutan, adult flies emerge from the overwintering pupal stage in late April/early May. Most flies are mature by the end of May and it is inferred that mating occurs at this time: from the beginning of June males rapidly disappear from the population and by mid- to late June are rare or absent from traps. Mature females are present in the mandarin crop at the beginning of June, but very little oviposition occurs until mid-June, while most damage has occurred by mid-July. Initiation of oviposition into mandarins is almost certainly linked to crop phenology. Adult flies disappear from the orchard system during August. After fruit drop, larvae were recorded leaving the fruit to pupate within 13 days. The use of early to mid-season protein bait sprays and/or targeted use of systemic insecticides during the one month oviposition period, plus the removal of fallen fruit once every 10 days, are recommended as control strategies.

40|$|Introduction. African fruit production, {{as well as}} {{regional}} and international fruit trade, have experienced heavy economic losses {{over the past decade}} due to the damage caused by fruit flies, especially B. invadens Drew Tsuruta & White (Tephritidae: Diptera). Bactrocera invadens attacks fruits belonging to numerous botanical families, several of which are of great economic importance. The females of these flies generally lay their eggs in mature fruits, but some can lay in green-immature fruits. Materials and methods. The influence of the species, variety and phenology of fruits on the fruit attractiveness to B. invadens and the elicitation of B. invadens egg-laying behaviour were studied in the laboratory. Fruits harvested regularly during the years 2008 and 2009 from orchards in the Niayes area (Senegal) were exposed to gravid females in cages set for the different factors tested. The exposed fruits were then incubated and the pupae emerging from them were counted. Results and discussion. Bactrocera invadens females laid eggs in ripe fruits. Within the same fruit species, the variety {{plays an important role in}} egg-laying preference. Hence, among the mango varieties tested, the Pêche variety hosted the highest number of pupae per fruit, while the Palmer variety hosted the lowest number. Comparison among different fruit species showed that mature papaya was more infested than mature mango or <b>citrus.</b> Furthermore, <b>flies</b> were unable to develop on lime. Conclusion. Our study showed that B. invadens can infest green and ripe host fruits, and even immature abscised fruits. Consequently, management of this pest must include preventive measures in the development and implementation of an integrated management system. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

50|$|In 1912, Shary {{made his}} way to the Rio Grande Valley and {{realized}} the possibilities of this lush area. At the time it was largely brush and cactus, but Shary was impressed with citrus crops that were being grown by early citrus experimenters and felt that citrus was the crop of the future for Texas. Citrus crops needed irrigation and in 1914 Shary purchased the First Lift Station which pumped life giving water from the Rio Grande to irrigate 15,000 acres (61 km²) of surrounding crops. The chimney from the lift station has been designated a Texas historical landmark and is still standing at the site of Chimney Park in Mission, Texas. That following year Shary planted the first commercial citrus orchard. His first crops were seeded <b>white</b> grapefruit. His <b>citrus</b> empire would eventually grow to almost 15,000 acres (60 km²) of groves. The first commercial shipments of citrus, packed in onion crates, were shipped from the lower Rio Grande Valley in 1920. By 1922 much of the land had been transformed into citrus groves, and cotton, onion, and vegetable fields. Shary took the lead in organizing and building the United Irrigation Company, in order to assure water supplies for future developments.|$|R
