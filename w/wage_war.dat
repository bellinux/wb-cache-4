5|$|In the semi-legendary {{period of}} the early republic, sources record Rome was twice {{attacked}} by Etruscan armies.

Again in 508 BC Tarquin persuaded the king of Clusium, Lars Porsenna, to <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> on Rome, resulting in a siege of Rome and afterwards a peace treaty.|$|E

A Byzantine fleet under Niketas Kastamonites was sent against him, but Tzachas defeated it in battle. Some modern scholars have speculated that his activities during this time {{may have been in}} conjunction, and perhaps even coordination, with two contemporary Byzantine Greek rebels, Rhapsomates in Cyprus, and Karykes in Crete.|$|E
5|$|Mary strived {{for peace}} in the Netherlands. Charles paid no {{attention}} to the problems she was facing as governor and often ignored her warnings. One such incident led to Charles's loss of the city of Metz to France. Mary was forced to <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> against France in 1537 and to deal with the Revolt of Ghent between 1538 and 1540. Mary's appointment as Governor of the Netherlands was renewed on 14 October 1540, after the revolt in Ghent had been subdued.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarians {{recruited}} {{an army of}} 40,000, many drawn locally from Transylvania. Many knights and Hungarian aristocrats followed, one of {{them being}} Stefan Báthory.

The Moldavians, being fewer in number and seeing that the Hungarians were determined to <b>wage</b> <b>war,</b> started to evacuate the population close to the Hungarian border and blockaded the passages by cutting down trees and placing them on the roads.|$|E

Seward submitted it to Lincoln, who, realizing that the Union was {{in no position to}} battle both the South and Britain, toned it down considerably, and made it merely a memorandum for Adams's guidance.|$|E

5|$|After {{a fierce}} battle, Ozai slams Aang into a rock, hitting the {{scar on his}} back from Azula's {{lightning}} in the previous season and inadvertently releasing his locked seventh chakra, allowing Aang to enter the Avatar State. With the combined power of his past lives, Aang quickly overwhelms Ozai but refuses to kill him. After subduing Ozai, Aang finally understands the lion-turtle's meaning and uses energybending to strip Ozai of his Firebending powers, removing his ability to <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> while Sozin's Comet vanishes beyond the horizon.

5|$|Aircraft {{were used}} for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role was {{advanced}} considerably. Innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel); and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to <b>wage</b> <b>war).</b> Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, such as the German 88 mm gun. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Although the Byzantine–Bulgarian {{conflict}} {{that began in}} 913 was provoked by the Byzantines, it was the Bulgarian monarch Simeon I (r. 893–927) who was seeking pretext to <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> and fulfil his ambitions to claim an imperial title for himself and to assume the throne of Constantinople. Unable to confront the Bulgarians, the Byzantines reluctantly recognized Simeon I as Emperor of Bulgaria (in Bulgarian, Tsar) as early as July 913 but the decision was revoked after a palace coup in Constantinople in 914. Three years later, in 917, the main Byzantine forces were routed in the Battle of Achelous and the Bulgarians took the military initiative. In the four year that followed they launched a number of successful campaigns, reaching the walls of Constantinople and the Isthmus of Corinth.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{perceived}} the unrest in Scotland as a rebellion against his authority, precipitating the First Bishops' War in 1639. Charles {{did not seek}} subsidies from the English Parliament to <b>wage</b> <b>war,</b> but instead raised an army without parliamentary aid and marched to Berwick-upon-Tweed, {{on the border of}} Scotland. Charles's army did not engage the Covenanters as the king feared the defeat of his forces, whom he believed to be significantly outnumbered by the Scots. In the Treaty of Berwick, Charles regained custody of his Scottish fortresses and secured the dissolution of the Covenanters' interim government, albeit at the decisive concession that both the Scottish Parliament and General Assembly of the Scottish Church were called.|$|E

5|$|In 1777, the Revolutionary War {{intensified}} in Kentucky. British {{lieutenant governor}} Henry Hamilton armed his Indian allies from his headquarters at Fort Detroit, {{encouraging them to}} <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> on the Kentucky settlers in hopes of reclaiming the region as their hunting ground. The Continental Army could spare no men for an invasion in the northwest or {{for the defense of}} Kentucky, which was left entirely to the local population. Clark spent several months defending settlements against the Indian raiders as a leader in the Kentucky County militia, while developing his plan for a long-distance strike against the British. His strategy involved seizing British outposts north of the Ohio River to destroy British influence among their Indian allies.|$|E
5|$|In December 1829, Rosas became {{governor}} of the province of Buenos Aires and established a dictatorship backed by state terrorism. In 1831, he signed the Federal Pact, recognising provincial autonomy and creating the Argentine Confederation. When his term of office ended in 1832, Rosas departed to the frontier to <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> on the indigenous peoples. After his supporters launched a coup in Buenos Aires, Rosas was asked to return and once again took office as governor. Rosas reestablished his dictatorship and formed the repressive Mazorca, an armed parapolice that killed thousands of citizens. Elections became a farce, and the legislature and judiciary became docile instruments of his will. Rosas created a cult of personality and his regime became totalitarian in nature, with all aspects of society rigidly controlled.|$|E

He was apparently accepted as king by {{some or all of}} the Danes in England and in 903 he induced the East Anglian Danes to <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> on Edward. This ended in disaster, with the death of Æthelwold and of Eohric of East Anglia in a battle in the Fens.|$|E

He repeatedly defeated the East Angles and drove Cenwalh the king of Wessex into exile for three years. He continued to <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> against the Bernicians of Northumbria.

The film follows the four boys Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick as they sneak into an R-rated film featuring Canadian actors Terrance and Phillip and begin cursing incessantly. Eventually, their mothers pressure the United States to <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> against Canada for allegedly corrupting their children.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} unrest {{reached its}} most serious {{stage in the}} two civil wars or marches upon Rome by the consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla {{at the beginning of}} 82 BC. In the Battle of the Colline Gate at the very door of the city of Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Roman senate and its Samnite allies. Whatever the merits of his grievances against those in power of the state, his actions marked a watershed of the willingness of Roman troops to <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> against one another that was {{to pave the way for}} the wars of the triumvirate, the overthrowing of the Senate as the de facto head of the Roman state, and the eventual endemic usurpation of power by contenders for the emperor-ship in the later Empire.|$|E
