500|$|According to MTV, {{the initial}} concept {{for the music}} video was to portray Spears {{on the porch of}} a beachfront home {{watching}} a group of kids having fun, prompting flashbacks about her former boyfriend. The video begins with Spears going to the telescope, and Spears is looking through a telescope. The concept was later changed a man and a dog walk on the beach, portraying the singer as the girl next door, watching her love interest, played by model Chad Cole, from afar. The beach location was kept, and the music video intercuts with scenes of Spears' dancing on the Paradise Cove pier with her dancers dressed all in beach-friendly white attire, then Spears sits near a car. A writer of Rolling Stone noted the video is best known for [...] "purifying the sexy persona Spears introduced in the '... Baby One More Time' video", while describing it as [...] "a virginal Britney in a long, flowing white dress (and other demure outfits) gazes at a clean-cut boy on the beach, then she walks on the balcony with a pink ball, then does some chaste choreography that features her dancers forming a heart while she sings that she only wants to [...] "hold you tight, treat you right." [...] Spears is sitting on a picnic blanket <b>wishing</b> <b>she</b> was there with him. She leaves alone." [...] On February 20, 2012, behind the scenes footage of the music video leaked online.|$|E
500|$|Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly {{commanded}} {{the direction of}} Åkerlund, but criticized Spears for her lack of involvement, and commented, [...] "It’s hard not to wonder: Is Britney having any fun?" [...] Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic stated the video lived up to hype of the teasers, and added that it was unquestionably one of her [...] "artier" [...] videos to date. Drew Grant of Salon.com said that despite the product placement, the video [...] "s visually stunning, with a 'Matrix' meets 'The Cell' vibe that will have Lady Gaga <b>wishing</b> <b>she</b> had thought of IV paint drips first." [...] Alex Catarinella of The Huffington Post deemed it as her greatest and most mature work, and said the video was ultimately simple in its concept, and added, [...] "The once picture-perfect pop star has returned and is offering fans the new, worn-and-torn and yes, stronger than yesterday Britney." [...] The use of product placement received criticism from the media. Megan Gibson of Time said that the video was [...] "borderline insulting" [...] and commented, [...] "we get that it's hard economic times all around, but couldn't they have been a tad more subtle with ?". Liz Kelly of The Washington Post called the clip [...] "an infomercial" [...] and said, [...] "I would write more, but suddenly {{feel the need to}} put on some Make Up Forever and dash out to buy a Sony flat screen TV." [...] ‘Hold It Against Me’ video got a certified in the digital platform VEVO on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune {{said the}} episode {{appeared}} to be heading in a better direction than the first season and, regarding Leslie, added [...] "You start to root for her this season, instead of <b>wishing</b> <b>she</b> would go away." [...] She also praised the [...] "Parent's Just Don't Understand" [...] rap, comparing it to Poehler's acclaimed rap about the-vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during a Saturday Night Live sketch. Matt Fowler of IGN said [...] "Pawnee Zoo" [...] was [...] "more solidly entertaining" [...] than the entire first season, and made a stronger effort {{to build up the}} supporting cast, particularly by establishing a romance between Jones and Schneider. Fowler particularly praised Pratt and voiced excitement for his new subplot. San Francisco Chronicle writer Tim Goodman, who was very critical of the Parks and Recreation first season, said [...] "Pawnee Zoo" [...] brought new life to the series. Goodman felt the Leslie character was less clueless and ditzy, and that same-sex marriage was [...] "perfect fodder" [...] for the show. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club commented the [...] "Pawnee Zoo" [...] plot was strong, the supporting cast performed well and that Poehler feels [...] "a lot more comfortable in Knope's skin." [...] But Heisler said it [...] "isn't the best thing on tonight." [...] Not all reviews were positive. Verne Gay of Newsday voiced admiration for Parks and Recreation, but found [...] "Pawnee Zoo" [...] to be [...] "flat, forced and messagey", and did not make proper use of the supporting cast. He gave the premiere episode a C+ grade. Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline praised Poehler and the [...] "Parents Just Don't Understand" [...] opening, but felt cast members like Jones are wasted. He also said there is little chemistry between Jones and Schneider.|$|E
