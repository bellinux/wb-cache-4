40|$|The {{genesis of}} Hurricane Hernan (1996) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern Pacific was {{investigated}} using gridded analyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and gridded outgoing longwave radiation. Hernan developed {{in association with}} a <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>easterlies</b> that could be tracked back to Africa in longitude–time plots of the filtered � component of the wind (2 – 6 -day period) at 700 mb. The wave crossed Central America near Lake Nicaragua with little change in its southwest–northeast tilt, but the most intense convection shifted from near <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> axis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean to west of <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> axis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific. <b>The</b> <b>wave</b> intensified as it moved through a barotropically unstable background state (defined by a low-pass filter with a 20 -day cutoff) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western Caribbean and eastern Pacific. A surge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southwesterly monsoons and enhanced convection along 10 �N occurred {{to the west of}} <b>the</b> 700 -mb <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific and traveled with the wave. This had the effect of enhancing low-level vorticity over a wide region ahead of the 700 -mb wave. Available evidence suggests that additional low-level vorticity was produced by enhanced flow from the north through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as the 700 -mb wave approached. Depression formation did not occur until 6 – 12 h after the 700 mb wave reached this region of large low-level vorticity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Tehuantepec. Eastern Pacific SST and vertical wind shear magnitude are typically favorable for tropical cyclone development in Northern Hemisphere summer and early fall. Because the favorable mountain interaction and <b>the</b> surge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low-level monsoons appear to relate directly to <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>easterlies,</b> it is argued that the strength of such waves reaching Central America from the east {{is the single most important}} factor in whether subsequent eastern Pacific cyclogenesis occurs. Possible parallels with western Pacific cyclogenesis are discussed. 1...|$|R
50|$|Under {{specific}} circumstances, upper cold lows {{can break}} {{off from the}} base of the TUTT.

Upper cyclones and upper troughs which trail tropical cyclones can cause additional outflow channels and aid in their intensification process.

50|$|Tropical waves, easterly waves, or {{tropical}} easterly waves, {{also known}} as African <b>easterly</b> <b>waves</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic region, are a type of atmospheric trough, an elongated area of relatively low air pressure, oriented north to south, which moves {{from east to west}} across the tropics causing areas of cloudiness and thunderstorms.
