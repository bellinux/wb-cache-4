500|$|Kh치nh {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to meet with Qu치t and his cabinet in a building at Tan Son Nhut. It was the new ministry's first meeting, and Taylor and General William Westmoreland, the commander of US forces in Vietnam, were present. Due to the poor relations, Kh치nh <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> were plotting against him. He thus suspected their insistence on his attending Qu치t's first cabinet meeting {{to be part of a}} trap, and decided to excuse himself partway through the meeting to go [...] "on tour", at which point he saw troops massing around the perimeter of the air field.|$|E
60|$|Hereupon Clennam {{said that}} he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> would still receive her kindly, if she should ever desire to return.|$|E
6000|$|Ah! I always <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> had rich friends, {{though they}} keep it so close. Never {{let me hear}} of their poverty after this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! yes: I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> will, my Pluto! I {{will ask}} them to, I will ask them myself, I will request them, as a {{particular}} and personal favour to myself, {{to be very}} careful indeed. And if they do their duty, and I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> will, they shall be styled, as a reward, [...] "Proserpine's Own Guards."' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. [With a smile.] Then I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> {{perfectly}} right.|$|R
6000|$|This charming sentiment, {{recommended}} {{as much by}} {{sense as}} novelty, gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> will consent," [...] was her frequent declaration; [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> delighted with you." ...|$|R
60|$|Her mother sighed, {{and said}} bravely that she <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> all got on very pleasantly as it was, {{and that she}} was {{perfectly}} satisfied if Tom was.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} smiled sympathetically, {{and said he}} <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> would not keep Miss Saunders long at the block. [...] "There's {{a friend of mine}} I should like to bring here, some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|Acute {{satisfaction}} flooded over Harris. [...] "You do? I {{was sure}} the natives would know." [...] He stood up again. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> would, if the Pipers really existed. Then they do exist, do they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will soon}} learn our {{language}}," [...] {{he said to}} the mate, [...] "and I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> will make good sailors. I have put down their wages and share of prize money at half that of our own men, and I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> will <b>be</b> well worth it, when they get to speak the language and learn their duties." ...|$|R
5000|$|Do {{not tell}} your {{troubles}} to others unless you <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> {{want to hear}} them.|$|R
60|$|Trick. You shall feel no where: I {{have felt}} already and <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> lost.|$|R
6000|$|Certainly, Barbara {{would think}} again. No, she didn't {{see why it}} was of course. She didn't {{understand}} what Christopher meant. And besides she <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> wanted her up stairs by this time, and she must go, indeed-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Annabel turned pale, but Venetia {{was still}} sanguine. 'They are at Sarzana,' she said; 'they {{must be at}} Sarzana: you see George was right. He said he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> were at Sarzana. Besides, dear mother, he heard they were at Sarzana.' ...|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} the voice came so near to Zeb that he jumped back in alarm. Two childish voices laughed merrily at this action, and Dorothy <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> {{were in no}} danger among such light-hearted folks, even if those folks couldn't be seen.|$|E
5000|$|... "Mini-states Down Under <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> can secede" [...] by Nick Squires, The Daily Telegraph, 24 February 2005 ...|$|R
6000|$|Their breakfast so warm to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> did eat, [...] A custom in {{travellers}} mighty discreet. [...] Prior.|$|R
60|$|He and Phil {{had picked}} up several small nuggets, so that all <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> had really {{discovered}} the lost mine.|$|R
60|$|For I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> {{had been}} burnt, {{perhaps more than}} once. How, I never learned, for which I am rather sorry for it {{interests}} me to study burnt fingers, {{if they do not}} happen to be my own. Then we changed the subject.|$|E
60|$|He {{argued with}} the ape-man therefore, against the latter's desire to exterminate the blacks, {{and at last}} he prevailed upon Tarzan to follow them in peace, saying that he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> would lead {{them out of the}} forest into a rich country, teeming with game.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know! I saw he {{had been}} getting into a fix with those Grevilles, and had been sold somehow. They said something, {{and got out of}} my way directly, and I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> had done some mischief, and left him to pay the cost." ...|$|E
60|$|The riders {{dared not}} answer. <b>They</b> must <b>be</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>They</b> gazed through narrow slits of eyelids; {{and the silence}} grew intense.|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE. I was not. But oh, sister, I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> suspect, else {{why should}} they be here? They never {{frequent}} balls.|$|R
2500|$|... "Thus, my lord, your jury is safely packed, {{and your}} verdict, or rather vote, <b>is</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>They</b> poll {{to a man}} for the Crown." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those {{twins are}} real nice children," [...] said Mrs. Rachel, when she <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> {{were out of}} earshot. [...] "Dora is so womanly and helpful, and Davy is {{developing}} into a very smart boy. He isn't the holy terror for mischief he used to be." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{moment later}} the captain came on deck {{followed}} by Lowell. They gazed sharply about, and I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> were counting {{to see if any}} of the men were missing, for presently the boatswain entered the forecastle to see if one of the men was not there.|$|E
60|$|I {{remarked that}} I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> could, {{and for the}} next half-hour talked almost without interruption, keeping nothing back and {{explaining}} that I was anxious to find someone who would finance an expedition to search for this particular plant; as I believed, the only one of its sort that existed in the world.|$|E
60|$|Binet was amused. It was droll; {{it showed}} a ready fancy. Oh, to <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>they</b> must get to work {{together}} on those scenarios.|$|R
60|$|No, but--They {{have been}} so kind; and the dogs were so kind. I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> knew we <b>were</b> going, and were sorry too.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{expect that}} O'Connor and Dick Ryan {{will turn up}} here, before the spring. I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> will, if they have got together.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Two {{flights of}} stairs were descended, and then they stood before a small but heavy door; some bolts were drawn and a key turned in the lock, this being done so noiselessly that Ronald <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> must have been {{carefully}} oiled. The two men passed through with them, locking the door behind them.|$|E
60|$|At {{nine o'clock}} they started, {{and made their}} way down, with some {{difficulty}} and many slips and falls, into the valley. Then they kept along near the river, till Oswald <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> were close to the ford. He bade them halt here, and went forward alone. Before he had gone fifty yards, he nearly stumbled against a man.|$|E
60|$|Charlotte ran {{as fast as}} {{her legs}} could carry her, for {{she did not want}} any of the other orphans to see her. As a rule, Charlotte liked the company of the other orphans and was a {{favourite}} with them. But, somehow, she did not want them to know about the gaps. She <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> would not understand.|$|E
6000|$|... "If shentlemans {{were seeking}} ta Red Gregarach," [...] he said, [...] "to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> couldna {{expect to find}} her without some wee danger." ...|$|R
50|$|This was {{extremely}} difficult with multiple guns firing since several observers could not <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> all {{looking at the}} same particular gun. The British solved this using a flashboard located at HQ fitted with a combination of buzzers and signal lights connected to the observers by telephone wires, which operated {{in such a way that}} after a sequence of observations, all observers could <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{looking at the same}} gun flashing and its position determined by triangulation.|$|R
