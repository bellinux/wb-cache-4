5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue in order to {{supplement}} and increase royal income in a time when new demands were being made on royal finances. Although derived from the older danegeld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a regularly assessed tax. Also new was the fact later collections were imposed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the barons. However, the main flow of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stage of World War II, the United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively.

The two bombings killed at least 129,000 people (most of whom were civilians) and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in the history of warfare.|$|E
5|$|The Carolingian dynasty was a Frankish noble {{family with}} {{origins in the}} Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD. The family {{consolidated}} its power in the late 8th century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and dux et princeps Francorum hereditary and becoming the real powers behind the Merovingian kings. In 751, a Carolingian, Pepin the Younger, dethroned the Merovingians and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the Papacy and the aristocracy, was crowned King of the Franks.|$|E

Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his Manifesto To the League of Nations, which implored the newly formed League of Nations to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts. The League took little action on the requests.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Mercia Wilfrid acted as bishop <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of King Æthelred. Information on Wilfrid's life {{at this time}} is meagre, as the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi says little of this period. He is {{generally}} considered to have been Bishop of Leicester until about 706, when he is held to have been transferred to Hexham. Wilfrid {{became involved in the}} missionary efforts to the Frisians, which he had started in 678 during his stay in Frisia. Wilfrid helped the missionary efforts of Willibrord, which were more successful than his own earlier attempts. Willibrord was a monk of Ripon who was also a native of Northumbria.|$|E

5|$|Karmal was {{appointed}} Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, synonymous with vice head of state, in the communist government. The Parchamite faction found itself under significant pressure by the Khalqists soon after taking power. In June 1978, a PDPA Central Committee meeting {{voted in favor}} of giving the Khalqist faction exclusive control over PDPA policy. This decision was followed by a failed Parchamite coup, after which Hafizullah Amin, a Khalqist, initiated a purge against the Parchamites. Karmal survived this purge but was exiled to Prague. Karmal remained in exile until December 1979, when the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the Afghan government) to stabilize the country.|$|E

Moments before the wedding, Nisha asks Prem's dog Tuffy to give Prem the necklace that Pooja had given her, along with a letter. Tuffy exits Nisha's room and instead of taking the letter to Prem, delivers it to Rajesh. Rajesh reads the letter and realizes that Prem and Nisha love each other. Subsequently, he halts the wedding and confronts both Nisha and Prem. In the end, Nisha and Prem marry each other <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of their families.

5|$|Responsibility {{for running}} the {{university}} is held at an executive level by the vice-chancellor, but the council is the only body that can recommend changes to the university's statutes and charter, {{with the exception of}} academic ordinances. These can only be made <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the senate, the chief academic body in the university which also holds responsibility for teaching and learning, examinations and research and enterprise. The chancellor and pro chancellors are nominated by council and appointed formally by court, whose additional powers are now limited to these appointments and a few others, including some lay members of council. Finally, Convocation, the body of all staff, ceremonial officers and graduates of the university, returns 100 members to court and one member to council, but is otherwise principally a forum for discussion and to ensure graduates stay in touch with the university.|$|E

5|$|The Flag of Hong Kong between 1959 and 1997 was a Blue Ensign {{with the}} {{coat of arms}} of Hong Kong on a white disk.

In 1959, {{following}} {{a grant from the}} College of Arms and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of Queen Elizabeth II, it was adopted as the flag of British Hong Kong. While the flag lost its official status following 1 July 1997 transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, it resurfaced in the 2010s as a symbol of protest against Chinese intervention in Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|The scandal {{which has}} likely done the {{greatest}} damage to Harding's reputation is Teapot Dome. Like {{most of the}} administration's scandals, it came to light after Harding's death, {{and he was not}} aware of the illegal aspects. Teapot Dome involved an oil reserve in Wyoming which was one of three set aside {{for the use of the}} Navy in a national emergency. There was a longstanding argument that the reserves should be developed; Wilson's first Interior Secretary Franklin Knight Lane was an advocate of this position. When the Harding administration took office, Interior Secretary Fall took up Lane's argument and Harding signed an executive order in May 1921 transferring the reserves from the Navy Department to Interior. This was done <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of Navy Secretary Edwin C. Denby.|$|E

5|$|The two {{versions}} of Ernoul's chronicle tell different stories about John's ascent to the throne of Jerusalem. According to one version, the leading lords of Jerusalem sent envoys to France in 1208 asking Philip II to select a French nobleman as a husband for their queen Maria. Taking {{advantage of the opportunity}} to rid himself of John, Philip II suggested him. In the other version an unnamed knight encouraged the Jerusalemite lords to select John, who accepted their offer with Philip's consent. John visited Pope Innocent III in Rome. The pope donated 40,000 marks for the defence of the Holy Land, stipulating that John could spend the money only <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and the grand masters of the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller.|$|E
5|$|Tvrtko's {{yielding}} in {{the legal}} dispute with Ragusa may have been brought about by another, major change: the death of King Louis I on 11 September 1382. Without a male heir, the Hungarian crown passed to Louis's 13-year-old daughter Mary and the reins of government to his widow, Tvrtko's cousin Elizabeth. The great unpopularity of the queens led to rebellions and presented an opportunity for Tvrtko, not only to reclaim Drijeva and other lands lost to Louis in 1357, but also to seize Kotor. When exactly or how this took place is not known. Already {{in the spring of}} 1383, Tvrtko started building a navy: he bought a galley from Venice, ordered two more to be built, and employed a Venetian patrician as his admiral <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the republic. Around the same time, he erected a new town, Brštanik, near present-day Opuzen.|$|E
5|$|While Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko {{considered}} {{the outcome of}} the war still open, and were planning to use the combined Polish-Lithuanian forces to defeat the still separate Russian forces, King Poniatowski, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the Guardians of the Laws (cabinet of ministers) decided to ask for a ceasefire. Tsarina Catherine demanded that the King Poniatowski joins the pro-Russian aristocratic faction, the Targowica Confederation; with his cabinet split, he gave in to her demand around 22–23 July, which effectively forced Prince Poniatowski to terminate military resistance. The last military confrontation of the war was fought on 26 July at Markuszów in Lublin province, where an enemy attack was repelled by Polish cavalry led by Poniatowski.|$|E
