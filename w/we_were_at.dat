25|$|At Cabinet on {{the morning}} of 30 October Lloyd {{reported}} that the USA was ready to move a motion at the UN condemning Israel, which had attacked Egypt in the Sinai the previous day, as an aggressor. Macleod and Heathcoat Amory approved of Lloyd's suggestion of postponing the attack by 24 hours (in breach, as it happens, of the secret agreement between Britain, France and Israel) in order to bring the Americans on board, although they thought it unlikely to work, but it was not adopted. Macleod was telling others of his dismay that ministers had not been fully informed of the agreement with France and Israel. Either now or at some subsequent meeting Eden apologised to the Cabinet for his reticence “in time of war”, causing Macleod to snap “I was not aware that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> war, Prime Minister!” The Anglo-French ultimatum was on the afternoon of 30 October.|$|E

Not only the first game, because {{that could have been}} an accident – with the weather conditions etc. No, the performance we achieved in Liverpool under bad circumstances – I've never seen such a hectic situation. We drew that game 2–2 and never really had problems. For me, it was the proof that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> the international level." ...|$|E

500|$|The match {{has been}} cited as a pivotal turning point in English football. Author Jason Cowley noted how instead of rioting, as had {{occurred}} at Heysel with fatal consequences, Liverpool fans stayed on after the game and applauded Arsenal [...] "as if they understood that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> the start of something new; {{that there would be}} no returning to the ways of old". Cowley describes the match as [...] "the night football was reborn" [...] and that the event [...] "repaired the reputation of football". Dominic Fifield suggested Arsenal's win [...] "had shattered the myth that Liverpool were invincible," [...] while Si Hughes in The Daily Telegraph wrote it [...] "...set in motion the decline of one of football’s grandest institutions." ...|$|E

As the band had already prepared [...] "about 30 or 40" [...] songs when they entered the studio, DiDia's task was relatively minor. Bassist John Collins said of DiDia; [...] "Nick was really good. The way Nick based the record was {{that he wanted to}} record the band how <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> that particular moment, he didn't want to play around too much." [...] As a result of this attitude, the band only spent one month in the studio, and the album was mixed by DiDia soon after. [...] Powderfinger used the extra time to play table tennis, which was the band's recreation of choice during the Internationalist and Odyssey Number Five recording sessions.|$|E

So since we don't really like having song titles being {{the title of the}} record, 'cause it brings this weird, undue focus to the song, I thought it would be cool to call it Down on the Upside. We started {{thinking}} about all these other titles, and worrying about them describing the whole record without excluding anything... So it was the last minute and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> a photo shoot for Spin and someone called and said, 'We need your title now so we can start doing the record package,' so Matt [...] brought up the title again, and everyone went, 'yeah, that's it.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the suite has always been mixed, and all band members have expressed negativity toward it in recent times.

I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period" [...] and [...] "a good idea but it was dreadful... Atom Heart Mother sounds like we didn't have any idea between us, but we became much more prolific after it." [...] Similarly, in a 1984 interview on BBC Radio 1, Waters said [...] "If somebody said to me now – right – here's a million pounds, {{go out and play}} Atom Heart Mother, I'd say you must be fucking joking." [...] Alec Dubro of Rolling Stone gave Atom Heart Mother a negative review, ultimately stating [...] "if Pink Floyd is looking for some new dimensions, they haven't found them here." ...|$|E

[...] He proceeds to greet everyone in the casino by saying [...] "Hi-how-are-you?" [...] in the rhythm of a stereotypical Native American chant. This joke was pitched by Tom Gammill, and there was a debate among the staff of the show about whether or not to include it in the episode as Native Americans could find it offensive. However, according to Scully, Dan Castellaneta (who voices Homer) [...] "did [...] so funny when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> the table-read so we decided to put it in and risk offending." ...|$|E

In an interview with Christopher Walsh of Billboard, Ballard explained how he and Morissette met, and how [...] "Ironic" [...] was written. He commented: [...] "I'm telling you, within 15 minutes <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> it—just writing. 'Ironic' was the third song we wrote. Oh God, we were just having fun. I thought 'I don't know what this is—what genre it is—who knows? It's just good". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, it is a song set in the time signature of common time, composed in a moderate tempo of eighty-two beats per minute. It {{is set in the}} key of B major with Morissette's vocal range from the tone of E5 to B5, and [...] "Ironic" [...] chord progression starts with the sequence of Emaj7–F♯6–Emaj7–F♯6, before changing to F♯–Badd2–F♯–G♯m7 in the chorus.|$|E

500|$|Since A Thousand Leaves was {{the first}} Sonic Youth album that was {{recorded}} in their own studio, the band had more time and freedom to work on it. As a result, the songs evolved unevenly and were recorded from {{an early stage of}} development. According to guitarist Lee Ranaldo, the album is [...] "a reflection of where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> the time. We weren't into making anything concise. We were just playing what we felt like playing. We really didn't feel like what we needed to be doing was producing another record like Goo." [...] The 11-minute song [...] "Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)" [...] was initially intended to be released on one of the EPs as an instrumental track, but it was ultimately included on the album with vocals. The album was co-produced by the band and Confusion Is Sex producer Wharton Tiers and mastered by Greg Calbi at Masterdisk in New York City.|$|E
500|$|Fired {{partly by}} his mother's stories of joy flights in pre-war Britain, {{and a desire}} to become a flying boat captain for Imperial Airways, Cresswell applied to join the Royal Air Force (RAF) in September 1937. Receiving no answer from the RAF, he applied for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and was accepted. He entered No.1 Flying Training School at Point Cook, Victoria, as an air cadet in July 1938. Over the next twelve months he learnt to fly in Avro Cadet, deHavilland Gipsy Moth and Westland Wapiti trainers, and {{graduated}} as a pilot officer. His first posting was to No.3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron at Richmond, New South Wales, where he began flying Hawker Demon fighters in July 1939. Cresswell recalled a mix of excitement and panic within the squadron when World WarII broke out two months later: [...] "The second night we all slept on the hangar floor next to our aircraft. Imagine it: there was war over in Europe and here <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> action stations!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first week}} of {{recording}} produced [...] "Go", [...] "Blood", [...] "Rats", and [...] "Leash" [...] before the band hit a lull. In order to keep up his intensity, Vedder traveled into San Francisco and began sleeping in his truck, {{as well as the}} sauna at the recording studio. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "Recording Vs., {{there was a lot more}} pressure on Ed. The whole follow-up. I thought we were playing so well as a band that it would take care of itself... He was having a hard time finishing up the songs; the pressure, and not being comfortable being in such a nice place." [...] Ament added that [...] "toward the end it got fairly intense" [...] and that the band [...] "tried to make it as uncomfortable for [...] as we could." [...] Eventually the band was able to get [...] "back on track" [...] according to Ament as Vedder was allowed [...] "to get in the space of his songs." [...] The album was finished in May 1993. Vedder later said, [...] "The second record, that was the one I enjoyed making the least... I just didn't feel comfortable in the place <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> because it was very comfortable. I didn't like that at all." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{band has}} stated that the album's tenth track, [...] "Wretches and Kings", pays homage to the hip-hop group Public Enemy. Speaking to NME about the song's {{reference}} to Public Enemy, Shinoda said, [...] "There is a homage to Chuck D on there. It's probably the most hip-hop song on the record {{and one of the}} most aggressive...Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff going on in there too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> creatively." [...] Ian Winwood of Kerrang! noted that [...] "Wretches and Kings" [...] references the Public Enemy song [...] "Fight the Power" [...] and compared the album's content to Public Enemy's third studio album, Fear of a Black Planet. Chuck D later provided vocals on a remix by HavocNdeeD. The fifth track [...] "When They Come for Me" [...] references , the seventh studio album by hip hop artist Jay-Z, with whom the band collaborated on the 2004 EP Collision Course. The album includes samples of notable speeches by American political figures, including Martin Luther King, Jr., J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Mario Savio.|$|E
500|$|At the {{suggestion}} of manager Lenny Poncher and Hassinger, The Electric Prunes agreed to record a concept album that integrated Gregorian music into psychedelic pop, with the belief it would launch them into commercial success. Poncher recruited David Axelrod, a formally neo-classically trained musician, to compose all of the material for the project. The result, Mass in F Minor, was a complex arrangement of religious-based rock, which was sung entirely in Latin. Although the band did record the songs [...] "Kyrie Eleison", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Credo", the intricate orchestration proved to be too difficult and time-consuming for the group. As a consequence, Hassinger enlisted the Canadian group, The Collectors, among other session musicians, in completing the album, although Lowe, Tulin, and Weakley did contribute to every track. Mass in F Minor was released in January 1968 and reached number 135 on the Billboard 200. An eerie version of the opening track, [...] "Kyrie Eleison", became somewhat of an underground favorite when it appeared in the soundtrack for the counterculture film, Easy Rider. The Electric Prunes performed with the new songs in concert just once, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, which Tulin described: [...] "From the outset the performance was a disaster. We missed the intro on the first song and it never got any better. Amp speakers blew, charts fell off music stands and everyone was, in general, in a complete state of confusion. Ended up each song turned into one long jam. I think <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> <b>at</b> times, {{all in the same}} key. I made my way over to the four celli and four French horns and told them to 'jam in E.' Somehow we would hit a break and James would manage a vocal". As a result of financial and musical issues, Weakley and Lowe left the group in early 1968. Tulin and Williams finished a tour with a line-up that also included Kenny Loggins and Jeremy Stuart, but by mid-1968 they too departed the group.|$|E
