25|$|Part of Cruzado's {{governing}} {{style is}} {{to seek out the}} views of others. In her first year in office, she held meetings across the state to solicit citizen views on the university. She also met one-on-one with many of the state's agricultural leaders. In September 2010 Cruzado began holding monthly luncheon meetings open to any who wished to attend, to solicit input on a variety of ideas. An example of this aspect of her governance style is her football stadium listening session. When she proposed spending several million dollars to expand the MSU football arena, she held a two-hour session with students to obtain their views and ensure it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted.|$|E
25|$|While {{the return}} of Bo and Luke was welcomed by ardent and casual viewers alike, {{and as a result}} ratings {{recovered}} slightly, the show never completely regained its former popularity. One of Wopat and Schneider's disputes even before they left <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> considered to be increasingly weak and formulaic scripts and episode plots. With Wopat and Schneider's return, the producers agreed to try a wider scope of storylines. However, although it continued for two more seasons, the show never fully returned to its former glory. As well as what was widely recognized to be increasingly inferior scripts, many cast members decried the miniature car effects newly incorporated to depict increasingly absurd General Lee and patrol car stunts (which had previously been performed with real cars by stunt drivers). The miniature car effects were intended as a budget saving measure (to save the cost of repairing or replacing damaged vehicles) and to help compete visually with KITT from the NBC series Knight Rider. In February 1985, The Dukes of Hazzard ended its run after seven seasons.|$|E

Similarly, a reviewer writing for The Boston Globe observed that the vampires of her novels represent [...] "the walking alienated, those of us who, by choice or not, dwell on the fringe." [...] On the subject, Rice herself commented, [...] "From the beginning, I've had gay fans, and gay readers who felt that my works involved a sustained gay allegory ... I didn't set out to do that, but that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> perceived.

500|$|To {{create the}} sound of the Clickers, the third stage of the Infected, the team found {{inspiration}} from a report on the journalism show 20/20 (1978–present) about blind children using clicking noises to communicate. [...] "We liked the idea of taking this benign sound and attributing it to something really scary," [...] said Druckmann. In addition, the team wanted to reflect the creature's feeling of pain and suffering, attempting to balance it with a sense of creepiness. The sound team created {{the sound of}} the Clicker first, realising early that it was the most challenging. To create the sound, they hired voice actors to perform their renditions. When voice actress Misty Lee provided her own rendition, a noise that Kovats described as originating in the [...] "back of the throat", Kovats and senior sound designer Derrick Espino agreed that it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted. Kovats then emulated the sound to feature in the game.|$|E
500|$|On 16 December, {{the first}} request was sent from South Africa for {{auxiliary}} troops, {{and a commitment}} was made to send a [...] "considerable force of militia and picked yeomanry and volunteers". In early January, the reinforcements to be sent out included one service company of volunteers for each regular battalion, one complete volunteer battalion, and seven militia battalions. A large number of battalions of the Militia, which had volunteered for overseas service, were eventually sent {{out of the country}} during the war; sixty, with around 46,000 men, went to South Africa, whilst eight more served in colonial garrisons. They were employed mainly on lines of communication, and regarded as second-line troops of low quality; this was unsurprising, as they were strongly deficient in officers and heavily composed of men of 18 and 19, who would have been regarded as too young by the regular Army. The deficiencies of the militia were increased by {{the fact that many of}} its best and most experienced men had volunteered for the Militia Reserve: Of the 30,000-strong militia reserve, 13,000 were stripped from their battalions and sent overseas as drafts for regular units, while some of the 10,000 who had already travelled to South Africa with the militia were subsequently transferred to regular units while overseas. Sir Ian Hamilton commented that [...] "the men from the Militia Reserve who were in regular battalions were quite excellent... Every commanding officer I asked about them said they were first class men. The Militia battalions that had come out, had lost many of their officers, who had gone to regular battalions to replace losses in the earlier part of the war. They had also been somewhat short of officers to start with... that [...] <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were best suited for under the circumstances." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the war, county cricket resumed in 1946, during which year Seamer played two matches with little success. He did not appear in first-class cricket in 1947, but was named as one of three captains of Somerset in 1948. Jack Meyer had reluctantly captained the side in 1947, but stepped {{down at the end of}} the season: he was having problems with his sight, and required daily painkillers for lumbago. There was no obvious replacement for Meyer; like many counties Somerset would not consider having a professional captain, and finding an amateur with the time and money to lead the side was proving troublesome. So, with no single candidate suitable, the Somerset committee announced that the club would be captained first by Mitchell-Innes during his leave from the Sudan, then Seamer during his own leave. Once both of these had returned to their duties, George Woodhouse would take over. In his history of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck describes the situation as a [...] "remarkable state of affairs", while David Foot suggests that the true number of captains was closer to seven. During his time as captain, Seamer carried an old train board saying [...] "To Tonbridge" [...] in his cricket bag, claiming that it brought good luck to the team. In the eleven matches that Somerset played under his captaincy though, only one resulted in a victory. Seamer claimed that some of his best friends at the club were among the professionals, who he praised for their team spirit, despite the strained leadership changes. His friendship with the professionals was in contrast to the attitudes of both the club's committee, and its captain for the previous season. Meyer had been unpopular with the professionals due to his attitude to the game, and the manner in which he utilised them, while the club's committee felt that the professional players deserved little recognition when successful, claiming that this <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were paid for. Seamer's batting was no longer strong enough to support his inclusion in the team, and he played low in the middle order. He failed to reach double figures in any of his first seven innings that season, but recorded a half-century against Kent in his final match for Somerset, his first since 1936 in first-class cricket.|$|E

2500|$|Paul's views {{went against}} the {{thoughts}} of the Greek philosophers to whom a bodily resurrection meant a new imprisonment in a corporeal body, which <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted to avoid—given that for them the corporeal and the material fettered the spirit.

Porter was able to create for Orbison his trademark sound, with background vocals brought nearer the foreground, beginning with [...] "Only the Lonely". For that session, Porter discarded his standard mix style of building up from a foundation of percussion, and instead used the vocal countermelody as the foreground sound, and built the other sounds below and around it, leaving the percussion almost inaudible. The song's success cemented this mix style as Orbison's sound. Other Orbison hits recorded for Monument at RCA Nashville were [...] "It's Over", [...] "Running Scared" [...] and [...] "Oh, Pretty Woman".

The palisade which surrounded the site was designed for defensive purposes. It had bastions at regular intervals, with archer slots to defend against enemy attacks. The peoples of Casqui and Pacaha were in a state of perpetual war with one another, and most large sites throughout the area in this time period had this type of defensive palisade.|$|E

By this view, Atta’s political and religious beliefs affected the method of his suicide and his choice of target, but they were not the underlying causes of his behavior.|$|E
