25|$|At age of 78, in 1996, she was {{diagnosed}} with cancer. She had been working on building the semiconductor base {{in the southern part of}} China. When she {{was diagnosed}}, she asked, “Can someone give me another ten years? In ten years, I can definitely finish <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> and I can die with no regrets!” She wanted ten years to offset the ten years wasted in the Culture Revolution. At 1:00p.m. on March 4, 2003, Lanying died.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{explained}} {{the lack of}} critical attention he received as follows: [...] "Guys who do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> are viewed as passé." [...] He also contrasted his own approach with that of performers who produced [...] "interview music": [...] "something that's obviously different, {{and you get the}} interviews and a certain amount of attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding his {{personal}} life, Paul Oscar has said: [...] "I {{have a lot}} of work still to do. I have had three relationships that, from the outside, looked picture perfect, I suppose. But they were actually quite rotten and false, abusive to me. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> now is learning to fall in love with myself." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Condé Nast {{announced}} {{she would be}} taking on the position of artistic director for the company's magazines while remaining at Vogue. She assumed some of the responsibilities of Si Newhouse, the company's longtime chairman, who, in his mid-80s at the time, was retreating from his role at Condé Nast to oversee managing Advance Publications, its parent company. A company spokesman told The New York Times the position was created to keep Wintour. She described it as [...] "an extension of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing,</b> but on a broader scale." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{rejects the}} notion that her song lyrics are autobiographical, telling The Times in 1998: [...] "the {{tortured}} artist myth is rampant. People paint me {{as some kind of}} black witchcraft-practising devil from hell, that I have to be twisted and dark to do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing.</b> It's a load of rubbish". What is more, she later told Spin: [...] "some critics have taken my writing so literally to the point that they'll listen to 'Down by the Water' and believe I have actually given birth to a child and drowned her." ...|$|E
500|$|While on tour Madonna {{participated in}} the Raising Malawi {{initiative}} by partially funding an orphanage in and traveling to that country. While there, she decided to adopt a boy named David Banda in October 2006. The adoption raised strong public reaction, because Malawian law requires would-be parents to reside in Malawi for one year before adopting, which Madonna did not do. She addressed this on The Oprah Winfrey Show, saying {{that there were no}} written adoption laws in Malawi that regulated foreign adoption. She described how Banda had been suffering from pneumonia after surviving malaria and tuberculosis when she first met him. Banda's biological father, Yohane, commented, [...] "These so-called human rights activists are harassing me every day, threatening me that I am not aware of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> ... They want me to support their court case, a thing I cannot do for I know what I agreed with Madonna and her husband." [...] The adoption was finalized in May 2008.|$|E

It is important to highlight how some students value the quality of the teacher’s feedback: “the teacher’s feedback was very thorough.

2500|$|When Larry Sanger left Wikipedia, Wales's {{approach}} {{was different from}} Sanger's. Wales was fairly hands-off. Despite involvement in other projects, Wales has denied intending to reduce his role within Wikipedia, telling The New York Times in 2008 that [...] "Dialing down {{is not an option}} for me... Not to be too dramatic about it, but, 'to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language,' that's who I am. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing.</b> That's my life goal." [...] In May 2010, the BBC reported that Wales had relinquished many of his technical privileges on Wikimedia Commons (a Wikipedia sister project that hosts much of its multimedia content) after criticism by the project's volunteer community over what they saw as Wales's hasty and undemocratic approach to deleting sexually explicit images he believed [...] "appeal solely to prurient interests".|$|E
2500|$|With age, a {{deepening}} personally spirtuality led to several elucidations and clarifications, as he untangled language problems in religion, attacking, for example, {{the temptation to}} think of God's existence {{as a matter of}} scientific evidence. In 1947, finding it more difficult to work, he wrote, [...] "I have had a letter from an old friend in Austria, a priest. In it he says that he hopes my work will go well, if it should be God's will. Now that is all I want: if it should be God's will." [...] In Wittgenstein's Culture and Value, it is found, [...] "Is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> [...] really worth the effort? Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above." [...] His close friend Norman Malcolm would write, [...] "Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers." [...] At last, Wittgenstein writes, [...] "Bach wrote on the title page of his Orgelbuechlein, ‘To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.’ [...] That is what I would have liked to say about my work." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the time, {{the rebels}} {{had yet to}} {{completely}} surround Duchang, so Taishi Ci managed to sneak past the enemy at night and enter the fortress to meet Kong Rong. He asked Kong Rong to let him lead soldiers to fight their way out, but Kong refused and insisted on waiting for reinforcements. The rebels came closer day by day. Kong Rong wanted to seek help from Liu Bei, the Chancellor of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Pingyuan, Shandong), {{but no one had}} any idea on how {{to break out of the}} siege. Taishi Ci volunteered to fight his way out and seek reinforcements from Liu Bei, but Kong Rong said, [...] "The rebels have completely surrounded the fortress. Everyone thinks it is impossible to break out. It will be very difficult for you to break out no matter how courageous you are." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "When I was away, you treated my mother very generously. She feels grateful, hence she told me to help you. She knew that I know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing,</b> and that I can help you. Now, everyone says it is impossible to break out. If I were to agree with them, I will not be able to repay your kindness. Why, then, did my mother send me here for? We are in a very desperate situation. I hope you won't hesitate any longer." [...] Kong Rong agreed to let him break out of the siege.|$|E
