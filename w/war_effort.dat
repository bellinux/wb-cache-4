5|$|The British did {{not return}} to Charleston until 1780, when General Clinton {{successfully}} besieged the city and captured an entire army. Until the South again became a focus of the war in late 1778, its states provided military supplies to the northern <b>war</b> <b>effort</b> and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the <b>war</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the <b>war</b> <b>effort.</b> Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with the <b>war</b> <b>effort</b> or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E

5|$|The main {{provisions}} of the Act were focused upon allowing the Commonwealth to enact legislation that was required for the smooth prosecution of the war. The main areas in which legislation was enacted under the War Precautions Act were: the prevention of trade with hostile nations, the creation of loans {{to raise money for}} the <b>war</b> <b>effort,</b> the introduction of a national taxation scheme, the fixing of the prices of certain goods, the internment of people considered a danger to the <b>war</b> <b>effort,</b> the compulsory purchase of strategic goods, and the censorship of the media.|$|E
5|$|The <b>war</b> <b>effort</b> was {{the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the <b>war</b> <b>effort,</b> and any manner of compromise alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate <b>war</b> <b>effort.</b> In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Around 375,000 Belgians {{also served}} in labour {{programs}} within Germany during the war, working in manual jobs in industry or agriculture for the German <b>war</b> <b>effort.</b> Though nearly 180,000 Belgians signed up before conscription began in 1941, most were conscripted after that date {{and worked as}} forced labour against their will.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Quisling {{believed}} {{that the only way}} he could win back Hitler's respect would be to raise volunteers for the now-faltering German <b>war</b> <b>effort,</b> and he committed Norway wholeheartedly to German plans to wage total war. For him at least, after the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Norway now had a part to play in keeping the German empire strong. In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the <b>war</b> <b>effort.</b> Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom, an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Confederate war finance was {{the various}} means, fiscal and monetary, {{through which the}} Confederate States of America financed their <b>war</b> <b>effort</b> during the American Civil War.

50|$|Three lessons {{could be}} learned from the war. First is that money was a main reason why the war came into being. Secondly, {{industry}} and capitalists were very important for the <b>war</b> <b>efforts.</b> Thirdly, the state {{is more important than the}} nation, because the state rules over the life and death of its subjects. But when state and nation are combined, the state has more power. The poor results of Austria-Hungarian <b>war</b> <b>efforts</b> compared to Germany were an example of this.|$|R

5|$|Factories, {{ports and}} other {{strategic}} sites {{used by the}} German <b>war</b> <b>effort</b> were frequent targets of Allied bombers from both the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and American United States Army Air Forces (USAAF).

5|$|Hitler {{dominated}} his country's <b>war</b> <b>effort</b> during World War II to {{a greater}} extent than any other national leader. He assumed the role of supreme commander of the armed forces during 1938, and subsequently made all major decisions regarding Germany's military strategy. His decision to mount a risky series of offensives against Norway, France, and the Low Countries in 1940 against the advice of the military proved successful, though the diplomatic and military strategies he employed in attempts to force the United Kingdom out of the war ended in failure. Hitler deepened his involvement in the <b>war</b> <b>effort</b> by appointing himself commander-in-chief of the Army in December 1941; from this point forward he personally directed the war against the Soviet Union, while his military commanders facing the Western Allies retained a degree of autonomy. Hitler's leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against Germany, with the military's defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions. Nevertheless, he continued to believe that only his leadership could deliver victory. In the final months of the war Hitler refused to consider peace negotiations, regarding the complete destruction of Germany as preferable to surrender. The military did not challenge Hitler's dominance of the <b>war</b> <b>effort,</b> and senior officers generally supported and enacted his decisions.|$|E
