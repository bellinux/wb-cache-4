5000|$|Cross-linking the fatty-acid chains with sulfur (brown factice) or S2Cl2 (<b>white</b> <b>factice)</b> {{yields a}} rubbery {{material}} that improves the processing characteristics and ozone resistance of rubber. [...] Varying {{the amount of}} factice changes the physical properties of the rubber; molded items might be 5-10% factice, extrusions 15-30%. Rubber erasers can have as much as 4 times as much factice as rubber in their composition.|$|E

Foaming SBR was made up by machinery and observed by stereoscopic microscope. The results suggested that ointment can make the cell structure distribute more balance and the effects of RA- 101 is better than AN; When the amount of RA- 101 was 10, the foaming temperature was 175 â„ƒ, the {{physical and}} mechanical properties was better, and cell structure was more balance and surface of rubber was smooth. Introuction At first, ointment was used as rubber substitute but as the development of technology, it has become one processing aid with special functions and technique. Now ointment has been used widely in the processing of rubber, but it is seldom used as blowing promoter. Ointment has many kinds which includes black factice, <b>white</b> <b>factice,</b> sulfur chloride factice, factice used in specialty rubber, unique factice without sulfur and chlorine and others. Ointment can promote processing characteristics, vulcanization characteristics and physical and mechanical characteristics of the materials. Besides, processing techniques such as foaming temperature, the amount of foaming agent has great effects on the structure of foaming rubber. The purpose of the article is to study the application of ointment to foaming SBR, and to explore the effects of ointment variety, ointment amounts and vulcanization temperature on the foaming SBR.
