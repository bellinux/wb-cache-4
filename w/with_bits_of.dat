25|$|The ‘galleries' {{produced}} by embiopterans are tunnels and chambers woven from the silk they produce. These woven constructions {{can be found}} on substrates such as rocks and the bark of trees, or in leaf litter. Some species camouflage their galleries by decorating the outer layers <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> leaf litter or other materials to match their surroundings (see image). The galleries are essential to their life cycle, maintaining moisture in their environment, plus offering protection from predators and the elements while foraging, breeding and simply existing. The only occasion when an embiopteran will leave the gallery complex is when winged males fly out or wingless males walk out in search of a mate, or when females explore the area immediately surrounding them in search of a new food source. On detection of a potential predator or threat, the embiids retreat into their galleries, and some species have even been observed to 'play dead' until the threat is no longer present.|$|E
25|$|An earthworm's {{digestive}} system {{consists of a}} mouth, pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When the churning is complete, the glands in {{the walls of the}} gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By peristalsis, the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown. This releases carbohydrates, protein, fat, and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body.|$|E

[...] However, she concluded the review by noting that [...] "for all its flaws, it is an authentic work of great talent". School Library Journal wrote that in Eragon [...] "sometimes the magic solutions are just too convenient for getting out of difficult situations".

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of August 16, the weather cleared, and Stark ordered his men {{to be ready to}} attack.

They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow." [...] Upon hearing that the militia had melted away into the woods, Baum assumed that the Americans were retreating or redeploying. However, Stark had decided to capitalize on weaknesses in the German's widely distributed position, and had sent sizable flanking parties to either side of his lines. These movements were assisted by a ruse employed by Stark's men that enabled them to get closer safely without alarming the opposing forces. The Germans, most of whom spoke no English, had been told that soldiers <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> white paper in their hat were Loyalists, and should not be fired on; Stark's men had also heard this and many of them had suitably adorned their hats.|$|E

500|$|The {{black vulture}} lays its eggs {{on the ground}} in a wooded area, a hollow log, or some other cavity, seldom more than [...] above the ground. While it {{generally}} does not use any nesting materials, it may decorate the area around the nest <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> brightly colored plastic, shards of glass, or metal items such as bottle caps. Clutch size is generally two eggs, though this can vary from one to three. The egg is oval and on average measures [...] The smooth, gray-green, bluish, or white shell is variably blotched or spotted with lavender or pale brown around the larger end. Both parents incubate the eggs, which hatch after 28 to 41 days. Upon hatching, the young are covered with white down. Both parents feed the nestlings, regurgitating food at the nest site. The young remain in the nest for two months, and after 75 to 80 days they are able to fly skillfully. Predation of black vultures is relatively unlikely, though eggs and nestlings are readily eaten if found by mammalian predators such as raccoons, coatis and foxes. Due to its aggressiveness and size, few predators can threaten the fully-grown vulture. However, various eagles may kill vultures in conflicts and even the ornate hawk-eagle, a slightly smaller bird than the vulture, have preyed on adult black vultures.|$|E

2500|$|The {{simplest}} nest {{construction is}} the scrape, which {{is merely a}} shallow depression in soil or vegetation. [...] This nest type, which typically has a rim deep {{enough to keep the}} eggs from rolling away, is sometimes lined <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> vegetation, small stones, shell fragments or feathers. These materials may help to camouflage the eggs or may provide some level of insulation; they may also help to keep the eggs in place, and prevent them from sinking into muddy or sandy soil if the nest is accidentally flooded. Ostriches, most tinamous, many ducks, most shorebirds, most terns, some falcons, pheasants, quail, partridges, bustards and sandgrouse are among the species that build scrape nests.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide range}} of spiders are known as [...] "trapdoor spiders". [...] These spiders {{excavate}} a burrow and seal the entrance with a web trapdoor hinged on one side with silk. The most well-known door is the “cork”-type, which is thick and beveled to precisely fit the opening. The other is the “wafer”-type door, a more simple sheet of silk and dirt. The top of the door is usually camouflaged <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> debris such as twigs and rock, making {{it very difficult to}} detect. The spider spins silk fishing lines, or trip wires, that radiate out of the burrow entrance. [...] When the spider is using the trap to capture prey, its chelicerae hold the door shut on the end furthest from the hinge. The vibrations of passing prey are conducted by the silk and alert the spider whereupon it quickly throws open the door, ambushes the prey and returns with it down the tube.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first four}} {{films of the}} series were {{produced}} and written by Frank Capra from 1952–1956.

McBride writes that Capra [...] "undoubtedly realized that the AT job was a way of going back to work quietly and rehabilitating his image." [...] Matthew Gunter compares Capra's involvement with the Bell series to his work on wartime propaganda and training films, [...] "As in the creation of the war documentaries, Capra dove into the work and rediscovered his passion for the filmmaking process. Like his work on the war films, he employed found footage and animation to verify, illustrate, and document what was being said in the voice-over narration." [...] Capra later described the films, [...] "Those four films about science, hand woven <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> celluloid, were sprightly patterns of poesy and fact; fresh ideas were their main charm, a rather elegant charm, we thought, much like the light-hearted but disciplined charm of a Mozart composition."

Queso Zacatecas is an aged cheese which is usually hard on the outside and a little soft on the inside, and white with a tinge of yellow. It is crumbly and cannot be sliced. Instead, it is served grated. Queso molido, also called queso prensado, is sometimes covered in a red chili pepper paste. Costena cheese is a specialty of Guerrero state. The texture of this cheese is crumbly, and it tastes like fresh or slightly soured milk. Normally, it is white in color.

2500|$|Taylor {{initially}} {{planned a}} representational {{setting for the}} film; Verona, Milan and the forest were all to be realistic. However, {{he changed his mind}} early in preproduction and had production designer Barbara Gosnold go in the opposite direction – a stylised setting. To this end, the forest is composed of metal poles <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> green tinsel and brown sticks stuck to them (the cast and crew referred to the set as [...] "Christmas at Selfridges"). Whilst the set for Verona remained relatively realistic, that for Milan featured young actors dressed like cherubs as extras. This was to convey the idea that the characters lived in a 'Garden of Courtly Love', which was slightly divorced from the everyday reality represented by Verona. Working in tandem with this idea, upon Proteus' arrival in Milan, after meeting Silvia, he is left alone on screen, and the weather suddenly changes from calm and sunny to cloudy and windy, accompanied by a thunderclap. The implication being that Proteus has brought a darkness within him into the garden of courtly delights previously experienced by Silvia. Although the production is edited in a fairly conventional manner, much of it was shot in extremely long takes, and then edited into sections, rather than actually shooting in sections. Director Don Taylor would shoot most of the scenes in single takes, as he felt this enhanced performances and allowed actors to discover aspects which they never would were everything broken up into pieces.|$|E
2500|$|The Waseda University (Japan) and NTT Docomo's {{manufacturers}} {{have succeeded in}} creating a shape-shifting robot WD-2. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided {{the positions of the}} necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three degrees of freedom. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To [...] "copy" [...] a face, they need only a 3D scanner to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.|$|E
