25|$|Thus (after having grouped {{the terms}} with the same exponent) <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> set of the exponents form a {{complete}} set of conjugates and, if two terms have conjugate exponents, they are multiplied by the same coefficient.|$|E

25|$|Subjacency {{says that}} you cannot relate two {{positions}} across two bounding nodes. In (13), <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> movement of the wh-expression 'what' was moved past a CP and a TP {{to get to the}} Spec CP position- thus this phrase is ungrammatical.|$|E
25|$|If we further {{consider}} both spaces {{with the}} sup norm the extension map becomes an isometry. Indeed, {{if in the}} construction above we take the smallest possible ball B, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sup norm of the extended sequence does not grow (although {{the image of the}} extended function can be bigger).|$|E
25|$|From the {{analysis}} of the case with unknown mean but known variance, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> update equations involve sufficient statistics computed from the data consisting of the mean of the data points and the total variance of the data points, computed in turn from the known variance divided by the number of data points.|$|E

25|$|Coming back to {{the first}} picture, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two effects {{introduce}} a change in frequency in two different opposite directions. It is possible to make a pulse so that the two effects will balance each other. Considering higher frequencies, linear dispersion will tend to let them propagate faster, while nonlinear Kerr effect will slow them down. The overall effect will be that the pulse does not change while propagating: such pulses are called temporal solitons.|$|E
25|$|For decades we—and {{survivors}} {{from many}} other nations—have been scarred by the horror, loss and injuries we {{experienced in the}} wars of the 20th century. Today <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> beginnings of the 21st century are also marked by suffering and destruction.

25|$|As seen above, the Möbius group PSL(2,C) acts on Minkowski {{space as}} the group of those isometries that {{preserve}} the origin, the orientation of space and the direction of time. Restricting to the points where Q=1 in the positive light cone, which form a model of hyperbolic 3-space Hnbsp&3, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Möbius group acts on Hnbsp&3 {{as a group of}} orientation-preserving isometries. In fact, the Möbius group is equal to the group of orientation-preserving isometries of hyperbolic 3-space.|$|E

25|$|Then {{there is}} a variety Av and a family of degree 0 line bundles P, the Poincaré bundle, parametrised by Av such that a family L on T is {{associated}} a unique morphism f: T → Av so that L is isomorphic to the pullback of P along the morphism 1A×f: A×T → A×Av. Applying this to the case when T is a point, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> points of Av correspond to line bundles of degree 0 on A, so {{there is a}} natural group operation on Av given by tensor product of line bundles, which makes it into an abelian variety.|$|E
25|$|We can {{now give}} a {{complete}} description of w = z½. To do {{so we need}} two copies of the z-plane, each of them cut along the real axis. On one copy we define the square root of 1 to be e0 = 1, {{and on the other}} we define the square root of 1 to be e'iπ = 1. We call these two copies of the complete cut plane sheets. By making a continuity argument <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> (now single-valued) function w = z½ maps the first sheet into the upper half of the w-plane, where 0 ≤ arg(w) < π, while mapping the second sheet into {{the lower half of the}} w-plane (where π ≤ arg(w) < 2π).|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} (1) covariance between environment and competition, and (2) species-specific {{response to the}} environment decouple the strongest intraspecific and interspecific competition experienced by a species. Intraspecific competition is strongest when a species is favored by the environment, whereas interspecific competition is strongest when its rivals are favored. After this decoupling, buffered population growth limits the impact of interspecific competition when a species is not favored by the environment. As a consequence, the impact of intraspecific competition on the species favored by a particular environment exceeds that of the interspecific competition on species less favored by that environment. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fundamental requirement for species coexistence is fulfilled and thus storage effect is able to maintain stable coexistence {{in a community of}} competing species.|$|E

The in-wall temperature values {{on the other hand}} are rather constant. <b>We</b> also <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> peaks in the in-wall RH values correspond to peaks in the outer surface temperatures, pointing out presence of free water within the building fabric.|$|R

25|$|If one invests $100 in {{an inverse}} ETF {{position}} in an asset worth $100, and the asset's value changes to $80 {{and then to}} $60, then {{the value of the}} inverse ETF position will increase by 20% (because the asset decreased by 20% from 100 to 80) and then increase by 25% (because the asset decreased by 25% from 80 to 60). So the ETF's value will be $100*1.20*1.25=$150. The gain of an equivalent short position will however be $100–$60=$40, and so <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> capital gain of the ETF outweighs the volatility loss relative to the short position. However, if the market swings back to $100 again, then the net profit of the short position is zero. However, since the value of the asset increased by 67% (from $60 to $100), the inverse ETF must lose 67%, meaning it will lose $100. Thus the investment in shorts went from $100 to $140 and back to $100. The investment in the inverse ETF, however, went from $100 to $150 to $50.|$|E
25|$|Say we {{are told}} that a woman has two children. If we ask whether either of them is a girl, and are told yes, what is the {{probability}} that the other child is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that the other child is female is ½ (50%). But by building a probability space (illustrating all possible outcomes), <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> probability is actually only ⅓ (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But we were given more information. Once {{we are told}} that one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ⅓ of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl. Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see Boy or girl paradox.|$|E
