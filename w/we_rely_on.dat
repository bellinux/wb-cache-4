As a halakhic movement we look to precedent to find the tools with which to shape the Torah. For the most part, <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> the strategies of old. At the same time, we are willing to do explicitly what was largely implicit in the past, namely, to make changes on moral grounds.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} first {{election}} to the Senate, Lieberman was approached by incoming Majority Leader George Mitchell who advised him, [...] "Pick out two or three areas that you’re really interested in and learn them so that your colleagues know what you’re talking about...You’re {{going to have more}} influence even as a freshman than you think because you know there’s hundreds of issues and inevitably <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> each other.” Recalling the conversation, Lieberman has said, [...] "that was true when I first came in, although you could see partisanship beginning to eat away at that. But {{at the end of my}} 24 years, it was really so partisan that it was hard to make the combinations to get to 60 votes to break a filibuster to get things done." ...|$|E

Hadi Al-Ameri, the head of the Parliament's Security and Defense Committee, said that he would push for an official investigation to [...] "find out how this piece of equipment was sold to Iraq." [...] If it was determined that ATSC was responsible he planned to [...] "seek compensation via the ministry of foreign affairs." [...] MP Haneen Kado said: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> these devices {{there is no point in}} having checkpoints. It makes the whole of Baghdad open to terrorist attacks.

30|$|This study {{gathered}} two self-report instruments {{following the}} literature on hedonic and eudaemonic happiness. <b>We</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> a measure of positive affect as a proxy to hedonic happiness, as {{it refers to the}} positive emotional experience in the moment. As for eudaemonic happiness, <b>we</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> a measure of purpose in life, one of its core characteristics. The psychometric characteristics were tested for all the self-report measures. Regarding these instruments these were translated into Portuguese by two experienced researchers, fluent in English. The Portuguese version of it was later translated back to English, by another native English speaker into English language to ensure the accuracy of the translation, warranting, therefore the items’ linguistic particularities.|$|R

60|$|In {{all that}} we say of totemism, as, later, of fetishism, <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> an {{enormous}} mass of evidence from geographers, historians, travellers, settlers, missionaries, explorers, traders, Civil Servants, and European officers of native police in Australia and Burmah. Our witnesses are of all ages, from Herodotus to our day, of many nations, of many creeds, of different theoretical opinions. This evidence, so world-wide, so diversified in source, so old, and so new, Mr. Max Muller impugns. But, before meeting his case, let us clear up a personal question.|$|E
60|$|We cannot {{part with}} our friends. We cannot let our angels go. We {{do not see}} that they only go out that archangels may come in. We are idolaters of the old. We {{do not believe in}} the riches of the soul, in its proper eternity and omnipresence. We do not believe there is any force in to-day to rival or {{recreate}} that beautiful yesterday. We linger in the ruins of the old tent where once we had bread and shelter and organs, nor believe that the spirit can feed, cover, and nerve us again. We cannot again find aught so dear, so sweet, so graceful. But we sit and weep in vain. The voice of the Almighty saith, 'Up and onward for evermore!' We cannot stay amid the ruins. Neither will <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> the new; and so we walk ever with reverted eyes, like those monsters who look backwards.|$|E
6000|$|If any {{one thinks}} that I {{have not been}} {{warranted}} in drawing a sharp distinction between [...] "scientific theologians" [...] and [...] "counsels for creeds"; or that my warning against the too ready acceptance of certain declarations as {{to the state of}} biblical criticism was needless; or that my anxiety as to the sense of the word [...] "practical" [...] was superfluous; let him compare the statement that M. Renan has made a [...] "practical surrender of the adverse case" [...] with the facts just set forth. For what is the adverse case? The question, as Dr. Wace puts it, is [...] "It may be asked how far can <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> the accounts we possess of our Lord's teaching on these subjects." [...] It will be obvious that M. Renan's statements amount to an adverse answer--to a [...] "practical" [...] denial that any great reliance can be placed on these accounts. He does not believe that Matthew, the apostle, wrote the first Gospel; he does not profess to know who is responsible for the collection of [...] "logia," [...] or how many of them are authentic; though he calls the second Gospel the most historical, he points out that it is written with credulity, and may have been interpolated and retouched; and as to the author, [...] "quid qu'il soit," [...] of the third Gospel, who is to [...] "rely on the accounts" [...] of a writer, who deserves the cavalier treatment which [...] "Luke" [...] meets with at M. Renan's hands? ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{the saint}} perhaps never discoursed better on this subject, {{than in a}} letter written at his return from the Moluccas, after a {{dangerous}} navigation. His words are these: [...] "It has pleased God, {{that we should not}} perish; it has also pleased him, to instruct us even by our dangers, and to make us know, by our own experience, how weak we are, when we rely only on ourselves, or on human succours. For when we come to understand the deceitfulness of our hopes, and are entirely diffident of human helps, <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> God, who alone can deliver us out of those dangers, into which we have engaged ourselves on his account: we shall soon experience that he governs all things; and that the heavenly pleasures, which he confers on his servants on such occasions, ought to make us despise the greatest hazards; even death itself has nothing in it which is dreadful to them, who have a taste of those divine delights; and though, when we have escaped those perils of which we speak, we want words to express the horror of them, there remains in our heart a pleasing memory of the favours which God has done us; and that remembrance excites us, day and night, to labour in the service of so good a Master: we are also enlivened by it to honour him during the rest of our lives, hoping, that, out of his abundant mercy, he will bestow on us a new strength, and fresh vigour, to serve him faithfully and generously, even to our death." ...|$|E
60|$|Our {{tendency}} for many centuries past has been, {{not so much}} towards creating an aristocracy (which {{may or may not}} be a good thing in itself), as towards substituting an aristocracy for everything else. In England we have an aristocracy instead of a religion. The nobility are to the English poor what the saints and the fairies are to the Irish poor, what the large devil with a black face was to the Scotch poor--the poetry of life. In the same way in England we have an aristocracy instead of a Government. <b>We</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> a certain good humour and education in the upper class to interpret to us our contradictory Constitution. No educated man born of woman will be quite so absurd as the system that he has to administer. In short, we do not get good laws to restrain bad people. We get good people to restrain bad laws. And last of all we in England have an aristocracy instead of an Army. We have an Army of which the officers are proud of their families and ashamed of their uniforms. If I were a king of any country whatever, and one of my officers were ashamed of my uniform, I should be ashamed of my officer. Beware, then, of the really well-bred and apologetic gentleman whose clothes are at once quiet and fashionable, whose manner is at once diffident and frank. Beware how you admit him into your domestic secrets, for he may be a bogus Earl. Or, worse still, a real one.|$|E
