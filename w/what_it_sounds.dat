500|$|Like many {{contemporary}} alternative bands, the Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa. Hüsker Dü's seminal album Zen Arcade demonstrated {{to the band}} how they could place gentler material against more aggressive fare, and Corgan made such shifts in dynamics central {{to the pursuit of}} his grand musical ambitions. Corgan said he liked the idea of creating his own alternative universe through sound that essentially tells the listener, [...] "Welcome to Pumpkin Land, this is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like on Planet Pumpkin." [...] This emphasis on atmosphere carried through to Adore (described as [...] "arcane night music" [...] in prerelease promotion) and the Machina albums (concept records that tell the story of a fictional rock band).|$|E

It's like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind..." [...] Barrett later said of the album: [...] "I liked what came out, only it was released far too long after it was done. I {{wanted it to be}} a whole thing that people would listen to all the way through with everything related and balanced, the tempos and moods offsetting each other, and I hope that's <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like." [...] In a bid to increase sales, Jones wrote a letter to music magazine, Melody Maker, under an alternate name, writing how great the album was.|$|E

Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{called it a}} [...] "beguilingly compulsive tale of pulling a drug-induced whitey, {{with a combination of}} clipped marching beats, sawing electronics and mild R flavor that bears a vague resemblance to Nelly Furtado's 'Maneater'". Ben Norman of About.com said that the song [...] "opens the album like a valkyrie leading the charge [...] riding triumphant ahead of her army. If you don't know this song, use your browser. I won't waste time explaining <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like." [...] However he also noted that the song is not groundbreaking and compared it to the music of Rihanna, Chris Brown and The Pussycat Dolls. Bill Lamb from About.com called the song tame but catchy enough for Gaga to be noticed by mainstream. He also added that [...] "'Just Dance' has strong energy and features Lady GaGa's striking voice, but it ultimately adds up to rather bland dance-pop."

500|$|Keenan and Jones {{met through}} {{a mutual friend}} in 1989. After Keenan played a tape {{recording}} for Jones of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band. They started jamming together and were {{on the lookout for}} a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello, an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep. Carey began playing in their sessions because he [...] "felt kinda sorry for them," [...] as other invited musicians were not showing up. Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour. Early on, the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the pseudophilosophy [...] "lachrymology". Although [...] "lachrymology" [...] was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained their intentions differently: [...] "Tool is exactly <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like: It's a big dick.

Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "For a band that's always specialized in inspirational, larger-than-life gestures—a band utterly determined to be Important—The Joshua Tree could be the big one, and that's precisely <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like." [...] The review described the album's sound as [...] "wed the diverse textures of The Unforgettable Fire to fully formed songs, many of them as aggressive as the hits on War". Steve Morse of The Boston Globe echoed these sentiments in his review, stating, [...] "It's another spiritual progress report, enwrapped in music that strikes a healthy balance between the lushness of their last album, 1984's The Unforgettable Fire, and the more volcanic rock of their early years." [...] Morse called it [...] "their most challenging work to date" [...] and the [...] "most rewarding rock record of the new year". NME praised the album as [...] "a better and braver record than anything else that's likely to appear in 1987... It's the sound of people still trying, still looking..." [...] Thom Duffy of the Orlando Sentinel said the songs have [...] "exultant power" [...] that, [...] "like the Joshua Tree's branches, stretch upward {{in stark contrast to}} their barren musical surroundings on rock radio". He praised the musicianship of the group members, calling Bono's vocals [...] "wrenching", the rhythm section of Mullen and Clayton [...] "razor-sharp", and the Edge's guitar playing [...] "never... better". The New Zealand Herald called The Joshua Tree [...] "the most compelling collection of music yet from a band that has cut its career with passionate, exciting slashes". It judged that the record's [...] "power lies in its restraint" [...] and that there is an [...] "urgency underlying virtually all of the 11 songs".|$|E

2500|$|After {{they split}} from Nervous Records, Black Moon became {{entangled}} {{in a legal}} battle with the label over the licensing of their group name, which lasted {{for a number of}} years. The case was finally settled in 1998, with Duck Down receiving permission to license the name through Nervous. After a five-year hiatus, Black Moon returned in 1999 with their second album, War Zone. The album received moderate sales and good reviews, especially when compared to the Camp's three previous efforts. One factor in its positive reception was the return of Da Beatminerz, who produced the entirety of the album. The group recruited a number of fellow New York City emcees for appearances, including Busta Rhymes, Q-Tip and M.O.P.

6000|$|In my last Letter I {{said that}} in the Bible there is more that FINDS me than I have {{experienced}} in all other books put together; that the words of the Bible find me at greater depths of my being; and that whatever finds me brings with it an irresistible evidence of its having proceeded from the Holy Spirit. But the doctrine in question requires me to believe that not only what finds me, but that all that exists in the sacred volume, and which I am bound to find therein, was--not alone inspired by, that is composed by, men under the actuating influence of the Holy Spirit, but likewise--dictated by an Infallible Intelligence; that the writers, each and all, were divinely informed as well as inspired. Now here all evasion, all excuse, is cut off. An infallible intelligence extends to all things, physical no less than spiritual. It may convey the truth in any one of the three possible languages--that of sense, as objects appear to the beholder on this earth; or that of science, which supposes the beholder placed in the centre; or that of philosophy, which resolves both into a supersensual reality. But whichever be chosen--and {{it is obvious that the}} incompatibility exists only between the first and second, both of them being indifferent and of equal value to the third--it must be employed consistently; for an infallible intelligence must intend to be intelligible, and not to deceive. And, moreover, whichever of these three languages be chosen, it must be translatable into truth. For this is the very essence of the doctrine, that one and the same intelligence is speaking in the unity of a person; which unity is no more broken by the diversity of the pipes through which it makes itself audible, than is a tune by the different instruments on which it is played by a consummate musician, equally perfect in all. One instrument may be more capacious than another, but as far as its compass extends, and in <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> forth, it will be true to the conception of the master. I can conceive no softening here which would not nullify the doctrine, and convert it to a cloud for each man's fancy to shift and shape at will. And this doctrine, I confess, plants the vineyard of the Word with thorns for me, and places snares in its pathways. These may be delusions of an evil spirit; but ere I so harshly question the seeming angel of light--my reason, I mean, and moral sense in conjunction with my clearest knowledge--I must inquire on what authority this doctrine rests. And what other authority dares a truly catholic Christian admit as coercive in the final decision, but the declarations of the Book itself--though I should not, without struggles, and a trembling reluctance, gainsay even a universal tradition? ...|$|E
60|$|As {{will be seen}} later on, Pygmalion needs, not a preface, but a sequel, which I have {{supplied}} in its due place. The English have {{no respect}} for their language, and will not teach their children to speak it. They spell it so abominably that no man can teach himself <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like. It is impossible for an Englishman to open his mouth without making some other Englishman hate or despise him. German and Spanish are accessible to foreigners: English is not accessible even to Englishmen. The reformer England needs today is an energetic phonetic enthusiast: that is why I have made such a one the hero of a popular play. There have been heroes of that kind crying in the wilderness for many years past. When I {{became interested in the}} subject {{towards the end of the}} eighteen-seventies, Melville Bell was dead; but Alexander J. Ellis was still a living patriarch, with an impressive head always covered by a velvet skull cap, for which he would apologize to public meetings in a very courtly manner. He and Tito Pagliardini, another phonetic veteran, were men whom it was impossible to dislike. Henry Sweet, then a young man, lacked their sweetness of character: he was about as conciliatory to conventional mortals as Ibsen or Samuel Butler. His great ability as a phonetician (he was, I think, the best of them all at his job) would have entitled him to high official recognition, and perhaps enabled him to popularize his subject, but for his Satanic contempt for all academic dignitaries and persons in general who thought more of Greek than of phonetics. Once, in the days when the Imperial Institute rose in South Kensington, and Joseph Chamberlain was booming the Empire, I induced the editor of a leading monthly review to commission an article from Sweet on the imperial importance of his subject. When it arrived, it contained nothing but a savagely derisive attack on a professor of language and literature whose chair Sweet regarded as proper to a phonetic expert only. The article, being libelous, had to be returned as impossible; and I had to renounce my dream of dragging its author into the limelight. When I met him afterwards, for the first time for many years, I found to my astonishment that he, who had been a quite tolerably presentable young man, had actually managed by sheer scorn to alter his personal appearance until he had become a sort of walking repudiation of Oxford and all its traditions. It must have been largely in his own despite that he was squeezed into something called a Readership of phonetics there. The future of phonetics rests probably with his pupils, who all swore by him; but nothing could bring the man himself into any sort of compliance with the university, to which he nevertheless clung by divine right in an intensely Oxonian way. I daresay his papers, if he has left any, include some satires that may be published without too destructive results fifty years hence. He was, I believe, not in the least an ill-natured man: very much the opposite, I should say; but he would not suffer fools gladly.|$|E
