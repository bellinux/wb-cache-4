5|$|Pickford {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with Adolph Zukor in June 1916. Among the agreements in the contract was that she <b>would</b> <b>now</b> be producing her own films {{and they would be}} distributed through a special division of Paramount Pictures called Artcraft. Pickford made 13 films for Artcraft of which 11 survive complete.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} lessons had been {{learned from the}} 1856 {{disaster}} that allowed the Church to continue the handcart system while avoiding another disaster. Never again would a handcart company depart Florence later than July 7. The construction of the handcarts was modified to strengthen them and reduce repairs. The handcarts <b>would</b> <b>now</b> be regularly greased. Arrangements were made to replenish supplies along the route.|$|E

5|$|Article One {{came within}} one {{state of the}} number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, it has never received the approval of enough states {{to become part of}} the Constitution. As Congress did not attach a ratification time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. Since no state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states <b>would</b> <b>now</b> be necessary for the article to be adopted.|$|E
5|$|By 1967 {{the debate}} over ABM systems had become a major public policy issue, with almost continual debate on the topic in {{newspapers}} and magazines. It {{was in the midst}} of these debates, on 17 June 1967, that the Chinese tested their first H-bomb in Test No. 6. Suddenly the Nth Country concept was no longer simply theoretical. McNamara seized on this event as a way to deflect criticism over the lack of deployment while still keeping costs under control. On 18 September 1967, he announced that Nike-X <b>would</b> <b>now</b> be known as Sentinel, and outlined deployment plans broadly following the I-67 concept.|$|E
5|$|However, Peloponnesians {{may have}} been party to Themistocles's stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they <b>would</b> <b>now</b> have to fight at Salamis. The Allied navy was thus able to prepare {{properly}} for battle the forthcoming day, whilst the Persians spent the night fruitlessly at sea, searching for the alleged Greek evacuation. The next morning, the Persians rowed into the straits to attack the Greek fleet; {{it is not clear}} when, why or how this decision was made, {{but it is clear that}} they did take the battle to the Allies.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} shootdown, South Korea, {{owner of the}} {{aircraft}} and therefore prime considerant for jurisdiction, designated the United States and Japan as search and salvage agents, thereby making it illegal for the Soviet Union to salvage the aircraft, providing it was found outside Soviet territorial waters. If it did so, the United States <b>would</b> <b>now</b> be legally entitled to use force against the Soviets, if necessary, to prevent retrieval of {{any part of the}} plane.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 2010, {{it emerged}} {{that the new}} owners King Power wanted to rename the stadium The King Power Stadium, and had plans to {{increase}} the capacity to 42,000 should Leicester secure promotion. On 7 July 2011, Leicester City confirmed the Walkers Stadium <b>would</b> <b>now</b> {{be known as the}} King Power Stadium. In 2015, vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha stated plans were in place to increase the capacity of the stadium to around 42,000. Relocation to a bigger stadium has also been considered.|$|E
5|$|Other researchers, like Larry Martin {{believe that}} dromaeosaurids, {{along with all}} maniraptorans are not dinosaurs at all. Martin {{asserted}} for decades that birds were unrelated to maniraptorans, but in 2004 he changed his position, and now he agrees that the two are the closest of relatives. Martin believes that maniraptorans are secondarily flightless birds, and that birds evolved from non–dinosaurian archosaurs, so {{that most of the}} species formerly called theropods <b>would</b> <b>now</b> not even be classified as dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Raul Gonzalez fought Felix Trinidad on May 3, 1992, in Cayey, Puerto Rico. This {{fight was}} the main event of the night. Both Gonzalez and Trinidad weighed in at 142 pounds. Gonzalez had a record of 8-2-3 with 5 KOs, while Trinidad had a record of 13-0 with 10 KOs. Gonzalez went down three times, and Trinidad took the victory in round four by TKO. Trinidad would add another victory by KO to his record and <b>would</b> <b>now</b> make it 14-0 with 11 KOs.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on October 8, optimistic field reports expecting an {{imminent}} Egyptian collapse caused Gonen to alter {{plans for the}} attack. Adan <b>would</b> <b>now</b> attack {{in the direction of}} the strongpoints at Firdan and Ismailia. The change was not formulated on precise tactical intelligence, and would come to cause some confusion among Israeli commanders for the rest of the day.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{aircraft}} had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals {{had died in}} the incident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was legally required to investigate. On the morning of September 1, the NTSB chief in Alaska, James Michelangelo, received an order from the NTSB in Washington {{at the behest of the}} State Department requiring all documents relating to the NTSB investigation to be sent to Washington, and notifying him that the State Department <b>would</b> <b>now</b> conduct the investigation.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{originally}} scheduled for completion in April 1945, but construction was expedited after the defeat at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944 as the IJN {{anticipated that the}} United States <b>would</b> <b>now</b> be able to bomb Japan with long-range aircraft from bases in the Mariana Islands. The builder was unable {{to increase the number}} of workers on Shinano and could not meet the new deadline of October. Even so, the pressure to finish as quickly as possible led to poor workmanship by the workforce.|$|E
5|$|A charter {{granted in}} 1363 by David II, King of Scots (reigned 1329–71), awarded the burgh {{the right to}} trade across the regality of Dunfermline. This charter allowed the burgesses of Kirkcaldy to {{purchase}} and sell goods to the burgesses of the three other regality burghs—Queensferry, Dunfermline and Musselburgh—that belonged to the Abbey. By 1451, Kirkcaldy was awarded feu-ferme status. Under the status, responsibility <b>would</b> <b>now</b> lie with the bailies and council {{to deal with the}} routine administration of the town and its fiscal policies; conditional on an annual payment of two and a half marks (33s 4d or £1.67) to the Abbot of Dunfermline.|$|E
5|$|After its reconstruction, the Mezhyhirya Monastery {{became a}} {{regional}} {{center of the}} Zaporozhian Host, serving the host as a military monastery. In 1610, the monastery received {{the status of a}} stauropegic monastery (orthodox church autonomy), under the Patriarch of Constantinople. The universal (act) of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky issued on May 21, 1656 transferred the neighboring settlements of Vyshhorod, Novi Petrivtsi, and Moshchany under control of the Mezhyhirya Monastery. In effect, the universal made Khmelnytsky the monastery's ktitor. After the destruction of the Trakhtemyrivskyi Monastery by a Polish szlachta army, the Mezhyhirya Monastery replaced it as the main cossack military monastery. As a military monastery, retired and elderly cossacks from the Zaporozhian Host <b>would</b> <b>now</b> come to the monastery to retire and live in until the end of their lives. At that time, the monastery's expenses were paid off {{with the help of the}} cossack's Sich Host.|$|E
