5|$|Alonso is a Meath Gaelic {{football}} supporter. His {{interest in}} the Irish sport stems {{from the age of}} 15 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Irish town of Kells, County Meath, and stayed with a family to learn English, where he played it in his spare time.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, Willkie {{returned}} to New York. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> movies, {{he received a}} standing ovation, as {{he did when he}} went to see the play Life With Father. He resigned from C on July 8, 1940, confident that even if he lost his presidential bid, he would not lack for work. He had Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman John Hamilton dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors, who felt Hamilton was too conservative and isolationist, though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign. Congressman Martin became RNC chair. At a time when little campaigning was done until after Labor Day, Willkie left on a five-week working vacation to The Broadmoor, a resort in Colorado Springs, but found neither peace nor privacy.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{remained}} at Cornell until 1964, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He remained {{there for the}} remainder of his career, becoming Institute Professor in 1976, and Institute Professor Emeritus in 1986. In 1963, working in collaboration with a student of his, James Felten, Morrison had investigated the effect of inverse Compton scattering, an important source of cosmic x-rays and gamma rays. At MIT, Morrison teamed up with Bruno Rossi's x-ray group there, and also with Riccardo Giacconi's group at nearby American Science and Engineering. Morrison became deeply involved in the exploration of the cosmos through its x-ray and gamma ray emissions. In a 1960 paper, he noted the similarities between pulsars and quasars. He returned to this in 1976, applying his model to the radio galaxy Cygnus A.|$|E

25|$|Sofronie {{was born}} {{in the first half of}} the 18th century in the Romanian village of Cioara, now Săliștea, Transylvania, which was at the time part of the Austrian Habsburg Empire. His Christian given name was Stan and his family name was Popa (or Popovici, {{according}} to other sources). His family name suggests that one of his ancestors was a priest, as in Romanian popǎ means priest. Sofronie also became an Orthodox priest and he remained in Cioara until the death of his wife, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> a monastery in Wallachia (possibly the Cozia Monastery) and became a monk.|$|E

25|$|Still, Talavera was waiting. On 16 May he was {{alternating}} {{there with}} Joselito when the bull Bailaor gave his brother-in-law a tremendous, unexpected goring. While Joselito {{was taken to}} the infirmary, Sánchez killed the bull. Afterwards <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> infirmary to see his friend, he was already dead. He watched over the corpse that night, in tears. The photograph of Sánchez overwhelmed by grief supporting his head with an open hand and with the other caressing the face of the reclining Joselito, tranquil in his glory, is perhaps the most emotional in the history of tauromaquia.|$|E
25|$|Born Maung Shwe in {{a village}} called Hsaisu near Thonze in Tharrawaddy District, British Burma, Kyaw Zaw was educated in the {{traditional}} manner, mainly in monastic schools often becoming a novice monk during the Buddhist lent, until the final year <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pazundaung Municipal High School in Rangoon. There he met teachers {{who were members of}} the nationalist Dobama Asiayone (We Burmans Association) who made him become politically aware and soon joined the Yè tat (The Braves - Dobama militia). As he was educated only in the vernacular and had no knowledge of the English language required for university, he went on to the Highergrade Teachers Training School where English was not required.|$|E
25|$|On September 21, 1849, the Oregon Baptist Educational Society {{was started}} {{in what was then}} the Oregon Territory. On September 27, 1849, a meeting of the group was held and they decided to build a school on the east bank of the Willamette River, {{approximately}} eight miles north of its confluence with the Calapooia River, and established a board of trustees. The Rev. Ezra Fisher was asked to start the school, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> planned site it was not available, and instead he started to teach school inside the Oregon City Baptist Church while leaders contemplated what to do for a permanent site. Meanwhile, the Rev. Richmond Cheadle was tasked with raising $2,000 to pay for construction of a school building.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, François Gouin went to Hamburg {{to learn}} German. Based on his {{experience}} as a Latin teacher, he thought {{the best way to do}} this would be memorize a German grammar book and a table of its 248 irregular verbs. However, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> academy to test his new language skills, he was disappointed to find out that he could not understand anything. Trying again, he similarly memorized the 800 root words of the language as well as re-memorizing the grammar and verb forms. However, the results were the same. During this time, he had isolated himself from people around him, so he tried to learn by listening, imitating and conversing with the Germans around him, but found that his carefully constructed sentences often caused native German speakers to laugh. Again he tried a more classical approach, translation, and even memorizing the entire dictionary but had no better luck.|$|E
