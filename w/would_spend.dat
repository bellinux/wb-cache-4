5|$|Arthur {{was murdered}} (allegedly by John), {{and his sister}} Eleanor <b>would</b> <b>spend</b> {{the rest of her}} life in captivity.

5|$|As a {{criminal}} lawyer who took on dramatic cases, Macdonald got himself noticed {{well beyond the}} narrow confines of the Kingston business community.

50|$|Title IV - Nutrition. Title IV of {{the conference}} {{agreement}} <b>would</b> reduce nutrition <b>spending</b> by $8 billion over the 2014-2023 period, CBO estimates.
