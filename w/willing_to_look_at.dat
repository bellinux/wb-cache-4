500|$|Initial {{reactions}} to Akane were mixed. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator {{liked the way}} the first episode focused on Akane's first day {{as a police officer}} and her opinions of it. Thomas Zoth from The Fandom Post said Akane's personality is typical of those in dramas; he called her a [...] "naive waif who gets over her head with her first case". Zoth said that in later episodes, he liked the relationship Akane established with Masaoka and Ginoza, which resulted in several interesting scenes. Zoth said he grew to care about Akane {{during the first half of}} the series in [...] "a somewhat ironically 'moe' way, as she's grown as a character". In a similar review, Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network said Akane's actions in the first episode [...] " [...] her up as the clear-eyed, albeit naïve, outsider of the story, <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> things differently". David West from Neo noted how weak Akane's character was in early episodes due to how often Kogami did her work. Moreover, once Kogami was impressed by Akane when she requested to revive her traumatic experience to see Makishima's face, West still felt the character was underdeveloped in contrast to Kogami's comments about her growth.|$|E
2500|$|Kimishima {{stated in}} {{interviews}} in January 2017 that the annual {{cost for the}} service in Japan would be between two and three thousand yen (between $17–27 USD); media outlets noted that should this pricing be similar in other regions, it would be approximately half the annual cost of the subscription services on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, discounting {{the fact that the}} two services include features not contained within the Switch online services. Kimishima stated that this price point range was a subject of importance in designing the Switch's online services, and that regardless of what competitors were doing, [...] "it's a matter of getting our content to the consumer at a price point that will make them happy, and then we're <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what else we can do going forward."

60|$|When awake [Endnote: 1], or {{beginning}} to awake, he lay {{for some time}} in a maze; not a disagreeable one, but thoughts were running to and fro in his mind, all mixed and jumbled together. Reminiscences of early days, even those that were Preadamite; referring, we mean, to those times in the almshouse, which he could not at ordinary times remember at all; but now {{there seemed to be}} visions of old women and men, and pallid girls, and little dirty boys, which could only be referred to that epoch. Also, and most vividly, there was the old Doctor, with his sternness, his fierceness, his mystery; and all that happened since, playing phantasmagoria before his yet unclosed eyes; nor, so mysterious was his state, did he know, when he should unclose those lids, where he should find himself. He was content to let the world go on in this way, as long as it would, and therefore did not hurry, but rather kept back the proofs of awakening; <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the scenes that were unrolling for his amusement, as it seemed; and willing, too, to keep it uncertain whether he were not back in America, and in his boyhood, and all other subsequent impressions a dream or a prophetic vision. But at length something stirring near him,--or whether it stirred, or whether he dreamed it, he could not quite tell,--but the uncertainty impelled him, at last, to open his eyes, and see whereabouts he was.|$|E

40|$|Much {{analysis}} {{of race in}} Australia focuses on ‘racist’ ideas and individuals. This group is often understood to be disconnected {{from the rest of}} the Australian population who are identified as being anti-racist or neutral and ‘benign’ on issues of race. While commentators and academics are happy to analyze the ‘racist’ Australians, they seem far less <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the group that they themselves generally identify with. Whiteness studies, working from the premise that all whites benefit from their racial identity, creates a space to scrutinize these ideas of benign whiteness. The construction of benign whiteness is apparent in arguments about land rights in the 1970 s, multiculturalism in the 1980 s, the political success of Pauline Hanson in the 1990 s, and reconciliation and the history wars in the present decade. This paper attempts to provide historical contextualization to these constructions of benign whiteness and analyzes the power relations inherent in anti-racist practice. It proposes that the idea of a benign white nation with elements of aberrant racism helps to ensure the perpetuation of white race dominance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The review {{presents}} the newly published book "Electrophysiological Recording Techniques" by Humana Press. This {{is an important}} collection of articles devoted to {{an issue that has}} gained increasing attention in modern neuroscience research - electrophysiological recording techniques. The present book is a timely update of methods spanning from single cell recordings to local field potentials, cortical, and scalp EEG recordings. The book {{presents the}} progressive development of electrophysiological recording methods by including both existing and new advanced technologies. Theoretical considerations on important issues like current source density analysis, local field potential and signal generation are also in focus. In most of the chapters, methods are illustrated with specific experimental results and are discussed towards future developments and applications. Chapters can be read independently because each chapter appears with its own theoretical background, literature survey and specific methodology. The book can be of interest to a broader audience <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the contemporary state of development of electrophysiological methods. Also, it can be of special interest to scientists with high expertise working in the field of neuroscience and behavior. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports {{findings}} of a research study undertaken to determine the attitudes and perceptions of acupuncture, chiropractic, and massage therapy faculty with regard to online learning within their respective disciplines, and to determine how they might be persuaded to teach online. The study surveyed faculty teaching at schools in these three fields and followed up with additional interviews. The study results indicate that, in general, acupuncture, chiropractic, and massage therapy faculty lack awareness of the capabilities of online education and the elements of good online learning. There is also a perception that what they teach cannot be taught online because of its kinesthetic requirements. The faculty hold this perception {{in spite of the}} success of medical science and related health care fields in the online environment, and they do not seem to separate the kinesthetic from the didactic. The present study indicates that faculty opinions about online instruction in this alternative type of education range from being <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the potential of online education to outright dismissing it...|$|E
40|$|Indian {{government}} has undertaken significant modifications in the Intellectual Property (IP) regime of the country. This {{is leading to}} a realignment of business strategies by firms in several sectors. Similarly, with liberalization and globalization, new opportunities for IP creation seem to be emerging for Indian firms. Unfortunately, writing on these issues has been more emotional and few are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the issues dispassionately and in a pragmatic manner. A more informed debate on what is required in the new Intellectual Property Act to facilitate active participation of Indian firms in the global technology and production networks is desirable. Given the fact that IT is a growth sector for the country, one needs to assess the utility of various TRIPS compatible policy alternatives. In this context, this paper attempts to document the emerging perspectives vis-à-vis IPRs in the Indian IT industry and explore factors that are driving the change in perspectives. This paper suggests that: Perspectives on IP are changing rapidly: Large IT firms and firms in high-end niche areas are proactively seeking IP-based growth strategies. While they typically seek IP protection in Western nations {{and not so much}} in India, this has led them to perceiv...|$|E
40|$|Attitudes about {{abortion}} {{have been studied}} in relation to many variables. This study seeks to discover the relationship between abortion attitudes and cognitive complexity. Cognitive complexity {{is a measure of}} an individual’s ability to see situations as multifaceted. Sixty-three unmarried and childless undergraduate females were given an attitude {{about abortion}} scale which included ten items as well as a test of cognitive complexity modified from Hunt, Bulter, Noy and Rosser’s Assessing Conceptual Level by the Paragraph Completion Method (1978). The results were expected to be an inverse u-shaped with those scoring high on cognitive complexity scoring in the mid-range on the attitudes about abortion scale while those scoring low on the measure of cognitive complexity scoring on one of the extreme ends of the attitudes about abortion scale. This result was expected because the intermediate range on abortion attitudes may mean that those individuals are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> each situation individually instead of just {{on the basis of a}} strong pro-life or pro-choice attitude. In contrast to expectations, the results show no relationship between the two variables; however, there were significant differences in responses to the items about abortion, dependent on the type of scenario...|$|E
