5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching predator. All the birds in the groups will be vigilant in looking for a predator because there is an advantage to seeing the predator first. There is also the risk that in a bigger group there will more false alarm signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which the birds <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> up into the trees. It was found the birds did not however give this signal {{when there was a}} snake.|$|E

5|$|P.exclamans {{has several}} {{different}} predators. Their most dangerous predators are birds, which <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> by and knock the nest to the ground. This phenomenon {{was discovered by}} the disappearance of nests, and wasp nests being found on the ground near the bird’s nest. It has also been found that birds eat the larvae from the P.exclamans nest. This attack kills the whole nest but it isn’t very effective against the adults from the colony. When attacked, the adults fly away either to another colony or a satellite colony.|$|E
5|$|Teams {{choosing}} {{to develop new}} air vehicle types have never won, as they are disadvantaged in comparison to those which adapt existing, working, air vehicles, and can therefore concentrate on performing the mission rather than developing something that <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> at all. As a result, adaptations of conventional rotary wing and fixed wing entries {{have always been the}} overall winners, with airships and ducted fans a close second.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtship}} {{rituals of}} the American goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male {{is able to}} signal his quality and fitness, both {{in the short term}} (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage). If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.|$|E

5|$|The male then {{leads the}} female to {{potential}} nest sites, {{and the female}} will choose one. The female dove builds the nest. The male <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> about, gather material, {{and bring it to}} her. The male will stand on the female's back and give the material to the female, who then builds it into the nest. The nest is constructed of twigs, conifer needles, or grass blades, and is of flimsy construction. Mourning doves will sometimes requisition the unused nests of other mourning doves, other birds, or arboreal mammals such as squirrels.|$|E
5|$|The {{status quo}} {{is no longer an}} option and there is an unquenchable desire for greater devolution. Quite simply, the Scottish people want to be more {{directly}} and deeply involved in the decisions that affect them and the generations to come.

5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E

5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan {{demonstrates that the}} female is continuously {{evaluating the quality of}} the male and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory {{at the beginning of a}} new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male’s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E
5|$|Beetles' flight {{wings are}} crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra. A fold (jugum) of the {{membrane}} {{at the base}} of each wing is characteristic. Some beetles have lost the ability to fly. These include some ground beetles (Carabidae) and some true weevils (Curculionidae), as well as desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, as in the glow-worms (Phengodidae), where the females resemble larvae throughout their lives. The presence of elytra and wings does not always indicate that the beetle <b>will</b> <b>fly.</b> For example, the tansy beetle walks between habitats despite being physically capable of flight.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mating}} season, the male moults its brown {{feathers}} and displays a fiery red plumage. It may fluff its red back and shoulder feathers out so they cover {{part of the}} wings in a puffball-display. It <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> about and confront another male to repel it, or to assert dominance over a female. It also picks red petals and sometimes red seeds and presents them to other birds. 90% of the time, the male presents to a female in {{what appears to be}} a courtship ritual. The other 10% of the time, it presents to another male in an act of apparent aggression.|$|E

5|$|Linguist Derek Bickerton, {{building}} {{on the work of}} biologist Bernd Heinrich, has argued that ravens are one of only four known animals (the others being bees, ants, and humans) who have demonstrated displacement, the capacity to communicate about objects or events that are distant in space or time from the communication. Young, unmated common ravens roost together at night, but usually forage alone during the day. However, when one discovers a large carcass guarded by a pair of adult ravens, the unmated raven will return to the roost and communicate the find. The following day, a flock of unmated ravens <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> to the carcass and chase off the adults. Bickerton argues that the advent of linguistic displacement was perhaps the most important event in the evolution of human language, and that ravens are the only other vertebrate to share this with humans.|$|E
5|$|Nuptial flight occurs after rain {{for several}} days, taking place between summer and mid-autumn (December to March). The males and virgin queens emerge from their nest, and unlike other species who mate {{on the ground}} or climb onto nearby trees or {{branches}} to fly off from, the reproductive alates <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> from the nest. Recorded nuptial flights usually took place on hilltops. M. nigriceps queens are not known to seal up their entrance during colony foundation, unlike other Myrmecia species such as M. regularis. Workers can live exceptionally long, with an average lifespan of 2.2 years; maximum longevity in workers varied from 2.1 to 2.4 years.|$|E
5|$|Satellite nests {{are common}} among P. exclamans. A queen <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> somewhere between 0.15 and 11m {{away from the}} {{original}} nest to settle in a new location. About 16–39% of nests create satellites from May to July. Similar to the wasp species, Parischnogaster alternata, constructing multitude of nests in clusters {{in order to create}} protection through dilution effect, the satellites are used as an insurance against attacks by predators and parasitoids. Of 12 nests that were knocked down by birds that had satellites, 66.7% of the colony survived by moving to the satellite, compared to the reproductive success of nests with no satellite that were attacked (5.7%). When Chalcoela iphitalis invades, the prevalence of satellites didn’t increase the survivability, however it did have an effect when Elasmus polistis were introduced. It gave the P. exclamans a place to escape to.|$|E

5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level. When the right amount of ingredients has been put in the bowl, a cake is baked and a new level begins.|$|E
5|$|When hatched, {{the chicks}} are downy. Neither altricial nor precocial, the chicks {{begin to move}} around and explore their {{surroundings}} within one to three days after hatching. Usually they do not stray far from the nest. Chicks are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after hatching. Both parents care for hatchlings. Chick diets always include fish, and parents selectively bring larger prey items to chicks than they eat themselves. Males bring more food than females. Feeding by the parents lasts for roughly a month before being weaned off slowly. After fledging, the juveniles learn to feed themselves, including the difficult method of plunge-diving. They <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> south to winter {{with the help of}} their parents.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake is a {{difficult}} bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation, but will sometimes emerge into the open. Occasionally, individuals may become very trusting; for five consecutive summers, an individual crake on the Scottish island of Tiree entered a kitchen to feed on scraps, and, in 1999, a wintering Barra bird would come for poultry feed once the chickens had finished. In Africa, it is more secretive than the African crake, and, unlike its relative, it is rarely seen in the open, although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides. The corn crake is most active early and late in the day, after heavy rain and during light rain. Its typical flight is weak and fluttering, although less so {{than that of the}} African crake. For longer flights, such as migration, it has a steadier, stronger action with legs drawn up. It walks with a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened. It will swim if essential. When flushed by a dog, it <b>will</b> <b>fly</b> less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then crouch on landing. If disturbed in the open, this crake will often run in a crouch for a short distance, with its neck stretched forward, then stand upright to watch the intruder. When captured it may feign death, recovering at once if it sees a way out.|$|E
