5|$|After the 1982 season, Perkins became {{head coach}} of the University of Alabama and the Giants hired Parcells to replace him. In the coming years this change proved crucial to the Giants and Taylor.

5|$|From the lake, Cortés {{continued}} {{south along}} the western slopes of the Maya Mountains, a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover , during which he lost {{more than two-thirds of}} his horses. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cortés turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.|$|E

5|$|Symes {{returned}} to Shrewsbury and started pre-season training {{ahead of the}} 2008–09 season, having been told by Simpson {{that he would be}} given the same chance as any other player at Shrewsbury to impress, and also personally vowing to force his way into the manager's first-team plans. However, Simpson signed new strikers during the summer including Grant Holt, who cost a club record £170,000, and Symes spent {{the start of the season}} out of the team. After scoring six goals in two consecutive reserve games, Symes earned his first game for the first team, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> off the bench to score a late equaliser and earn Shrewsbury a 2–2 draw with Notts County on 30 August. After starting in a 2–1 Football League Trophy victory against Exeter City, he was again sidelined when he picked up a knee injury.

5|$|The 2011–12 season saw Totti {{initially}} receive few starts under Roma's {{new manager}} Luis Enrique, as the club's early struggles continued. Totti sustained an injury on 1 October 2011 {{in the second}} half of a match against Atalanta, which kept him out of action until the 20 November; he returned to the pitch against Lecce, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> off the bench in the 66th minute, as Roma won the match 2–1.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{budget was}} quickly surpassed, {{and back in}} Los Angeles, Wasserman grew increasingly frustrated. He was regularly confronting Ned Tanen, the executive in charge of production for Universal, in person over the costs.

Filming there, which was supposed to have concluded in the middle of September, continued into late October.|$|E

5|$|Balabushka used Titlist blanks until 1966 {{when he was}} {{contacted}} by Chicagoan Burton Spain. Spain had recently begun making handmade spliced blanks and was supplying them to Balabushka's closest rival, Frank Paradise. Spain had become fascinated by splicing technology <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> upon a Titlist cue split down the middle in 1965 {{and set out to}} perfect and even improve on the Titlist splice. Spain's original intent was to be predominantly a cuemaker in his own right using his proprietary spliced blanks. However, by 1966 Spain's superior blanks were in high demand and he instead turned to making blanks for other cuemakers full-time, which he continued until 1970.|$|E
5|$|George III {{reversed}} {{this trend}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> {{to the throne}} in 1760. George disliked Hampton Court, and was attracted by the park at Windsor Castle. George wanted {{to move into the}} Ranger's House by the castle, but his brother, Henry was already living in it and refused to move out. Instead, George had to move into the Upper Lodge, later called the Queen's Lodge, and started the long process of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks. Initially the atmosphere at the castle remained very informal, with local children playing games inside the Upper and Lower Wards, and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds. As time went by, however, access for visitors became more limited.|$|E
5|$|He {{signed for}} Hull on a {{permanent}} basis on 28 May 2013, joining on a two-year contract. He made his debut {{on the first day}} of the 2013–14 season <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> off the bench in a 2–0 loss away at Chelsea. On 17 May 2014 he played as a substitute in the 2014 FA Cup Final against Arsenal. This resulted in Hull qualifying for the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, in their first major European competition. Boyd made his European début in the first leg of the play-off round match against K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen.|$|E

5|$|His brother Manuel Silvestre Alberti {{signed the}} popular {{petition}} formulated on 25 May that aimed to draft {{the composition of}} the Primera Junta that would replace Cisneros in power. On that day Alberti moved to Azcuénaga's house and from it he observed the events in the plaza, along with many other patriots gathered there. He was there <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to know that he was chosen {{as a member of the}} new Junta. The reasons of Alberti's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists, and Alberti in particular may have been elected to serve as chaplain of the government.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007 Evans {{came off}} the bench to make his senior debut in City’s 1–0 League Cup victory against Norwich City. With first choice {{opportunities}} at City limited Evans moved on loan to Norwich City in November of that year, agreeing a deal until 1 January 2008. He made his debut for Norwich the following week <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> on as a substitute in the 3–1 victory over Blackpool. His first goal for the club came two games later, and just two minutes into his first start in a 2–1 victory over Plymouth Argyle {{at the start of}} December. Evans returned to Manchester City after his initial loan deal expired in January 2008, having made eight appearances and scored two goals.|$|E
