500|$|Despite being {{relieved}} that war was over, Alice was {{appalled by the}} behaviour of Prussian troops in Hesse; Berlin took the grand duchy's railways and telegraph systems, and assessed Hesse for three million florins in indemnity. Alice wrote to her mother, who in turn wrote to Princess Victoria, who responded that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do to relieve the [...] "painful and distressing position darling Alice was in", as it was [...] "one of the unavoidable results of this dreadful war". Influence came from the Emperor of Russia, who urged the Prussian King to allow the Grand Duke to keep his throne. The facts that the Emperor's mother was the Grand Duke's aunt, and Alice's sister being also the Prussian Crown Princess {{are likely to have}} influenced Prussia's generosity. However, Alice was angered by an untactful visit by Princess Victoria to the conquered region of Homburg, originally part of Hesse, shortly after it became Prussian territory.|$|E
60|$|But this {{improbable}} iniquity he had committed, and {{now there}} <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not believe of him. In the first place it was quite manifest that he was tipsy; in the next place {{it was to be}} taken as proved that all his religion was sheer hypocrisy; and finally the man was utterly shameless. She therefore stood watching for the sound of his footfall, not without some fear that he might creep out at her suddenly from among the bushes.|$|E

6000|$|And Gyp went on smiling. Between that, and {{stabbing}} these false raptures to the heart, {{there seemed}} to <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do. The moment his hands relaxed, {{she got up and}} said: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "She, and {{pardon me}} for repeating, was amazing. It {{is the one}} {{adequate}} word. Even the most minor adjectives applicable to her {{are bound to be}} sheer superlatives. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not do better than any woman and than most men. Sing, play--bah!--as some rhetorician once said of old Nap, competition fled from her. Swim! She could have made a fortune and a name as a public performer. She was one of those rare women who can strip off all the frills of dress, and in simple swimming suit be more satisfying beautiful. Dress! She was an artist.|$|E
60|$|This was {{a terrible}} state of things for Rosie. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do; and to sit still and wait was torture {{to one of her}} restless, {{energetic}} mind. When her mistress was out of the house she could give vent to her spite by getting into Fan's room and teasing her in every way that her malice suggested. But Fan usually locked her out, and would not even open the door to take in her dinner when it was brought; then Rosie would wait until it was cold before leaving it on the landing.|$|E
60|$|Already {{the people}} of Vaucouleurs {{had given her a}} horse and had armed and {{equipped}} her as a soldier. She got no chance to try the horse and see if she could ride it, for her great first duty was to abide at her post and lift up the hopes and spirits of all who would come to talk with her, and prepare them to help in the rescue and regeneration of the kingdom. This occupied every waking moment she had. But it was no matter. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not learnand in the briefest time, too. Her horse would find this out in the first hour. Meantime the brothers and I took the horse in turn and began to learn to ride. And we had teaching {{in the use of the}} sword and other arms also.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure she}} will," [...] the {{sergeant}} said briefly, and then added, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> else <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do," [...] and saluting {{he went out}} of the room.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{studied him}} with {{unobtrusive}} interest. It {{was obvious that}} he was not prospering, and he looked worn. This roused her compassion, though she realized that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do. The man’s pride stood between them.|$|R
60|$|But for the moment, of course, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ask: <b>she</b> {{would be}} {{married in a}} couple of days--alas! so soon!--and after that it would be to her husband that she must look for devotion, for {{guidance}} and for sympathy.|$|R
6000|$|A {{great deal}} more was said, but nothing that was said had the {{slightest}} effect on Ayala. When she was told of her dependent position, and of the splendour of the prospects offered, she declared that she would rather go into the poor-house than marry her cousin. When she was told that Tom was good-natured, honest, and true, she declared that good-nature, honesty, and truth {{had nothing to do}} with it. When she was asked what it was that she looked forward to in the world she could merely sob and say that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not tell even her sister Lucy of those dreams and castles. How, then, could she explain them to her Aunt Margaret? How could she make her aunt understand that there could be no place in her heart for Tom Tringle seeing that it was to be kept in reserve for some angel of light who would surely make his appearance in due season,--but who must still be there, present to her as her angel of light, even should he never show himself in the flesh. How vain it was to talk of Tom Tringle to her, when she had so visible before her eyes that angel of light with whom she was compelled to compare him! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know his}} nature so well, {{and feel that}} he would not bear rebuffs of which many another man would think nothing." [...] Thus, she did not doubt, the Marchesa had spoken very truly. But of what value was all that now? She could not recall the rebuff. She could not now {{eradicate}} the cowardice which had made her repeat those wicked fatal words,--"I cannot." [...] "I cannot." [...] "I cannot." [...] The letter had come too late, for there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do to amend her doom. She must send some answer to her friend in Italy, but there could be nothing in her answer to her to assist her. The feminine reserve and coyness had become odious to her,--as it had been displayed by herself to him. But it still remained in full force as to any assistance from others. She could not tell another to send him back to her. She could not implore help in her trouble. If he would come himself,--himself of his own accord,--himself impelled once more by his great tenderness of heart,--himself once more from his real, real love; then there should be no more coyness. [...] "If you will still have me,--oh yes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} didn't {{want the}} rubbish, if that's what you mean." [...] Mrs. Gereth, on the sofa, followed {{the direction of}} her companion's eyes; with the light of her satisfaction still in her face, she slowly rubbed her large, handsome hands. Wherever she was, she was herself the great piece in the gallery. It was the first Fleda had heard of there being [...] "rubbish" [...] at Poynton, but she didn't for the moment take up this insincerity; she only, from where {{she stood in the}} room, called out, one after the other, as if she had had a list in her hand, the pieces that in the great house had been scattered and that now, if they had a fault, were too much like a minuet danced on a hearth-rug. She knew them each, in every chink and charm--knew them by the personal name their distinctive sign or story had given them; and a second time she felt how, against her intention, this uttered knowledge struck her hostess as so much free approval. Mrs. Gereth was never indifferent to approval, and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> so love you for as for doing justice to her deep morality. There was a particular gleam in her eyes when Fleda exclaimed at last, dazzled by the display: [...] "And even the Maltese cross!" [...] That description, though technically incorrect, had always been applied, at Poynton, to a small but marvelous crucifix of ivory, a masterpiece of delicacy, of expression, and of the great Spanish period, the existence and precarious accessibility of which she had heard of at Malta, years before, by an odd and romantic chance--a clue followed through mazes of secrecy till the treasure was at last unearthed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have loved}} you ever since I was a boy." [...] He paused {{as though he}} {{expected}} that she would make some answer to this; but of course there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say. [...] "I have been true to you since we were together almost as children." ...|$|R
50|$|Clausen {{had already}} relinquished her parental rights so there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do.

60|$|He had {{uttered the}} hope that he should see her the next day, but Fleda could easily reflect that he wouldn't see her if she were not there to be seen. If there was a {{thing in the world}} she desired at that moment, it was that the next day should have no point of {{resemblance}} with the day that had just elapsed. She accordingly aspired to an absence: she would go immediately down to Maggie. She ran out that evening and telegraphed to her sister, and in the morning she quitted London by an early train. She required for this step no reason but the sense of necessity. It was a strong personal need; she wished to interpose something, and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> interpose but distance, but time. If Mrs. Brigstock had to deal with Owen she would allow Mrs. Brigstock the chance. To be there, to be in the midst of it, was the reverse of what she craved: she had already been more in the midst of it than had ever entered into her plan. At any rate she had renounced her plan; she had no plan now but the plan of separation. This was to abandon Owen, to give up the fine office of helping him back to his own; but when she had undertaken that office she had not foreseen that Mrs. Gereth would defeat it by a manoeuvre so simple. The scene at her father's rooms had extinguished all offices, and the scene at her father's rooms was of Mrs. Gereth's producing. Owen, at all events, must now act for himself: he had obligations to meet, he had satisfactions to give, and Fleda fairly ached with the wish that he might be equal to them. She never knew the extent of her tenderness for him till she became conscious of the present force of her desire that he should be superior, be perhaps even sublime. She obscurely made out that superiority, that sublimity, mightn't after all be fatal. She closed her eyes and lived {{for a day or two}} in the mere beauty of confidence. It was with her on the short journey; it was with her at Maggie's; it glorified the mean little house in the stupid little town. Owen had grown larger to her: he would do, like a man, whatever he should have to do. He wouldn't be weak--not as she was: she herself was weak exceedingly.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was into}} this {{going on as}} he was that they relapsed, and really for so long a time that the day inevitably came for a further {{sounding}} of their depths. These depths, constantly bridged over by a structure firm enough {{in spite of its}} lightness and of its occasional oscillation in the somewhat vertiginous air, invited on occasion, in the interest of their nerves, a dropping of the plummet and a measurement of the abyss. A difference had been made moreover, once for all, by {{the fact that she had}} all the while not appeared to feel the need of rebutting his charge of an idea within her that she didn't dare to express--a charge uttered just before one of the fullest of their later discussions ended. It had come up for him then that she [...] "knew" [...] something and that what she knew was bad--too bad to tell him. When he had spoken of it as visibly so bad that she was afraid he might find it out, her reply had left the matter too equivocal to be let alone and yet, for Marcher's special sensibility, almost too formidable again to touch. He circled about it at a distance that alternately narrowed and widened and that still wasn't much affected by the consciousness in him that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> [...] "know," [...] after all, any better than he did. She had no source of knowledge he hadn't equally--except of course that she might have finer nerves. That was what women had where they were interested; they made out things, where people were concerned, that the people often couldn't have made out for themselves. Their nerves, their sensibility, their imagination, were conductors and revealers, and the beauty of May Bartram was in particular that she had given herself so to his case. He felt in these days what, oddly enough, he had never felt before, the growth of a dread of losing her by some catastrophe--some catastrophe that yet wouldn't at all be the catastrophe: partly because she had almost of a sudden begun to strike him as more useful to him than ever yet, and partly by reason of an appearance of uncertainty in her health, co-incident and equally new. It was characteristic of the inner detachment he had hitherto so successfully cultivated and to which our whole account of him is a reference, it was characteristic that his complications, such as they were, had never yet seemed so as at this crisis to thicken about him, even to the point of making him ask himself if he were, by any chance, of a truth, within sight or sound, within touch or reach, within the immediate jurisdiction, of the thing that waited.|$|E
60|$|When Janet {{sat down}} {{shivering}} on the door-stone, {{with the door}} shut upon her past life, and the future black and unshapen before her as the night, the scenes of her childhood, her youth and her painful womanhood, rushed back upon her consciousness, and made one picture with her present desolation. The petted child taking her newest toy to bed with her--the young girl, proud in strength and beauty, dreaming that life was an easy thing, {{and that it was}} pitiful weakness to be unhappy--the bride, passing with trembling joy from the outer court to the inner sanctuary of woman's life--the wife, beginning her initiation into sorrow, wounded, resenting, yet still hoping and forgiving--the poor bruised woman, seeking through weary years the one refuge of despair, oblivion:--Janet seemed to herself all these in the same moment that she was conscious of being seated on the cold stone under the shock of a new misery. All her early gladness, all her bright hopes and illusions, all her gifts of beauty and affection, served only to darken the riddle of her life; they were the betraying promises of a cruel destiny which had brought out those sweet blossoms only that the winds and storms might have a greater work of desolation, which had nursed her like a pet fawn into tenderness and fond expectation, only that she might feel a keener terror in the clutch of the panther. Her mother had sometimes said that troubles were sent to make us better and draw us nearer to God. What mockery that seemed to Janet! Her troubles had been sinking her lower from year to year, pressing upon her like heavy fever-laden vapours, and perverting the very plenitude of her nature into a deeper source of disease. Her wretchedness had been a perpetually tightening instrument of torture, which had gradually absorbed all the other sensibilities of her nature into the sense of pain and the maddened craving for relief. Oh, if some ray of hope, of pity, of consolation, would pierce through the horrible gloom, she might believe then in a Divine love--in a heavenly Father who cared for His children! But now she had no faith, no trust. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> lean on in the wide world, for her mother was only a fellow-sufferer in her own lot. The poor patient woman could do little more than mourn with her daughter: she had humble resignation enough to sustain her own soul, but she could no more give comfort and fortitude to Janet, than the withered ivy-covered trunk can bear up its strong, full-boughed offspring crashing down under an Alpine storm. Janet felt she was alone: no human soul had measured her anguish, had understood her self-despair, had entered into her sorrows and her sins with that deep-sighted sympathy which is wiser than all blame, more potent than all reproof--such sympathy as had swelled her own heart for many a sufferer. And if there was any Divine Pity, she could not feel it; it kept aloof from her, it poured no balm into her wounds, it stretched out no hand to bear up her weak resolve, to fortify her fainting courage.|$|E
60|$|The {{afternoon}} passed {{very slowly}} with the little, anxious lady, and {{every now and}} then she crept softly out of the tent and gazed expectantly up the steep hillside. Still, each time she did it, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see except the long ranks of somber firs, and the oppressive silence was broken only by the sound of the river.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say {{to comfort}} him.

So much she now learned, and could tell herself that had she known him better she would either have prevented this second visit, or would have been careful that he should have learned the truth from herself before he came. Now <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only wait till he should again have got strength to hide his suffering under the veil of his own manliness.|$|R
5000|$|Mulholland {{was the one}} {{who gave}} Michael and Rita Schwerner an [...] "orientation" [...] on {{what you need to know}} about being a white activist in the state of Mississippi.

6000|$|... "I want to {{talk about}} Beatrice," [...] he declared. [...] "I want to tell you {{everything}} about her. I know that you will understand. We were brought up together in the same country place. We were both thrown upon the world about the same time. That was one thing, I suppose, which made us kindly disposed towards one another. We corresponded always. I commenced my unsuccessful fight in London. I lived--I can't tell you how--week by week, month by month. I ate coarse food, I was a hanger-on to the fringe of everything in life which appealed to me, fed intellectually on the crumbs of free libraries and picture galleries. I met no one of my own station--I was at a public school and my people were gentlefolk--or tastes. I had no friends in London before whom I dared present myself, no money to join a club where I might have mixed with my fellows, no one to talk to or exchange a single idea with--and I wasn't always the gloomy sort of person I have become; in my younger days I loved companionship. And the women--my landlady's daughter, with dyed hair, a loud voice, slatternly in the morning, a flagrant imitation of her less honest sisters at night! Who else? Where was I to meet women when I didn't even know men? I spent my poor holidays at Detton Magna. Our very loneliness brought Beatrice and me closer together. We used to walk in those ugly fields around Detton Magna and exchanged the story of our woes. She was a teacher at the national school. The children weren't pleasant, their parents were worse. The drudgery was horrible, and there wasn't any escape for her. Sometimes she would sob as we sat side by side. She, too, wanted something out of life, as I did, and there seemed nothing but that black wall always before us. I think that we clung together because we shared a common misery. We talked endlessly of a way out. For me what was there? There was no one to rob--I wasn't clever enough. There was no way I could earn money, honestly or dishonestly. And for her, buried in that Derbyshire village amongst the collieries, where there was scarcely a person who hadn't the taint of the place upon them--what chance was there for her? There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do, either. I knew in my heart that we were both ready for evil things, if by evil things we could make our escape. And we couldn't. So we tried to lose ourselves in the only fields left for such as we. We read poetry. We tried to live in that unnatural world where the brains only are nourished and the body languishes. It was a morbid, unhealthy existence, but I plodded along and so did she. Then her weekly letters became different. For the first time she wrote me with reserves. I took a day's vacation and I went down to Detton Magna to see what had happened." ...|$|E

60|$|It was, Grace fancied, half an {{hour later}} when they floundered down a declivity, with the roar of the river growing louder in their ears. It was with {{difficulty}} she kept in the saddle, and she was vaguely conscious that her skirt was rent to tatters, though she was too stiff and cold to trouble about that now. Even in the thicker timber the snow was almost bewildering, and it was only now and then <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see Ingleby scrambling and floundering in front of her.

She might grow discontented, he fancied, and perhaps a trifle bitter, though he could not imagine her becoming querulous.|$|R
5000|$|Plummer {{found her}} lot much {{improved}} by these encounters, as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> correct that <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have done could have earned her more respect than standing her ground and fighting.

Just then Lilija, having been freed by the Russians and now in their service as an officer, shows up, interrupts the rape, and saves Charlotte from further harm (execution) by arranging her inclusion as a nurse in the Soviet field hospital. She does however proceed to shoot Sonja, stating there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do to alter a death penalty for a collaborator, noting that she has at least saved her from suffering sexual abuse at the hand of the soldiers.|$|E
