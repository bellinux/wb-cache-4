5|$|The routes {{around the}} city of Preston, {{including}} the by-pass {{as part of the}} modern day M6 motorway, are recognised as being some of the most congested in the UK, <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> to and from Preston being labelled amongst the country's top 25 most congested routes.|$|E
5|$|The southeastern {{bridge was}} the first to be completed, and was opened to traffic on 19 September 1952, <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> {{continuing}} to use the other two bridges of the previous Causeway. Work then continued on the northwestern bridge and the further reclamation of land.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, an {{inspection}} programme was launched (costing £1.2million) {{to assess the}} condition of the main suspension cables after corrosion was discovered in a number of older bridges in the United States of a similar design and size. The study was completed two years later and reported that the main cables had suffered an 8–10% loss of strength. Future projections highlighted the likelihood of this accelerating, <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> restrictions to limit loading required in 2014 in the worst-case scenario, followed by full closure by 2020.|$|E

5|$|The NTSB {{recommended}} that the FAA revise the procedures for ATC facilities {{in the area to}} facilitate the process for VFR traffic that wishes to transit Class B airspace. This included establishing procedures to coordinate such requests between facilities; requiring controllers to instruct pilots to self-announce on the VFR corridor frequency if they are unable to immediately enter Class B airspace; adding information to area Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) broadcasts reminding pilots to use the self-announce frequency; and ensuring that pilots are provided <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> advisories if they are in contact with a controller.|$|E
5|$|The North Circular Road has a {{wide variety}} of styles and {{standards}} of junctions connecting to other roads. These range from the complex, grade-separated design at Charlie Brown's near Woodford, to at-grade junctions <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> lights. The original road contained entirely at-grade junctions; many of these were improved and grade separated during the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The game's city {{environment}} is modeled after Chicago, including {{many of its}} landmarks, such as the 'L', the Willis Tower (then known as the Sears Tower), Wrigley Field, and Soldier Field. The streets feature a number of objects into which the player can crash, including trash bins, parking meters, mailboxes, and traffic lights. In Checkpoint, other vehicles move in accordance <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> lights, but the player is {{under no obligation to}} obey them.|$|E

5|$|The outside {{edges of}} the Green are bordered by benches and trees; two {{flagpoles}} stand {{at the center of}} the western side. The plot is bounded by four streets: Wheelock Street to the south, College Street to the east, Wentworth Street to the north, and Main Street to the west. All but Wheelock Street are one-way roads, <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> circulating counter-clockwise around the Green.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of {{junctions}} on the A303. These range from motorway-style free-flowing junctions such as that with the A36 near Wylye, to simple forks on the single carriageway sections. Some junctions, such as the Countess Roundabout with the A345 near Amesbury, are known congestion hotspots because they are insufficient to cope <b>with</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|US-24 and US-40 run {{concurrently}} with I-70 and the Kansas Turnpike as it heads east toward Kansas City. The {{first free}} exit on the turnpike is a diamond interchange with 110th Street at Exit 410. This interchange is located {{just south of}} the Kansas Speedway. Just east of here, the route intersects I-435 at Exit 411. This exit uses a cloverleaf interchange with one directional ramp and collector–distributor roads to avoid issues <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> exiting immediately north of the turnpike. After this interchange, the highway enters Kansas City.|$|E

5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown is {{a racing}} video game {{developed}} by Criterion Games {{and published by}} Electronic Arts. It is the third instalment in the Burnout series, which is characterised by fast-paced arcade racing. A staple of the series {{is the use of}} boost, earned through risky driving, to rapidly increase a car's speed. The central mechanic introduced in Burnout 3 is Takedowns, which allow players to slam their opponents until they crash. Takedowns work in conjunction with the boost system by filling up and extending the boost meter. Aside from standard circuit races, the game features modes focused on performing Takedowns on rival vehicles and causing monetary damage at a junction occupied <b>with</b> <b>traffic.</b> Each game variant is featured in a single-player campaign mode called World Tour, which serves as the primary method for unlocking new and faster cars. The game supports both online and split-screen multiplayer.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown is {{a racing}} video game with arcade-style {{gameplay}} that emphasises dangerous and fast-paced driving. The game features standard circuit races which {{take place on}} carriageways and city streets populated <b>with</b> <b>traffic.</b> The Single Race mode pits the player against five AI opponents in a single or multiple lap race. During a race, boost, which is earned by acts of reckless driving such as drifting around corners, near misses <b>with</b> <b>traffic,</b> and driving in oncoming lanes, {{can be used to}} rapidly increase a car's speed. Boost can be used immediately in Burnout 3, unlike previous Burnout games which required the boost meter to be full. The quickest method for earning boost is a Takedown—a central mechanic introduced in this instalment of the series. A Takedown involves shunting opposing vehicles until they crash. Each one fills the boost meter and can provide an additional boost segment, causing the meter to extend up to four times its initial size. Ramming opponents will cause them to behave more aggressively in return; their level of hostility is indicated by a coloured arrow above their vehicle. When the player crashes or is taken out by an opponent, boost is lost and a bonus boost segment is withdrawn. During the crash sequence, a slow-motion mode called Impact Time can be activated. In Impact Time, the Aftertouch mechanic can be used to manoeuvre the wrecked car chassis into an opponent to get a Takedown, which acts as recovery move by negating the penalty of crashing.|$|E
40|$|Salmonella enterica {{requires}} a type III secretion system, designated Spi/Ssa, {{to survive and}} proliferate within macrophages. The Spi/Ssa system is encoded within the SPI- 2 pathogenicity island and appears to function intracellularly. Here, we establish that the SPI- 2 -encoded SpiC protein is exported by the Spi/Ssa type III secretion system into the host cell cytosol where it interferes <b>with</b> intracellular <b>trafficking.</b> In J 774 macrophages, wild-type Salmonella inhibited fusion of Salmonella-containing phagosomes with lysosomes and endosomes, and interfered <b>with</b> <b>trafficking</b> of vesicles devoid of the microorganism. These inhibitory activities required living Salmonella and a functional spiC gene. Purified SpiC protein inhibited endosome-endosome fusion in vitro. A Sindbis virus expressing the SpiC protein interfered <b>with</b> normal <b>trafficking</b> of the transferrin receptor in vivo. A spiC mutant was attenuated for virulence, suggesting {{that the ability to}} interfere <b>with</b> intracellular <b>trafficking</b> is essential for Salmonella pathogenesis...|$|R

5|$|By 1977, traffic {{had reached}} 172,300vehicles a day, which had {{increased}} by nearly 10percent {{over the previous}} year. It was hoped that the construction of SR52 would help to reduce the congestion. A revised Mission Gorge Road eastbound exit opened in 1979, merging <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> from I-15. Traffic reached 212,000vehicles a day by February1981, and Caltrans declared I-8 east of I-805 the busiest highway in the region. In 1987, Caltrans determined that I-8 west between College Avenue and Waring Road had the highest ratio of cars to number of lanes worldwide, at 2400cars per hour. Plans to add another lane to I-8 west from College Avenue to I-15 began in March1992.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other shopping centres such as Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre, Oxford Street remains in high demand as a retail location, with several chains hosting their flagship stores on the street, and {{has a number of}} listed buildings. The annual switching on of Christmas lights by a celebrity has been a popular event since 1959. However, the combination of a very popular retail area and a main thoroughfare for London buses and taxis has caused significant problems <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion, safety and pollution. Various traffic management schemes have been proposed by Transport for London, including a ban on private vehicles during daytime hours on weekdays and Saturdays, and improved pedestrian crossings.|$|E
5|$|Faversham was {{established}} as a settlement before the Roman conquest. The Romans established several towns in Kent including Faversham, <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> through the Saxon Shore ports of Reculver, Richborough, Dover and Lympne converging on Canterbury before heading up Watling Street to London. The town was less than 10 miles from Canterbury, and consequently Faversham had become established on this road network by 50 AD following the initial conquest by Claudius in 43 AD. Numerous remains of Roman buildings have been discovered in and around Faversham, including under St Mary of Charity Church where coins and urns were discovered during reconstruction of the western tower in 1794. In 2013, {{the remains of a}} 2,000-year-old Roman theatre, able to accommodate some 12,000 people, were discovered at a hillside near the town. The cockpit-style outdoor auditorium, {{the first of its kind}} found in Britain, was a style the Romans used elsewhere in their empire on the Continent.|$|E
