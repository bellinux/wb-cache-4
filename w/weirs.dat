5|$|Dams, <b>weirs</b> {{and other}} instream {{barriers}} block {{the migration of}} adult and juvenile Murray cod and prevent recolonisation of habitats and maintenance of isolated populations. Additionally, recent study has proven approximately 50% of Murray cod larvae are killed when they pass through undershot <b>weirs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Large scale {{irrigation}} commenced {{with the}} establishment of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) in 1912 which diverted water from the Murrumbidgee River near Narrandera. The River Murray Waters Agreement of 1915 allowed 26 <b>weirs</b> to be constructed with locks to provide permanent riverboat access to Echuca. When riverboat transport was no longer significant, the <b>weirs</b> supported irrigation. Irrigation in the region continued to develop with the construction of the Hume Dam between 1919 and 1931, the Burrinjuck Dam built in 1928 and Blowering Dam built in 1968.|$|E
5|$|The {{streams of}} the Peak District have been dammed to provide {{headwater}} for numerous water driven mills; <b>weirs</b> {{have been built}} across the rivers for the same purpose.|$|E
40|$|Riffles and pools have {{important}} roles for a river ecology and river environment. It {{is useful to}} develop a method for creation of riffle and pool. Our final goal is a development of technical method for creation of riffles and pools by means of over flow from <b>weir.</b> As first stage of it, we have studied that the characteristics of scours created by over flow from a sharp crested <b>weir</b> and an inclined <b>weir.</b> The main {{results of this study}} are as follows; (1) The maximum scour depths by the inclined <b>weir</b> are small compared with ones by the sharp crested <b>weir</b> when the gradients of inclined <b>weir</b> are mild. However, ones by the inclined <b>weir</b> approach ones by the sharp crested <b>weir</b> as the gradient of inclined <b>weir</b> become steep. (2) The maximum scour lengths by the inclined <b>weir</b> are large compared with ones by the sharp crested <b>weir</b> when the gradients of inclined <b>weir</b> are mild. (3) The scour depths in front of the <b>weir</b> by the inclined <b>weir</b> are large compared with ones by the sharp crested <b>weir</b> when the gradients of inclined <b>weir</b> are steep...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Weir</b> skimmers {{function}} {{by allowing}} the oil floating {{on the surface of}} the water to flow over a <b>weir.</b> There are two main types of <b>weir</b> skimmer, those that require the <b>weir</b> height to be manually adjusted and those where the <b>weir</b> height is automatic or self-adjusting. Whilst manually adjusted <b>weir</b> skimmer types can have a lower initial cost, the requirement for regular manual adjustment makes self-adjusting <b>weir</b> types more popular in most applications. <b>Weir</b> skimmers will collect water if operating when oil is no longer present. To overcome this limitation most <b>weir</b> type skimmers contain an automatic water drain on the oil collection tank[...]|$|R

5|$|Murray cod {{have died}} out {{in many of}} their upland habitats, {{particularly}} in the southern Murray-Darling basin, due {{to a combination of}} overfishing, siltation, dams and <b>weirs</b> blocking migration, pollution from arsenic-based sheep-dips, mining, and in some cases, introduced trout stockings, which causes competition between juvenile Murray cod and introduced trout species.|$|E
5|$|The rare floods that do {{break free}} of the dams and <b>weirs</b> of the Murray-Darling system have their {{magnitude}} and duration deliberately curtailed by river regulators. Increasing research indicates this management practice is very harmful and drastically reduces the general ecosystem benefits and breeding and recruitment opportunities for Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish species these now rare floods can provide.|$|E
5|$|At {{the south}} eastern {{corner of the}} eastern terrace is the former pumping station, {{associated}} tunnels {{and a set of}} 1850s workshops within an enclosing wall. Underneath parts of the eastern terrace, the adjacent Hampton Road, the pumping station and the workshops there are a complex series of shafts, drives and <b>weirs</b> cut from the rock during the 1890s and early twentieth century. The east workshops is a single storey limestone building on the western side with an enclosed area to the east. The entire workshops yard was roofed using a light steel truss on steel supports in 1960.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the River Slea was not navigable beyond Kyme, as {{the channel}} was inadequate, {{and there were}} fish <b>weirs</b> and water mills on its course. Three {{attempts}} were made to obtain an Act of Parliament to authorise improvements, but all were defeated. In 1791, William Jessop and John Hudson were commissioned to prepare a new survey and plans. Jessop was a canal engineer of some repute, with experience of several navigations, including the River Trent at Newark, while Hudson was less well known, but had experience of canal building in eastern England and Yorkshire. Their report was published on 25 November 1791, and estimated that the improvements would cost £9,979.|$|E
5|$|Five sets of sluices and two <b>weirs</b> {{are used}} to control the canal's depth. The sluices, located at Mode Wheel Locks, Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver Sluices, are {{designed}} to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length in a controlled manner. Each consists {{of a set of}} mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers. Originally, manually operated Stoney Sluices were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The sluices are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver Sluices, accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{the value}} of the towpath as a leisure amenity began to be recognised. The Deputy County Clerk for Hampshire walked along the towpath from end to end in 1966, {{together}} with members of the Ramblers Association. He decided that rather than challenge the legality of the towpath diversions, he would invite the local authorities through which the navigation ran to assume responsibility for maintaining the towpath. These organisations were Southampton County Borough Council, Eastleigh Borough Council, Winchester Rural District Council and Winchester City Council. The construction of <b>weirs</b> at most of the locks by the Southern Water Authority resulted in water levels being restored on significant parts of the navigation. The powers of the navigation were enshrined in Acts of Parliament obtained in 1665, 1767, 1795, 1802, 1811 and 1820, none of which have been repealed.|$|E

50|$|Aplin's <b>Weir</b> lies {{downstream}} of Gleeson's <b>Weir</b> and is {{the last}} <b>weir</b> before {{the mouth of the}} river. Aplin's <b>Weir</b> started out as small stop <b>weir,</b> built in 1927 to prevent incursion of salt water into the water supplies pumped from the upstream Top River wells, located at the end of Thompson Street, Mundingburra. The original stop <b>weir</b> consisted of a curtain of sheet steel which was driven into the sand to the clay bed. This stop <b>weir</b> protruded approximately 1.2 m above the sand level, with a concrete overflow section and also prevented water, released from the upstream Gleeson's <b>Weir,</b> which had previously percolated downstream, from doing so.|$|R

5|$|In the English Civil War, the Parliamentary Army built a {{blockhouse}} at East Mersea in 1648, {{with the}} aim of blockading the River Colne during the Siege of Colchester. Some ruins of this blockhouse remain and are known as the Block House Stone, which is legally protected by English Heritage as a scheduled monument. Fishing grew in importance on the island during this time, with numerous fish <b>weirs</b> being installed. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Dutch and French settlers arrived on the island. Some locals supplemented their income from the oyster trade by smuggling, which remained popular until the mid-19th century. Smugglers favoured the Peldon Rose, immediately north of the Strood, where they would store contraband in the pond alongside the inn. In the early 19th century, the increased demand for oysters despite a limited supply from the Strood and Pyefleet Channel led traders to get oysters from other places and pass them off as native to the island.|$|E
5|$|The River Don Navigation {{ended at}} Tinsley Wharf, but {{it forms a}} {{convenient}} place to start {{a description of the}} route. The wharf was on the river, just upstream from the present junction with the canal to Sheffield. It was close {{to the site of the}} Meadowhall Shopping Centre and the Tinsley Viaduct, which carries the M1 motorway over the valley of the River Don. From here there is a towpath along the canal to Victoria Quays (formerly Sheffield Basin) in Sheffield City Centre, or the Five <b>Weirs</b> Walk follows the course of the River Don to the same destination. The towpath extends to Rotherham in the opposite direction, passing the large Jordans Weir and the three locks on the Holmes Cut. Beside Jordans Weir is the outfall from Blackburn Meadows sewage treatment plant. In dry weather, this discharges 30 million gallons (136,000m3) of treated water each day, more than doubling the flow in the river.|$|E
5|$|The River Kennet {{was made}} navigable to Newbury in 1723, and the River Avon to Bath in 1727. The Kennet and Avon Canal between Newbury and Bath was built between 1794 and 1810 by John Rennie, to convey {{commercial}} barges carrying {{a variety of}} cargoes. and is 57miles (92km) long. The two river navigations and the canal total 87miles (140km) in length. The section from Bristol to Bath is {{the course of the}} River Avon, which flows through a wide valley and has been made navigable by a series of locks and <b>weirs.</b> In the later 19th century and early 20th century the canal fell into disuse following competition from the Great Western Railway, who owned the canal. Between 1970 and 1990 the canal was restored, largely by volunteers, and today is a popular heritage tourism destination, for boating, canoeing, fishing, walking and cycling. It is also important for wildlife conservation.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1943 the {{construction}} of a permanent concrete <b>weir</b> at this location began. This was completed and began use in January 1944 and became known as Aplin's <b>Weir.</b> The <b>weir</b> consisted of a hollow buttress <b>weir</b> with sloped walls {{on both sides of the}} <b>weir</b> and concrete abutments. repairs occurred several times during the 1950s after flood damage. The downstream slope of Aplin's <b>Weir</b> has in recent years deteriorated and much of the concrete slope has collapsed exposing the buttresses. The <b>weir</b> received a significant upgrade in 2011(??).|$|R
50|$|The Bingegang <b>Weir</b> near Middlemount {{contains}} barramundi, southern saratoga {{and golden}} perch. The Bedford <b>Weir</b> and Tartrus <b>Weir</b> are also stocked with barramundi. Bedford <b>Weir</b> is popular with water-skiers and camping is permitted {{adjacent to the}} reservoir.|$|R
50|$|Angling in the <b>weir</b> pool is possible, but tricky due to pontoon access at the <b>weir</b> pool. Anglers often {{stand on}} the stepped <b>weir</b> drops, but this is {{discouraged}} due to the damage that is sustained to the <b>weir</b> itself.|$|R
5|$|The Severn bore is a {{tidal bore}} {{seen on the}} tidal reaches of the River Severn in south western England. It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the surging water forces its way {{upstream}} {{in a series of}} waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond. The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two <b>weirs,</b> and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out.|$|E
5|$|The Shinano basin {{supports}} a large range of plant life, including over 1,100 species of plant which grow {{on the river}} bank, in the river bed or more broadly. The basin also {{supports a}} large range of animal life both {{in and around the}} river. However, the development of the river has threatened the continuing existence of a number of different species. Across the country, thirty to fifty (or higher) percent of endangered species are from freshwater river systems and the impact on the Shinano river system is also clear. Primarily this affects fish and amphibians due to their reliance on the river. The construction of <b>weirs</b> and dams to support agriculture and industry as well as the introduction of invasive species and pollution have been the main causes of ecosystem degradation. The Shinano basin provides a habitat for around twenty-five percent of Japan's fish species (around fifty-five of the 200 fish species living in Japan) including both endemic freshwater fish as well as diadromous fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Willamette River practiced a variety of life ways. Those on the lower river, slightly closer to the coast, often relied on fishing as their primary economic mainstay. Salmon {{was the most important}} fish to Willamette River tribes {{as well as to the}} Native Americans of the Columbia River, where white traders traded fish with the Native Americans. Upper-river tribes caught steelhead and salmon, often by building <b>weirs</b> across tributary streams. Tribes of the northern Willamette Valley practiced a generally settled lifestyle. The Chinooks lived in great wooden lodges, practiced slavery, and had a well-defined caste system. People of the south were more nomadic, traveling from place to place with the seasons. They were known for the controlled burning of woodlands to create meadows for hunting and plant gathering (especially camas).|$|E
50|$|Black <b>Weir,</b> {{formerly}} Black School <b>Weir,</b> is {{the most}} upstream <b>weir</b> of those on Ross River. Built in the early 1930s, Black <b>Weir</b> is a hollow buttress <b>weir</b> with an ogee shaped face on the downstream side, a sloped face on the upstream face and stone pitched abutments. The <b>weir's</b> name {{is derived from the}} name of Black School which abutted Ross River near the location of <b>weir</b> when it was constructed. Following damage to the <b>weir</b> due to flooding, the <b>weir</b> underwent major renovations in 1934. These renovations included the addition of a second pump well, the addition of further buttresses and the underpinning of the original structure. It took until 1936 to fill the reservoir behind the <b>weir,</b> but only provided a few years water supply. During World War II the large influxes of population as a result of Townsville's heavy military presence necessitated the provision of more water. In 1940 a galvanized iron wall was erected atop Black <b>Weir</b> to provide additional storage capacity to supplement the town's water supply. This continued for many years in order to provide additional water which could be pumped from the <b>weir.</b>|$|R

5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle {{is listed}} under the marine and migratory {{categories}} which give it protected status under Australia's federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. As a mainly coastal species, it {{is vulnerable to}} habitat destruction in Australia's increasingly populated and urbanised coastal areas, particularly {{in the south and}} east of the country, where it appears to have declined in numbers. However, there may have been an increase in population inland, secondary to the creation of reservoirs, dams and <b>weirs,</b> and the spread of the introduced common carp (Cyprinus carpio). However, it is rare along the Murray River where it was once common. It is also listed as Threatened under Victoria's Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988), with possibly fewer than 100 breeding pairs remaining in the state. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the white-bellied sea eagle is listed as vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Before the 13th {{century the}} direct {{route to the}} sea at Highbridge was blocked by gravel banks and peat near Westhay. The course of the river {{partially}} encircled Glastonbury from the south, around the western side (through Beckery), and then north through the Panborough-Bleadney gap in the Wedmore-Wookey Hills, to join the River Axe just north of Bleadney. This route {{made it difficult for}} the officials of Glastonbury Abbey to transport produce from their outlying estates to the Abbey, and when the valley of the river Axe was in flood it backed up to flood Glastonbury itself. Sometime between 1230 and 1250 a new channel was constructed westwards into Meare Pool north of Meare, and further westwards to Mark Moor. It then divided into two channels, one the Pilrow cut flowing north through Mark to join the Axe near Edingworth, and the other directly west to the sea at Highbridge. During monastic times, there were several fish <b>weirs</b> along the lower reaches of the river. They used either nets or baskets, the fishing rights belonging to the Bishop of Bath and Wells and the Abbot of Glastonbury.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} many people use the towpath to exercise their dogs, dog dips have been installed at Allbrook and Shawford. These provide easy access into the water for dogs, and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations, to conserve the bank in other places. The water vole surveys have followed the best practice described in the Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2006), and have also recorded evidence of otter, brown rat and American mink populations. While carrying out the work, the surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher, heron, moorhen and coot. The bat survey recorded common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's, noctule and serotine bats in 2011. Bat boxes have been erected near Allbrook, and there was some evidence that they were being used. The 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young Atlantic salmon in the lower river, but although fish <b>weirs</b> have been provided, wild parr were not recorded near Winchester. Above there, a large population of brown trout thrives. Eels were monitored {{for the first time in}} 2009, when their distribution was found to be variable.|$|E
