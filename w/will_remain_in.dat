Unlike physical attacks however, magic attacks cannot be chained.|$|E

5|$|Maintenance of the Australian Globemasters is {{undertaken}} {{by both the}} RAAF and Boeing. As part of Australia's membership of the Globemaster III Sustainment Partnership, Air Force technicians are responsible for routine servicing, and Boeing handles major maintenance tasks. Boeing also provides technical support for RAAF Globemasters during deployments outside of Australia, {{and the company is}} paid in return for achieving contractually mandated aircraft availability targets. Due to the economies of scale arising from a large international maintenance program, the contract with Boeing is considered to be cheaper than attempting to support the aircraft through unique Australian contracts. It is expected that the RAAF's Globemasters <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> service for 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Once {{secretory}} proteins are formed, the ER membrane separates {{them from}} the proteins that <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> the cytosol. Secretory proteins depart from the ER enfolded in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from the transitional ER. These vesicles in transit {{to another part of}} the cell are called transport vesicles. An alternative mechanism for transport of lipids and proteins out of the ER are through lipid transfer proteins at regions called membrane contact sites where the ER becomes closely and stably associated with the membranes of other organelles, such as the plasma membrane, Golgi or lysosomes.|$|E

5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> the same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E
5|$|In Grévy's zebras and {{the wild}} ass species, adults have more fluid {{associations}} and adult males will establish large territories and monopolize the females that enter them. These species live in habitats with sparser resources and standing water and grazing areas may be separated. Groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with non-lactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. The most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas. Mares may wander through several territories but <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> one when they have young. Staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to a renewable resource. Some feral populations of horse exhibit features of both the harem and territorial social systems.|$|E
5|$|On 21 December 2015, the Japan Rugby Football Union {{announced}} Hammett as {{the head}} coach of the newly formed Japanese Super Rugby franchise, the Sunwolves. In their debut season, the side finished bottom of the newly expanded table, with 1 win. Ironically, their win came against the other newly formed team, the Jaguares, a team made up predominantly of the successful Argentine side from the 2015 Rugby World Cup. On 27 June, it was announced that Hammett would be leaving the Japanese side to return to New Zealand. It had previously been announced that Hammett would be joining the Tasman Makos in 2016 as their new assistant coach for the 2016 Mitre 10 Cup. While in June 2016, it was announced that Mark Hammett <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> Super Rugby, but as an assistant coach at the Highlanders.|$|E

The Thales pod {{is based on the}} Sea King's Searchwater 2000; Lockheed had intended to use a derivative of the F-35's APG-81 radar but is now believed to be using an Elta system. Both systems will begin flight trials in the summer of 2014 ahead of Main Gate in 2016. Ten pods are planned with IOC in 2019. Until the Crowsnest system is available, a small force of Sea King ASaC.7 helicopters <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> service with 849 Naval Air Squadron after the final withdrawal of the remainder of the Royal Navy's Sea Kings.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2015, {{as part of}} {{a five-year}} {{programming}} and development deal, Sesame Workshop announced that first-run episodes of Sesame Street would move to premium television service HBO beginning with season 46, which premiered on January 16, 2016. HBO will hold first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with no charge to the stations for airing the content. The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future Sesame Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now – assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix; on August 14, Sesame Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, as a standalone service; the service <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> operation, likely with its offerings reduced to a slate content available for free or serving as a portal for Sesame Streets website. The deal came in the wake of cutbacks that had affected the series in recent years, the changing viewer habits of American children in the previous ten years, and Sesame Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Marine Corps {{tested the}} M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle, a lighter, magazine-fed rifle to {{supplement}} and partially replace the M249. With {{plans to buy}} up to 4,100 IARs to complement and partially replace its 10,000 M249s (of which 8,000 <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> service) held at platoon level, it acquired 450 of the Heckler & Koch HK416–based weapons for testing. The Marines started fielding the M27 in 2010, but kept both weapons in the inventory due to the M249's greater ammunition capacity and higher sustained fire rate; rifle companies are typically issued 27 IARs and six SAWs. The U.S. Army does not plan to introduce the IAR. Colonel Robert Radcliffe of the U.S. Army Infantry Research and Development Center stated that an automatic rifle with a magazine would lower the effectiveness and firepower of a squad. While the Marine Corps has 13-man squads, the Army organizes its soldiers into squads of nine and needs considerably more firepower from the squad machine gunners {{to make up the}} difference. The U.S. Army does, however, want to replace aging M249s with newer weapons.|$|E

5|$|After a varying {{amount of}} {{training}} (at {{least a few}} months), apprentices are eventually made warriors. Another naming ceremony is held, this time to mark the cat as being a full member of the Clan. Warriors are given their own unique suffix that often marks their personality or appearance; for example, ‘Graystripe’ would be named after the grey stripe running down his back, ‘Brokentail’ after the kink in his tail, and ‘Sandstorm’ after her fiery personality. It is extremely rare for warriors to meet another cat with the exact same name, but often a warrior will meet another cat with the same first part of their name, and very often will a warrior meet another cat with the same last part of their name (such as fur, tail, or heart). Once named, warriors hold a vigil at night to protect the clan, {{while the rest of}} the clan is sleeping. After the vigil, warriors are free to move into the warrior’s den, where the majority of the Clan sleeps. The duty of a warrior is to protect and uphold their Clan at all costs. They are able to hunt by themselves, and are generally skilled at defending themselves in battle. Warriors can take a mate, and females can give birth to new kits; if this occurs, the expecting mother, known as a 'queen', will avoid warrior duties for six months before returning to them once her kits are made apprentices. The vast majority of warriors are also chosen to later be mentors to new apprentices. Warriors <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> this position for the remainder of their life, or until they are old enough to retire.|$|E
