5|$|It was the Ottomans' {{skill with}} {{dealing with their}} opponents that made them very {{powerful}} very quickly. They would subjugate their opponents as vassals rather than destroy them, otherwise they would have exhausted themselves in the process. The exacting of tribute from conquered states {{in the form of}} children and money was effective in forcing subjugation over conquest. Coupled with this, the entire region was composed of many states (Bulgaria, Serbia, Latin states) who <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> fight each other as the Ottomans and realized too late that the Ottoman forces defeated them by integrating them in a network of subordinate states.|$|E
2500|$|John Younger {{was almost}} arrested in Dallas County, Texas in January 1871. He killed two lawmen during the attempt and escaped. On June 3, 1871, the gang robbed {{a bank in}} Corydon, Iowa; the James and Younger {{brothers}} were suspects. The bank contacted the Pinkerton National Detective Agency in Chicago, the first involvement of the famous agency {{in the pursuit of}} the James–Younger Gang. Agency founder Allan Pinkerton dispatched his son, Robert Pinkerton, who joined a county sheriff in tracking the gang to a farm in Civil Bend, Missouri. A short gunfight ended indecisively as the gang escaped. On June 24, Jesse James {{wrote a letter to the}} Kansas City Times, claiming Republicans were persecuting him for his Confederate loyalties by accusing him and Frank of carrying out the robberies. [...] "But I don't care what the degraded Radical party thinks about me," [...] he wrote, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> they would think I was a robber as not." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} written that male guardians such as fathers and husbands did not consent to their wives or daughters being {{examined}} by male practitioners unless absolutely necessary in life or death circumstances. The male guardians <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> treat their women themselves or have them be seen by female practitioners {{for the sake of}} privacy. The women similarly felt the same way; such is the case with pregnancy and the accompanying processes such as child birth and breastfeeding, which were solely reliant upon advice given by other women. The role of women as practitioners appears in a number of works despite the male dominance within the medical field. Two female physicians from Ibn Zuhr's family served the Almohad ruler Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 12th century. Later in the 15th century, female surgeons were illustrated {{for the first time in}} Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu's Cerrahiyyetu'l-Haniyye (Imperial Surgery). Treatment provided to women by men was justified to some by prophetic medicine (al-tibba alnabawi), otherwise known as [...] "medicine of the prophet" [...] (tibb al-nabi), which provided the argument that men can treat women, and women men, even if this means they must expose the patient's genitals in necessary circumstances.|$|E

Ain't it luck to find a white man on this island? I <b>would</b> have <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> expected to meet an angel from heaven--eh, Mr. Jones?

[...] "It wasn't more 'n ten {{or fifteen}} minutes before you came in, and he was a-sittin' here talking about ole times--he's rougher than he was, guess he didn't learn no good down there in Mississippi--when all ov a sudden he got up an' took his hat and walked off. Well, that was jist like George Mason. He never had much manners, and <b>would</b> always <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> go off without biddin' a body good-by as not." ...|$|R
60|$|Dinner was {{announced}} at that instant, and {{all eyes were}} turned on Harris, in expectation that he would advance to lead Anneke down stairs. The young man, even more youthful than myself, had {{a good deal of}} mauvaise honte; for, though the son of an Irish peer, of two months' creation, the family was not strictly Irish, and he had very little ambition to figure in this manner. From what I saw of him subsequently, I do believe that nothing but a sense of duty to his order made him respect these privileges of rank at all, and that he <b>would</b> really <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> go to a dinner-table last, as first. In the present case, however, he was soon relieved by Herman Mordaunt; who had been educated at home, and understood the usages of the world very well.|$|R
2500|$|Falwell {{condemned}} homosexuality as {{forbidden by}} the Bible. Gay rights groups called Falwell an [...] "agent of intolerance" [...] and [...] "the {{founder of the}} anti-gay industry" [...] for statements he had made and for campaigning against LGBT social movements. Falwell supported Anita Bryant's 1977 [...] "Save Our Children" [...] campaign to overturn a Florida ordinance prohibiting {{discrimination on the basis}} of sexual orientation and a similar movement in California. In urging the repeal of the ordinance, Falwell told one crowd, [...] "Gay folks <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> kill you as look at you." [...] When the LGBT-friendly Metropolitan Community Church was almost accepted into the World Council of Churches, Falwell called them [...] "brute beasts" [...] and stated, [...] "this vile and satanic system will one day be utterly annihilated and there'll be a celebration in heaven." [...] He later denied this. Falwell also regularly linked the AIDS pandemic to LGBT issues and stated, [...] "AIDS is not just God's punishment for homosexuals, it is God's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals." [...] Amongst many remarks over the years he is probably most known for statements attributed to him about a Teletubby being a homosexual role model for homosexual recruitment and stating that LGBT organizations angered God, thereby in part causing God to let the September 11 attacks happen.|$|E

6000|$|... "Let me {{have some}} now, please," [...] I begged; and I ate the raw bacon on {{a slice of}} bread, while her husband {{explained}} that {{the demands of the}} I.L.W. had been granted. The wires had been opened up in the early afternoon, and everywhere the employers' associations had given in. There hadn't been any employers left in San Francisco, but General Folsom had spoken for them. The trains and steamers would start running in the morning, and so <b>would</b> everything else <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> system could be established.|$|R
60|$|He {{would have}} sold his soul to root her, in her beauty, to the floor, {{and make her}} arms drop at her sides, and have her at his mercy. But he could not look at her, and not be afraid of her. He saw a {{strength}} within her that was resistless. He {{saw that she was}} desperate, and that her unquenchable hatred of him would stop at nothing. His eyes followed the hand that was put with such rugged uncongenial purpose into her white bosom, and he thought that if it struck at hIm, and failed, it <b>would</b> strike there, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon.</b>|$|R
60|$|Paddy the Beaver knew {{perfectly}} well that he <b>would</b> have visitors <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> he began to build his dam. He expected a lot of them. You see he knew {{that none of them}} ever had seen a Beaver at work unless perhaps it was Prickly Porky the Porcupine, who also had come down from the North. So as he worked he kept his ears open, and he smiled to himself as he heard a little rustle here and then a little rustle there. He knew just what those little rustles meant. Each one meant another visitor. Yes, Sir, each rustle meant another visitor, and yet not one had shown himself.|$|R

60|$|By {{the terms}} of the cartel then in force, prisoners {{captured}} by either army were required to be forwarded <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible to either Aiken's landing below Dutch Gap on the James River, or to Vicksburg, there to be exchanged, or paroled until they could be exchanged. There was a Confederate commissioner at Vicksburg, authorized to make the exchange. I did not propose to take him a prisoner, but to leave him free to perform the functions of his office. Had I insisted upon an unconditional surrender there would have been over thirty thousand men to transport to Cairo, very much to the inconvenience of the army on the Mississippi. Thence the prisoners would have had to be transported by rail to Washington or Baltimore; thence again by steamer to Aiken's--all at very great expense. At Aiken's {{they would have had to}} be paroled, because the Confederates did not have Union prisoners to give in exchange. Then again Pemberton's army was largely composed of men whose homes were in the South-west; I knew many of them were tired of the war and <b>would</b> get home <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> they could. A large number of them had voluntarily come into our lines during the siege, and requested to be sent north where they could get employment until the war was over and they could go to their homes.|$|R
6000|$|I felt tears {{come into}} my eyes {{at the memory of}} her laughter, the true memory of the senses almost more {{penetrating}} than the reality itself. It haunted me. All that appertained to her haunted me with the same awful intimacy, her whole form in the familiar pose, her very substance in its colour and texture, her eyes, her lips, the gleam of her teeth, the tawny mist of her hair, the smoothness of her forehead, the faint scent that she used, the very shape, feel, and warmth of her high-heeled slipper that would sometimes {{in the heat of the}} discussion drop on the floor with a crash, and which I would (always in the heat of the discussion) pick up and toss back on the couch without ceasing to argue. And besides being haunted by what was Rita on earth I was haunted also by her waywardness, her gentleness and her flame, by that which the high gods called Rita when speaking of her amongst themselves. Oh, yes, certainly I was haunted by her but so was her sister Therese—who was crazy. It proved nothing. As to her tears, since I had not caused them, they only aroused my indignation. To put her head on my shoulder, to weep these strange tears, was nothing short of an outrageous liberty. It was a mere emotional trick. She <b>would</b> have <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> leaned her head against the over-mantel of one of those tall, red granite chimney-pieces in order to weep comfortably. And then when she had no longer any need of support she dispensed with it by simply telling me to go away. How convenient! The request had sounded pathetic, almost sacredly so, but then it might have been the exhibition of the coolest possible impudence. With her one could not tell. Sorrow, indifference, tears, smiles, all with her seemed to have a hidden meaning. Nothing could be trusted. [...] . Heavens! Am I as crazy as Therese I asked myself with a passing chill of fear, while occupied in equalizing the ends of my neck-tie.|$|R
