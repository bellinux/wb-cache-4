5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E

5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax {{delinquency}} against Bevin and attacked Comer for accepting {{thousands of dollars}} in farm subsidies. Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly denounce the ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the ads and began a telephone survey that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions on issues such as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race was essentially a three-way dead heat between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|E
5|$|Dozens {{of birth}} control clinics opened across the United States during the 1920s, but not without incident.Robinson, Caroline Hadley (1930), Seventy Birth Control Clinics, Williams and Wilkins (70 clinics in U.S. and Britain by 1930, cited by Kennedy, p. 291). In 1929, New York police raided a clinic in New York and arrested two doctors and three nurses for distributing {{contraceptive}} information that was unrelated to the prevention of disease. The ABCL achieved a major victory in the trial, when the judge ruled that use of contraceptives to space births farther apart <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> medical treatment that benefited {{the health of the}} mother. The trial, in which many prominent physicians served as witnesses for the defense, brought {{a large segment of the}} medical community onto the side {{of birth control}} advocates.|$|E
5|$|Supporters {{said that}} the {{publication}} of the cartoons <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> exercise of free speech regardless of the validity of the expression, {{that it was important to}} openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.|$|E

5|$|Two {{important}} legal {{decisions in}} the 1930s helped increase the accessibility of contraceptives. In 1930, two condom manufacturers sued {{each other in the}} Youngs Rubber case, and the judge ruled that contraceptive manufacturing <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> business enterprise. He went further, and declared that the federal law prohibiting the mailing of condoms was not legally sound. Sanger precipitated a second legal breakthrough when she ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932, hoping to provoke a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the U.S. government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to the 1936 One Package legal ruling by Judge Augustus Hand. His decision overturned an important provision of the anti-contraception laws that prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.Rose, Melody, Abortion: A Documentary and Reference Guide, ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 29.Tone, p. 178: Tone calls the ruling a coup d'etat for Sanger. This court victory motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to finally adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a core component of medical school curricula.. Retrieved 15 October 2011. However, the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources until the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Gibbons v. Ogden (1824) {{overturned}} {{a monopoly}} {{granted by the}} New York state legislature to certain steamships operating between New York and New Jersey. Daniel Webster argued that the Constitution, by empowering Congress to regulate interstate commerce, implied that states {{do not have any}} concurrent power to regulate interstate commerce. Chief Justice Marshall avoided that issue about the exclusivity of the federal commerce power because that issue was not necessary to decide the case. Instead, Marshall relied on an actual, existing federal statute for licensing ships, and he held that that federal law <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> exercise of the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce, so the federal law superseded the state law granting the monopoly.|$|E

In 1796, he appeared before the United States Supreme Court in another important case, Ware v. Hylton, a case involving the validity of a Virginia law providing for the confiscation of debts owed to British subjects. Marshall argued that the law <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> exercise of the state's power; however, the Supreme Court ruled against him, holding that the Treaty of Paris in combination with the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution required the collection of such debts.|$|E

30|$|To {{understand}} jammer intrusion detection, it <b>is</b> {{assumed that}} <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> member moves from one cluster to another cluster. At this juncture, the jammer impersonates as <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> member and enters {{into a new}} cluster posing to be as legitimate member. For example, when a member M 1 moves from cluster C 1 to cluster C 2, then according to existing reassociation procedure, C 2 has to validate with C 1, whether M 1 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> member in C 1 or not. If C 2 receives a reply from C 1 stating that M 1 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> node in C 1, then C 2 ascertains that M 1 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> member. At this point of time, the jammer node poses to be M 1 enters into the cluster C 3. In order to check the legitimateness of M 1, C 3 queries C 1 and obviously receives a reply that M 1 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>legitimate</b> node in C 1. By posing to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> moving <b>legitimate</b> node, jammer node cleverly enters into C 3. This problem has to be addressed. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, the idea of cluster head code (CHC) is deployed and it is described in Section 3.1. 1. The jammer node is also referred as rouge node within the WSN. The reason to consider the rouge/jammer node in the WSN is given as follows: when a member M 1 moves from cluster C 1 to cluster C 2, the jammer node posing to be M 1 enters into the cluster C 3. After entering into C 3, the jammer node can jam the members of C 3 that are within the communication range of the jammer node.|$|R
