5|$|By 1968 the Americans <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of {{the scope}} and scale of the Cambodian {{logistical}} effort, but still remained reluctant to overtly violate Cambodia's neutrality since the U.S. still hoped to persuade Sihanouk to come on board against the communists. It was also conscious that any overt action might escalate the conflict into the international arena, possibly directly involving the Soviets and/or Chinese.|$|E
5|$|By dawn on 20 April 1941, the Germans <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that British and Allied {{forces had}} begun {{preliminary}} withdrawal operations from ports in southern Greece. The Luftwaffe made substantial attacks against these departure {{points in a}} bid to prevent or forestall an evacuation. On Sunday 20 April — Hitler's 52nd birthday — the Luftwaffe mounted mass attacks against Allied shipping in Piraeus Harbour.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th century, writers, artists, {{and architects}} in Italy <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the transformations that {{were taking place}} and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in {{the manner of the}} Romans and the ancients) to {{describe}} their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.|$|E
5|$|Officers in {{the field}} <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the killing {{operations}} being conducted by the Einsatzgruppen. The Wehrmacht tried to justify their considerable involvement in the Einsatzgruppen massacres as being anti-partisan operations rather than racist attacks, but Hillgruber wrote {{that this was just}} an excuse. He states that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.|$|E
5|$|The Germans <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that {{breaking}} the blockade {{was very important}} for the Soviet side. However, due to the reverse at Stalingrad and the Soviet offensive at Velikiye Luki to the south of Leningrad, Army Group North was ordered to go on the defensive and was stripped of many troops. The 11th Army, which was to lead the assault on Leningrad in September 1942, and which had thwarted the last Soviet offensive, was transferred to Army Group Center in October. Nine other divisions were also reassigned to other sectors.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{authorities}} {{had won a}} total military victory, they refrained from inflicting further draconian measures on the general population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only {{with the help of}} troops from Zürich and Uri. Had the peasants succeeded to extend the Huttwil League to encompass the countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict might have been different. The city authorities <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it. While they took steps to disempower the rural population politically, they also fulfilled many of the peasants original fiscal demands, alleviating the economic pressure on them. Tax reforms were passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased {{in the second half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|At 16:45, Tung {{was forced}} at gunpoint {{to talk to}} Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had ordered his special forces to surrender. Minh then ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy for Tung, because the special forces' commander had disguised his men in regular army uniforms and framed the generals for the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids in August. The generals <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the threat that Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces. At nightfall, Nhung took Tung, and his brother and deputy, Major Lê Quang Triệu, with their hands tied, to a jeep and drove them {{to the edge of}} the air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems had become more unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, ignorant of the court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have had much to do with the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a necessary evil, the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court backlogs, it was clear to many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed.|$|E

5|$|The Romans <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> {{that their}} victory was still fragile, {{and that as}} soon as the Parthian king had dealt with the Hyrcanian rebellion, he would turn his {{attention}} to Armenia. Despite Vologases' reluctance to risk an all-out conflict with Rome, in the end, he was forced to act when Tigranes raided the Parthian province of Adiabene in 61. The enraged protests of its governor Monobazus, and his pleas for protection, could not be ignored by Vologases, whose prestige and royal authority were at stake. Vologases therefore hastily concluded a treaty with the Hyrcanians so as to be free to campaign against Rome, and called an assembly of the grandees of his realm. There he publicly reaffirmed Tiridates' position as king of Armenia by crowning him with a diadem. In order to reinstall his brother on the Armenian throne, the Parthian king assembled a force of picked cavalry under Monaeses, complemented by infantry from Adiabene.|$|E
25|$|After 17 July 1941, German {{authorities}} ceased {{using the}} forest glade in Palmiry {{as a place}} of mass executions. The reason probably was that they realized the Polish resistance and the civilian population <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of what was happening in Palmiry.|$|E

25|$|Under the Ottomans, Palestine's Arab {{population}} mostly {{saw themselves}} as Ottoman subjects. In the 1830s however, Palestine was occupied by the Egyptian vassal of the Ottomans, Muhammad Ali and his son Ibrahim Pasha. The Palestinian Arab revolt was precipitated by popular resistance against heavy demands for conscripts, as peasants <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that conscription {{was little more than}} a death sentence. Starting in May 1834 the rebels took many cities, among them Jerusalem, Hebron and Nablus. In response, Ibrahim Pasha sent in an army, finally defeating the last rebels on 4 August in Hebron.|$|E

A raid by the authorities soon followed, during which many delegates were arrested before being ordered to leave the country or physically deported. Fraina and Nosovitsky were not detained, but rather made their way to the home of Dutch radical S. J. Rutgers in Amersfoort, where several other delegates had assembled. They remained there a week before returning home to America.|$|E
25|$|The British <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of Gibraltar's {{strategic}} {{value and}} its vulnerability to {{attack from the}} Spanish mainland. On the outbreaks of war with Italy, most of the civilian population were evacuated to the United Kingdom {{and other parts of}} the Empire, except for those in vital jobs in the dockyard, or who were members of the Gibraltar Defence Force. The garrison was more than doubled and the anti-aircraft defences were greatly improved. Work started on a programme of improvements to Gibraltar's fortifications, including a new network of tunnels deep inside the Rock and a system of strong points and minefields covering the land border.|$|E
25|$|Among serpents and eels, {{snakes and}} lizards were also popular {{depictions of the}} god Atum. Serpents were seen as creatures of the earth that embody primeval, chthonic qualities, {{involved}} in the process of creation. Because many snakes inhabit marshes, they were closely linked to water and the primeval ocean of Nun. Egyptians <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of both the snake's usefulness in controlling vermin and the dangers posed by its poison. Texts like the Brooklyn Papyrus include remedies and magical spells to cure the bitten. Snake deities were worshipped in hopes of preventing potential attacks by their earthly representatives. Commonly mummified in the Late, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods, lizards did not play much of a role in earlier culture.|$|E
