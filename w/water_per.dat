5|$|The {{liquid water}} density within a cumulus cloud {{has been found}} to change with height above the cloud base rather than being {{approximately}} constant throughout the cloud. At the cloud base, the concentration was 0grams of liquid <b>water</b> <b>per</b> kilogram of air. As altitude increased, the concentration rapidly increased to the maximum concentration near the middle of the cloud. The maximum concentration was found to be anything up to 1.25grams of <b>water</b> <b>per</b> kilogram of air. The concentration slowly dropped off as altitude increased to the height of the top of the cloud, where it immediately dropped to zero again.|$|E

The Radyr Weir scheme channels more than 500 million cubic metres of <b>water</b> <b>per</b> year through two screw turbines {{and is expected to}} generate 400kW — enough energy to power three of the city’s leisure centres — which will save 700 tonnes of CO2 annually.|$|E
5|$|Free basic water. Inspired by the Human Right to Water, two {{important}} cities in Colombia make a basic {{amount of water}} (Minimo Vital de Agua Potable) available to their poorest residents free of charge. In 2009, Medellin made 2.5 cubic meters of <b>water</b> <b>per</b> month and per person - or 10 cubic meters {{for a family of}} four - available for free to all urban residents in class 1. The city wants to reach 45,000 households and has budgeted 25 billion Pesos (USD 14 million) to finance free basic water and associated awareness campaigns. In February 2012 Bogota also introduced 6 cubic meters of free basic <b>water</b> <b>per</b> household for households in classes 1 and 2, covering more than 1.5 million households or 39% of all households. The annual cost is estimated at 60 billion Pesos (USD 33 million).|$|E

The water mains are preinsulated and electrically heated to supply the residents during the winter months. The water supply network is capable of producing some 882,000 cubic meters of <b>water</b> <b>per</b> year; two water-supplying lakes by the town have a combined annual minimum capacity of more than 7.2 million cubic meters.|$|E

5|$|Water used in {{the steam}} cycle is taken from the local mains water, {{supplied}} by Northumbrian Water. Up to 300,000 tons of mains <b>water</b> <b>per</b> year is {{used in the}} station, however it has to be cleaned of impurities before use. This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This treated water is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.|$|E

5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of <b>water</b> <b>per</b> kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E
5|$|Earth is {{the only}} planet known to support life, and its natural {{features}} {{are the subject of}} many fields of scientific research. Within the solar system, it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region. Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of <b>water</b> <b>per</b> year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of wetland {{complexes}} in the watershed of Stafford Meadow Brook. These include Bear Swamp (which is at the stream's headwaters), Simerson Marsh, and Little Virginia. The first of these is a Pocono wetland bog. Lakes in the watershed include Lake Scranton, the District Number Fifty-Nine Reservoir, the Williams Bridge Reservoir, and Hazard Pond. Lake Scranton and the Williams Bridge Reservoir are used as a water supply, with the former providing 22 million gallons of <b>water</b> <b>per</b> day. Together with Roaring Brook and Spring Brook, it provides {{a substantial portion of the}} water supply of the Lackawanna Valley. Downstream of Lake Scranton, the watershed contains a lake used by the Montage Mountain Ski Resort for snowmaking.|$|E

5|$|Water vapor {{generated}} through {{surface evaporation}} is transported by circulatory {{patterns in the}} atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of <b>water</b> <b>per</b> year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.|$|E
5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage <b>water</b> <b>per</b> day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Royal Park {{embarked}} on {{the restoration of}} the Serpentine to combat growing concerns about the status of the water {{and the quality of the}} aquatic environment. The project resulted in a substantial change to the hydrology of the lake, which had a turnover time of 10 years, and is now reduced to 4–5 months as a result of new borehole water being pumped into the lake. The three boreholes, drilled into the Upper Chalk, now supply the lake with up to 900,000 cubic metres of <b>water</b> <b>per</b> annum ensuring that the lake remains fresh and does not stagnate. In addition, the historically contaminated sediments have been treated and nutrients within the sediments chemically neutralised. Thirdly, the oxygen status of the water and the overall mixing of the lake is now controlled by a series of 24 aeration pumps fixed to the base of the lake. These ensure that the dissolved oxygen levels in the lake do not fall and result in chronic ecological stress. Finally, the overall ecology of the lake was reviewed and some of the large bream and carp were removed in February 2012 to reduce their disturbance of the sediment and vegetation of the lake. These measures were implemented over the period October 2011 to June 2012. The resultant water quality of the lake was excellent and proved to be an extremely popular venue for the swimming portion of the London 2012 Triathlon and the Marathon Swim events in August 2012.|$|E
