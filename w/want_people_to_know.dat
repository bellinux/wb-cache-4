25|$|The {{majority}} of women believe that antenatal care from a health professional is necessary to determine that their pregnancy is normal, {{to see that the}} fetus is well-positioned, to learn about when they were expected to deliver, to obtain a tetanus immunization, for the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses during pregnancy, and nutritional advice. The barriers to seeking antenatal care include travel time and distance from health care facilities, the high cost, and the inconvenient hours of operations of the clinics. Some women also did not <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> they were pregnant until their third month of pregnancy, and would wait until then to seek antenatal care. Inexpensive care from traditional birth attendants included routine antenatal care, however untrained attendants and traditional healers did not provide antenatal care.|$|E

He spent his childhood attached to his father, who subsequently became the narrator for the Gang Busters radio program. When Norman Schwarzkopf was eight years old, his father returned to the military amid World War II. His continuous absence made home life difficult, particularly for his wife.

[...] The song [...] "Danger" [...] was written about one of Duff's friends' relationships with an older man. [...] "I understand that feeling of wanting to be dangerous," [...] she said. [...] "You may know morally something's not right, but you can't help yourself." [...] She has stated that the song [...] "Dreamer" [...] was written about a stalker in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, and it has been speculated that it was written specifically about Miakovsky.|$|E

Islam is portrayed as oppressive (women in Hijab); outmoded (hanging, beheading and stoning to death); anti-intellectualist (book burning); restrictive (bans on post- and extramarital affairs, alcohol and gambling); extremist (focusing on Algeria, Lebanon and of course Egypt); backward (Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the Sudan); the cause of worldwide conflict (Palestine, Kashmir and Indonesia); and dangerous (Turkey and Iran).|$|R

In 2003 the company had a staff of 180 and was generating profits of 1.5 billion yen (about $15 million) on sales from 1000 titles a year. Takahashi's plan was to increase market share and to absorb or eliminate competition from the hundreds of other AV manufacturers by producing high quality products at lower prices ("We want to spend money making good movies that we can sell cheaply") and by removing some of the stigma attached to adult products ("I <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that there's nothing dirty about adult videos").|$|E
