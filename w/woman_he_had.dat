He became Deputy Director of Personnel at the Air Ministry in August 1919 and then Deputy Commandant of the apprentices' technical training school in August 1922. He married May Weddell in 1922; she died in September 1924, and he remarried the following year to Olive Foster, an American <b>woman.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> three children with Foster, a son and two daughters.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of respect}} for Momchil, Kantakouzenos spared his wife, a Bulgarian <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{captured}} during his conquest of Xanthi. He allowed her to flee to Bulgaria along with all of her property. However, it is unknown whether Momchil had any children from this marriage or a previous one, if any. Pavlov presents the hypothesis that Momchil's wife was a noblewoman from the Bulgarian capital Tarnovo, whom he married {{as part of an}} agreement with the Bulgarian court.|$|E
5|$|As life in Armenia grew {{relatively}} more stable under Soviet rule, Bagramyan sought {{to locate a}} <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> met several years earlier, Tamara Hamayakovna. Tamara, who was at this time living in Nakhichevan with her family, had been married to an Armenian officer {{who had been killed}} during the Turkish-Armenian war, leaving her with their one-year-old son, Movses. Bagramyan visited her and the two decided to get married at the end of 1922. In addition to their son Movses, who {{went on to become a}} painter, they had a daughter, Margarit, who later became a doctor. Tamara remained at Bagramyan's side until her death in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Phrynion learnt that Neaira {{was back}} in Athens, and {{attempted}} to take her back from Stephanus. Stephanus resisted, claiming that as Neaira was a free <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no right; a claim which Phrynion proceeded to challenge in court, though he was persuaded to settle the case by arbitration instead. The arbitrators decided that Neaira was indeed free, and {{that in addition to}} this she was her own kyria (mistress); this was an extremely unusual decision in a society where all citizen women, at least, had a kyrios (master). Despite this unusual level of freedom, however, Neaira was compelled to split her time between the two men as they agreed, without any input herself.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch, {{concerned}} about Amir's nationalistic tendencies, convinced the Sultan {{to send him}} back to Langkat, an order which the fledgling poet was unable to refuse. In 1937, Amir, together {{with two of the}} Sultan's vassals tasked with escorting him, boarded the Opten Noort from Tanjung Priok and returned to Sumatra. Upon arriving in Langkat, he was informed that he was to be married to the Sultan's eldest daughter, Tengku Puteri Kamiliah, a <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> barely met. Before the wedding Amir returned to Batavia to face his final exam– and have one last meeting with Sundari. Several weeks later he returned to Langkat, where he and Kamiliah were married in an extravagant ceremony. His cousin, Tengku Burhan, later stated that Amir's indifference throughout the seven-day event was due to his thinking of Sundari.|$|E
5|$|The Georgian hired William Manning Smith to {{represent}} Conley for $40. Smith {{was known for}} specializing in representing black clients, and had successfully defended a black man against an accusation of rape by a white <b>woman.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> also taken an elderly black woman's civil case {{as far as the}} Georgia Supreme Court. Although Smith believed Conley had told the truth in his final affidavit, he became concerned that Conley was giving long jailhouse interviews with crowds of reporters. Smith was also anxious about reporters from the Hearst papers, who had taken Frank's side. He arranged for Conley to be moved to a different jail, and severed his own relationship with the Georgian.|$|E

5|$|The Welles Declaration {{was written}} by Loy W. Henderson in {{consultation}} with Welles and Roosevelt. Welles {{would go on to}} participate {{in the creation of the}} Atlantic Charter, which stated that territorial adjustments should be made in accordance with the wishes of the peoples concerned. He increasingly served as acting Secretary of State during Cordell Hull's illnesses. Henderson, then the State Department's Director of the Office of European Affairs, was married to a Latvian <b>woman.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> opened an American Red Cross office in Kaunas, Lithuania after World War I and served in the Eastern European Division of the State Department for 18 years.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius's move thus {{seemed to}} be an interim solution: he would hold power only until his stepsons would come of age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, {{behavior}} of his unhappily married wife, Julia, may have also played a part. Indeed, Tacitus calls it Tiberius' intima causa, his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred of Julia and a longing for Vipsania. Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the Forum, and forbidden to see the <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> loved.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the Grays returned, and Ann became {{suspicious}} when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When they were left {{alone in the house}} in the early evening, the Grays searched the straw and found Docherty's body, showing blood and saliva on the face. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week; they refused. While the Grays reported the murder to the police, Burke and Hare removed the body and took it to Knox's surgery. The police search located Docherty's bloodstained clothing hidden under the bed. Burke and his wife gave different times for Docherty's departure from the house, which raised enough suspicion for the police to take them in for questioning. Early the following morning the police went to Knox's dissecting-rooms where they found Docherty's body; James Gray identified her as the <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen with Burke and Hare. Hare and his wife were arrested that day, as was Broggan; all denied any knowledge of the events.|$|E

25|$|The statesmanlike qualities {{displayed}} {{on this occasion}} were insufficient to avert the storm of indignation of Crispi’s opponents when {{he was accused of}} bigamy. When he remarried, a <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> married in 1853 was still living. But a court ruled that Crispi’s 1853 marriage on Malta was invalid because it was contracted while another <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> married yet earlier was also still alive. By the time of his third marriage, his first wife had died and his marriage to his second wife was legally invalid. Therefore, his marriage to his third wife was ruled valid and not bigamous. He was nevertheless compelled to resign office after only three months in March 1878, bringing down the whole government with him.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} juniper, known as savin, was {{mentioned}} frequently in European writings.

Other substances reputed to have been used by the English include Spanish fly, opium, watercress seed, iron sulphate, and iron chloride. Another mixture, not abortifacient, but rather intended to relieve missed abortion, contained dittany, hyssop, and hot water.|$|E
