25|$|In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum {{suggested}} that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting {{was inspired by a}} Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting, Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting, Where Do <b>We</b> <b>Come</b> <b>From?</b> What Are We? Where Are We Going?. In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. Nonetheless, later studies have confirmed Rosenblum's suggestion, disproving the Italian theory, for Munch had not been to Florence until after painting The Scream.|$|E
25|$|The 1992 film A League of Their Own {{is about}} the first season of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. While the film does not use real names, filmmaker Penny Marshall seemed to be aiming for realism, as her film {{includes}} fake newsreel footage and pseudo-documentary present day scenes {{at the beginning and}} end of the fictitious story. A League of Their Own itself was inspired by the 1987 documentary of the same title, written and produced by Kelly Candaele, one of the five sons of the aforementioned Helen Callaghan. Candaele also collaborated with Kim Wilson in the story for the film. The AAGPBL players were relatively unknown until the Marshall's film was exhibited for the first time. In the AAGPBL Players Association annual reunions since 1998, it is usual to hear the original AAGPBL players singing We're the members of the All-American League. <b>We</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> cities near and far. We've got Canadians, Irish ones, and Swedes. We're all for one, we're one for all. We're all Americans.|$|E

500|$|Production on {{the episode}} officially began in October 2011 at Los Angeles, California, {{after several months}} of {{research}} and development. The animators worked closely with executive producer Paul Tibbitt, creator Stephen Hillenburg, and creative director Vincent Waller to ensure the cartoon characters were properly translated into three-dimensional puppets. Hillenburg and Tibbitt provided hands-on feedback on the production on a weekly basis. [...] "They'd check out the weeklies and {{go back and forth}} with us on the various gags [...] It was really a pleasurable experience when they came to visit, because <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the same planet. It all felt very easy and natural," [...] Walsh said.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} before Whiteside {{was old enough to}} sign schoolboy terms with Manchester United, he was offered a trial at Liverpool, causing United's chief scout Joe Brown to fly over to Belfast to {{immediately}} offer him the schoolboy contract to sign. Whiteside remained in Belfast, and flew over to Manchester every weekend for training. From age 14, he was constantly compared to the now-retired George Best, and did little to cease such comparisons when he told a journalist that [...] "the only thing I have in common with George Best is that <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the same place, play for the same club and were discovered by the same man".|$|E

500|$|The first chapter, [...] "Gauguin's Questions", {{poses the}} {{questions}} that {{provide a framework for}} the book. Referring to Paul Gauguin's painting of the same name the questions are: Where do <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>from?</b> What are we? Where are we going? Wright defines progress using the Victorian terms [...] "the assumption that a pattern of change exists in the history of mankind...that it consists of irreversible changes in one direction only, and that this direction is towards improvement". Despite the extended time span of the Stone Age, Wright places the first sign of progress as being the ability to create fire. The competition between Cro-Magnon and Neanderthals is examined with respect to the conditions that allowed one to out-compete the other.|$|E
500|$|... "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!" [...] was {{the first}} {{full-length}} episode of the series to be produced in stop motion animation. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan animated it at Screen Novelties, while Caballero and Walsh served as the directors. Screen Novelties was chosen by the show's executives to execute the animation because they had already worked with them before in other several smaller projects. These include the revamping of the opening title sequence of the show for 2009's SpongeBob's Truth or Square. Walsh explained, [...] "They dug one of our shorts that we'd done a while back, which was called Graveyard Jamboree with Mysterious Mose, and wanted to have us apply our sensibilities to SpongeBob ... <b>We</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the same planet {{as far as our}} sense of humor and comic sensibilities are concerned. But we also {{wanted to make sure that}} it felt like a SpongeBob episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Development took {{approximately}} two years, and included {{a staff of}} thirty developers. Preliminary planning and creation of the backstory extended to several years before that. The word [...] "Xeno" [...] had been decided between staff from an early stage, with its meaning being [...] "something strange or alien". [...] "Gears" [...] was chosen from multiple suggested words. The game's Gears were not present during early stages, with their places being filled by traditional summoned monsters. The game's use of anime cutscenes was chosen as {{it was difficult to}} properly recreated Tanaka's Gear artwork into 3D CGI. The game's engine was also designed to be best suited for the 3D map displays and battle arenas. Takahashi had wanted to create the game in full 3D, but the PlayStation's capacities meant this could not be managed, resulting in the current mesh of 2D sprites against 3D backgrounds. The themes and story were greatly influenced by the works and philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. According to Tanaka, the reason for this correlation was simply due to a common interest with her husband. According to her, the story revolved around [...] "where do <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>from,</b> what are we, where are we going". There was a large portion of story and artwork that did not make it into the final game. The game's second disc consisted mainly of narration by Fei and Elly of events following the party's escape from Solaris. While it was popularly assumed to be due to budget constraints, Takahashi later revealed the full reason; as his team was inexperienced they were unable to create the entire proposed game in the expected two-year development time, so instead of ending prematurely {{with the end of the}} first disc, Takahashi offered up a compromise which became the second disc's content, allowing the staff to finish the game within time and budget deadlines.|$|E

2500|$|The {{piece is}} a {{meditation}} on death. Pärt's biographer, Paul Hillier, suggests that [...] "how we live depends on our relationship with death: how we make music depends on our relationship to silence." [...] It is significant that the piece begins and ends with silence—that the silence is written in the score. This silence creates a frame around the piece and has spiritual significance. It suggests that <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> silence, and return to silence; it reminds us that before we were born and after we die we are silent {{with respect to this}} world.|$|E

2500|$|A third {{uprising}} {{took place}} in December 1988. This time the uprising was led by Lieutenant-Colonel Mohammed Alí Seineldín and was supported by 1,000 rebel troops. This uprising proved successful. Several of the demands of Seineldin and his followers were met. Caridi was forced into retirement and replaced by General Francisco Gassino, who {{had served in the}} Falklands/Malvinas War and was held in high esteem by the carapintadas. On 5 October 1989 as part of a sweeping reform, the newly elected president, Carlos Menem, pardoned those convicted in the human right trials and the rebel leaders imprisoned for taking part in the military uprisings. Menem also pardoned the leftist guerrilla commanders accused of terrorism. In a televised address to the nation, President Menem said, [...] "I have signed the decrees so we may begin to rebuild the country in peace, in liberty and in justice ... <b>We</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> long and cruel confrontations.

2500|$|The Michigan Alumnus {{published}} {{a letter from}} another Michigan athlete, Cecil F. Cross, recalling memories of football in Ann Arbor:"The autumn is approaching here. The days are getting shorter {{and there is a}} chill in the air ... It seems to bring back the old feeling which is experienced where the smell of football is in the air, the first cold days of autumn and it makes me homesick, though only slightly. Ralph Henning, of Bay City, is here, and though <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> different parts of Michigan and attended different schools, he being the captain of the Michigan Aggies' football team in 1916, we quite frequently talk over the old scenes with which we are both familiar. He, too, has mentioned the feeling of football in the air. If they were to train an army of football players and throw them into the lines, the last weeks of October, with Coach Yost to address them just before the battle, we would score a touchdown the first half, and before Thanksgiving we would have pushed the Germans under their own goal posts and eat dinner in Berlin." ...|$|E
2500|$|Seeger died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on January 27, 2014, {{at the age}} of 94. Response and {{reaction}} to Seeger's death quickly poured in. President Barack Obama noted that Seeger had been called [...] "America's tuning fork" [...] and that he believed in [...] "the power of song" [...] to bring social change, [...] "Over the years, Pete used his voice and his hammer to strike blows for workers' rights and civil rights; world peace and environmental conservation, and he always invited us to sing along. For reminding us where <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> and showing us where we need to go, we will always be grateful to Pete Seeger." [...] Folksinger and fellow activist Billy Bragg wrote that: [...] "Pete believed that music could make a difference. Not change the world, he never claimed that – he once said that if music could change the world he'd only be making music – but he believed that while music didn't have agency, it did have the power to make a difference." [...] Bruce Springsteen said of Seeger's death, [...] "I lost a great friend and a great hero last night, Pete Seeger", before performing [...] "We Shall Overcome" [...] while on tour in South Africa.|$|E
